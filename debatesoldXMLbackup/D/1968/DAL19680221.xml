    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether any special meeting of Ireland's full-time UN delegates has been held to consider Irish policy in the UN during the present year; and which problems will have most attention from Ireland's delegation during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our permanent delegation to the United Nations consists of a Permanent Representative of Ambassador rank and two diplomatic members of his staff of Counsellor and Third Secretary rank.  During the annual sessions of the General Assembly this permanent delegation is strengthened by additional diplomatic staff drawn from the headquarters of the Department and from our Diplomatic Missions abroad as required, normally numbering about five additional members.  The delegation receives its instructions from me or from the appropriate officer of the Department after consultation where necessary with the Government, Departments of State, the Permanent Representative in New York and our other missions abroad.  Meetings of the full delegation normally take place only during sessions of the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the second part of the question, it is not possible to predict in advance which problems will receive most attention during the present year in the United Nations.  This will depend <Col N="1502" /> upon the nature of the items inscribed on the Agenda and developments in relation to them.  In recent years some of the main problems which have received our special attention in the United Nations have included the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons, the financing of peace-keeping operations, the application of the principles of the United Nations Charter to areas of conflict, the problems relating to Human Rights and the remnants of colonialism and the basic problems of an economic and social nature confronting the developing countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Vietnam was not raised in the General Assembly.  The American Government put down in the Security Council a motion dealing with the matter but that was not taken up because they did not get agreement between the other permanent members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in accordance with the statement I made several times.  If the Deputy wants to put down a separate question on that, put it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  I have answered the question.  If the Deputy wants to put further questions down, he is welcome to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reluctant to answer supplementaries.  If the Deputy wants a delicate and complicated matter like external affairs in relation to a very intricate problem discussed, it should be done on the Estimates or on a motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will review the 72-hour concession given to freight hauliers from Northern Ireland, as it is causing unemployment in the 26 Counties since the handing over of road freight to private enterprise in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1504" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the 72 hours customs free entry concession has recently been replaced by facilities covering temporary duty free importation for periods of up to one year of vehicles engaged in road freight transport.</P>
      <P>Under reciprocal arrangements in force since July, 1966, Northern hauliers may engage, under licences issued by me, in the cross-Border transport of merchandise for reward. These licences do not permit the transport of merchandise from point to point within the State.  I have no evidence that these arrangements have caused unemployment in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister has not given the information Deputy Cunningham wishes to obtain.  The question relates to the transport of goods from Northern Ireland to the Republic and from the Republic to Northern Ireland, and not as the Minister said within the Republic. Will the Minister not agree that this is not the real reason the Northern Ireland hauliers have an advantage over the hauliers of the Republic?  The real trouble is that they can purchase their vehicles for 15 per cent less, that the road tax is 50 per cent less, that tyres are half the price and that motor vehicles are in some cases 25 per cent cheaper than they are here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister does he not agree that this is the real reason.  Will he not agree to comment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I would not agree that they are as suggested by the Deputy.  In any event, there are discussions on the cross-Border licences taking place between the Northern Ireland authorities and ourselves arising from the results of the mutual <Col N="1505" /> liberalisation operation which has been very successful on the whole.  There are discussions taking place to review the whole position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister really appreciate the information which Deputy Cunningham seeks?  He wishes to ask whether the Minister is aware of the great advantage which Northern Ireland hauliers have in comparison with the hauliers on this side of the Border.</P>

      <P>It would not be practicable to carry out preliminary investigations of aircraft accidents in public.  If, however, as a result of an investigation.

      <P>Given satisfactory weather conditions, the intake of milk at creameries and other manufacturing premises this year should exceed last year's record intake of 473 million gallons.  The general outlook in export markets, however, is not equally encouraging. Access to many markets is limited by variable levies, quantitative import control or other restrictions and, as a result of the expansion of milk production in many countries, the pressure on such export market outlets as are available has increased greatly and prices in those markets are tending to weaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Ministre for Agriculture and Fisheries the likely prospects for the cattle trade during 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as can be judged at this stage, the prospects for the cattle trade during 1968 appear <Col N="1510" /> reasonably satisfactory.  The demand by British feeders for our store cattle should continue to be fairly strong and exports of slaughter cattle, mostly of carcase beef, to Britain should also be at a satisfactory level.  The US market for manufacturing beef seems likely to remain good also.  Because of the levies and duties applicable to imports of cattle and beef into the EEC area, however, it is not possible to be optimistic about exports to that area.</P>
      <P>Total exports of cattle and beef during 1968 are likely to be somewhat below the 1967 level because, of course, last year's exports included some 200,000 extra cattle carried forward from 1966.  There is now a healthy tone to the cattle market generally and on the basis of the best information available at present this seems likely to continue during 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (a) the guaranteed price of wheat for next season, and (b) the guaranteed price of feeding barley for next season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced on 13th February that the guaranteed prices for wheat and feeding barley of the 1968 crops will be the same as in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> In the case of wheat the prices range from 94/6d per barrel for wheat with a moisture content of 16 per cent and a bushel weight of 64 lb weight to 78/3d per barrel for wheat with a moisture content of 26 per cent and a bushel weight of 56 lb weight.</P>
    <P>The floor price for feeding barley is 45/- per barrel for barley delivered to the purchaser's premises at 20 per cent moisture.  This price is subject to the usual additions for barley of a lower moisture content than 20 per cent and to the usual reductions if the moisture content is over that figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree in view of the fact that rates have gone up considerably, that all overhead charges of farmers have gone up and that wages are going up on 1st April, there is a reasonable case for an increase in the price of feeding barley to growers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with all those things lumped like that together because rates have not just generally flat-footedly gone up everywhere, for the simple reason that on a great deal of the farm land of this country, there are no rates payable at all any more. In addition to that, while there will have been an upward trend in various overhead costs, it is also true that the yield, which is a very important factor in any of these crops, has been showing an encouraging upward trend, particularly during the last harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an indication to the House how farmers, if they are getting the same price as they got last year, will recoup the extra costs imposed on them, even assuming they have better yields?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the price of barley is only the same as it was 20 years ago and that overhead expenses and the cost of production <Col N="1512" /> have increased enormously since then so that there has been a reduction of 300,000 acres in the past ten years, surely the Minister should grant an increase in the price of barley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has made that case with his tongue in his cheek for the simple reason that the output per ton of barley is better than it was ten years ago.  Surely the proof of the pudding is in the eating?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <P>The answer in each case is that I am not prepared to take action in regard to drift net licences in the Foyle area on the lines suggested by the Deputy. I am aware that the Foyle Fisheries Commission have given notice of proposals to increase certain existing licence fees.  Regulations to give effect to such proposals have not yet come before me, but when I come to deal with this matter I shall feel obliged to have regard to the commission's need to secure adequate revenue to pay for protection and improvement of the fisheries in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether an assessment has been completed in all local authority areas of the number of houses needed to replace existing unfit dwellings; the number of ascertained unfit dwellings; and how soon they will be replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No separate assessment has been made by housing authorities of the number of houses needed to replace existing unfit dwellings.  Assessments of housing needs have, however, been made in all areas in general conformity with the requirements of section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966. These assessments show that housing authorities have provisionally estimated that there are, at present, approximately 29,000 families living in dwellings which are regarded by them as unfit and incapable of repair at reasonable cost.  Because of demographic and other factors such as recurring vacancies in existing housing estates, a proportion of these families will not need to be rehoused in new dwellings.  Pending detailed examination by my Department of the housing needs assessments, and the submission to me of building programmes under section 54 of the Housing Act, 1966, it is not possible to say when necessary replacements of existing unfit dwellings <Col N="1517" /> will be completed.  It is well however to bear in mind that, because of normal obsolescence, the problem of unfitness in dwellings is a continuing one.</P>
      <P>Output of local authority dwellings has been rising for some years and is now running at about 4,000 units per annum.  Overall housing output has also been rising steadily and substantially, and in the year 1967 completions reached over 12,000 units.</P>

      <P>I am talking about special allowances, not pensions.  A man who got a pension was awarded it years ago by the board of assessors or the referee and the pension entitled that man to a medal with bar.  We are concerned here with medals without bar issued to applicants.  A man cannot apply for a special allowance until the medal is awarded to him.  In June, 1957, the Government decided that certain conditions had to be complied with before it could be deemed that the medal was duly awarded.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 17 on 8th February, 1968.</P>
      <P>This school was staffed by two qualified teachers up to 4th September, 1967. Advertisements for teachers for the school were published on 29th and 30th September, 1967, and 5th, 6th and 16th January, 1968.  I understand that the manager received replies from three applicants, none of whom was considered suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is very unfair that a new school, built six years ago, at which there are 29 pupils in attendance should have been left in the care of a junior assistant mistress from last September until now?  Would the Minister not agree that even slightly unsuitable trained teachers would be better than a completely untrained teacher and will he try to ensure that the manager does, in fact, have two teachers appointed to this school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the difficulty in getting teachers was due to the fact that the teachers left in the middle of the school year and it is not easy to get teachers at this time.  Teachers are usually obtained through advertisements during the summer, before the commencement of the scholastic year. I am satisfied that the manager did make an effort at public advertisement.  I <Col N="1539" /> am also satisfied that in relation to the three applications he did get and from which he refused to make an appointment, his decision was the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the advertisements submitted to the newspapers were for temporary teachers, and does he not agree that it is not very likely that a suitable teacher will leave a job for the purpose of taking up temporary employment? Is he further aware that the parents of the children there are gravely perturbed because of the fact that such a long period has elapsed with apparently no genuine effort being made to replace the two teachers at the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would not blame the parents for being perturbed in this case.  All I can say to the Deputy is that my Department, in co-operation with the Reverend Manager, are doing all we can in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware of local anxiety with regard to a report that Vicarstown national school, County Laois, is to be closed; and whether he will give an assurance that this will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Vicarstown is a small two-teacher school with an average enrolment of only 34 pupils.  I am fully satisfied that the educational interests of these pupils would be much better served by transferring them to the larger schools in Stradbally. Accordingly proposals to that effect are being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the parents of the children attending Tiershanahan school, Ballyheigue, County Kerry, are very perturbed at the suggested closing of this school; and that they have formed a protest committee; and if he will now reconsider this matter as this school was erected only a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this case is that about the time that the <Col N="1540" /> question of carrying out a major scheme of improvements at the Tiershanahan school arose, a three-teacher school at Glenderry, which was opened in 1963, became, through a fall in enrolment, a two-teacher school. As the latter school contains all the modern amenities it was felt that the educational interests of the children from the two areas would best be served by adding a classroom to the Glenderry school, and having the children from Tiershanahan brought there by transport.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this is, on educational grounds, a very sound proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new school which has excellent facilities, heating, hot water and so on.  The attendance is above the average and the school is well maintained.  It is within 100 yards of the county road.  In all the circumstances, I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision, because the parents in that locality are not in favour of having their children transferred to the school at Glenderry.</P>

      <P>I am seeking guidance from the Chair.  In accordance with Standing Order No. 89, I propose to give a short explanatory statement of the contents of the first Bill.  This Bill proposes to give the people an opportunity of deciding at a referendum whether the existing provisions of subsection (3) of section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution regarding the ratio between the number of Dáil Members and the population in each constituency should be replaced by new criteria governing the determination of constituencies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not usual to oppose the First Reading of any Bill, because the general idea of the House being unanimous in accepting the First Stage is in order to become more conversant with the proposals or the details in the Bill when in fact it is published.  This is not the same situation here and for that reason the Labour Party are now opposing even the First Stage.  We know exactly what is in it, and we do not pretend that we will by our assent allow this House, if we can stop it, to use any part of public time in discussing this measure and certainly the Second Bill, which is described as the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> The contents are well known to us from a statement released by the Taoiseach some few weeks ago after, I believe, a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, there was a certain amount of confusion even after that statement was issued.  It was only in the past week or so that the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, told us that there would be two separate proposals, despite the fact, if I may mention it&mdash;and I assume he was speaking for the Government&mdash;that the Minister for Justice told the public on the television programme &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; that there would be a package deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this because we believe there is no demand for it.  At the present time, the situation is that there is one Deputy representative of a population of between 20,000 and 30,000.  We believe there is sufficient latitude within this 20,000 to 30,000 to do what the Taoiseach suggests can be done under this new proposal.  There is a tolerance margin of 10,000 and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only limitation on the debate is at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle and I assure him that I will not be too long more.  We are told by the Minister for Local Government, and I think by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that this will not mean an increase in the number of Deputies in Dáil Éireann.  I should like to have that explained.  We have had many explanations of this legislation at Fianna Fáil cumainn and various other places, but not in this House.

      <Col N="1552" /> I gathered from what Deputy Corish said on the first Bill that it is the intention to oppose the introduction of this Bill also.  Therefore, I propose under the appropriate Standing Order to make a brief statement explaining broadly the purpose of the Bill.  The Bill proposes to give to the people the opportunity of deciding at a referendum whether the relative majority system of election, with the single non-transferable vote and single-seat constituencies, should be adopted for Dáil elections.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a Constituency Commission for the purpose of determining constituencies and for the automatic re-election of an outgoing Ceann Comhairle as a second Member for an appropriate constituency. Details of these proposals will be available when the Bill is circulated.</P>
    <P>In view of an obvious misunderstanding of the ratio of Deputies to population, as indicated by Deputy Corish of the Labour Party, I should like to say that there is no question of tolerance between 20,000 and 30,000. The Dáil in its legislation may adopt any number between 20,000 and 30,000 and whichever number is adopted, the existing Constitution requires that the same number of the population per Deputy, as near as is practicable, should be in every constituency.</P>
    <P>This is the second Bill.  It was the intention to introduce both measures in one, and with due authority from the Government, the Minister for Justice made the announcement, but the Government were entitled to reconsider the position.</P>

As I have said before, it is an insult to the intelligence of the people to refer back to them a question which they decided eight and a half years ago.  Of course we will be told, as we were told by the Minister for Justice in &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;, that the countries of Europe do not employ the system of proportional representation.  They do.  It is not necessarily the same. Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland do employ a system of proportional representation.  We have been told we should be trying to adjust ourselves to European patterns in our Parliamentary and economic machinery but it seems now that we are going in the opposite direction. What we are adopting now is the British system and the Northern Ireland system.</P>

Under a system of proportional representation, they have been in government for 27 out of the past 36 years. They have had majorities in most of these governments.  The lifetime of Dáil Éireann, on average, has been longer than most European parliaments. Therefore, we are entitled to be suspicious as to the motives of the Fianna Fáil Party in wanting to introduce a new system.  It seems to me the game is going against them, and they want to change the rules in order that the people will retain them.</P>

Last week when the Minister for Justice was asked that a certain type of legal aid be given, he said it would cost £200,000 and said that that money should be directed to some more worthwhile project.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide the statutory framework for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of this country's part of the continental shelf.  The concept that a State might have exclusive rights to explore and exploit the natural resources of the sea bed and subsoil outside its territorial waters to where the sea bed falls to the ocean floor assumed growing importance after the last war.  Technological advances were making it possible to explore and exploit such natural resources, but considerable uncertainty existed in international law as to the precise rights of individual States to the parts of the continental shelf adjoining their shores.  At the request of the United Nations, the International Law Commission carried out a study of the problem with a view to bringing the definition and control of these rights within the ambit of international law.  The Report of the International Law Commission was considered by the International Conference <Col N="1560" /> on the Law of the Sea, 1958, which was convened at Geneva by the United Nations, and this resulted in the drafting of the Convention on the Continental Shelf.</P>
      <P>The Convention was signed by this country's delegates, subject to ratification by the Government, but has not yet been ratified.  The Convention came into force internationally in 1964, after being ratified by 22 countries.  To date the Convention has been ratified by 35 of the 46 countries which signed it, including the West European countries Britain, France, Denmark, Portugal, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.</P>
      <P>The Convention clarifies the position in international law regarding the continental shelf, deals with the allocation of the shelf between adjacent States or States whose coasts are opposite each other and defines the right of the adjacent coastal State to explore and exploit the natural resources of its particular area of shelf, subject to the State assuming certain obligations.  The continental shelf is defined as the sea bed and subsoil of the submarine area adjacent to the coast but outside the territorial waters to a depth of 200 metres or beyond that limit where the depth of the waters permits exploitation. The natural resources covered by the Convention are defined as mineral, including oil and gas, and other non-living resources of the sea bed and subsoil, together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species.  I might add that this definition excludes all swimming fish.  Under the Convention, the rights the coastal State may exercise over its area of continental shelf are limited to such rights as are necessary for the exploration and exploitation of its natural resources.  These rights do not amount to full sovereignty which would be inconsistent with the legal status of the waters above the shelf as high seas and of the air space above these waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the sea bed is a recent development in most parts of the world.  It has been made possible only by notable advances in technology and it is still a very difficult, <Col N="1561" /> hazardous and expensive operation compared with similar work on dry land.  Because of the heavy expenditure involved, marine exploration is usually confined to the search for the most rewarding types of deposit, such as oil and gas.  Metallic ores do not possess the same potential significance because of mining difficulties and cost of exploitation.  Some spectacular progress has been made in the exploration and exploitation of off-shore petroleum and gas in many parts of the world.  I should mention, however, that the sea bed is not specially favoured with deposits of oil and gas as compared with adjoining land areas.  In European waters the outstanding example of submarine exploration is the search for gas and oil in the North Sea.  The potentialities of this area had long been recognised but it was the discovery of a huge gas field in the adjoining land area of Northern Holland in 1959 which gave rise to the present intensive exploration, which has yielded such promising results.  Of growing importance is the dredging from the sea floor of sand and gravels for use as concrete aggregate and of banks of shells and other organic material for use as lime and fertiliser.</P>
    <P>The area of continental shelf accruing to this country includes half the Irish Sea area and an area of Atlantic Shelf extending about 200 miles off the south-west coast and 165 miles off the west coast.  These are very approximate indications of the extent of the area but it will, very probably, exceed the size of the national territory.  The amount of geological information available about our shelf area is very little and it is not possible to give any real indication of the exploitable resources likely to be found there.  Lest spectacular success elsewhere should give rise to too much optimism as to the potential of our area of shelf, I think I should point out that the results of the search for oil and natural gas carried out over the whole country and the territorial waters by a group of American companies have not been encouraging and the limited geological information at present available does not suggest the presence <Col N="1562" /> in our area of shelf of gas deposits comparable with those discovered in the North Sea.  Some oil companies have, however, indicated an interest in exploring our area of shelf which suggests that the area has possibilities for oil and gas and there is no reason why we should not entertain hopes of success. We know that sand and gravel aggregate is present in great abundance in the many banks and shoals fringing our east coast and beds of organic mud of possible use as fertiliser have been noted off the west coast.</P>
    <P>While the potential of our area of shelf must be regarded as largely unknown at present, the important fact is that technological advances have now made the exploration of this vast area possible and such exploration offers the exciting possibility of locating valuable resources, the exploitation of which could prove to be of great benefit to our economy.  It is, therefore, considered desirable that we should now provide a statutory framework for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the area.  We will then be in a position to grant licences and leases to competent parties desirous of exploring and exploiting the resources of our area of shelf.</P>
    <P>As I already pointed out, the rights which the coastal State may exercise over its area of continental shelf do not amount to full sovereignty.  Our existing laws could not, therefore, be taken as applying automatically to our area of the shelf and it is necessary to extend the application of a number of existing statutes to the area so as to provide a basis of law and order for operations there.  Much of the Bill is concerned with the extension of the application of these statutes.  The interests of many Departments are concerned, and the Bill has been drafted in consultation with these Departments.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Government may by Order designate the area of continental shelf over which the rights which accrue to the State will be exercised.  These rights are vested in and exerciseable by the Minister for Industry and Commerce except where the Government may by direction vest the rights in another Minister.  The rights relating to minerals, oil and gas <Col N="1563" /> will be exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and if the exploration or exploitation of any other natural resources, such as sedentary fisheries, should arise at some future date the Government will by direction provide for the exercise of the rights by the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <P>We are applying the provisions of the Minerals Development Act, 1940 and the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act, 1960, which govern mineral and petroleum exploration and exploitation in the land area and territorial waters, to similar operations in the shelf area thus providing a legal framework for the grant of exploration licences and exploitation facilities to operators in the area.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the extension of criminal and civil law to installations in designated areas and waters within 500 meters of such installations and in the case of other parts of designated areas, to any act or omission arising out of the exploration or exploitation of the natural resources of the areas and for the prosecution of offences taking place in the shelf area.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the safety of navigation and installations in the shelf area and for the prevention of the pollution of the sea from pipe lines or installations.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885, which deals with the wilful or negligent breaking or injuring of cables or pipelines, are being extended to all cables and pipelines and the provision of the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 and 1956, which relate to the control of and interference with wireless telegraphy, are being extended to wireless apparatus on or near installations.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the extension of insurance cover under the Social Welfare Acts and the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Acts to persons engaged in exploration or exploitation in the designated shelf areas.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House feels, as I do, that the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of our continental shelf area is highly desirable. I hope that, on its enactment, <Col N="1564" /> this measure will provide a satisfactory legal framework for the carrying out of such work and I have every confidence that the Bill will meet with the general approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the North Sea exploration that there should be legislation of this kind.  It is wise that we should enact it so that we shall be not only in step with the rest of Europe but ready without delay to encourage the development of exploitation of the continental shelf we own, if &ldquo;own&rdquo; is the right word.  It appears as if under the international agreement mentioned by the Minister, as far as a nation can own it, we do own it and it is to be a piece of Ireland. Wherever these boring rigs are erected and whatever exploration takes place, evidently even our social welfare provisions will apply.  Therefore, we must own it as a bit of Ireland, probably, as the Minister said, much bigger than the Ireland we now have.  You could compare that with the frozen state of Alaska which the United States brought into their fold.  The geographical area was bigger of course than its importance.</P>
      <P>We like to see this legislation enacted also because since the time of the North Sea exploration, various things have happened.  Boring rigs have gone adrift and have been a danger to shipping.  It is necessary that there should be control there and that there should be an arrangement whereby there will be no danger to navigation. Also in the last month we have had a situation in which a borehole which had been made in the North Sea became a danger on the basis of leaks. If the wind was blowing in the right way, you could have had natural gas being blown across cities on the east side of Britain.  This again is something over which we should have control. Nobody should be in a position to go out from the west or east coast and bore for gas or conduct any sort of operation which could pollute the air or the sea.  For that reason also, this Bill is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The laws of the State must also be there.  I thought of shades of Jimmy O'Dea when I was told about the jurisdiction of the Garda Síochána. <Col N="1565" /> One can think of the unfortunate sergeant in the next parish to America having jurisdiction over a lot of heavy-drinking Americans and Canadians who were boring for gas perhaps 50 miles out.  This is something he will have to see about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in any way reflecting on this local sergeant.  Many of them are very dear friends of Deputy Dunne and myself.  It was just a thought.  We would hope that there would be money made by our tax-gatherer who would tax the profits of such an operation.  It may seem a bit far-fetched to speak of pirate radio stations but a couple of years ago somebody died.  I will not say there was a murder; I forget whether anybody was convicted but a man died and people took over a pirate radio station by force.  Therefore, policing of this area, if there is any development there, is a real responsibility of the State and something that must occur.  These things appear so far away and then one realises that they are not.  In a port in my constituency, a boat has been regularly plying to supply a radio ship with fuel, food and supplies and all the rest.  We even know the shops they buy their goods in.  I shall say no more on that.  It is a trawler and it is still plying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wireless control is one of the most important things because where you get a pirate radio on land, it makes the news on the paper.  Nobody is terribly worried.  They are caught and then they give interviews to the paper. Sometimes, but not often, it is an underground movement.  We have had that too coming in on Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann.  On land, it does not constitute a danger to life, but on sea, it constitutes a very real danger.  Any of us who go to sea a bit know that, for instance, on the half hour and the hour, you have the three minutes silent period when nobody may go on the air except to give &ldquo;May-day&rdquo;, the SOS of the sea.  When anybody hears May-day, they listen and they do not <Col N="1566" /> speak.  That is an international law of the sea.  I am sorry to tell you that I happened to be near France once and I was horrified to hear a Frenchman whistling the <i>Marseillaise</i> and thinking it was a great joke.  The person with the highest watt-output drowns out the other.  A person with a 50-watt output will drown out a person with a 20-watt and a ship with a 150-watt output will drown out one with a 50-watt output.  The international May-day 2182 wave-band is reserved for that SOS.  If you had pirate radios or persons who were not licensed or disciplined on rigs boring along our continental shelf, the position would be that people could lose their lives. Ships might, during the silent period, find themselves unable to get their SOS through because the heavier watt output of a boring rig with perhaps a more powerful dynamo generator might be such that they would have an output of 150-watts.  It would mean that the whole business of safety at sea and navigation would be affected.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything else about the Bill except to welcome it and to say that one of the interesting things about it is that we are now talking in metres which means that we are very near the metric system.  We are going to police waters within 500 metres of these installations.  This is a non-controversial Bill but one which should receive the consideration of the House as being very necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We used to talk about our spiritual empire beyond the seas.  It looks now as if we will be talking about our physical empire underneath the seas, or at least something approximating thereunto.  The Minister says: &ldquo;The area of continental shelf accruing to this country...&rdquo; I would suggest that the Minister might recommend that these people who compose his speeches might have reference to the recent excellent booklet circulated by the Department of Finance as to the use of economy of language and the appropriate use of language. &ldquo;Accruing&rdquo; in this instance does not seem to me to be the best word.  However, that is only by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His statement says that the area of continental shelf which will fall to come <Col N="1567" /> within the legislation of this country will be an area extending about 200 miles off the south-west coast and 165 miles off the west coast.  That is pretty considerable.  It is very necessary that this piece of legislation should go through the House and should be on the Statute Book, because we have, as Deputy Donegan indicated, read of the development of this kind of exploration not alone in the regions of the Great North Sea, but I think some years ago off the coast of America.  I must say that the prospect of a collection of oil-rigs existing off our shores is not a very entrancing or inviting one, but I have no doubt that with the passage of time, the present awkward-looking rigs will become as dated as the early motor car is today and that some method will be found of exploiting the mineral wealth which may be discovered under the continental shelf by a method which may possibly dispense entirely with any surface rigging whatsoever.  With technological development, such a concept is not outside the bounds of possibility and it is to be hoped that it will happen because it does not look natural or in any way attractive.  However, I suppose it is a necessary part of mineral development at the beginning at least but I am sure that there will be improvements along that line.</P>
    <P>There is just one thing which strikes me in regard to this Bill and I am sure it must have occurred to the Minister also and anybody who thinks about it. It is essential that we provide the ordinary machinery of law to ensure that the authority of Dáil Éireann, in so far as it is feasible and necessary, in regard to what is known as the continental shelf, shall be exercised, in the matter of exploitation of resources. Nobody can say what may be hidden there.  It may be that there may be some discoveries in the near or, perhaps, in the very distant future but it is not impossible to think of an important discovery, say, towards the outer edge of the continental shelf&mdash; some tremendous form of wealth, oil, natural gas or what have you and that such a discovery exploited, perhaps, at great cost by interests which would not originate in this country might not benefit us in the slightest.  What could <Col N="1568" /> we do to enforce our rights at such a remove from our shores if somebody wanted to defy us?  Assuming anybody would take such an extreme course, in order that we might protect the natural interests, should this Bill or some other legislation not provide that if there is at any time in the future some exploitable wealth descivered part of the profits which will flow from that wealth will be available to the people who live in this country?</P>
    <P>I am thinking of the sinking of an oil rig 165 miles south-west of the Irish coast and oil being taken from there to some port on the Continent, to some other country, without reference to this country at all.  What tangible benefit would that be to us as a nation?  How would it benefit our economy?  Should we not ensure in so far as we can in such an eventuality, however remote it may now appear, that we should have already in our statute law a provision which will enable us to ensure that this territory, the wealth which flows from this territory, would primarily be of benefit to the population of this country?  This is the only point which occurs to me in regard to this essential measure which is in accord with the spirit of the times in which we live.  We should be ready to avail of every possible opportunity to keep in step with progress either in Europe or in the rest of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I have a particular reason for welcoming this Bill and I am happy to see it has now at last been introduced.  It is, of course, possible, as has been mentioned by some of the other speakers, that there could be an oil discovery but the matter which interests me most, and the one which I hope will now be fully investigated, is the question of organic mud and its use as a fertiliser. The Minister referred to it thus in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that members of the staff of University College, Galway, have carried out extensive research on the floor of the ocean off the west coast of Ireland and they have discovered there quantities of the deposit which in their opinion is of very high value as a fertiliser.  From their studies into the <Col N="1569" /> use of this material in other countries it seems that it is being marketed by other countries and is proving of great financial benefit to countries who have invested in its development and the marketing of this particular type of fertiliser.</P>
    <P>It is maintained that it is present in large quantities off the west coast of Ireland.  Some of us were worried that some outside interests might get going on this before any Irish interest did and that then, not having this particular Bill and this particular jurisdiction over this part of the ocean, that the Irish nation might possibly lose something which might have been very profitable to the nation if we had jurisdiction over this area.  I think the Bill clarifies that position and that many developments will take place.  I should like to recommend to the Minister that he would give whatever assistance he can to the further research and investigation of this deposit which it is firmly maintained is there and maybe in the not too distant future this country might reap very rich rewards from this part of the continental shelf.  This might prove of great benefit to the country in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill may seem to many of us somewhat remote and not very applicable to present day affairs there is no doubt that submarine exploration is virtually only in its embryo stage.  This is a matter of considerable importance to all of us and to all maritime countries. I take it that this is enabling legislation so that we may opt into the scheme or convention adopted in Geneva at some period or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the Minister's definition of the territorial jurisdiction of our continental shelf just a little vague.  I would be anxious to know if at this convention which took place in Geneva and at which presumably we were represented by somebody or other some territorial distribution was made.  We ought to have a map which would clear up any matters which might arise in the future in regard to particular areas.  The Minister stated that our territorial claims would be half Irish.  I take it that the other half would be around <Col N="1570" /> Britain or neighbouring countries which have shores near us, 165 miles into the Atlantic and 200 miles south-west of the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>That again raises the question which was raised by some other Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Dunne&mdash;of a map being very desirable.  If I was asked a question in relation to a place about 200 miles off the coast of Ireland my geographical knowledge would be very vague without a map.  You would certainly conflict with territorial claims by other countries if the ratio depth of 200 metres, as stated in the Minister's speech, came into operation. There might be some considerable confusion unless that point is completely cleared up.  I would ask the Minister to inform the House whether such a map exists, if one was drawn up at the convention and if not my fears on that point would need to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Another thing I want to ask the Minister is this.  Fairly recently there have been ships off the Irish coast carrying out surveys.  I am not quite sure of their nationality.  I believe them to belong to a British company who are carrying out survey for natural gas. They were engaged in these operations prior to the introduction of this Bill, which I assume the House will give the Minister today or next week perhaps. How will the concessions given to this company be affected by this legislation? I take it they were looking for natural gas.  It is possible that there is quite a lot of gas under the sea within the area of our territorial waters.  If it is in the North Sea, it stands to reason that it is probably a bank or a streak of some sort.  There is absolutely no reason why it should not be found in the Irish Sea, be it in the northern area or down in the southern area.  We need to be sure we have complete jurisdiction over our own territory.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat dubious as to the legal issues and the protection of our rights.  We have a very poor chance of protecting our maritime rights if we have difficulty in protecting our territorial waters which have a limit of 12 miles.  It will be very difficult to operate 165 miles off the west coast and about 200 miles off the south-west coast with three antiquated corvettes.  We shall <Col N="1571" /> have to make a treaty or agreement with some other maritime power to look after our interests which we are unable to look after ourselves.  We would in no way be denigrating ourselves in so doing.  We are not a first-class power or a wealthy country.  It is only natural to look to other countries to join with us in a convention or a treaty to help us to protect our interests.</P>
    <P>We are to have control to the extent of 200 metres in depth.  That means we must have up-to-date charts and surveys of the waters around our coasts.  I do not know how the Minister proposes to deal with that problem.  I presume he will use the British Admiralty charts which are, perhaps, the most up-to-date in the world.  The British Navy survey is perhaps second to none.  If we rely on ourselves to find out our rights in relation to this depth of 200 metres, it will be a different story altogether because we have not had such surveys of our harbours or of our territorial waters for the past 50 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Since I became a Member of this House, I have tabled questions on numerous occasions on the possibility of exploration for oil and natural gas in our territorial waters.  I believe this will prove one of the most important Bills ever to be introduced into this House if the results are what we hope they will be.  The Bill will achieve two objects. Either we shall strike oil and/or gas and become a rich country or else it will stop us from wondering if oil or gas are in fact there.  Such natural resources have been found off the north coast of Holland and in the North Sea and there is great hope that some deposit of oil and/or natural gas will be discovered within the range of our territorial waters.  It may not be well known that, even at the moment, quite a good few Irish workers go to Holland to take part in taking the oil from the sea bed.  We have a very well-trained manpower there, since the Dutch discovered this a few years ago, who could be very useful to us if our experts strike oil and/or natural gas.  We are so near to <Col N="1572" /> this, without realising it.  For instance, cooking apparatus is being sold in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere with a note on it to the effect that it can be adapted to the use of natural gas. Already, in Britain, they are attaching adaptation gadgets to this type of cooking apparatus for sale here on the off-chance that natural gas may be found in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The protection of our rights is very important.  How shall we protect an oil deposit many miles off our coast? This time, we must depend not on gunboat diplomacy but on the people to whom we give the right to explore these areas.  There are no poor oil companies or oil interests.  If our areas are leased to these people, I think they will take good care that their rights are respected.  Otherwise, it would mean building up a big naval force, which we just cannot afford to do.  That is only a very small point.</P>
      <P>When God made this country, he endowed it with very few natural resources. Perhaps here is the answer to many of our economic ills.  I believe that a discovery of gas and/or oil in the seas around us could change the whole economy of our country.</P>
      <P>This very slender Bill gives us a chance of getting into the thick of things with the British, the Dutch, the French, the former colonies, and so on.  The introduction of this Bill is a tremendous step forward.  If we discover oil and/or gas we shall become a fairly rich country.  If we do not succeed, we shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing that we tried to find these natural resources.  If they are not there, it is not our fault.  We cannot be faulted for not having tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I anticipated, there is a general welcome on all sides for this Bill.  I shall endeavour to clarify a few of the points which were made. First of all, there seems to be some doubt about the definition of our area of jurisdiction, if we may so call it.  Let me repeat what I said when introducing the Bill, that we are not getting full sovereignty over this area which is outside our territorial waters and within the limits laid down in the Convention. We are getting such rights as are necessary to explore and exploit the resources. <Col N="1573" /> In defining the area concerned, somebody asked whether maps were drawn up when the Convention was being worked out in Geneva.  No: maps were not drawn up at that time.  The definition covers, in our case, halfway across the Irish Sea and, as I have said, 165 miles off the west coast and about 200 miles off the south-west coast.  Deputies will note that the definition laid down in the Convention relates to depth, that is, 200 metres, but it goes on to say &ldquo;... and further where the resources involved may be exploited even beyond a depth of 200 metres...&rdquo;  This lends a certain amount of ambiguity about the extent of our area of the continental shelf, but it seems that the areas in which exploration is likely to take place in the next few years, at any rate, are within very closely defined limits and that we will not have any great problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Convention also provided that in delimiting the boundaries of the shelf, if we were to produce a map showing the area which we claim, any lines drawn on this map must be defined with reference to charts and geographical features if they exist at a particular date and reference must be made to fixed, permanent identifiable points on land so that all will know where they stand in this regard.  However, as I say, we believe that the areas which are completely ours are the areas in which interest would centre for some years to come.  In so far as there may be any doubt about the area to which we would lay claim, as between us and other coastal States, this would be a matter for negotiations between us and them, and as for the distance out in the Atlantic to which our area might go, this to some extent depends not only on the technological development of methods of exploring under the sea but also on an interpretation of the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under one interpretation, we could end up claiming an area half way between here and the United States of America, and we may well do this, but this is not an immediate problem for us.  Another interpretation of the <Col N="1574" /> Convention would prevent us going that far, but the Convention may be revised in 1969, just five years after it entered into force, and the matters about which there is some ambiguity may well be clarified at that time.  But, as I said, the areas where there is no ambiguity at present are the areas of greatest interest as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was raised was the question of the protection of the area which we do claim.  It seemed to me that some Deputies were tending to think of this as being analogous to fishery protection, and of course it is not.  This is not the kind of operation where people can go about operating suddenly and then disappear in a matter of hours or days.  The greatest protection we have in this regard is that any operation of this nature is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time and a geat deal of technological expertise, and it is reasonable to assume that no individual, or no company composed of individuals in their sane senses, are going to embark on this kind of substantial expenditure and run the risk that the results of their efforts will be lost to them because they do so without a licence from the Irish Government.  Therefore, the actual risk involved of doing some exploring of the resources without permission is very remote for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, even if somebody in this remote circumstance were to embark on this kind of operation, it would usually require a fairly permanent structure in the sea which would, at least at the present stage of technological development, be quite sizeable, and we are not quite entirely dependent on the corvettes to know what is going on in these areas; we have other methods available to us, including, of course, the planes of the Air Corps and some other methods.  I do not think we will find ourselves having any difficulty in regard to the policing of our area of the continental shelf in connection with this kind of exploration and exploitation.</P>
    <P>Another point raised was: supposing there is a substantial find, what benefit will this be to us?  Well, the first benefit <Col N="1575" /> would be that in order to explore in the first instance the company concerned have to have a licence from us, and then if they think they have a strike, they would look for a lease and the lease, of course, contains various provisions including royalties to be paid to the Exchequer here from the produce of their strike.  In addition, we can impose conditions which would compel the delivery of the finds, be they oil or gas or whatever, to specific ports.  We would be entitled to make such conditions. This kind of approach, therefore, is in fact the legal framework that we apply to mineral exploration on land at the moment.</P>
    <P>We can be satisfied that in this Bill we are giving ourselves all the powers we need to derive the full benefit to which we might lay claim in the event of any find in our area of the continental shelf, having regard, of course all the time to the fact that the people who carry out exploration of this kind are expending a great deal of money and, indeed, may try in a number of areas and spend a great deal of money without any result, and therefore would claim, in the event of making a satisfactory strike, a fairly substantial return.  This is a risk which we take and which they take in this type of operation, but Deputies can be satisfied that we are taking sufficient power here to ensure that in the event of any discoveries of substantial resources in the continental shelf area, this country will benefit substantially from any such discovery.</P>
    <P>One other point was raised by Deputy Esmonde.  He referred to some ships which were surveying off the Wexford coast.  I should say in that regard that preliminary surveys may be carried out by anybody without permission but any detailed investigation requires licence from us and detailed investigation cannot be carried out, as I have indicated, without a great deal of expenditure of money and time and resources.  If he did see ships carrying out some surveys, these were merely preliminary surveys which they were carrying out and do not entitle the people concerned to any rights within our area of the continental shelf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 59 is the section which enables the Minister to make various regulations dealing with the control of traffic and pedestrians.  It replaces a section of the 1961 Act under which the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, after consultation with various people, was empowered to make bye-laws, as I think they were called in that section. I should like the Minister to tell us why he considers it more desirable that these regulations should be made by the Minister under the new section rather than by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána under section 88 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>
      <P>When dealing with regulations or bye-laws&mdash;call them what you will&mdash; dealing with the control of traffic and pedestrians, I should like to take the opportunity to refer to a matter that probably has already been dealt with but which, in my opinion, merits further emphasis, that is, regulations for the safety of pedestrians.  Many of the fatal accidents of which we read in the newspapers or hear about on television or radio concern pedestrians. Frequently we hear that a person who has been killed in a road traffic accident was a pedestrian.  I believe that these fatal accidents to pedestrians occur because motorists do not see the pedestrians.  I am convinced that pedestrians do not realise the risk involved in walking on concrete roads at night without having on some luminous apparel to make them clearly visible to motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has experience of driving a motor car knows how often a driver sees a pedestrian at the last moment.  This is a difficult matter to explain.  There may be black spots on the road; the motorist may be blinded by the lights of an oncoming car. Whatever the reason is, one thing is <Col N="1577" /> certain, that is, that a number of pedestrians are killed simply because the motorists in question do not see them.  I am convinced that many more pedestrians would be killed, were it not for the Providence of the Almighty. They are saved by a miracle.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not regulations exist making the wearing of scotchlight belts or other luminous apparel obligatory.  I do not think that such regulations are in existence but I do think that the Minister has already the power to make such regulations.  I also know that it would be, perhaps, in the beginning a considerable inconvenience to pedestrians to have to wear this protective&mdash;and protective is the word &mdash;belt or identification mark at night but it would be worth while.  I do notice the occasional pedestrian already wearing the scotchlight type of belt and, of course, it is worn by the gardaí.  The fact that some people are wearing them indicates that people do realise the risk involved to a pedestrian at night.  It is amazing to see people walking at night on the lefthand side of the road, not moving one way or the other, wearing dark clothes, giving no indication to motorists of their presence.  That may be because they imagine that because of the powerful headlights on cars motorists must see them, that they stand out in the lights.  As I have said, motorists know that very often they see a pedestrian at the last moment and in fatal cases the motorists just do not see them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like strongly to recommend to the pedestrian public that they should wear this luminous type of clothing or belt and I would recommend to the Minister that he should seriously consider introducing regulations of the type I have mentioned for the protection of pedestrians.</P>

      <P>The Minister is only wasting time and paper in bringing in a Road Traffic Bill if every matter is not fully considered such as the case put by the previous speaker.  A pedestrian on a country road at night has no protection if he comes between two cars.  Take a wet misty night.  The Minister is barking up the wrong tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> He should provide protection for pedestrians by having footpaths laid along the roads outside towns.  This may not come within the ambit of the section under discussion but I would point out that the Minister must act under another section of his Department and provide protection for the people by providing paths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware I did not want to come in on this Bill too early.  That was because it appeared to me that a number of Deputies were <Col N="1579" /> anxious to make contributions, and since the obvious tactic was to deal with new planning appeals and other cases which Deputies wished to represent as being planning appeals, although they were not planning appeals, I felt it was desirable to let as many of those Deputies as possible have their say before I came in.  I assume that the reason for raising those cases here was that the Deputies wished me to deal with them in my reply and clear up whatever doubts they might have.  I hardly think it was the intention to wait until I had spoken and then raise these cases in anticipation that I would not have the opportunity of commenting on them. It would appear, therefore, that to deal with the debate as it has been so far will take some considerable time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is ostensibly introduced in order to set up special machinery to deal with planning appeals, to make a fundamental change in the Planning Act which places a responsibility on the Minister and to hand it over to another body.  It is for the purpose of setting up rather elaborate machinery, the functioning of which would result in what might be described as a lawyers' paradise.  It is obvious that the process of an appeal would consist more or less of the usual type of litigation.  However, as the debate proceeded, it became obvious that the primary purpose of the Private Members' Bill was really to provide a vehicle which would further the campaign of slander that has been deliberately and cold-bloodedly decided upon by the Opposition Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of individual cases have been referred to already.  These have been selected out of what I could properly describe as the huge number of planning appeals that have been decided by myself and my predecessor. These cases have been referred to here already, and that is as far as the debate has gone.  I assume that it is intended that more cases will be produced when those Deputies who have been held in reserve by the disciplinary arrangements of the Opposition Parties make their contribution.  I will have to deal with the cases that have been raised.  It has apparently been decided that in <Col N="1580" /> discussing this Bill which proposes to set up machinery to deal with future appeals, it is in order to discuss the details of cases that have already been decided and, indeed, of cases that have never been referred to the Minister by way of appeal at all.  I expect I shall have to deal with these cases that have been raised, and, in view of the fact that there are still the majority of the Opposition Deputies of both Parties waiting to contribute to this debate, I shall also have to anticipate some of the cases that they might decide to raise.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the cases that have been selected out of the vast number that have been decided were obviously selected in the belief that the one-sided presentation of these cases which has already, in some instances, been undertaken by the various means of communication, would give a certain picture of the manner in which appeals are dealt with.  In order to make it clear that this picture is a false picture, and a deliberately false picture, it will not be sufficient for me just to deal with the cases that the Opposition Deputies selected themselves, but it will also be desirable from my point of view, in order to present the true picture of the manner in which these appeals are dealt with, to select other cases and to point out the considerations that applied in those cases.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Opposition found it necessary to go back to decisions made by my predecessor, I think, in order to show that there was at least no great difference in the manner in which different Ministers have dealt with appeals, that it will be essential for me to produce some cases that were dealt with by his predecessor and by the person who preceded him also as Minister, who was Deputy P. O'Donnell.  It appears, then, that it may be some time before the cases which the remaining Deputies of the Opposition have been holding in reserve will come to light.  As I say, I shall have to try to anticipate the type of cases which they will raise.  As I said, unfortunately this will all take time, but that cannot be helped.  Unlike the Opposition, I think it is necessary, in order to present a balanced picture of this, to deal with <Col N="1581" /> the different types of cases.</P>
    <P>Now, planning appeals may be of a number of different types.  They may be appeals by an applicant for planning permission against a refusal of that planning permission by the planning authority.  They may be appeals, again by a person who applies for planning permission, against some conditions attached to the permission given by the planning authority.  They may be appeals by third parties against the decision of the planning authority granting permission to the person who applied for such permission, or against some of the conditions attaching to such permission.  So there are a number of different things that can take place.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before when dealing with this matter on my Estimate, the listing of cases by my Department is with reference to the final result of the original application.  So that cases which are listed as permission having been granted may not in fact be cases in which &mdash; and very often they are not &mdash; the original decision of the planning authority was reversed.  They may merely be cases in which the appeal by a third party against a permission granted was refused.  Similarly cases in which the final result is that the permission sought has been refused may not in fact be a reversal of a decision of the planning authority.  It may be a confirmation of it.  It will be necessary for me to produce cases showing all these different types of things.</P>
    <P>I would think it necessary also to point out that in making my decision on these cases, I have available to me the best technical advice, and certainly the best possible that may be obtained. I consider cases, unlike what a former Minister said was his practice when he was in a position to deal with these cases.  On the Second Stage of the Derelict Sites Bill, as reported in the Official Report, column 404, volume 185, 30th November, 1960, Deputy O'Donnell described the manner in which Ministers for Local Government dealt with these cases.  Of course, he was speaking only from his own experience.  He said:</P>
    <P>With great respect to the present <Col N="1582" /> Minister and to all Ministers for Local Government, they cannot possibly deal with each appeal individually. On at least one day in the week there is a file of appeals handed to the Minister with the recommendation of the Department's inspector on them and the Minister, unless he has some reason or other to examine each individual file, merely signs what an individual has put before him.</P>
    <P>I want to say first that Deputy O'Donnell cannot speak in that regard, as he purported to do, for all Ministers for Local Government.  He has experience only of his own manner of dealing with appeals.  On that occasion the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, disagreed with him and said that was not the manner in which he dealt with appeals.  Neither is it the manner in which I deal with them.</P>
    <P>I examine the case in all these appeals.  As I said, I have the best possible technical advice available to me.  I have a large number of appeals to deal with and this takes some considerable time, but I deal with them according to my opinion as to my responsibility as Minister for Local Government.  Of course, I do not do it in a five-day, 40-hour week.  It takes me until late at night &mdash; until 10.30 or 11 o'clock on Christmas Eve, for instance.  I deal with them and I read them.  I do not sign documents without examining the files, as Deputy O'Donnell says he did.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that Deputy O'Donnell, according to his own words, does not know the circumstances that obtained in any of the appeals he decided, I think it would be good for him if he now learned something about some of the appeals he decided.  I propose to inform Deputy O'Donnell now, and if he will not be here to listen, at least some of the information about some of the appeals Deputy O'Donnell decided when he was Minister for Local Government will be available to him in the Official Report of the Dáil Debates.  I know of course that this will be in the Official Report only.  I know that the freedom of speech we hear about in the Opposition newspapers and other places is <Col N="1583" /> interpreted in a certain way.  Freedom of speech there means freedom for people who have access to &mdash; the small group of people who have access to &mdash; these media of communication to present the side of the story they themselves are interested in and, at the same time, to suppress the other side of the story completely, or worse still to pretend to give it by making some passing reference to some slight aspect of the other side of the question.</P>
    <P>I am aware therefore that the other side of these cases is not going to be put.  I know that when the <i>Irish Times</i> and those other crawthumping hypocrites talk about free speech, they interpret the phrase &ldquo;freedom of speech&rdquo; in that way.  It is freedom for the people who are in control of these media of communication to twist and distort every case in whatever way they see fit.  It is freedom to suppress the other side of the story and give only the side that interests them at the particular time, and to present only the side that interests them and the side that helps to promote the campaign of slander that has been decided upon in a cold-blooded and determined manner by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A predecessor in Local Government says he never looked at any appeals.  He just put his name where some official told him to put it.  That was in 1960.  The Minister for Local Government at the time said that was not the way he did things.  But Deputy O'Donnell again this year, this month, repeated that statement.  The statement will be found at column 1127 of volume 232 of the Official Report.  Deputy O'Donnell said:</P>
      <P>Another day about 100 appeals are taken into him by his officials.  They are handed to him for signature.  He cannot possibly wade through them because there are files with them. There are local authority files, and also departmental files, and one could not possibly read them through.  All one can do is ask:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>At least he says now that he asked; in 1960 when, presumably, his recollection of what he actually did would have been somewhat clearer than it might be in 1968, he said he did not even ask; he just put his name where he was told to put it.  Now he says:</P>
      <P>All one can do is ask: &ldquo;Are you affirming or are you reversing the decision of the local authority?&rdquo;  If they are affirming the decision, and if no representations have been made, they are merely handed to the Minister for signature.  As I say, you have not the slightest chance of reading them through.  I am speaking from practical experience and I am sorry to say there is not a hope in hell of reading through all the files.  You depend entirely on your officials.  I want to be fair to the officials and to the assistant secretaries or the secretary who brings you the appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is not the way I deal with appeals and, since Deputy O'Donnell maintains that he knows nothing about the appeals he decided, I have here some appeals he decided and I will put on the records of this House the considerations that applied, the decisions of the local authority which came before him and the decisions he took. Now that Deputy O'Donnell has more time on his hands than he had when he <Col N="1586" /> was Minister for Local Government, he will have this opportunity, at least, of becoming acquainted with some of the decisions he made.  I am sure he will be surprised to discover that some of the decisions he made were in relation to appeals which were submitted by people with whom he could not have been unacquainted.</P>
    <P>In one particular case, the appeal was by a person whom he certainly met every second day.  He did not learn anything about these appeals when he was deciding them.  Maybe, when he had time for contemplation, he formed the opinion that he should reverse the decisions of the local authorities with regard even to such horrible things as petrol filling stations.  Maybe he got this time for contemplation while he was driving, or being driven, around in his State car, because Deputy O'Donnell may recognise one of these particular decisions and he may have thought that is where he got the idea. Not, of course, that anybody mentioned to him while he was in the State car that it would be an advisable thing to change the decision of the planning authority in regard to an application to erect a petrol filling station in any particular part of this city.  My method of dealing with these appeals is different from that of Deputy O'Donnell.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, this will take some time. I said my method of dealing with appeals is different from that of Deputy O'Donnell.  I consider I should know what is decided.  I do not say I read through every single file, but I certainly read the advice given to me and I certainly, in every case I have decided, have at least read the summary submitted to me.  As I said, I do not do that in a five-day 40-hour week; it took me until late at night, any night I could spare, in the Custom House, up to and including Christmas Eve.  But I was satisfied that my decision was right in every single case in which I gave a decision and I propose now to justify that decision.  Mark you, I have a big supply of documents and, in order to anticipate the contributions of those Deputies who were held, as I <Col N="1588" /> said, in reserve by the disciplinary arrangements of the two Opposition Parties, I shall have to give quite a selection of cases that have not yet been raised here.  I read the advice given to me, and if I have any doubts I go back for further information and I go through the whole file and read all the submissions in every case.</P>
    <P>Few of the Deputies who spoke dealt with the Bill itself and, before going on to deal with the allegations made, I should like to deal with the proposals in the Bill.  The Bill proposes&mdash;I do not think many Deputies know what it proposes or care &mdash; the assignment of one of our judges on a whole-time basis to take over the functions of the Minister in respect to planning appeals under the 1963 Act.  That is the first thing it proposes.  The person concerned would remain a judge.  His salary, I presume, would be the salary of a judge.  It is proposed that this person would decide appeals and that he would be assisted by two assessors with technical qualifications who would be employed for three years initially.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Fine Gael Party know that two such technically qualified assessors would be available for employment for a period of three years initially.  The experience of my Department in efforts to obtain these qualified persons does not lead us to suppose they would be available but we can assume that the Fine Gael Party know better than that, that such people could be got on these terms.  However, they would not be got for nothing.</P>

When I come to deal with that, hardly tonight, I will, I think, cast some doubt in the minds of some members of the Fine Gael Party who may know more about their own higher echelon that the person involved in this is a member of Taca.

      <P>Deputy Treacy can rest assured of that.  In the meantime I will deal with the matters that come before me arising out of this Bill.  As I was saying, in addition to the judge on a whole-time basis and the two assessors to be appointed for three years initially, provision is also made in the Bill for the appointment of staff to serve the board.  It does not state how many staff; there is no assessment made as to how many head of staff would be involved, but it would not be inconsiderable.  Also it is visualised that the volume of work might necessitate a further board.  Possibly it is visualised that the board would be multiplied further by having several judges as deputy chairmen, all employed on a whole-time basis, all paid judges' salaries, allowances and expenses, all paid out of the bottomless well of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in reply to one of Deputy Barrett's interruptions&mdash;I do not recall whether I was allowed to reply before I was interrupted again &mdash; there is something more involved in this than the mere decision of individual cases.  There is the question of planning policy, and if we are to have a coherent planning policy, then there must be some way of ensuring that as far as possible these decisions correspond with that coherent planning policy.  The Planning Act was debated during 1963&mdash;I think it was only during 1963, though it may have been before that, but it became the Planning Act, 1963&mdash;and it came into operation on 1st October, 1964. It was not brought into operation until 1st October, 1964.  The decision to bring the Act into operation throughout the whole country was not taken without careful consideration because it would obviously be a mistake to bring the Act into operation until such time as it appeared likely that it could be implemented.</P>
      <P>Even at that time it was visualised there would be initial difficulties: it had been anticipated there would be, and many initial difficulties did materialise.  Planning, nowadays, is a highly complex matter and at that time the cadre of skilled personnel was very small, and indeed it is not sufficient yet.  At the same time, what has been achieved during the past three years has been remarkable.  The initial developing of plans now nearing completion is an important step forward, reflecting the concern, the interest and the enthuasism of local councils and their officials for the future welfare of their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning authorities are at present dealing with about 20,000 development applications per annum and it is sought to imply that the Minister for Local Government is responsible for the <Col N="1591" /> decisions in each of these 20,000 planning applications.  Indeed Deputies have gone so far as to put themselves on record in the debates charging the Minister for Local Government with being responsible for decisions which were in fact made by themselves as members of planning authorities; and, of course, the Opposition newspapers do the same thing.  They pretend that every building that is erected, every development that takes place, has been decided by the Minister for Local Government, though they know full well that that is untrue.  They state it, knowing it to be untrue, for the purpose of promoting the Opposition's slander campaign.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is&mdash;just in case anybody on the Opposition side or any of the hypocrites in the <i>Irish Times</i> or these other Opposition newspapers might be interested in the truth, which is something I doubt&mdash; that only 7 per cent of these are dealt with by way of appeal and the other 93 per cent are not dealt with by the Minister for Local Government at all. The people who preach this freedom of speech have themselves the freedom to refuse to make facts known to the public and all I can do is make the facts available on the records of this House for anybody who is not prepared to accept these one-sided statements as being the truth and who would like to find out the truth for himself.</P>
    <P>There are many improvements still to be achieved.  I agree with that, but the system under the Planning Act of 1963 is beginning to work fairly smoothly.  It is now generally understood and, I think in the circumstances, any change in the system will require very careful consideration.  I want to say that I am quite anxious to get rid of the load of having to decide all these appeals.  I am not prepared to do the job in the manner in which Deputy O'Donnell did it, that is, by having things decided, as he says, by officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>We all agree that appeals should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. In recent years, it has been found difficult to overhaul the sharp repeated rises in the numbers of planning <Col N="1592" /> appeals.  I have said before that I thought many planning appeals should never come to the appeal stage.  I have exhorted planning authorities to make every effort to reach agreement, if possible, with the person proposing any development of his own property. It is only in cases where it does not seem possible to recouncile the particular development proposal with the exigencies of the common good that outright refusal should be resorted to. Prior to that, there should be the maximum possible consultation between the planning authority, the planning officers and the individual making the proposal or his technical advisers.</P>
    <P>I think there has been a considerable improvement in that regard, but at the same time, it is a fact that, probably because of the increased number of applications, which of course arises from the increased prosperity in the country and the increased confidence in the future of the country, despite the fact that there is more consultation and more resolution of difficulties at local level, the total number of appeals is still apparently increasing.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to train administrative staff to deal with the complex questions which arise on these appeals. Procedures had to be worked out and followed which were fair and equitable to all parties and these procedures take time because most of these cases are dealt with in writing.</P>
    <P>There was, as I said, a chronic shortage of qualified planners and those who could be recruited had to devote much of their time to other planning and training problems.  Nevertheless, since April, 1966, there has been a steady improvement in the appeals position and cases have been cleared more rapidly than before.  The average period taken for consideration has been reduced over the past year and a half by about 50 per cent and it is a fact that planning appeals cannot be dealt with properly without being examined and reported on by trained planners.  Therefore, further improvements in the time taken in dealing with appeals are largely dependent on trained planners becoming available.  I have taken steps towards that end and the arrangements made <Col N="1593" /> with the Dublin vocational education authorities and the universities should help to solve that problem in due course.</P>
    <P>Appeals work is only one aspect of planning.  There is so much more to be done on the more positive side of planning and development that I feel it desirable that all the inspectors available to me should be closely associated with that side of the work also.  I do not think it is feasible or desirable to have people who will merely specialise in dealing with appeals.  The present arrangements permit the best use to be made of the skills that are available. Unless the positive aspects of planning are developed further, we cannot hope to realise its benefits to any worthwhile extent.</P>
    <P>As I said already, most appeals are dealt with on the basis of written representations by the people concerned. When a case matures for decision, the relevant correspondence and plans are submitted to me, together with the report of my inspector.  The normal thing is that a person appealing submits the grounds for his appeal and states the reasons why he thinks the decision of the planning authority should have been in his favour.  The processing of the appeal consists of conveying the observations submitted by the appellant to the planning authority and obtaining their comments on these submissions.  That takes some time and when these local authority's comments have been received, the appellant, in turn, is given an opportunity of commenting on them.  Finally, the planning inspectors of my Department consider the case.  In most cases, where a negotiated settlement cannot be achieved, the papers are eventually referred to me.  It is necessary that I should have all the relevant documents so that I can give each appeal the fullest consideration.  Even those appeals where the issues are straightforward and simple&mdash;and there are relatively few of these &mdash; may be of great importance to the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1965-66, I received 1,344 appeals. Last year there were 1,229, and this year it looks as if the intake of appeals <Col N="1594" /> will rise to at least 1,600.  As I said, the work and responsibility associated with the deciding of this volume of appeals place a heavy burden on me, but one which I am not prepared to shirk in the way Deputy O'Donnell says he shirked it.  I am not prepared to sign my name on a line without looking at the details.  I do not do it; I have not done it; and I do not intend to do it.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if the work could be discharged more quickly if each case had to be considered by the type of appeal board proposed in this Bill. All these processes would have to be gone through and it would take as long, if not longer &mdash; personally, I think it would take longer.  Certainly I know there would be more people getting a rake-off on it.  There would be plenty of work for lawyers and technical personnel generally.</P>
    <P>This Bill envisages the setting up of a very considerable and costly organisation and I fear it would have nothing more than a disruptive influence on the whole planning process. It is not merely the temporary effects of a sudden and radical change in the established appeals procedures.  If improvements are warranted, and could be effected by this change, I would not object.  I am satisfied that the outcome of the changes would inevitably be to substitute a more complicated procedure for the existing arrangements where procedures are kept as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to consider objectively the effects of the proposed changes from the aspects of economy and expedition.  The appointment of a judge to decide appeals would be interpreted as a feature making for emphasis on legal considerations rather than on considerations of strictly planning concern.  It would so influence procedure that appellants might more and more feel compelled to employ lawyers as advocates.  I wonder do the promoters of this Bill really appreciate the effect this change might have on the man of slender or moderate means and the advantage which it would confer on the big company and the rich developer?  Is it that the Opposition have no interest in the man of slender means?  A great number <Col N="1595" /> of planning applications and appeals come from people of that class.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can afford to risk the loss of the great practical advantages of the system which enables any person, rich or poor, to make an appeal simply by writing a letter and which assures him that all relevant aspects of his case&mdash;legal, technical and administrative &mdash; will be examined objectively without further trouble or expense on his part.  Only the big developers and the lawyers are likely to benefit from the more legalistic procedure proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This grave disadvantage does not appear to me to be in any way offset by the proposal to have a judge as chairman of the appeal board, in fact, it is doubtful that there is any special merit in having a judge decide on planning issues.  On what basis is he to make his decisions?  A judge in court can follow well-established principles. His task is to apply the law to the cases which come before him.  Training, experience and forensic skill acquired in the course of his profession enable him to apply the law and, if necessary, to interpret the intention of the Legislature.  There is a vast corpus of precedent for his guidance.</P>
    <P>But where is the similarity in dealing with planning appeals?  Do the proposers of this Bill imagine that the chairman would simply have to interpret and apply some code of bye-laws? If he looks to the law for guidance, he will find it only on procedure and the things which he may or may not do. He will find that he is restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area in which the particular case has arisen, regard being had to the provisions of the development plan.  The question as to what is the proper planning and development of an area is one of policy rather than of law.  His assessors, no matter how highly qualified, can only offer their own opinions as to the proper planning and development of the area.</P>
    <P>In general, appeals can be decided only within a general policy framework. The only line of policy available to the board would be that of the planning authority.  If the board were to adopt this automatically as a proper <Col N="1596" /> criterion, there would be no point in considering any appeal.  If the board were to make their own policies they could not be sure that these policies would be implemented because the components of a development plan must be integrated with due regard to the inter-action of each part on the other.</P>
    <P>My objection to the type of appeals board proposed is one of principle. There are problems in dealing expeditiously with the present volume of appeals but I am convinced that the Bill would aggravate rather than relieve these problems.  I agree that there is room for improvement on this aspect but I have explained the difficulties so far as I am personally concerned. The deciding of all these appeals is a load I would like to be rid of.  I have also indicated some of the new problems this proposal would create.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said, I do not consider it necessary to deal with this Bill in greater detail.  Nevertheless, there are a couple of further points I should like to mention.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 7 proposes an amendment of the Appeals and References Regulations.  An addition is to be made to paragraph (2) of Article 2 and, although it is not so stated, I take it that it is intended for the end of sub-paragraph (a).  The intention appears to be that where an application for permission is refused, any person who has objection to the grant of permission shall be a party to any appeal. It is not quite clear to whom objection may have been made, but I presume that the intention is to give all the rights of a party to each person who lodged an objection with the planning authority while the application was under consideration.  In addition, it is proposed to give the same rights to any person who applies to the board and appears to the board to have a genuine interest in the appeal.</P>
    <P>I am not unsympathetic to this idea, but experience suggests that it would not be worth the trouble and delay which it would cause in dealing with appeals.  Each party is entitled to receive a copy of the appeal and to submit observations.  They are also entitled to see any document or information <Col N="1597" /> which any party is required by the Minister to submit.  They must be afforded an opportunity to make observations to the Minister on any considerations relating to the proper planning and development of the area which he proposes to take into account and which are matters other than those put before him by the parties to the appeal.  Any party to an appeal may request an oral hearing and seven days notice must be given to all the other parties if that request is withdrawn. Notice of the time and place of an oral hearing must be given to each party and each party has a right to be heard at the hearing.</P>
    <P>What happens is that a number of residents object to some development proposal in their neighbourhood.  If the planning authority turn it down and the developer appeals, the objectors are not regarded as parties to the appeal.  If the objectors submit their views to the Minister, he takes them into account.  Copies of their letters are given to the appellant in accordance with the regulations.  If the appellant requests an oral hearing, notice of the time and place of the hearing is given to the objectors.  They are invited to attend and to make a statement of their objections after the appellant and the planning authority have presented their cases.  If it appears to the Minister that the matter is of sufficient public interest, he usually directs that an oral hearing be held, even if the appellant or the planning authority have not requested it.</P>
    <P>This procedure is not unreasonable. If appeals are to be dealt with expeditiously there must be some limit to the copying of documents and the exchange of submissions, observations and counter-observations.  Cases involving oral hearing already tend to take longer to decide than those dealt with by correspondence.  It is undesirable that further complications in the procedure be introduced.  It is not unusual to have from 20 to 60 objectors&mdash;in one cases there were several hundred&mdash;all objecting independently. While it might be necessary to instruct an appeal board to have regard to the views of a body of interested residents, I can assure the House that no Minister <Col N="1598" /> needs such instruction.  The views of objectors are always given the most careful consideration even where they are not parties to an appeal.</P>
    <P>The other point which I want to mention is the requirement under section 8 that appeals shall be decided in the order of receipt.  This is qualified by the phrase &ldquo;so far as practicable&rdquo;. Without this qualification the effect of the section would be deplorable; with the qualification, I am satisfied that the section could have no effect whatsoever. A recent check in my Department showed that one-third of all the cases not yet sent for inspection were held up because the appellants had not submitted their full grounds of appeal or had requested that their appeal be held in abeyance.</P>
    <P>When the inspector is in an area, he normally tries to deal with all current cases in that area.  It would be inefficient to restrict him because there is an earlier case awaiting inspection in some other area.  When he reports, some of the latest cases may be straightforward and capable of being decided without further correspondence, but further information may be required on earlier ones.  Why hold up those cases which can be decided?</P>
    <P>There are many circumstances which make delays unavoidable.  An appellant may misunderstand the reasons for a refusal of permission and must be given time to make his case when the reasons are clarified.  The same applies if a new objection is raised in the course of the appeal.  Some cases raise policy issues which have to be worked out in detail; others can best be settled by finding an acceptable compromise.  Not infrequently, cases are almost ready for determination when the appellant requests an oral hearing.  As regards oral hearings, a frequent cause of delay is the difficulty of finding dates for hearings convenient to all the parties.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill would not in any way help to eliminate what has been the main source of delay in the past&mdash;insufficient skilled staff to keep up with a 50 per cent increase in appeals in 1964-65 and again in 1965-66. The measures which I have taken to clear the backlog have been showing <Col N="1599" /> good results and, while there is a further increase in the intake of appeals this year, a much better work flow is being maintained and I am confident that the position will improve further. The limiting factor in this regard is the necessity to follow a procedure which is fair and just to all concerned. In a great many cases delays are outside my control and in other cases, more often than not, are in the interests of appellants.  In general, I regard it as more desirable to find a solution acceptable to both appellant and planning authority or to allow an appellant every facility to make his case rather than to reject his appeal promptly.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the proposers of this Bill are anxious to ensure that the procedure for dealing with planning appeals is as just and fair as possible.  It may even be that from their own experience they have some appreciation of the difficulties which faced and still face my Department.  I am deeply concerned about both aspects, but, having considered these proposals, I am satisfied that they hold no promise of effecting improvements. I also feel certain that there is no special merit in appointing a judge to decide planning issues but that inevitably appeals would be dealt with in a more legalistic manner.  For these reasons I consider the Bill to be unacceptable in principle but that does not mean I am opposed to change in the present method.  I am arranging to have the whole question of how planning appeals could be dealt with re-examined.  There are some serious difficulties in proposing any new system.  One of these which I have already touched on is the need to make good the scarcity of skilled personnel. Time must elapse before the supply is adequate to meet the demand, and, in the meantime, we must husband our resources to secure the best possible return from their services.</P>
    <P>There are other difficulties also which I do not propose to go into now but if a reasonably satisfactory solution seems possible, I intend to put forward the necessary legislative proposals. The opportunity can also be taken to look again at the other provisions <Col N="1600" /> of the 1963 Act and to consider any changes or amendments which may be found desirable in the light of the experience which has been gained of the Act in operation.  This examination will take some little time but when it is carried out we should have reached a position where the regional studies at present in progress are completed and development plans have been made for the whole country.  We will then have a comprehensive picture of what has been achieved and a better idea of what is needed to secure the real benefits of planning and the modifications which should be made in the system.</P>
    <P>As I said the burden of deciding planning appeals at the present rate is very heavy.  There may be some Deputies who think that I am opposing this Bill because I am reluctant to allow appeals to be decided other than by a Minister of the Government or to lose some political advantage.  If so, it is time that they studied the Act and the Appeals and References Regulations. I can assure the House that, as far as I am concerned, I would be very pleased to get rid of this responsibility if I thought planning policy could be implemented in some other way.  I am just indicating some reasons why I consider it necessary to oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, the manner in which the debate has been conducted makes it necessary for me to deal with allegations made by those Deputies who have been allowed to speak so far.  I want, first of all, to point out that there is some element of profit for the individual making the proposal in, I am sure, every planning application made. Otherwise, it would not be made. There is provision made for the hearing of appeals and in any case in which an appeal is made there is a dispute as to the validity of the reasons given by the planning authority for making its decision.  I would say it is probably inevitable that some appeals would be successful.  Obviously then, in view of the fact that there is this big number of appeals submitted, these planning appeals offer great scope for any group of people who have decided as a deliberate policy to abandon any effort to remove the Government by the <Col N="1601" /> normal political tactics and to embark instead upon a deliberate and planned campaign of character assassination. I quite appreciate there is no field which offers better scope for that type of person, for the type of person who cannot carry out his political efforts in the normal way, who has long ago despaired&mdash;no matter how many new policies are drafted&mdash;of getting the support of the people on that basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who has come together with his colleagues in a particular political Party, has sat down and decided that the programme of drafting new policies has been unsuccessful and, therefore, we will go back to the type of campaign of slander and of character assassination which secured a very temporary success in 1948 when it was carried out and when it was not considered even too far to go to resort to open perjury.  Everybody who has a planning appeal decided in his favour gets some advantage from it.  Therefore, the type of individual who can descend to this kind of tactic has, of course, scope to pursue his disgusting occupation in regard to these appeals.  Some of these allegations have been made here and I propose to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, in all these cases there is a difference of opinion; otherwise presumably an appeal would not have been made.  The individual who has submitted the planning proposal has, generally speaking, got technical advice available to him and his technical advisers advise him that the proposal is not objectionable, and that if it has been turned down, the grounds on which it has been turned down are not sufficiently worthy to justify the rejection of this proposal to carry out the particular development.  As a result of that advice which he receives he appeals. On the other hand, the planning authority have technical advice available also and they have decided on the basis of that technical advice that the particular development should not be allowed.  However, that is not an unusual type of situation.  It is with the same type of situation, of contradictory <Col N="1602" /> advice being given to two parties, that the legal profession make their livelihood and in a legal case, both parties have presumably got the best technical advice that was available to them.  On the basis that their case was a justifiable one, they go to court and have it decided but it can only be decided in favour of one or the other.  It is similar with regard to planning appeals.  There is a dispute.  There is technical advice available to both sides and a decision can be in favour of only one side.  I have already expressed the opinion that in these planning matters there are two important principles involved, not just one as some people try to convey, as the people who have the sole access to the media of communication try to convey.  They try to convey that there is just the aspect that interests them and that nothing else matters, that the only relevant consideration is the amenity they enjoy from the undeveloped state of somebody else's property.  I assert that there are two considerations involved and I feel I should quote Article 43 of the Constitution.  Article 43, subsection 1, paragraph 1, reads:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2 reads:</P>
    <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what the Opposition have been trying to allege <Col N="1603" /> and contrary to what the Opposition newspapers have been trying to convey, as Minister for Local Government, I do not think the Planning Act supercedes the right to private property.  I think it delimits the exercise of those rights in order to provide that they will be reconciled with the exigencies of the common good.  I do not think it could do any more and that the fundamental right is a relevant consideration, but I also think that the exigencies of the common good is a very relevant consideration and that the question of the amenity that somebody else's property provides for the community as a whole is a relevant consideration, but where I disagree with these people is in their assertion that it is the only consideration.</P>
      <P>I do not think this.  Unlike these people, I think that the interests, let us say, of the smallholder in the west of Ireland in the use of his property is a relevant consideration.  They maintain it is not.  Well, that is where the difference of opinion comes in.  They maintain that the only consideration is the question of amenity for people who appreciate amenity.  I disagree with that. In effect, I believe that in dealing with these appeals, I am required to take into consideration these two principles, not just the one principle, and I insist on doing it while I am Minister for Local Government and while I am charged with the responsibility of deciding planning appeals.  I know that this offends these people: I cannot help it.  They will just have to continue to be offended.  I do not know that they have any particular justification for constituting themselves experts.  I do not know that the mere fact that a person has access to newspaper columns automatically makes him an expert on planning matters but apparently that is the position.  They presume that this accident makes them experts&mdash;so expert that they can decided these things without examining the case that is put forward but can decide purely and simply on the basis of their own instincts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose that is a very comfortable frame of mind to be able to have, but I am not like that.  I feel that I must examine the case put forward not only <Col N="1604" /> by the people who are interested in preventing a particular development but I also think&mdash;and this is what annoys them&mdash;that it is my duty to consider also the case put forward by the person who wants to carry out development. That apparently offends these people and in regard to particular cases which have been raised, it also offends the Opposition.  Before I conclude, I intend to put to the Opposition Parties some of the decisions that were made by an Opposition Deputy when he was Minister for Local Government and we will see whether people were offended by the decisions taken in those cases.</P>
    <P>I am expected not only to implement the planning objectives of the planning authorities but also to implement every single wish of every self-constituted expert who has access to any of the media of communication and who, as I said, exercises his God-given right to free speech, which is, of course, interpreted by him as being the right to put his own point of view at length and to exclude any other views whatever.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be better to give some examples of decisions made by Deputy O'Donnell or whether it would be better, first of all, to deal with some of the allegations that have been made in this particular debate.  Perhaps we will start by dealing with some of the allegations that were made.</P>
    <P>I take, first of all, one of the cases dealt with by my immediate predecessor. Deputy Treacy was here some time ago and was shocked that anybody should deal with cases that were dealt with by somebody else as Minister for Local Government. Apparently he was not aware that one of his colleague's contribution to this debate consisted in the main of a highly imaginative discourse with regard to an appeal which was decided by a former Minister for Local Government. Deputy Cluskey's contribution to the debate consisted largely of wild, general charges of corruption in high places, particularly in connection with decisions on many planning appeals.  When he was challenged to be more specific, he produced just two cases.  One of these dealt with a case <Col N="1605" /> decided by myself and the other case related to a decision made by my predecessor in regard to private housing development at Kilbarrack.</P>
    <P>There was no excuse whatever for the allegations made by Deputy Cluskey in this case.  They are completely without foundation and I am well aware that nobody knows better that they are completely without foundation than Deputy Cluskey and his colleagues in the Labour Party.  All the relevant facts in relation to this were fully and clearly placed before the Dáil by the previous Minister for Local Government when he replied to a question tabled by Deputy Cluskey on 6th May, 1965, and when he replied again on the Adjournment on that date.  Deputy Cluskey alleges that through collusion between the Minister for Local Government and Messrs. Gallagher and Company a private housing development was allowed on 129 acres which had been earmarked for corporation houses and that the builders are now offering back to the corporation 700 to 800 houses in the same area at a price calculated to give them a fat profit margin.</P>
    <P>The facts of this case are that in June, 1962, those builders applied to Dublin Corporation for general planning permission to develop approximately 95 acres at Kilbarrack for private housing.  In August, 1962, the corporation refused permission on the grounds that they intended to develop the general area for muncipal housing. There was an appeal against this decision and in the appeal it was represented to the Minister that the firm had bought the lands over a year previously with the intention of building about 1,000 low-cost houses there. It was represented that their houses would be similar to corporation houses and that they would cater for approximately the same class of people.  They intimated at that time that if the corporation so wished they were prepared to sell the houses to applicants chosen by the corporation.</P>
    <P>The appellants stated that they were in a position to proceed immediately with the development of the lands and so provide houses quickly, whereas it <Col N="1606" /> would be years before the corporation could undertake the development of the area.  That is something which was not in dispute.  I think Deputies on all sides of the House represent themselves as being interested in the main in the speedy provision of low-cost houses which will help to deal with the long list of people who are applicants for local authority houses.  The appellants indicated that they were prepared to conform to any general scheme of development which the corporation had in mind for the area as a whole and to bear their due share of the cost of providing facilities such as shops, open spaces, schools and, possibly, church sites.  In fact, the corporation produced a general sketch plan for the area as a whole and the appellants undertook to develop in accordance with this.</P>
    <P>The Minister was impressed by the arguments put forward in support of the appeal.  In particular, he was aware, and I think most Deputies who are in touch with the people were aware, that there was a substantial unsatisfied demand for private housing of the type they proposed to build&mdash;low-cost housing in which people who would otherwise have to depend on the corporation to house them would be interested. He was also influenced by the assurances that were given that the development of the land would be properly integrated with the overall development of the area along the exact lines intended by the corporation. Therefore, he granted the permission sought on the 7th May, 1963.</P>
    <P>In the following July, the corporation made a compulsory purchase order for all the lands in Kilbarrack affected by the muncipal housing reservation, including those lands in respect of which permission had been given in May, 1963.  This action prevented the development of the lands until the compulsory purchase order had been determined by the Minister. Several objections to the order were submitted and a lengthy public inquiry was held to consider them.  In the course of the inquiry it was argued forcibly on behalf of those builders that the lands should not have been included in the order as the issue as to whether they should be used for municipal <Col N="1607" /> or private housing had already been decided in the planning appeal in May, 1963.</P>
    <P>The Minister was satisfied that the arguments adduced in this regard were sound and accordingly he excluded the bulk of the lands from the operation of the compulsory purchase order.  In so far as the order related to those lands it was confirmed only in respect of one small, detached section which was needed to round-off an area which the corporation were authorised to acquire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey referred here to the crying need at the time for muncipal housing in the Kilbarrack area.  The position is that at that time the corporation were authorised to acquire a total area of 228 acres under the compulsory purchase order which the Minister confirmed in October, 1964, but despite the crying need for corporation housing in the area to which Deputy Cluskey referred housing in that area has not started yet.  It has not commenced yet although the compulsory purchase order was made in October, 1964.  On the other hand, development of the lands which were the subject of the planning appeal has been in progress since 1966 and as I said, it is for the same type of housing as the corporation intended to provide but have not got round to starting yet.  A large number of houses on the site excluded from the compulsory purchase order have already been completed and the entire scheme of approximately 900 houses will probably be finished in the present year.  I think there can be no question as to the need for the type of house being provided by the private developers.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Road Traffic Bill, 1966: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That section 59, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the consequences of section 59, as we now find it, should, I think, be reflected in the index to the statue.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and <Col N="1608" /> of his advisers to the effect of the repeal of section 88 of the Principal Act.  I think the repeal of that section by section 59 as we now find it is almost casual.  Lawyers and, indeed, others who have to have recourse to these Acts feel they should find the repeal of any section of the Principal Act referred to in the index to the repealing statute.  The index to the Bill, under section 59, simply says: &ldquo;Regulations for the general control of traffic and pedestrians.&rdquo;  Some reference, however casual, should be made to the fact that section 88 of the Principal Act is repealed by this section 59.  It would be wise and certainly it would be welcomed by legal practitioners and others if they could find a reference to the repeal of section 88 of the Principal Act in the index to section 59 of this Bill, when they scan through it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the repeal of section 88 of the Principal Act but I do so in a qualified sort of way.  I welcome it because the regulation-making authority under section 59 replaces the Commissioner of the Garda by the Minister.  Anything I say now is not a reflection upon the Commissioner of the Garda and his advisers, or anything like that.  However, this section is very wide in its general powers.  Subsection (2) points out that anything that subsection may provide is without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1).  That being so, the most widespread regulations may now be made by the Minister in place of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something to which I always took violent objection, in regard to the making of regulations of this nature by the Garda Commissioner, was that, of its nature, the Garda force is not interested in the economic effects which any regulations in regard to the control of traffic might have.  They conceived their duty, and rightly so, I think, as being confined mainly to making the streets safe for pedestrians and others and to making traffic move with ordinary expedition.  They proceeded on that basis.  Whether or not they proceeded under section 88 or section 89 of the old Act, I do not know, but if it was not possible for them to proceed under section 88, they <Col N="1609" /> proceeded under section 89: I am sorry steps were not taken to remove section 89 from the ambit of the Commissioner's powers.  The effect was that traffic regulations were generally of a nature which probably made traffic move faster, and maybe safer for pedestrians and others, but there were calamitous effects for street traders &mdash;large ratepayers and others&mdash;living in areas affected by these new regulations.</P>
    <P>Now that he has the power to make regulations, I hope the Minister will advert to the serious and, in some cases, crippling hardship which can be inflicted upon business firms in areas affected by traffic regulations.  In my constituency of Cork city, regulations of this nature, made under either section 88 or section 89, had calamitous effects on traders&mdash;very considerable traders such as those in McCurtain Street, Grand Parade, South Mall, Pembroke Street and Winthrop Street &mdash;but nothing could be done for them.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the powers of the Garda Commissioner in regard to the regulation of traffic generally, include the siting of bus stops.  Again, the same approach was taken by the Commissioner &mdash; the Commissioner, of course, being advised by the local Garda who did not advert to the social or economic consequences of the regulations they were making.  Lest the Minister be in any doubt about that, I may say I received a letter this week from the Chief Superintendent of the Garda in Cork regretting that, under the regulations, he felt it would be wrong for him to take into consideration the economic effects which any regulations he might make in regard to the siting of bus stops would have on traders, for instance, in South Mall and other streets in Cork.  I should like the Minister, under section 88 and section 89, to take power to deal with this matter.  I know that the section says that the Commissioner, having consulted with the local authority concerned, may make bye-laws for the regulation and control of traffic and pedestrians and to facilitate the movement of traffic and pedestrians.  The Commissioner, however, is under no obligation to take advice from the <Col N="1610" /> local authority.  My experience in Cork city is that that is so.  It is within the statute if he asks for their views.  He can then throw those views into the river or into any receptacle handy at the time and pay no further attention to them.  That has happened.  It is a bad thing; it is a dangerous thing.  It has given rise to many difficulties in my constituency of Cork City.</P>
    <P>I mention a bus stop there, as an example.  Particularly, I think section 88 would deal with this because it enables the Minister to make general rather than local regulations.  When the present regulations, made under section 88 of the old Act, are being replaced &mdash;I welcome most sincerely the Minister's amendment which provides for the revocation of these regulations&mdash; there should be a very direct indication to the Garda authorities generally, or to whoever is in charge of the siting of bus stops, things like pedestrian crossings, and so on, that no bus stop should be erected in close proximity to a pedestrian crossing.  Many death traps were created by that particular habit which seems to have been developed certainly by the Garda authorities in Cork city.  There is one at Infirmary Road and another at St. Luke's Cross in Cork.  Every public representative there has, from time to time, been approached with a view to having either the bus stop or the pedestrian crossing removed but nothing has happened in that regard.  Therefore, when the Minister comes to make regulations under section 88, I hope he will make a general regulation directing that the authorities throughout the country shall advert in particular to this dangerous and unfortunately popular habit of siting bus stops near pedestrian crossings. It is an exceedingly dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>In the same general way, the Minister should direct traffic authorities throughout the country that bus stops should not be sited in places where there is an unbroken white line in the middle of a narrow street.  The effects of that have been noticed quite often particularly at peak hours in Cork city, and particularly at Infirmary Road to which I directed the Minister's attention by way of Dáil Questions.  A bus <Col N="1611" /> stop is sited continuous to a pedestrian crossing and also in a narrow street where there is an unbroken white line in the middle of the street.  The effect is that when buses stop there at peak hours, traffic, right back the whole way, is stopped because it would have to go over the white line in order to pass the buses.  It is clumsy and unimaginative and it is very necessary that the Minister should give a general directive in this matter.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons why I welcome the Minister's assumption of powers in this matter where the Garda authorities had them before. Again, I want to make it quite clear that I am not pointing any finger of scorn at the Garda authorities but the Minister, as Minister responsible to this House, should advert more to general welfare than purely to the road traffic aspects of a matter like this.  There is no doubt that the operation of section 88, and certainly of section 89, of the Principal Act, is accompanied by immense hardship being suffered by people who feel they have no come back of any description against the authorities who are imposing these hardships on them, and imposing them quite sincerely in the belief that they are doing their duty and, in fact, the people in question are doing their duty at the time.</P>
    <P>For that reason, even at this stage&mdash; I hope I can stay within the rules of the House in saying this&mdash;perhaps the Minister would have another look at section 89 to see if he could do something about it.  It would be very important, if the Minister is going to allow these powers to reside with the Garda Commissioner, that there should not only be provision for the Garda Commissioner to consult with the local authorities but there should be some stronger word or words to give the local authorities some power in these matters.  I say that because it is only people like the local authorities who understand the difficulties involved for business people and people who want to shop in their areas.  I earnestly suggest to the Minister that he might have another look at these sections.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would indicate if he agrees with my suggestion that in the index to the Act <Col N="1612" /> there should be a definite indication that section 88 has been repealed.  In a general approach to legislation it is a bad thing that a section of any Act should be repealed in such a casual fashion as in subsection (4) of section 59.  This particular subsection should be held up to all draftsmen of all Departments as a particularly bad example of draftsmanship and an example which should not be followed under any circumstances in any future enactment of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might deal with some of Deputy Barrett's points first. I will look into the question of the index between now and Report Stage and if what he suggests can be done, I will arrange it.  With regard to the bye-laws made by the Commissioner of the Garda at present, the Minister must, of course, be advised of any views or representations that the local authorities make with regard to the bye-laws and these are considered very carefully before the Minister approves. With regard to section 89 of the 1961 Act, if Deputy Barrett will look at section 61 of the Bill he will see that under that section, which is an enabling section, power may be transferred to the local authority under that section.  It reads: &ldquo;The Minister may by order transfer to a specified road authority...&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the point that pedestrians should be required to wear reflectorised belts or armlets.  The section would appear to cover that and that type of regulation could be made.  This, however, is something in which a certain degree of success is being achieved by persuasion at present and this has been a major feature in a number of our safety campaigns and in television <Col N="1613" /> publicity.  On the previous day when we were discussing this Bill, Deputy de Valera made the point that those making the laws should have regard to the practical question of enforcing them and he pointed out that there were not sufficient gardaí to enforce existing bye-laws made by the Commissioner and now it was intended that these functions should be transferred to the Minister for Local Government who, as I pointed out myself, has not the responsibility for enforcing them.</P>
      <P>As I already stated in the course of this debate, I reject the suggestion that because we cannot ensure 100 per cent enforcement of the laws, we should do nothing about these problems which it is desirable to regulate.  I fully agree that we cannot ensure that every law passed will be 100 per cent observed and enforced, but we have to hope for some element of co-operation by the public.  We have to hope that the majority of people will decide that since the law is there, they will observe it.  For those who do not observe the law we have to depend on the degree of enforcement it is possible to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Deputy de Valera asked why it was proposed to transfer the power of the Commissioner to make general bye-laws for the general control of traffic and pedestrians to the Minister for Local Government.  Deputy Barrett gave some of the reasons why this is desirable.  The main reason is that in recent years, with the development of motor traffic, with the emergence of the new science of traffic engineering and the growth of international traffic involving harmonisation of the law in European countries&mdash;for example, the European Conference of Ministers for Transport propose to introduce a uniform system of rules of the road&mdash;the formulation of rules of the road must be regarded as a matter of high policy.  In all countries, so far as we can trace, the rules of the road are the responsibility of a Minister and of the Parliament of the country and, in view of this, it seems to be wrong in principle that bye-laws should be made by the Commissioner. The change proposed here will mean that the regulations made <Col N="1614" /> will be made under the usual scrutiny of the House and of the Seanad, as are the bye-laws at present.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, also, Deputy Tully asked if there were any proposals to make regulations to govern the driving of lorries in convoys on main roads going in and out of the city.  There is no immediate proposal to make such regulations but the power is there, under section 59 of the Bill, to do so if it is considered necessary.  The draft international Convention on Road Traffic, to which Ireland will probably adhere, includes provisions governing the driving of lorries in convoys and section 48 of the Bill makes it an offence to drive a vehicle without reasonable consideration for others.  So that, I think that problem can be effectively covered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to the emission of diesel fumes from vehicles. This is covered under the Road Traffic Construction and Use Regulations, 1963 which are made under the 1961 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Has he any power to deal with level crossings or is he taking any power in this Bill or am I in order in pursuing this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly is the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of a level crossing on a railway where there is a gate on the road and the people using the road must open the gate. This has been a source of accidents. Subsection (1) states that the Minister may make regulations for the general regulation and control of traffic and pedestrians in public places.  The roads that I am thinking of are used by the public.  When one communicates with CIE, the organisation concerned, they point out that the road in question is an accommodation road and that the public have not complete right on them. Accidents have occurred on these roads and questions have been asked in the Dáil about one in particular outside Castlerea which has given rise to quite a few accidents.  There are many other such crossings throughout the country and this could be an opportunity to try to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> I do not know whether you can deal with them by regulation under this section or not but there is a demand from the public in the Castlerea area that something should be done.  There are other such crossings in Roscommon and Mayo.  They are a source of danger.  If people using them must open the gate on the road and close it against the train, if the train happens to be coming through one has to scurry and some people are not able to scurry quickly enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions.  The Minister may not be able to answer the first question off the cuff.  I should like to know if there is a public right of way between the two sections of Dún Laoghaire Harbour which the train that goes to meet the mailboat crosses.  Some years ago CIE just locked the gates and closed this public right of way and I do not think they had any authority to do that.  I should like the Minister to tell me what their authority was.  He may not be able to answer this question off the cuff.  Alternatively, could he prevail on CIE to put in the Continental type of gates, if they do not want to have a man in charge of opening and closing them?  Inconvenience has been caused to many people by the closing of the gates.</P>
      <P>The second question might be directed to Deputy Cluskey, the Parliamentary representative on the Local Government Committee of the Council of Europe.  From country to country the rules governing right of way on roundabouts vary.  In some countries, as in this country, I understand, the person on the roundabout has the right of way, whereas in Italy and other countries the person coming on to the roundabout has the right of way and the person on the roundabout must yield.  Something should be done about getting internationally recognised regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is most important that in Europe all the rules of the road should be the same. In view of the experiments that have been carried out, we should seriously examine the question, in consultation, I suppose, with the United Kingdom, as to whether it would be advisable at <Col N="1616" /> this stage to revert to driving on the righthand side of the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Dr. Gibbons dealing with level crossings&mdash;the same answer will apply to the first question raised by Deputy Lemass&mdash; these matters are dealt with under railway statutes and, therefore, the question of level crossings would be a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power but before any change in the control system at a crossing is made the Department of Transport and Power does consult with the Department of Local Government with regard to safety aspects.  The actual control of these things is dealt with by statutes dealing with railways.  The Department of Local Government would, of course, be concerned with the provision of warning signs, and so on, with regard to level crossings but the control of the level crossings is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to ask the Minister what exactly he has in mind here because, candidly, on reading the section and even on reading the explanatory memorandum it is not too clear to me.  It is a proposal to transfer certain traffic functions to local authorities.  As to whether the transfer is to be from one local authority to another or from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to a local authority, I am not too clear. I should like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was intended mainly for the Dublin area <Col N="1617" /> but it was put in general terms in case the need might arise elsewhere.  It arose because of a report that was commissioned by An Foras Forbartha, known as the McGrath Report, which recommended the setting up by a Dublin Corporation of a separate traffic engineering section under a traffic director which would carry out all traffic functions for the Dublin area.  The report envisaged that the section would be subject to a traffic board which would include representatives of the corporation, county council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Garda authorities, through which all matters relating to traffic management in the Dublin area would be channelled.  No decision has been taken to do all this, but it is accepted that it may be best to have all traffic functions carried out by the road authority.  The section is purely an enabling section and an order under it will be made only if circumstances require and there is no certainty that they will.  In so far as the McGrath Report has been accepted by the City Manager, it is his intention to implement it in stages.  If an adequate organisation of this type were created by Dublin Corporation, all traffic functions in the city and county could be transferred to it.  There are obvious advantages in transferring traffic management from the Garda to a body using traffic engineers, especially when that body is also the road authority and the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the wish of the Minister and the administrator to have all power vested in traffic engineers, but that overlocks the equally important consideration that the public have the right to be consulted.  The indiscriminate application of engineering principles to road traffic problems often ignores the fact that human considerations ought to take precedence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some extraordinary decisions in relation to road traffic in Dublin in recent times, in regard to bus traffic, in regard to the location of bus stops and so on, which have caused severe personal hardship.  Several <Col N="1618" /> changes in road traffic have also caused serious financial loss to traders.  On many occasions legitimate interests which have been built up over the years have been destroyed overnight because of the application of some engineering conception.  That would be bad enough if the engineers were always right in what they did, but it also happens that sometimes the experts, the engineers, have recommended the application of some scheme or other which turns out to be worse than the difficult situation that they intended to cure, and in the application of the temporary scheme untold hardship is done to people not only in relation to personal convenience but also in relation to personal fortune.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, with a certain amount of reserve that one approaches a section such as this by which the Minister seeks to vest immense power in people who may, from an engineering point of view, appear to have the solution, but from the human point of view may be doing something which will cause untold hardship.  I should like to see more consideration of representations made by people who may be affected by traffic schemes, and I do hope that whatever power the Minister may seek to vest here in Dublin Corporation or any other local authority will not be exercised unless due attention is paid to the representations which may be made to them.</P>
    <P>At present we have the ludicrous position in relation to bus traffic that if representations are made to CIE, the answer is made by CIE that the Garda are responsible and not they.  If representations are made to the Garda, we are informed it is Dublin Corporation and CIE who are responsible.  If Dublin Corporation are consulted they push the blame on to CIE and the Garda.  The result of all this is that the ordinary members of the public feel that there is no organ available to them to express themselves.  On that account I would urge that a second look be taken at this section so that we do not vest power, without ultimate responsibility to the public, in any set of engineers or any set of experts.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Having heard the Minister's explanation <Col N="1619" /> of section 61, I find it difficult to know what was intended because what the Minister intends to do in this section, which he says is intended to apply only to Dublin city, but it might possibly in years to come to apply to the rest of the country, is to transfer the functions of the Commissioner of the Garda or of a local authority to a body or a road authority which does not yet exist.  The Minister says he has got from somebody or other a report which recommends the setting up of a road authority in Dublin consisting of various people, but distinct and apart from Dublin Corporation, and that he intends to transfer to that body the functions of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and Dublin Corporation and, I assume, Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>Since the board which he has in mind has not yet been set up, might it not be better to leave this section until such time as the board is brought into existence?  Under the section as it stands, it would be possible, in theory &mdash;I know it is unlikely to happen&mdash; to transfer the functions of Dublin Corporation to Leitrim County Council or transfer the functions of Kildare County Council to Dublin County Council.  If I understand the section properly, that could happen.  As the whole position regarding what is intended under this section is so very much in the air, I think it would be much better to forget about it until the road authorities which the Minister has in mind are set up.</P>

      <P>As I said, this is only an enabling section.  There is no decision made to do this at all.  Deputy Ryan says these decisions should not be taken by road engineers only.  At present they are made by the Garda authorities, and this provision would transfer these functions to the road authority which would be composed of other representatives of local authorities, where, I think, representation in regard to the effect of decisions on individuals would be likely to get more consideration, if anything, than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would not make an order transferring functions to a local <Col N="1620" /> authority without consulting the elected representatives.  I do not think there is anything to be afraid of in this.  As I said, no decision has been made to do it, but it seems that it may be desirable to do it at some time in the future.  I think this is a desirable power to have, to make this change, which is merely to transfer the functions from the Garda authorities to the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that any order made by the Minister setting up such an authority may contain such modifications of the Principal Act as are reasonably necessary for the purpose.  If ever there was latent legislation by regulation this is it.  Here we are for months on end discussing amendments to the Road Traffic Act of 1961, all of which can be negatived by some regulation which the Minister may make amending the whole of the 1961 Act.  One appreciates the Minister is limited by what is considered to be reasonably necessary, but if an engineer is able to produce anything which, from an engineering point of view, can be shown to be reasonably necessary, apparently the Minister will not be under any obligation to come back to the House to seek to amend the legislation.  I think that is too great power to give to the Minister, and I should like to see this subsection qualified.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> My objection to this enabling section, <Col N="1621" /> as the Minister calls it, and which it undoubtedly is, is that the whole thing is gloriously vague.  This is asking the House to give a blank cheque, to transfer a function which is now vested in the Commissioner of the Garda in Dublin or Monaghan County Council to a road authority which may come into existence in future.  That is going too far.  It is too much of a blank cheque.  If we knew the constitution of this proposed road authority, we might have no hesitation in giving the authority sought in this section, but we do not know its constitution.  We do not know whether the elected representative will have any control over it, or whether this House will have any control over it.  I am not happy, to say the least of it, about this section. Candidly, I admit that I did not understand it until the Minister explained it, and having heard the Minister, I do not think I can be blamed for not understanding it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is the section which provides for the removal, disposal and storage of vehicles which have been or appear to have been abandoned on a public road, or a car park, or have been parked in contravention of this Act or of a regulation, bye-law or rule thereunder. It is provided that regulations may be made which may, among other things, provide for the sale or disposal otherwise than by sale of the vehicles. The Minister may make regulations providing for the sale of vehicles and he may make regulations to provide for the disposal of the vehicles otherwise than by sale.  I presume that what is in mind here is that an abandoned vehicle may have no commercial value and that it would be impossible to sell it, but I am sure it is unlikely that it would not have any value.  Some safeguard should be written in there to provide that before the vehicle is disposed of otherwise than by sale, it should be offered for sale.  In other words, it should not be left to the discretion of some member of the Garda to say it is a heap of scrap and not worth anything, and that it can be thrown into the sea or something like that.  I should like to have some provision making it obligatory on the authorities to offer the vehicle for sale before disposal otherwise than by sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> I think there is some peculiar drafting in subsection (4).  When one comes across what appears to be a glaring mistake in a subsection, one wonders whether one is seeing correctly, because I am sure the parliamentary draftsman studied these things very closely before reducing them to print.  Subsection (4) is very desirable.  It provides for the giving of notice to the owner of a vehicle, if he can be ascertained, before the vehicle is sold, or for the retention of the vehicle for a reasonable time before disposal.  I can appreciate that there might be a case where it would be impossible to serve notice on the owner, that he might dump the vehicle there on his way to America, or on his way to the airport en route to America. It may not be possible to serve notice on him, but subsection (4) provides:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a vehicle removed under this section shall not be disposed of thereunder before the expiration of a period of six weeks from the date of the removal or two weeks after notice has been given in the prescribed manner, whichever is the longer.</P>
    <P>It is the last four words which puzzle me&mdash;&ldquo;whichever is the longer&rdquo;.  Surely six weeks is the longer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

Local authorities have difficulty in dealing with this problem and it is only right and proper that provision should be <Col N="1626" /> made in this measure for the removal of abandoned and unlawfully parked vehicles.  Abandoned cars have greatly detracted from the scenic beauty of a great part of our countryside.  Even our beaches have not escaped.  I notice in subsection (7) that a vehicle shall include a part of a vehicle or an article designed as a vehicle but not at the time of removal functioning as a vehicle.  Is the reference there to any part of a car or truck which may be dumped?  There will be authority under the section presumably to track down those responsible and have these dumped portions removed.  This provision will be welcomed by all local authorities.  It will be especially welcome to those interested in the Tidy Towns competition because the dumping of vehicles and parts of vehicles has constituted a great problem for these worthy people.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, support the Minister wholeheartedly in this.  A way must be found for the disposal of the great numbers of vehicles that have hitherto been indiscriminately dumped here, there and everywhere.  I should like the Minister to elaborate a little.

      <P>In page 34, line 41, after subsection (1) to insert the following subsection.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where an authorised person for the purposes of section 103 of the Principal Act finds a person and has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is committing or has committed an offence to which that section applies, the authorised person may demand of such person his name and address and, if such person refuses or fails to give his name and address or gives a name or address which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 63 of the Bill amends section 103 of the 1961 Act&mdash;which provides for the system commonly referred to as fines on-the-spot&mdash;so as to enable authorised persons to affix the prescribed notices to vehicles and to deliver such notices to persons alleged to be committing offences.  As things stand, authorised persons will have no power to demand the name and address of an alleged offender.  This could complicate the working of the system and cause an inordinate amount of paper work.  I feel, therefore, it is desirable that the power to demand the name and address of an alleged offender should be given to the authorised person.  Refusal to give one's name and address will be an offence.  It is not proposed that &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; should have any power of arrest.</P>

The only complaint I have to make in this respect is that we have not more wardens. Local authorities have power to appoint traffic wardens to do traffic regulation work.  Many local authorities avail of those persons for traffic duty.  They do an excellent job in ensuring safe crossing at dangerous junctions and in ensuring that children near schools, old people and the like, get safely across the streets.  The difficulty is that though the power to appoint them is conferred on local authorities, many local authorities are unable to do so because of lack of financial accommodation and the likely burden on the rates of paying these people.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with the powers of these authorised persons. <Col N="1629" /> I should like to be satisfied that this relates specifically to traffic wardens and others.  The appointment of traffic wardens or the authorised persons referred to here has something to recommend it in the sense that many people suggest that too much of the time of the gardaí is taken up doing trivial traffic duties of various kinds, including the sticking of dockets on windscreens involving on-the-spot-fines. People suggest that the gardaí would be better employed in following up crimes of a more serious nature.  There is a lot to be said, therefore, for conferring more powers on traffic wardens and leaving gardaí free to deal with more serious crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In order to deal with the section I have to deal briefly with section 103 of the Principal Act, the 1961 Act, which created the on-the-spot fines system.  As far as I know, that system of imposing fines on-the-spot and collecting them without going to court has been applied only to parking offences.  However, section 103 is much wider in its scope than that because it states that it shall apply to such offences under the Act as may be declared by the Minister by regulation to be offences to which the section applies.  Therefore, the Minister may by order apply the on-the-spot fines system to any person covered by the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 103 of the Principal Act went on to provide that any member of the Garda Síochána could fine a person committing an offence to which <Col N="1630" /> the section applied, could do the things specified in the section&mdash;broadly speaking, collect a fine or impose a fine by attaching a notice to the vehicle <i>et cetera.</i>  As I say, under the original section only members of the Garda Síochána who were trained police officers subject to strict discipline and supervision could operate this section.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in section 63 is to confer those self-same powers on authorised officers, who are to be appointed, I think, by virtue of this section 63.  It would appear in an indirect way from section 63 that these persons who are to act as authorised officers are to be appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. That would appear, from indirect inference, from the section.  They are, I think, a different category from the wardens who are appointed by local authorities to help children to go to school safely about whom Deputy Treacy speaks.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about handing over the power conferred by section 103 of the Principal Act on members of the Garda Síochána to these authorised officers.  I should like to know a lot more about the authorised officers than I do at this stage.  It is another case of giving a blank cheque.  Subsection (2) of section 63 says:</P>
    <P>The number of persons appointed by the Commissioner to be authorised persons for the purposes of section 103 of the Principal Act and the remuneration and other conditions of service of such persons shall be such as may be determined from time to time by the Minister for Justice with the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) goes on to provide that:</P>
    <P>Neither the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, nor the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, shall apply to the situation of an authorised person for the purposes of section 103 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not making charges that these people will be appointed on a political basis. Maybe they will, but I am concerned otherwise about it.  They will be appointed in a casual way.  Members <Col N="1631" /> of the Garda Síochána are recruited on the result of an examination conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners and their conditions of appointment are fixed and noted.  It would appear to me that these authorised officers will be appointed in a somewhat informal or casual way.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask whether they will be full-time permanent independent civil servants, enjoying, as long as complying with the regulations and their conditions of employment, fixity of tenure and independence.  I would hate to see powers given by section 103 of the Principal Act conferred on part-time officers who could be recruited and sacked at will.  I might fear that people who were employed on that basis might think that the more on-the-spot fines they collected and the more detections they made, the securer their employment would be.  I do not think that would be desirable.</P>
    <P>If these powers are to be given over to these authorised officers, the authorised officers should be recruited on the same basis as the Civil Service is recruited. The Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956 should apply to them and they should not be specifically excluded from those Acts as they are excluded by subsection (3) of section 63.  Before these officers, who as far as I know are of the warden type Deputy Treacy has in mind, are let loose on the city of Dublin or the country at large, they should undergo a course of training and instruction on how to deal with the public and how to enforce the powers conferred on them in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>They should be subjected to the same sort of discipline as that to which the Garda Síochána are subjected.  Perhaps these authorised officers are dealt with in some other section, but if this section 63 creates the office for the first time, it certainly does so in a very off-hand, roundabout and informal manner.</P>
    <P>I think I have made my position clear on this section.  I am against conferring these quite extensive and indeed unknown powers on people to be appointed in this way.  I say &ldquo;unknown <Col N="1632" /> powers&rdquo; because the Minister may decide at any time, in relief of the Garda Síochána for some other reason, to confer some other powers on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is not intended to give traffic wardens who operate children's crossings these powers.  These authorised persons might be called &ldquo;parking wardens&rdquo; and will be employed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, which is not the position in regard to traffic wardens who help children to cross the road.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the powers conferred under section 103, Deputy Fitzpatrick says there are wide powers conferred under this, but, in fact, there is now experience as to how this has operated and it has in fact been confined to offences of a parking type that are either committed or not committed and that do not rely on any element of proof.  I do not see how they could operate otherwise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that. In regard to subsection (3) of the section this is necessary because it is intended that the authorised persons will be appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda.  The provisions which are referred to in this subsection would require the appointment to be made by the Civil Service Commissioners by a competitive examination but it is desirable that they be appointed by the Garda Commissioner.  The only power these parking wardens will have will be to stick a notice on a car or hand a notice to the driver, having first asked for his name and address. Most people appreciate the need for something like this.  Deputy Treacy certainly does.  The growing volume of vehicles on the road is making everincreasing demands on the Garda whose duty it is to enforce the Road Traffic Act and the stage has been reached, having regard to the crime position, that the Garda, particularly in Dublin, are becoming short-staffed and <Col N="1633" /> scarcely able to cope with their primary task of preventing and detecting crime and preserving law and order.</P>
      <P>Much of the work of enforcing the Road Traffic Act, particularly in regard to parking, is of a very routine nature which could well be performed by persons other than gardaí who are highly and expertly trained in police duties proper.  When we were faced with the choice of expanding the strength of the Garda Síochána considerably or recruiting a special traffic service whose personnel would not be required to have the same physical standards or standard of police training as the gardaí, it was natural to opt for the solution we are suggesting here.  The Bill provides that it is only for this work of affixing notices on cars in respect of fines on-the-spot that these people will be appointed.  It is intended to employ them in Dublin initially and details of hours of work, level of remuneration and so on have not been worked out, but the idea is to employ them on a part-time basis concentrating on peak hours when parking is a definite problem.  It is possible that if the scheme is a success in Dublin it will be introduced in other cities and towns.</P>

      <P>I would be concerned that these authorised persons might go beyond their responsibilities and duties and feel their security depended upon the number of stickers they pasted on cars on any given day.  However, I presume they will be responsible people and will not have unbridled liberty of this kind and will exercise their power with due restraint and for the public good.</P>
      <P>It is very desirable that the gardaí as such should be relieved of this menial work.  However important it may be from a traffic point of view, it is menial work which the gardaí should not be engaged in when there are so many other more demanding duties to be performed.  Earlier, I referred to the increase in the incidence of crime.  The public are alarmed that we have a very serious incidence of knifing and thuggery and a situation in which little children and women are unable to go home at night safely.  The gardaí could be engaged in dealing with serious crime of this kind instead of putting stickers on motor cars, and I think the Minister is right if he can find a substitute by having these authorised persons.  I should hope that the idea will extend from Dublin to the country at large.</P>
      <P>I have said how desirable it is to have traffic wardens and mentioned the inability of many of our local authorities to provide them on account of the cost involved.  I understand there is provision in this measure for the payment of these authorised persons who would be appointed by the Garda Commissioner.  Naturally, there are many local authorities who are as concerned with traffic problems as Dublin or the bigger cities are.  The same problems of traffic congestion occur in smaller towns, the same bottle-necks and confusion and the same danger to life.  Therefore, we hope that the provision of these authorised persons, if agreed on, would extend to all the towns in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the anxiety of Deputy Fitzpatrick on the ground that these people are to be appointed at the discretion of the Garda Commissioner.  We have become accustomed to the appointment of persons in an allegedly fair <Col N="1635" /> and impartial way by the Civil Service Commissioners, by the establishment of appointments boards and by way of a proper examination, a test of merit and ability to fill the vacant post, and I would be concerned about conferring such wide powers on a Garda Commissioner that he would have the right to appoint people of this kind. We are also concerned to ascertain the conditions under which these people will work, their wages, hours of work and the duties they will perform. The Minister says their duties will be specifically confined to catching up on these people who are wrongly parked or have parked for too long, getting names and addresses and putting stickers on windscreens.  This would seem to be the limit of their duties and responsibilities.  I am making a comparison between them and the traffic wardens and I find invariably that the traffic wardens are rather elderly men or women, mainly in the pensioner class and mainly retired.  There are some, perhaps, not so old as to be on pension but they are disabled although still capable of carrying out a warden's duties.  Here the salary scales or wages paid are, perhaps, not the normal wages paid to an active adult person.</P>
    <P>I would like some clarification as to the kind of person who will be appointed, the hours of work and the salary scales which will apply.  I wonder why their appointment should not be left to the local authorities, who appoint very many types of workers such as clerk-typists, staff officers, truck drivers and labourers?  A fair and impartial method of appointment is operated under the County Management Acts.  I ask the Minister if it might not be more appropriate to leave the appointment of these persons to the local authorities rather than vest that power in one person, the Commissioner of the Garda.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This section and the discussion on it discloses an alarming state of affairs, which I do not believe is appreciated by Deputies.  We are creating here new police officers, or quasi-police officers, in a most off-hand way.  Most people <Col N="1636" /> reading this section for the first time would come to the conclusion that these authorised officers had already been in existence, that it was a post that had been long since established. Deputy Treacy thought they were traffic wardens.  I do not blame him. In fact, we are creating here a new police officer discharging police or quasi-police functions.  As I say, we are doing it in a most off-hand manner.</P>
      <P>I want to disagree completely and utterly with the Minister when he says that these people's business is going to be sticking notices on motor cars. Their functions are going to be to deal with such offences under the Road Traffic Act as the Minister may by regulation specify are to be dealt with by them.  They may be dealing with parking offences today and may be using the breathaliser in six months time.  They may be dealing with cases of careless or dangerous driving if the Minister so directs.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not against the enforcement of the parking laws; I am in favour of them.  I am not against the enforcement of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act of 1961.  I will support the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by this Bill, when it is enacted.  But I do not want to see these powers given to untrained persons who have no fixity of office and whose conditions of employment we do not know.  The method of recruiting and dismissing them is not stated.  I do not want to confer these powers on people who enjoy such terms of employment.  The Minister says that were it not for subsection (3) of this section, these people would have to be appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners as a result of a competitive examination.  What is wrong with that?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They should not be part-time.  It is utterly against them that they should be part-time.  They are to be recruited and sacked at will.  What is wrong with employing them as a result of a competitive examination?  The Minister says it is desirable that they should be <Col N="1637" /> appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda.  This is the first time the Commissioner has been asked to discharge such a function.  Why is it desirable that they should be appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda?  Has not the lowest paid typist in the Civil Service to be appointed as a result of an open competitive examination?  Is it not right that she should be so appointed?</P>
      <P>If these people are to be paid so little and are to be so unimportant as the method of employing and sacking them would indicate, then I do not want to have any hand, act or part in letting them loose on the citizens of this city or the people of any other town in Ireland.  Surely they are to have reasonable conditions of employment and are to be paid a decent salary?  If so, what is wrong with letting the ordinary procedure employed for recruitment to the Civil Service apply to them?  Is this the beginning of the end of the Civil Service Commissioners and of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act of 1956? If so, it will not go unnoticed as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister says they are part-time. I join with Deputy Treacy in saying that they should not be part-time. If in the city of Dublin, there are peak periods, valley periods and normal periods, they should be employed on a permanent basis.  If there is not full-time employment for them in this sphere of activity, they could be used in some other sphere which would be covered by their conditions of employment.  But let them be permanent.  Do not let them be recruited on a commercial basis, on the basis that they believe the more people they prosecute, the more stickers they get rid of and the more pounds they get in, the more popular they will be and the better chance they will have of being permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really feel very strongly on this that it is a most undesirable suggestion, brought in on this section in a casual, off-hand way.  I will certainly have down an amendment on Report Stage to provide that they be employed on a full-time and permanent basis and <Col N="1638" /> that they be recruited under the provisions of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act of the same year and I think that when the people realise what is being done here, they will be just as alarmed about it as I am.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Fitzpatrick is being very imaginative again if he sees in this, as he claims to see, the end of the method of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission of appointing people.  As I said earlier, the hours of work and so on have not yet been decided but it is obvious that these people will only be needed part-time. They will only be part-time employees. The effect of Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion to have them made permanent full-time employees would of course be to make the proposal impossible to operate because the question of financing this does arise.  This proposal seems to be almost the same thing as requiring, instead of these, the expansion of the Garda Síochána Force so that they could adequately carry out this work of enforcing parking regulations as well as their more fundamental work of controlling crime. Obviously these people will only be needed at peak hours and the general intention is to avail of people such as retired gardaí and so on for this work, similar to the system that exists in Britain and which works satisfactorily there.  Deputy Fitzpatrick professes to see at some future time these people dealing with breathalisers and offences such as dangerous driving.  I cannot understand how he can foresee any such thing happening because all it is proposed to do here is to amend section 103 of the Road Traffic Act which gives power to do nothing except serve these notices and the only additional&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only additional power I am asking for in the amendment is the power to request the name and address.  These people will not be enabled in any way to deal with these offences or any other offences, and even if a prosecution results from the affixing of one of these notices, the prosecution will be conducted by a garda officer and the parking warden, as we call him, will only be called as a witness in the case.  The only power this is giving is to serve notice and to request the name and address.  They are only needed for part-time work and there is no point in employing them on a full-time permanent basis.</P>

      <P>When I read this section of the Bill, I could see nothing wrong with it, but having listened before I came into the House on the address system in the Whip's Office and having listened to the debate here in the House, it appears to take on a different complexion altogether, because it appears that according to what section 63 says, the duties they will carry out are the same as those of a member of the Garda Síochána and you are going to put in &ldquo;or an authorised person&rdquo;.  If that is so, it means then that a traffic warden's duty is the same as a guard's.  If that is not so, I would like the Minister to point out to me where the distinction is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like if he could point out to me where the specific work of a traffic warden is referred to.  Even, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, the section of the parent Act does not specifically say that it must be only a warden's duty and the fact that these people are either going to be allowed to collect on-the-spot fines, or alternatively that the on-the-spot fine will disappear completely, does give them much wider powers than the Minister would have it appear to this House. I feel that there is a danger here in having a body appointed which the Minister refers to as part-timers.  We see quite a lot of that and we know how the traffic warden system operates in other countries, particularly in England. Why have they not been described specifically as either traffic or parking wardens?  Why has this other term <Col N="1640" />&ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; been given to them?  There must be some reason for that.</P>
    <P>I would not suggest, as some of my colleagues have done, that this is a job which should be done by the Local Appointments Commission, but I believe that there should be no suggestion whatever that we are going to have a selective body, selected by a political head of State, a political head who would pass on the information to the officer in charge, the Garda Commissioner, a list of people who might be appointed.  If the Minister says this cannot be done, I am sure he remembers hearing of&mdash;if he does not remember himself&mdash;the Broy Harriers.  Nobody will suggest that these part-timers could be anything like that but they could be selected people.  This could be the thin edge of the wedge to introduce a system which would not be that which would be desired in this country.</P>

Does this mean that only a certain type of people will be eligible?  He is not too clear on what their terms of appointment will be.  He has not mentioned, or maybe just mentioned in passing, that a decision has not yet been made on their conditions of employment, hours of work and wages. These are important things if people are to be employed to do a job.  The Minister says they are part-time.  What does he mean by that?</P>
      <P>We have part-timers in this country, pensioners who are doing part-time work and who are being paid with buttons.  I do not like to see the State starting off with part-timers to do important work, paying them with buttons and saying it is all right because they do not have to get much.  We will then finish up with an army of those people who feel that because they do not do very much, they were not supposed to do the job well because they were badly paid or alternatively, as has been pointed out by the two previous speakers, their jobs were determined on the number of stickers put on cars by them.  When I read this section first, I could find nothing wrong.  It was only when I compared it and listened to the arguments in this House, and particularly to what the Minister said, that I saw there was more in it than appeared from an ordinary reading.  I am quite reasonable and if the Minister says that it is simply and solely a question of appointing wardens to do what he said recently, just putting stickers on cars and nothing else, that is a different thing.  If they are to be authorised officers to do other things, then the system of appointment and everything else must come into the reckoning, and also how they are paid and what they are supposed to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read it.  Subsection (2) and subsection (3) are really the important sections, but I will read the whole section for Deputy Tully since he is unable to read it himself. Subsection (1) of section 103 is:</P>
      <P>This section applies to such offences under this Act as may be declared by the Minister by regulation to be offences to which this section applies.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with that aspect.  I have pointed out that this subsection only applies to parking offences.  The subsection which it is proposed to amend is subsection (2) which says:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;which is amended by adding &ldquo;or an authorised person&rdquo; and we continue&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>finds a person and has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is committing or has committed <Col N="1645" /> an offence to which this section applies, the member&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;we now add &ldquo;or authorised person&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>may deliver to such person a notice in the prescribed form stating&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that such person is alleged to have committed that offence,</P>
    <P>(b) that such person may, during a period of twenty-one days beginning on the date of the notice, make to a member of the Garda Síochána at a specified Garda Síochána station a payment of a prescribed amount accompanied by the notice,</P>
    <P>(c) that a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will not be instituted during the period specified in the notice, or, if the payment specified in the notice is made during that period, at all.</P>
    <P>That is subsection (2).  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;It is proposed to add to that &ldquo;or an authorised person&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>finds a mechanically propelled vehicle and has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence to which this section applies involving the use of the vehicle is being or has been committed, the member may affix to the vehicle a notice in the prescribed form stating&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that that offence is alleged to have been committed,</P>
    <P>(b) that a person liable to be prosecuted for the offence may, during a period of twenty-one days beginning on the date of the notice, make to a member of the Garda Síochána at a specified Garda Síochána station a payment of a prescribed amount accompanied by the notice,</P>
    <P>(c) that a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will not be instituted during the period specified in the notice, or, if the payment specified in the notice is made during that period, at all.</P>
    <P>Then, after subsection (7), there is subsection (8) which defines an &ldquo;authorised <Col N="1646" /> person&rdquo;.  The only thing he is authorised to do is to serve the notice on an individual or to affix the notice to a vehicle, except that, in the amendment I am proposing, I am also asking that he be empowered to request the name and address from the individual.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am glad we have got back to a more reasonable discussion of this section.  I want to say, and I propose to prove, that section 103 of the 1961 Act, as enacted, was never intended to be confined to parking offences and contains the machinery for extending it to a much wider range of offences.  In subsection (1) it applies &ldquo;to such offences under this Act as may be declared by the Minister by regulation to be offences to which the section applies&rdquo;. Therefore, even so far as the Garda Síochána are concerned, it may be that it applies only to parking offences today but it may be extended to a much wider range of offences to-morrow. Earlier, the Minister said that all these people would have to do would be to stick notices on motor cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In subsection (2), it is specifically stated:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;or, now, an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>finds a person and has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is committing or has committed an offence to which this section applies, the member may deliver to such person a notice in the prescribed form stating...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that that visualises the extension of this section to a wider range of offences.  It is all right for the Minister to say that this authorised officer is only going to deliver this notice or to stick it on a car and that the person can pay the fine and that the duties of the authorised officer end there.  The <Col N="1647" /> Minister did not go on to say, but I am sure we were meant to understand, that there was no obligation on the person to pay the fine if he did not want to do so and that he could go to court.</P>
    <P>In effect, we are here constituting this authorised officer a police officer because he or she is the person who is going to make the detection.  If the person who is accused says: &ldquo;I am not guilty of the offence&rdquo; and does not pay the fine within 21 days, or whatever it may be, and goes to court, the authorised officer will then come into court, as the expert witness, as the person who has made the detection, to give evidence to sustain the charge and that person has a very real interest in sustaining the charge.  Human nature being just exactly as weak as human nature is, that person&mdash;the authorised officer&mdash;will be very concerned to get a conviction.  He or she might feel that if the case is dismissed, it is a reflection on him or her.  He or she is employed only on a part-time basis with his or her employment coming up for renewal.  He or she might think that, if the charge was not sustained, it might be a reflection on him or on her.  Is that not a dangerous road on which we are setting out? Is it not necessary that the persons upon whom we are conferring these powers should be people who have training in this type of police work, that they should enjoy public confidence, that they should be recruited as civil servants are recruited, even those in the lowest grades of the Civil Service?  Is it not necessary that they should have what I would call fixity of tenure, for want of a better word?  Is it not necessary that they will not be afraid of being sacked?  Is it not necessary that they will not be very concerned always to come down on the side of their employer, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&mdash;in reality, the Minister&mdash; to ensure that their employment is continued? I put it seriously to the House that that is a dangerous set-up and that we are embarking on an undesirable innovation.</P>
    <P>We can experiment, as we have done with the ban-ghardaí.  We can appoint a small number in the city of Dublin, <Col N="1648" /> see how they work out, make them full-time.  Indeed, there are other duties, I am sure, which the Garda Síochána do at the moment that could perhaps be entrusted to them if they were properly recruited and properly trained.  There is quite a major principle involved here, something that goes far outside the bounds of this section we are discussing.  I hope the discussion in this House has done something to ventilate it.  I hope there will be second thoughts about it and that the matter will be further considered.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>(3) Neither the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, nor the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, shall apply to the situation of an authorised person for the purposes of section 103 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells me, as his explanation for inserting that subsection, that, if it were not there, these people would have to be recruited by open competitive examination by the Civil Service Commissioners.  What is wrong with that?  In the next breath, the Minister tells me that these will be part-time officials.  I cannot be expected, as a part-time politician, to have all the contents of the various Acts of Parliament at the tips of my fingers, but I have a feeling that the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, does not apply to part-time officials who are recruited only in a casual manner for a short time.  I am not certain about that, but I have a feeling that, for example, officers in the Department of Agriculture who are employed for short periods are not required to be recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners. If I am right in that, it means that the people who drafted this subsection must have had in mind the employment of people who would, in the ordinary course of events, be subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956: in other words full-time full-blown, permanent officers.  If that is so, why are we excluding them from the provisions of this?  The deeper we probe into this, the more mysterious, if not sinister, the suggestion becomes. <Col N="1649" /> I should like to know if the Civil Service Commissioners Act applies to part-time officers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that unless this provision is in, the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956, will apply to these persons.  These Acts deal with the recruitment, appointment, control, conditions of service, etc., of civil servants and other public employees.  They provide for recruitment by means of competitive examinations arranged by the Civil Service Commissioners, for general control by the Minister for Finance, for conditions and salaries, dismissal, and so on.  As I pointed out, it is intended that these new authorised persons here will probably come to be described as parking wardens and will be part-time employees because they need to operate only part-time. It is provided that they be appointed by the Garda Commissioner and they will be under the control of the Garda Commissioner.  Since their remuneration and conditions of service will be fixed by the Minister for Justice, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, the application of the 1956 Acts to these persons would be superfluous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that if we could contemplate dealing with these parking regulations by the method suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Tully, which is, in effect, by expanding the Garda Síochána to such an extent as to make it possible for them to do it, then I suppose we would do it, but the Garda Síochána at their present strength are just barely able <Col N="1650" /> to deal with their more fundamental duties.  As I said already, this type of duty is purely routine and does not call for the same standard of training.  They will be required mainly during peak hours.  It is reasonable that we here should deal with this matter in an economic way just as it is dealt with in England under a Labour Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as Minister for Local Government, has the job of putting this Bill through the House.  He has no more responsibility. <Col N="1652" /> The Department of Justice will be dealing with it from that out and all I am asking is this: would the Minister agree to have another look at it, and as it is the thing now for Ministers and the Government to change their minds&mdash;and I agree that that is a good thing when they find they are making mistakes&mdash;and see if it is necessary to say in the section what those people are going to be and to say whether or not they are to be people appointed in such a way that they will not all be pensioners?  It does appear that this is being set up for a particular class.  I have no objection at all to pensioners, if they are able to do the job, getting that job, but I hate to see them preyed on by employers, particularly the State, who love to get these people who, because of their miserly pensions, can do with a few, a very few, extra shillings.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying that we are trying to see that the guards will be taken off detection work and put on to matters such as the parking of cars. That is all nonsense and the Minister on reflection will see that.  We are as anxious as he is to see the matter dealt with sensibly, and indeed more anxious than he, and we are asking him to be reasonable about this.  We do not want people who are not trained to do this type of work dumped out and given authority, particularly if their appointment is a political one.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sorry to have to get up on section 63 again.  Subsection (3) proposes to exclude from the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956, the appointments which are to be made here.  When I first raised that I was told that the reason was that the Minister did not want to make the appointments subject to those Acts.  I then accused the Minister of creating permanent appointments and excluding them from those Acts enacted by the Oireachtas for making appointments. The Minister then told me that these were part-time people that he was appointing.  On further consideration, I asserted that the Acts I referred to did not apply to part-time appointments and I asked the Minister to deal with that and to clarify the position. I asserted that the Acts did not apply <Col N="1654" /> to part-time appointments.  The Minister has not contradicted that and I am asserting it now as a fact, but if the Minister genuinely intends to appoint part-time authorised officers, which would be a most undesirable thing, it would not be necessary for him to put in subsection (3), because the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 would not operate.  It is obvious that what the Minister has in mind is to appoint full-time, permanent, whole-time officials, to exclude the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 from their appointment and I now assert that it is, in fact, what I thought it was, the thin end of the wedge to abolish the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, in the making of public appointments of a permanent nature in this country. Nothing could be more obvious.</P>

The Minister is annoyed because he has been caught out in creating this new police force in this off-hand manner, buried away in section 63 of this Bill and about four or five lines in the explanatory memorandum. We are not to have them subject to the Civil Service Commissioners. I do not speak of the Local Appointments Commission, which is a totally different body from the Civil Service Commissioners who recruit the Garda Síochána, who recruit the typists in the Civil Service, who recruit all the grades of the Civil Service, no matter how low or how high.  I am against that and I want to assert now that that is what it is proposed to do.  It is the first time, I venture to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think I am not going too far when I say that that is what is being done here.  We are in this subsection excluding from the provisions of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act of the same year a category of employees who, were it not for this subsection, would be brought within it. That demands an explanation and I do not think I can be accused of going too far if I say that, either intentionally or otherwise, the thin end of the wedge is being driven into these Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am asserting, as a matter of fact, that this is the first time that we have had this type of provision put into an Act and if we have it put into this Bill today, there is no reason why it would not be put into another Act to-morrow and the section which we are dealing with now held up to this House as a precedent for it.  I am certainly going to put down a formal amendment on Report Stage to delete subsection (3) and put it into the section in reverse, lest there be any doubt about it, and to say that the provisions of these Acts shall apply to the appointments.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána should be burdened or embarrassed, as embarrassed he would be, by the power that is being thrust on him by this section.  It is even worse, I think, for the Commissioner of the Garda to be asked to do it than for the Minister to be given this power because, at least, we could discuss the Minister's activities on the Estimate for his Department.  We cannot discuss the appointments which might be made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on the suggestion of the Minister or one of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of this section, read in</P>
      <P>Neither the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 nor the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, shall apply to the situation of an authorised person for the purposes of section 103 of the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have established, I think, beyond all doubt that but for that section these appointments would be subject to these Acts and that only permanent, whole-time <Col N="1657" /> appointments are subject to these Acts.  Therefore, what we are doing, in this instance at any rate, is to by-pass those Acts which were established for the purpose of appointing civil servants and such employees so that the public in general would have confidence in the method of appointment, so that the public in general would not think that people got these jobs for political reasons or other unsavoury reasons, and so that the public would be satisfied, as they are satisfied, that the Civil Service Commissioners employ the best people as a result of open competitive examination.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that these people are going to cost so little, would he mind telling us&mdash;and I am sure he has given it some thought&mdash;what he proposes to pay them?  Has he any ideas about that?  Does he propose to pay them by the week or by the hour or by the year?  Are they to be appointed by the week or by the hour or by the year?  I think all these things are very material, very material in view of what has come to light as a result of this discussion.</P>
    <P>I am candid enough to admit that when I read this section first I thought these authorised officers had already been appointed or there was some machinery for appointing them before, because they are just casually referred to as authorised officers as if we knew them all our lives, as if we had been dealing with them since the Road Traffic Act of 1961 came into operation. As a result of the discussion here tonight we find we are creating them for the first time and in spite of the method by which they are being created, these people will detect offences and will go to court and prosecute these offences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that these <Col N="1658" /> people would not be full-time employees, that they would be part-time employees.  I can do no more than state it again.  Deputy Fitzpatrick does not believe it or pretends not to believe it.  The Civil Service Commissioners Act of 1956 which deals with the method of appointing civil servants does not necessarily appear to be excluded from applying to part-time employees.  The other Act, that is, the Civil Service Regulation Act which it is intended to provide should not apply is not required because of subsection (2) of section 63 which will apply instead of it.  This Act is a fairly long Act dealing in detail with such matters as retirement, suspension, absence from duty, <i>et cetera,</i> and all these things are not applicable to the kind of job envisaged under this section. As I said, if this could be dealt with and if work could be found on a full-time basis for the people it is proposed to appoint, then that method would be adopted, but this problem is such that it is considered necessary to have such people to deal with it only at peak hours.  Only part-time people are required, and that is all it is intended to employ.</P>

    <P>Under section 17 of the 1961 Act expenses incurred by a road authority in repairing damage caused to a road by extraordinary traffic are recoverable from the person by whom or on whose order the traffic was conducted as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Section 17 is substantially a re-enactment of the Public Roads (Ireland) Act, 1911. By virtue of the Courts (Supplemental) Provisions Act 1965, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in relation to claims under the 1911 Act was exercisable, at the election of the plaintiff, that is, the road authority, by the judge of the circuit where the damage was done or the judge of the circuit where the defendant or one of the defendants resides or carries on business.  I am advised that when section 17 of the Road Traffic Act of 1961 became law the words &ldquo;recoverable as a simple contract debt&rdquo; could operate to preclude a road authority from electing to have a claim dealt with by the judge of the circuit where the damage was done.  This was not intended, and this amendment is designed to restore the position as to the venue of trial which existed prior to the passing of section 17 of the 1961 Act.</P>

    <P>Section 52 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, deals with careless driving and section 53 deals with dangerous driving.  I think that a second or subsequent offence under section 53, dealing with dangerous driving, carried a consequential disqualification but that any number of convictions for careless <Col N="1663" /> driving did not carry a consequential disqualification which, of course, is a very heavy penalty.  The White Paper says that we have introduced in the Bill a new offence of careless driving. With all respect, I do not think we have, because the marginal note to section 52 of the 1961 Act describes the offence created by that section as careless driving.</P>
    <P>It is not the easiest thing in the world to follow the amendments made to the Road Traffic Act, 1961, by this Schedule.  I want to ask the Minister if I am correct in this view.  I think the object or the effect of the amendment to section 36 of the 1961 Act is to provide for a consequential disqualification in the case of careless driving.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> My views about the new statutory offence are known and now I want to deal with this new offence of careless driving created under section 49.  The Minister has stated and the White Paper has stated that it is a more serious offence than the old offence of careless driving.  I do not agree with that because section 52 of the old Act provided:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the place.</P>
      <P>The new section provides:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention.</P>
      <P>It could be argued that the wording of section 52 of the old Act is stronger. To put a person off the road for 12 months for a second offence under this new provision would be, in my opinion, a very serious matter.  A lorry driver, for example, might be guilty of a slight error of judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Section 49 provides:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive a vehicle in a public place without due care or attention.</P>
      <P>It would be a matter of luck, I think, as to which of those sections a person would be charged under; it would depend on the superintendent directing the prosecution.  Candidly, I should not like to be the superintendent who would have to decide under which section the charge should lie.  A reasonable superintendent would differentiate, though he would have difficulty in doing it; if you had another type of superintendent, he might say: &ldquo;The heck with it.  I will throw section 49 at them and let the court make up its mind.&rdquo;  Then the district justice would be in difficulty trying to decide which section the facts of the particular case fitted.  What I am really concerned about is that someone guilty of a minor error of judgement could be convicted twice under section 49 and, if he is, his licence goes for 12 months.  Am I right in thinking the Minister dropped the provision enabling him to restore licences?</P>

If there is serious injury, it is an indictable offence and he goes to the Circuit Court.  It is only if he commits a second offence that his licence goes.  Now we are creating a lesser offence and imposing exactly the same penalties as those imposed for dangerous driving.  That is going too far.  It could work an injustice. Discretion could be left to the district justice.  We will drive district justices into falling back on section 48 <Col N="1668" /> in cases in which they see an injustice will be done.
