      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will arrange that school transport in the Glencar area of County Sligo will collect children at 9 a.m. to take them to Manorhamilton schools instead of collecting them as at present at 8.10 a.m. for the opening of the schools at 9.30 a.m., as these children have to begin preparation for school at 7 a.m.; and if he will have steps taken to reroute the bus via Glencar Catholic Church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the school bus operating this route is at present required to do a second run to bring further post-primary pupils to Manorhamilton; hence the reason for the early start.  This position obtains in many parts of the country.  Improvements to the services in the areas concerned will be made as additional buses become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the suggested rerouting, I am advised that portion of the road involved is not suitable for large buses. Furthermore, the present route provides a reasonably convenient service <Col N="725" /> for the majority of pupils using it, since no pupil has more than two miles to walk to a pick-up point.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Higher Education has published in its Presentation and Summary Report and in the first volume of its main Report an estimate that the numbers <Col N="726" /> of students in Irish universities will rise from 13,000 in 1964-65 to 23,000 in 1975.  It is clear that, if a demand of this magnitude is to be met, our facilities for university education both in Dublin and outside of it will have to be expanded.</P>
      <P>Pending publication and consideration of the second volume of the Commission's Report, it will not be possible to announce final decisions as to future policy in this regard.  In the meantime, however, certain developments are taking place at University College, Cork, of which the most important is the provision of a new building for Physics, Chemistry and Mathematical Sciences now in course of construction at an estimated cost of £1,600,000; while at University College, Galway, the provision of a new building for Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry to cost £1,750,000 has been sanctioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.  In these cases provision is already made in the superannuation schemes for national and secondary teachers for the recognition for pension purposes of periods of interruption of teaching service.  In the case of vocational teachers there is an arrangement for the retention in the service in certain circumstances of teachers with national service after they have reached the normal retiring age of 65 years. <Col N="727" /> This is in lieu of granting them pensionable credit for that service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I consider that the existing provisions are adequate.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply given on 13th February, 1968, to a question from Deputy Boylan regarding the university scholarship scheme of Kildare County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the time limit by which these schemes must be prepared is running out and that no reply whatever has been received by Meath County Council from the Department of Education about this very important matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say why Meath County Council are not being allowed to use up money which they are prepared to use for the purpose of university scholarships and why the Department will not give a reply to the letters which have been written to them by Meath County Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have no details of correspondence that has passed between the Department and Meath County Council, but I take it that the instruction given last October to local authorities was given also to Meath County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make it awkward for the Taoiseach, knowing the situation he is in at present, but surely if Meath County Council submit a scheme to the Department as requested by them and ask for <Col N="728" /> sanction, it is not too much to ask the Department of Education to say that they are or are not sanctioning that scheme, and so far they have not done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether legislation would be required for approval of a new scheme, but no time is lost on the part of Meath County Council if they have submitted a scheme which conforms to the basis which was in operation up to October, 1967.  There may be some problem, but I do not see any offhand.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the schools transport services is that they are organised for a specific purpose.  In many instances the vehicles used are licensed only to carry school children.  Furthermore, the capacity of the vehicles is geared very closely to the number of children eligible for transport.  In fact, until more vehicles are available, many of the existing ones will be required to make double journeys.</P>

      <P>An application for sanction to the acceptance of a tender for the supply of traffic light signals at two locations in Drogheda was received in my Department from Drogheda Corporation on 13th November last.  Discussions between the Department's engineering inspector for the area and officers of the corporation were necessary on a number of technical points in relation to the proposed signals.  Approval has now been issued to the acceptance of the tender in so far as the installation at the junction of West Street and Dominick Street is concerned.  In the case of the junction of Dublin Road, Marsh Road and James Street some experimentation is considered necessary before it could be accepted that the proposed signals would solve the difficult turning problems at this junction.  The corporation have been requested to undertake this experiment.</P>

      <P>The Post Office Savings Bank rate is a stable rate fixed by legislation and does not vary up and down with the commercial banks' <Col N="738" /> deposit rate.  Depositors in the Post Office are thus assured of a fixed rate which will not be affected by market variations.  This arrangement has in general worked to the advantage of these depositors as over the years, apart from a short period in 1966 and the present time, the Post Office rate has always been higher than that paid by the banks.  I am, however, watching the situation and should it appear that interest rates are likely to continue for a long period at the present high level I will consider what measures may be necessary to improve the relative position of depositors in the Post Office.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Post Office is the bank used by small depositors?  The present rate is 3½ per cent as against 4¼ per cent in the banks.  Surely he will agree that it is unfair to ask small depositors to invest their money in State enterprises at three-quarter per cent less than the rate of the commercial banks, taking into account that the Post Office savings rate usually exceeded the bank rate by about one per cent?</P>

      <P>I assume that by &ldquo;vandalism&rdquo;, the Deputy means malicious damage to property.  This, of course, can take many forms, ranging from trivial damage by youngsters to major damage costing a great deal of money.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that they have no reason to believe that there is any appreciable increase in such offences in recent years and that it is quite clear that the number of serious offences of this kind has actually declined, the figures for last year being 18 per cent lower than in the preceding year.</P>
      <P>The less serious incidents of malicious damage are, however, particularly difficult to detect, except where members of the public are able and willing to come forward with information, and even a substantial increase in Garda strength would be unlikely to make very much difference in these cases.</P>
      <P>As far as the more serious&mdash;that is to say, indictable&mdash;offences of malicious damage are concerned, the number was, as I have said, down last year by 18 per cent, from 192 to 157.  Furthermore, the already high detection rate of 70 per cent went up to 73 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the severe hardship caused in many cases by the delay in payment of unemployment assistance, as applicants have to wait from three to six weeks during which time they have no income; and if he will take immediate steps to remedy this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Procedures in relation to unemployment assistance applications are designed to ensure as far as possible that delay in payment, which is made weekly, is minimal.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant is already the holder of a qualification certificate&mdash; possession of which is essential to the receipt of unemployment assistance&mdash; he should normally receive his first payment within a fortnight, even in those cases where the application is dealt with through the post owing to the person's distance from his local office.  In these postal cases, however, delay may arise where it becomes necessary to return essential forms to the applicant for proper completion.</P>
      <P>Where the applicant has not got a qualification certificate, the examination of means necessary to settle entitlement will usually, and unavoidably, prolong the period normally required for issue of the first payment. In these cases payment accrues, where appropriate, from the date of application. If there is hardship while first payment is awaited it is open to the applicant to seek home assistance, any payment of which may be recovered from any arrears of unemployment assistance subsequently payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> I would like to add that my Department has always emphasised the advantages of making application for a qualification certificate in good time and points out in its publicity that application may be made even while a person is in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, no matter how the regulations are designed to ensure benefit to the applicant, in many cases, not only in Cork but throughout the country, public representatives on all sides of the House are familiar with complaints of hardship caused by a strict interpretation of the regulations whereby families are left hungry for weeks having to go from the home assistance officer to the St. Vincent de Paul Society and from there to their public representative to try to get subsistence to live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that is general.  I am sure there are cases of that kind, usually due to some very good reason, where the application is not straightforward or a mistake has occurred.  The Deputy may be talking about persons making their original application for a qualification certificate.  This is a different thing and, as the reply indicates, must entail a certain amount of delay.  But we emphasise that persons, even while in employment, can apply for qualification certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of this discussion, perhaps the Minister would inform the House if it appears to him, as it appears to me, to be a simple issue to have this matter simplified in the applicant's favour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had to go through a lot of these complaints, as I have, he would invariably find some definite reason why it is just not possible to have it paid in a straightforward way in a fortnight's time.  Very often it is a question of correspondence back and forth in respect of applications requiring further information.</P>

I had reminded the House that the primary purpose of an election was to produce a Government that could govern, and that the secondary purpose was to elect an effective Opposition that could be an alternative Government, that the PR system and the multi-seat system of election had failed to do just this, that there was only one really effective system of Government and Opposition, or Government and alternative Government, and that was one which would give a two-Party system, that we had reached such a state of political stagnation here in the past 40 years that there was, in effect, at the moment. no real alternative to the Fianna Fáil Party, and that this is certainly not the fault of the present Government who are merely doing what any Party would do to win elections and try to remain in power.</P>
      <P>I said the present multi-seat system was such that it just was not possible for an Opposition Party to build itself into a strong position to take over, that the Government have been in office for so long now that they will soon deem it to be their right to be there, and that the Opposition have been so long in Opposition that they have lost the urge to rule, and lost the will to fight.  I made the case that this was wrong and that we should make a change in the present system which brought this about, and that it was our duty to do so.  I rejected the suggestion that this Bill was designed by Fianna Fáil to wipe out the Labour Party or that it would do that.  I rejected the suggestion that Fine Gael had any altruistic motives for worrying about the Labour Party, or that they were interested in protecting the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rejected the suggestion that they were in any way concerned about the future of the Labour Party as such. They were merely making friendly noises in the hope of codding the Labour Party into a coalition at some future date.  Deputy Dillon finished his speech by inviting them to do just this.  I rejected the suggestion that <Col N="747" /> those who like Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy O. J. Flanagan and myself were convinced of the superiority of the single-seat constituency were power mad or bore any resemblance to the South American dictators.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that, much as I should like to remain in politics and in public life, I was not motivated by self-interest in resigning from the Labour Party and placing my political head in jeopardy, and that when it came to deciding on the Bill before the House, I would try to be motivated by the same selfless ideals which persuaded me on that occasion that I was right in resigning from the Labour Party of which I was a member, and taking a stand as an Independent, and that I would try to judge these amendments entirely on their merits and not be influenced by personal considerations.</P>
    <P>I have already informed the public by means of a press statement that I intend on the Committee Stage of this Bill to move an amendment.  The purpose of this amendment would be to give effect to the single-seat constituency and the single transferable vote. The amendment will read as follows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>I feel that the Deputy should not go into the details of his amendment.  He may refer to it, but we cannot discuss it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. The purpose of this amendment would be to give us the single-seat constituency and the single transferable vote. In other words, it would give us the benefit of the best of both systems: PR, which appeals to some people in this House, and the single-seat constituency, which appeals to the Government and to myself and many other Deputies. With this, I feel, we will be getting the best of both systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that many Deputies really believe that the multi-seat constituency is desirable in itself.  The disadvantages are well known and have already been discussed here in great detail.  In the big multi-seat constituencies, the area involved is too large and it is almost impossible for a Deputy to visit all parts of it and meet his <Col N="748" /> constituents frequently.  It is very difficult for the constituents to meet their Deputy.  It places undue strain on a Deputy who conscientiously tries to fulfil all that is expected of him by his constituents.  In this regard it is well to remember that we have had seven deaths so far in the present Dáil and out of a membership of 144 in a period of less than three years, this represents an unduly high casualty rate.</P>
    <P>The multi-seat constituency is also very inefficient in itself.  Not infrequently three or four members make representations to a Department on behalf of the same person or attend at the same Department with the same local deputation or ask the same question about the same parish pump.  Not infrequently three or four Deputies attend the same meeting in a constituency about the same local matter. This obviously greatly adds to the amount of work involved not only for the Deputies themselves but also for the officials concerned whether Departmental or local authority, and it also adds to the cost.</P>
    <P>Under the present multi-seat system, we are not getting the best possible people available to offer themselves for Dáil elections.  At present the strain of life on Deputies is such that many people are not prepared to take it on. It has been known for some members of the House to decide not to go forward for future elections, having had experience of what is involved, because of the strain on themselves and their families.  Smaller constituencies would eliminate much unnecessary duplication of effort and to some extent would reduce the strain involved for a Deputy.  If this were the position, I think that over a period we would get many people who are not at present prepared to enter public life to reconsider the matter and offer themselves.  This is not in any way intended to be derogatory to Deputies, most of whom fulfil their functions extremely well and do all that can possibly be expected of them but we know that there is a large body of people in outside occupations who are not prepared to make themselves available and in a small country such as ours, we cannot afford to exclude any <Col N="749" /> section of the community that might be willing to participate in our public life.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have had the case made here that the smaller and more compact constituencies lead to greater local knowledge and efficiency. There is no need for me to repeat the arguments at any length.  To those who see great virtue in PR itself I would suggest that my amendment should satisfy them because it contains the principle of PR.  I can imagine somebody saying that what I propose is not, in fact, PR.  I disagree.  Ideally, PR in its absolutely pure form should in fact consist of one big constituency for the whole country having 144 seats and anybody obtaining a quota would be elected, no matter from what part of the country the votes were obtained.  This is obviously impracticable and unrealistic.  In fact, the constituencies as far as I can recollect were originally seven-seat constituencies and nobody suggested that although this was not PR in its purest form, it was not PR.  Quite obviously it was.  Later, the constituencies were reduced from seven to five seats and some to four, and in time some four-seat were made three-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is that we follow this development to its logical conclusion and reduce the three-seat constituency to one-seat constituencies and keep the PR principle by having the alternative vote.  That would end the argument about the type of voting and whether we should or should not retain PR.  It would then become an argument as to whether we wanted single-seat constituencies or larger areas.  I think it is obvious to Deputies that the smaller and more compact constituency has much to recommend it and nothing, that I know of, against it.  The Constitution itself, on the matter of voting for the President in Article 12, section 2, subsection (3) says:</P>
    <P>The voting shall be by secret ballot and on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>I am advocating what is already <Col N="750" /> written into the Constitution.  There is nothing against it in principle.  It is described as PR with the whole country as one constituency and there is one seat involved.  Reducing the size of the constituency and retaining the same principle we do not alter the intention and there is no change of ideas involved.  It is merely an extension of the same principle.</P>
    <P>We have seen that for the purpose of the election of President the system of using the country as one constituency is quite acceptable, and if we can accept this system in voting for the President, why not in voting for Deputies?  We cannot be both for and against the same principle at the same time.  The amendment I am proposing is not obviously what the Government would wish.  They have indicated that they would like the straight vote and the single-seat constituency.  Neither is it what the Opposition want.  They want the multi-seat constituency and PR methods.  But mine is an honourable compromise, and I mean honourable. I do not accept that it is <i>infra dignitatem</i> for a Government to change its mind; rather the reverse. What I propose in my amendment is a happy compromise, the best of both Government and Opposition points of view.</P>
    <P>Whether the change proposed in the present Bill would or would not be carried in a referendum is open to speculation.  Nobody at this stage can give a definite answer but it is reasonable to assume that the result would be pretty close.  When we last had a referendum on this issue, I think there were only 33,000 votes out of 900,000 in the difference, a matter of two or three per cent, which is very small. Whoever won, there would obviously be a very large body of opinion dissatisfied. I believe, both from the comments I have had from people and the many letters I have received on this issue, that my amendment would meet with approval by the vast body of public opinion.  One of the complaints by the Opposition Parties was the waste of valuable Dáil time which could be better used in debating the other more pressing issues before the country.  This complaint, in itself, <Col N="751" /> would be removed.  This debate which promises to be long drawn out and largely futile would end on a peaceful and harmonious note, to the national advantage.</P>
    <P>Politics, I have been led to believe, is the art of making the idealistic into the practical.  Compromise is its life-blood. Support or otherwise of my amendment would show us who is prepared to put the national interest above Party interest.  I ask Deputies on both sides of the House to put aside personal considerations and to support the single seat and the PR method of voting.  We in this country for all too long have been divided.  If Members of this House accept my amendment, then we can unite the country on this important issue.  We can always be proud that when the moment of truth came, we did not find ourselves wanting, that we chose Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, a Cheann Comhairle.  I have indicated in broad outline the reasons which move me to support this Fourth Amendment and I have indicated, whether in order or not, what I propose to do to try to reach a happy compromise between the two sides and this we can discuss again on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to make a few observations on the Third Amendment, which is the tolerance issue.  On this Third Amendment, I have no hesitation whatsoever in supporting the Government's proposals to give slight preference to rural areas as distinct from urban areas.  I represent a rural area&mdash;Kildare, part of Meath and part of Westmeath&mdash;and I feel that I would be disloyal to my constituents if I did not try to protect their interests. <Col N="752" /> Today, there is a drift from the land to the cities and towns.  This is a worldwide phenomenon and there is nothing specially noteworthy about it in Ireland, but it is occurring.  We, unlike many other countries, are principally an agricultural country.  For us more than for most others, it is important that we should not have a Parliament which is dominated by urban-minded Deputies. It would be a sad day for this country if we had the Dáil here controlled by Deputies who were elected by city and urban areas.  We can imagine the scant sympathy and support the farmers, the rural population generally and the agricultural industry in particular, would receive should this situation come about.</P>
    <P>There are also the hard practical facts of life.  I represent an area which runs from Rathcoole just outside Dublin down to Athy and across to Mullingar&mdash;roughly 50 miles by 50 miles by 50 miles&mdash;triangular.  It is not possible to cover an area of this size adequately.  It is all right for city Deputies to talk about multi-seat constituencies because in their case a constituency might consist only of a mile or two by a mile or so, but in rural areas where the territory involved is enormous, and where constituents are just as entitled to see their Deputy frequently as are the constituents in any city, unless the Deputy is to be on the road morning, noon and night, this is impossible.  Dividing the five-seat constituencies would make the Deputy much more easily available to his constituents.  If we are to give effect to this, in fact, we must have some form of tolerance in the country areas as distinct from the city areas.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the rural population is dwindling.  Every year, approximately 10,000 persons leave the land. Some of these are small farmers, and some are farm labourers but the overall effect is that every year about 10,000 persons with a rural mentality and rural understanding of life are leaving the land and this is approximately equal to one Deputy per year.  So the net result is that each year we have one less Deputy who understands the rural way of life and one more Deputy representing city interests.  We have seen <Col N="753" /> estimates that by 1980 the population of Dublin will be approximately 1,000,000.  The estimates for the other cities are also forecasting large increases. This is something which I do not believe it is possible for any Government in this country to stop.  It is one of the things which will inevitably continue.  Other countries have helped to deal with this problem by giving this tolerance in rural areas which our Constitution does not allow.</P>
    <P>I feel that in this Bill we are, in fact, giving effect now to something which we should have done years ago. It has been suggested by some Deputies that this rural tolerance applies only to counties in the west of Ireland. This has been mentioned and, quite obviously, this is one of the important factors that gave rise to this Bill, but, in fact, as the Bill stands, this applies to all rural areas not just to western counties and any Deputy who represents a rural area, I would suggest, has a duty to his constituents to see that they are not outvoted by cities in a few short years ahead, has a duty to protect rural constituents against the vast hordes building up in the cities.</P>
    <P>I hope that any Deputy from a rural area who may decide to vote against this Bill will make it quite clear to his constituents what he is doing and why he is doing it; that he will be honest and brave enough to tell them that, in fact, he is putting his Party interests above their interests, so that at the next election, they may give him the reward he undoubtedly will deserve. As far as I personally am concerned, I intend to put the interests of the people of Kildare before any other considerations and for this reason I intend to support the Third Amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>An eminent citizen of this State, in this city, when he heard of the proposal of the Government to try to do away with the principle of proportional representation and the principle of one man, one vote, passed the comment: &ldquo;If they want it, it must be wrong.&rdquo; The late Deputy William Norton had a very much more picturesque way of describing <Col N="754" /> a situation confronting the country, a formula by which he tested any Fianna Fáil proposal, or any proposal coming from the Fianna Fáil Party.  He said: &ldquo;What is good for the hounds, is not good for the hare.&rdquo; It will be apparent that what the hounds, in the shape of the Fianna Fáil Party, want in these proposals is certainly not good for the hare, in the shape of the Opposition.  I hope to make it quite clear before I sit down that the purpose of all these proposals before the House is to secure political and material advantage for the Fianna Fáil Party in Government.</P>
      <P>We have two proposals before the House, one of which is the Third Amendment of the Constitution dealing with the endeavour either to do away with or very seriously to erode the democratic principle of one man, one vote.  The purpose of that is quite obvious.  The voting power of the rural areas at present has been gravely interfered with by the emigration that has taken place over the years under the Fianna Fáil Government and they see that their voters are going over to England and elsewhere, and consequently the number of votes they are likely to get in western counties is going to be seriously interfered with.  They tried before, in another direction, to get the rural votes which they have lost when they announced with a flourish of trumpets that they were going in for a policy of decentralisation and were going to send civil servants down to the West, in order to secure as I suggest, and this is quite clear, some political advantage by way of votes among the people there.  They were going to get them by uprooting these people and their families in breach of their legal rights.  If they had legal rights, it would be against them, in their relationship of master and servant.  It is the same purpose that is at the back of the Third Amendment: there is no shadow of doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to give a one-sixth tolerance is quite anti-democratic. I will have occasion later to refer to the provisions of the Constitution and to compare them with the Constitution of the United States of <Col N="755" /> America in this connection.  It is both against the principles of democracy and also against the principle of Article 40 of our Constitution which provides for equal rights for the individual before the law.  The proposal is designed to give some citizens in some parts of the country 40 per cent more Dáil representation than others who live in other districts.  Under the Bill a population of 16,667, to give an example, in one area will be entitled to a Deputy, whereas in another area, 40 per cent more, 23,333, may be required.  Therefore a population of some 116,669 could be represented by five TDs in one area and seven in another, giving the citizens in the second area 40 per cent greater representation, or influence on legislation, than the citizens in the first area.  This undemocratic procedure is designed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Fianna Fáil control of the Dáil.  Taking it in conjunction with the proposal in the Fourth Amendment to do away with the principle of PR, they will be able to secure a Dáil majority with a good deal less than 40 per cent of the popular vote.  These are statistics with which the Minister may deal when he gets the opportunity.  They cannot be controverted and they speak for themselves. At present in a number of counties in the west of Ireland, including Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Sligo, Fianna Fáil have barely one-half of the seats, 21 out of 39.  Under the proposed &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; system, as it is called, Fianna Fáil claim they will secure three-quarters of these seats in defiance of the wishes of the electorate in these areas.  In this way their hope is to increase their artificially inflated Dáil majority still further so that with a good deal less than 40 per cent of the popular vote, they can control the Dáil.  That is the effect of the proposal <Col N="756" /> before the Dáil, which is masquerading under the guise of democracy and still worse, pretending that it is going to confer some benefit on the rural constituencies.</P>
      <P>Article 40 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo; That principle of equality before the law is even more emphatic than the principle embodied in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, equality of citizens before the law. That principle of equality before the law which is embodied in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States was the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court just four years ago declaring to be unconstitutional the position in numerous states in the United States where certain rural areas had greater representation than urban areas and in effect, stating that if the legislatures of the states concerned did not put that matter right, the Supreme Court would put it right for them.  That was undemocratic and contrary to the provision of equality before the law.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which is being put first before the House and then before the people, is contrary to Article 40, contrary to the principle of equality for individuals before the law.  Let them pass these Bills as they are at present and let them be put as part of our Constitution and I believe they will still be open to argument.  Of course one cannot anticipate what the final judicial conclusions would be, but it will still be open to argument that the Bills as they stand at present will be unconstitutional under Article 40, not-withstanding the new provisions, as being in breach of the equality rights of individuals before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the principle of equality before the law was one of the great principles of the Constitution of the United States of America.  The drift of population from the land to the towns became very great in a number of the states in the United States.  Deputy Dillon referred to this aspect and to some of the states involved.  There developed a constitutional struggle <Col N="757" /> which was finally solved by a judicial struggle in the courts of the United States by what was called in America, very graphically, the cow vote, the rural vote of the cow legislators.  The cow vote was not of any greater sanctity than the ordinary vote of the individual in the cities and the towns.  That principle was given effect to by Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States of America, in the case of Reynolds and Synge and the quotation I am about to give is taken from the book <i>Warren, the Man, the Court and the Era</i> by John D. Weaver.  Earl Warren resolved this problem in the year 1964; some of the principles he laid down in the course of his famous judgment are based on the same principle as that enshrined in Article 40 of our Constitution and are peculiarly applicable and appropriate to be considered in relation to this Amendment No. 3 of the Constitution, or the cow vote in the rural areas of Ireland.  I commend for the consideration of independently-minded Deputies, if there are any such in this House, this statement of the Chief Justice:</P>
    <P>A citizen, a qualified voter, is no more nor no less because he lives in the city or on the farm.</P>
    <P>Why should he, since it is the constitutional right of every citizen, have greater voting rights because he lives in the country instead of in the town? We have equality before the law in our Constitution here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Black of the Supreme Court of the United States commented in another case:</P>
    <P>We cannot believe that it will make the old ship of State slip one knot for this Court to say that, in choosing their representatives, the people should have one vote for one man as nearly as that is possible.</P>
    <P>He then quoted Justice Holmes Wilson of Pennsylvania, who took an active part in framing the American Constitution. This is what he said:</P>
    <P>All elections ought to be equal. Elections are equal, when a given number of citizens, in one part of the state, choose as many representatives, as are chosen by any other <Col N="758" /> citizens, in any other part of the state.</P>
    <P>The one man, one vote principle was reaffirmed on June 15th, 1964, when Chief Justice Warren gave judgment in Reynolds and Synge.  He then made this significant and very relevant statement:</P>
    <P>Legislators represent people, not trees or acres.  Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interest.</P>
    <P>Later, in the same judgment, he said:</P>
    <P>Representative government is in essence self-government through the medium of elected representatives of the people and each and every citizen has an inalienable right to full and effective participation in the political processes of his state's legislative bodies.  Most citizens can achieve this participation only as qualified voters to the election of legislators to represent them.  Full and effective participation by all citizens in state governments requires therefore that each citizen has an effective voice in the election of members of the legislature. Modern and viable state government needs, and the constitution demands, no less.</P>
    <P>I said that the purpose behind this is to gain extra votes for Fianna Fáil in rural constituencies.  I have shown by reference to our Constitution and the Constitution of the United States of America the broad basic principle underlying equal rights of all citizens, irrespective of whether they are citizens living on farms or the members of a gang on a building site in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be rejected by the electorate.  It is unacceptable in principle.  It is wrong from the point of view of the public interest.  I do not know how it came about that these Bills were divided into two.  They were originally supposed to be a package deal.  They were unpackaged later. Why part of the second package was not put into the first package I do not know.  It would certainly be more appropriate there.  The Third Amendment deals with the so-called principle of tolerance.  There is provision as to <Col N="759" /> what is to be taken into account when constituencies are being delineated. But the real nub of the problem arises in the Fourth Amendment, the proposal to abolish proportional representation. Detail after detail is stuck in, dealing with the setting up of a Commission. These details, so far as they are relevant at all, should be in the First Bill.  I cannot understand how a judge will ever be able to mark out constituencies in accordance with the provisions of the Third and Fourth Amendment.  There is no guiding principle, no guiding headline, as to what he shall do.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach introducing these measures referred to a suggestion I made nine years ago when similar measures were before the House.  I suggested then that, instead of putting into a Constitution Amendment details more appropriate for law, they should settle the principles and leave the details to be settled by law.  The Taoiseach said the Government had considered that but could not see how they could carry it out.  I do not care whether or not they could see, but, since they have not done it, this Bill will, in my view, be of no effect whatsoever. There is nothing to guide the judge.  If there is disagreement, the judge will decide.  I can imagine no one less qualified to settle constituencies on the basis of political considerations than an independent judge unless he has some principles to guide him.  There is none in either of these measures of sufficient validity or in sufficient detail to give him any information as to how he should discharge his duty, should this Bill unfortunately come into operation.</P>
    <P>After a lapse of nine years, we are here once more considering a proposal to abolish proportional representation. Nine years ago I spoke in this House and throughout the length and breadth of the country in condemnation of the proposal at that time.  The proposals were examined in complete detail by the members of the Labour Party, particularly by Deputy Norton, and by myself and others.  I do not think there is any obligation upon me at this stage again to go through the variety of arguments <Col N="760" /> on and the refutation of every point that was put up in favour of the abolition of PR. I hope my public duty will have been discharged when I merely give an outline of some of the matters that must affect voters. I would not be inclined to refer to the 1959 volumes in which this debate is recorded, were it not for the fact that there are some young voters coming up, aged 21 or 22, who will be voting for the first time now perhaps and who would have been only about 13 or 14 when this discussion took place.</P>
    <P>Looking down through some of the speeches I made and the arguments I put forward and trying to cull from them the most important ones I had put here, I came across a statement in which I must confess I was wrong. On several occasions I did say in various parts of the country&mdash;I do not think I said it here in the House&mdash;that I believed that if the people turned down these proposals, that would be the last they would ever hear of the proposal to abolish PR.  I misread my friends, the Fianna Fáil Party: I was wrong. Here they are again trying to do the same thing as they failed to do.  There is not one argument or one pretext that was used on the last occasion that has not been used on this occasion, and no other. There is not one additional reason adduced. I was wondering if we could hear some whisperings from across the Front Bench to the effect that the people have no right to do wrong&mdash;shades of the past&mdash;that they have no right to turn down this proposal of the Fianna Fail Party. We thought this case was closed, but we did not reckon on the single-track, narrow gauge mentality of the Fianna Fail Party. I have listened to Deputy Norton stating here today that politicians should change their minds.</P>

      <P>But such a change should not be made except for cogent national reasons, and certainly not for the reason that is behind this proposal, that they can no longer count on securing a Party majority. That is my interpretation, and I stand by it, and that is the interpretation we put upon their action nine years ago here in this House, and it can be seen in the speeches that were made here. That is what the people thought it was and that is what I hope they will still think at this referendum, that Fianna Fail are trying to secure by artificial means the majority which they are afraid they might not sustain under the present system.</P>

      <P>The arguments put forward by the Taoiseach in support of these proposals are exactly the same as were put forward by his predecessor, now President de Valera, in 1959. The then Taoiseach said that the system was complex; there was a lot of queer counting in it; there was a certain amount of chance. I sympathise with that point of view. I mentioned it myself nine years ago in the debate in Dáil Éireann on the Second Reading of the Bill. I would recall the attention of anybody who is interested to the terms of our amendment to the Second Reading of that Bill. We put down an amendment refusing to give a Second Reading to the measure for reasons stated and at the end of the amendment, we recommended that, for the purpose of informing public opinion, an expert commission be established to examine and report on the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has not been done.  We said: &ldquo;Get your mathematicians to look at the rules made under the Electoral Act of 1923. I remember asking the person who formulated those rules where <Col N="762" /> he got them, and he said he made them up.  They have worked since 1923.  There may be some mistakes in them but they could be rectified.  The case of the Government would have been very much stronger if they came in here, having had this examination made by mathematicians or other experts into the principles of PR. They would have seen where the weaknesses were; they might have been able to come in here with reasons for their proposals, instead of talking as the Taoiseach does, about the logic of modern developments.  Human affairs do not run to logic.  If they did, Germany ought to have won the 1914-18 war, and also the last war.</P>
    <P>If this examination had been carried out, the Government might have been able to say: &ldquo;We had no reasons before except A, B, C and D, but now in addition to those, we have these reasons.  The system has been in operation now for 45 years.  We have looked at the results arising from the operation of the system at each general election, at each by-election, at local elections and at Presidential elections, and there can be only one conclusion, that this system is wrong.&rdquo; Then they would be in a strong position.  They are not able to do that.  This system has been in operation for 45 years and they cannot point to one single defect in it.</P>
    <P>No speaker so far in this debate has been able to point to anything that was wrong with the system.  I was the only one to do that myself on the last occasion this discussion took place.  I pointed out that I thought there was some little matter that might be corrected and that certainly should be looked into.  I also pointed out, not in this debate but previously, that the system that has been adopted to fill by-elections here was contrary to the principle of proportional representation and was wrong.  I pointed out that when, in the second inter-Party Government, we had a pretty substantial majority of 12 in this House, that majority was eaten into by reason of the deaths of people over the years&mdash; nine people, I think&mdash;so that from a majority of 12, we were brought down to three.  That was because of the system <Col N="763" /> which Deputy Norton says he is going to bring in here.  That system is not true to the principles of proportional representation and I have heard it argued very forcibly and very cogently by a person who knows what he is talking about that that system was unconstitutional and that all our by-elections held under that system have been unconstitutional and void. That system is not in accordance with the principles of proportional representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is laid down in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that the result of the adoption of this system for our by-elections was that the bigger Party got more votes and that the people who were supposed to be protected by the principle of proportional representation were swallowed up by the bigger Parties.  I had nine of my majority of 12 swallowed up by Fianna Fáil, simply because the deaths took place in constituencies which lent themselves to that.  What happened in the last six by-elections?  Fianna Fáil captured Cork from Labour; they captured Clare from Fine Gael and Waterford from Fine Gael; and Fine Gael captured Wicklow from Labour.  The system we use at present in dealing with vacancies in local bodies is a far fairer system, that is, where the vacant seat is filled in accordance with the wishes of the Party in which the death has occurred.  It is not in accordance with the principles of proportional representation when we find that the seat of the late Deputy Murphy, who got 10,000 votes or thereabouts, is taken up by Fianna Fáil because they happen to have the constituency sewn up to enable them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not proportional representation. Nor is it a fair system.  It is probably a system that is quite illegal and it is certainly not a fair one.  The Government would be much better employed in looking into that position and trying to find remedies for it rather than saying that proportional representation leads to unstable government when that is against the facts, <Col N="764" /> rather than saying that it leads to government not representative of the people when that is against the facts. There is not one single cogent reason for the proposition they are now putting forward here.</P>

He can spend the money on the paper or he can read it in the Library.  She is not a lawyer, nor is she in any way connected with my Party.

      <P>I did.  When I was in office, I said that this system of election was not in accordance with proportional representation, that it was not fair.  My majority of 12 went down to three because Fianna Fáil filched the seats of the minority.  That is not proportional representation and I was denounced by Deputy MacEntee, of all people, for saying that.  Here in the <i>Irish Times</i> there is a letter which verifies my contention of that time that this is not proportional representation. When Deputy de Valera was Taoiseach in charge of putting the present Constitution through the Dáil, he had this very principle which they are now trying to get rid of copper-fastened and riveted into the Constitution. I put down an amendment seeking to suggest that this was too rigid and suggesting that the phrase used in the 1922 Constitution: &ldquo;Should be on the principles of proportional representation&rdquo; should be used instead.  He said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He wanted it confined and riveted to the principle of the single transferable vote while I wanted to leave it a little more flexible.  He insisted on putting this rigid system of the single transferable vote into the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies remember the rumpus kicked up in this part of the country in 1927 or 1929 when the Northern Ireland people were taking out of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the obligation on them to have their elections under proportional representation? We raised Cain down here at that time, and properly so. <Col N="766" /> That provision was put into the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, by the British Parliament in order to safeguard in some way not merely the Catholic minority in the North but also the Protestant minority down here in the South.  It was taken out of the system in Northern Ireland by the British Parliament and since that time the Catholic minority in the North have had little chance of getting proper representation in the provincial Parliament of Northern Ireland.  The result of that decision was that it froze the pattern of political life in Northern Ireland as it stood 40 years ago.  Any time there is an election now, even in a constituency at one time regarded as a safe seat for what were then called the Nationalists, all the Unionist Party have to do is to get somebody to go up and split the votes of the minority and the Unionist gets in.  That is the system we want.  Once you split the vote in the single-seat constituency, put up a stooge, there is an end to anybody having any chance against the official candidate.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we now are going to say that Northern Ireland did right in 1927 or 1929 to deprive the Catholic minority of the North of their right of representation as a strong minority in the Northern Ireland Parliament and that we should do it now.  I certainly will not subscribe to that.  The Catholics in the North are getting very little, even though they have gone a long way and even though the Taoiseach has gone across the Border several times and the Prime Minister has been down here several times.  How much influence had to be brought to bear on the British Lord Chamberlain to get a Catholic appointed to the judiciary in the North?  That is the result of doing away with it in the North.  Is that any guideline to us to do away with it in the South?</P>
    <P>We stand and have always stood since 1922 for a representative Parliament, a Parliament in respect of which the voters will be electors and not merely voters, will have a proper choice in the candidates they wish to vote for and will have two, three, four or more, if necessary, TDs who will go into a Department, write letters to a Department, <Col N="767" /> attend meetings and look after their constituents' interests.  I certainly would not like to consider their position under the first-past-the-post system where a man with one more than 50 per cent of the votes gets in and all the rest are disfranchised.  Every one of the others has to go with his hat in his hand to the fellow who is in who will probably tell him to go and have a jump at himself: &ldquo;You did not vote for us the last time.&rdquo; Under the proportional representation system, they have their own Deputy who will look after their interests because he is put in to represent them. Under the proportional representation system, we have a really representative Parliament, formed from the people, bringing the people close to the Parliament and not the position where you will have somebody with less than 40 per cent of the vote with a very big, artificially inflated majority in the Parliament.</P>
    <P>This system of proportional representation, this part of the voting system affected by the Third Amendment of the Constitution, is part of the structure and fabric of the State.  I have the respectable authority of Edmund Burke to sustain me in my belief and contention that no person should venture to pull down any edifice or any fundamental part of the structure of the State, which is serving tolerably the common purpose of society, without infinite thought and infinite care.  What thought has been given here to this? They dug up all the old arguments and brought them forward again.  There is not even a new look about them&mdash;all the same old stale clichés we all dealt with nine years ago in this House and up and down the country all over the place.</P>
    <P>I would like, first of all, to bring Deputies here, and some of the younger people in the country, to the realisation that this is an Irish system.  It is our system, adopted by this House, conceived by Irishmen for Irishmen and to suit Irish conditions.  We are asked to adopt a British system we do not know anything about as far as its operation in this country is concerned.  The present system was conceived and designed <Col N="768" /> by Irishmen for Irishmen to suit Irish conditions.  It has had its roots even away beyond the establishment of the State.  It comes out of our own conditions. It was created in this country and sustained here in Irish tradition over the years since it became an actual practical realisation.  We felt it was the best system for our own peculiar problems and our own concerns.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when this matter was being discussed here, the present Minister for External Affairs&mdash;I forget what he was then&mdash;suggested it was the British imposed this on us. We answered that in Volume 172 of the Dáil Debates.  May I quickly and succinctly refer to some of the matters to which I directed attention at that time?  It is of importance that this thing should not be got out in any sort of way that conveys a wrong impression. As far back as 1911, Arthur Griffith declared that the principle of proportional representation is the one just system of election in a democratic Government.  In the issue of Sinn Féin for January, 1911 &mdash; I quoted this at column 1009 of Volume 171 of the Dáil Debates.  He said this:</P>
    <P>We believe the strength of the Irish Legislature will reside in its including from the beginning representatives of every section of the nation.  We desire to see the evil growth of political bossism checked under Home Rule and every section of the community given free speech in an Irish Legislature.</P>
    <P>In a further issue of <i>Sinn Féin</i> of 25th February, 1911, he wrote:</P>
    <P>PR secures that the majority of the electors shall rule, and that the minority shall be represented in proportion to their strength.  It is the one just system of election in democratic government.</P>
    <P>That was Arthur Griffith. The Proportional Representation Society of Ireland secured its inclusion in the Home Rule Bill which was passed through the British House of Commons in 1912 and it formally became law on the outbreak of war in 1914.  It was also put in the Government of Ireland <Col N="769" /> Act, 1920.  In 1919, it was used at the express request of the local people in Sligo to deal with a local situation that existed then, it having been put into operation and having given complete satisfaction.  Mr. de Valera gave it his approval at that time, as he did in 1927, and I am sure he had very eloquent words to say when the Northern Ireland Government took it away from the Government of Ireland Act in 1920 and left the Catholic minority to the tender mercies of the wonderful system of first past the post.  I have already indicated this and I will not go through it again.  He insisted on this particular system being riveted in any system of PR.  He would not leave any elbow room at all.  He insisted that this system should be inserted into the Constitution of 1938.  It is there now. He tried to get rid of it.  He made his effort in 1959, but it was unsuccessful. His successors are now trying to get rid of it again, and I hope they will be equally unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Arthur Griffith was still alive in 1922.  He did not remain alive very long, but he had something to do with the Constitution and with General Michael Collins, he directed that it should contain the principles of PR. That did not copperfasten the de Valera system.  It left elbow room. Mr. de Valera insisted on this rigid system being adopted.  People who were alive then knew the conditions that existed before 1922.  It was essential that we should have this principle of PR at that time.  It is hard to understand now, in these ecumenical days, the fierce hatred and bitterness that existed in this country between what were known as Unionists, Nationalists, Sinn Féiners and all the rest, prior to 1922. I remember a famous newspaper advertisement headed: &ldquo;A call to Unionists&rdquo;, issued before the Treaty. Protestants were genuinely convinced that if anything like Home Rule were given &mdash;not to talk of the great measure of independence we got&mdash;they would be destroyed.  We heard talk of Rome Rule, that their religion would be destroyed, and their businesses and property taken away.  They felt that genuinely. In order to meet that situation <Col N="770" /> and to show that they would be entitled to a square deal from the new Government, this was put in by Collins, Griffith and O'Higgins as part of our political life.  It has remained there ever since and has worked very well.</P>
    <P>I saw this Dáil from 1922 up to the present.  I saw Party after Party being formed.  I saw representatives of the business community as Independents, and I saw representatives of Trinity College and Protestants sitting in this House.  The Cosgrave Government gave them fair representation in the Seanad.  The result is that there is now no whisper from anyone that anything could happen to the Protestant minority in this part of the country.  It was a very serious problem at that time.  It was part of our principles that we should give fair representation to the minorities.  The Protestants were only one minority: there were various others.  As I said, I saw Party after Party going through this House.  I saw the National Party.  I saw the Labour Party which gave great service to the country in the first years of the State. I saw the National Labour Party coming up before Kevin O'Higgins was murdered.  I saw the Farmers' Party, the ordinary workers Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and the National Democratic Party.  They are all gone.  This Parliament is still here and still stable in spite of the fact that it was put up by Mr. de Valera and others that the system leads to unstable Government.</P>
    <P>I want to pause for a few moments to give some indication to this House and to the country of the effects of the British system we are asked to adopt here.  Let me recall in this context what the Taoiseach said.  He referred to the impressive array of old-established states like Great Britain, the United States of America and Canada that have this system of first past the post. The British system of election in its actual operation in other countries has demonstrated that that system can produce a Government which instead of being a reflection of general public opinion represents a minority of such opinion and in fact exaggerates a <Col N="771" /> minority into an inflated majority.  I gave some examples of elections in England in a speech I made on the Second Reading of a Bill like this before.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1022, Volume 171 of the Official Report, I referred to the situation which existed in the years 1911 and 1912.  I was a student at that time and I remember it well.  There was a great fund of excitement and anxiety.  The Home Rule Bill was at last going through the House of Commons.  There was a Liberal Government which had been elected on the first past the post system which should have been a stable strong Government with a big majority, but the Government had not got it.  They were depending upon a few Labour men and a few Irishmen to keep them in office.  Every vote counted.  They had to face by-elections with almost disastrous results. There were three by-elections.  I shall quote what I said then:</P>
    <P>There were three by-elections within a short space of time and in each of three constituencies that I am taking as examples, the Home Ruler as the person pledged to vote for Home Rule was the sitting Member of Parliament, and this was the result. At Oldham in Lancashire on the 13th November, 1911 the anti-Home Ruler got 12,255 votes: the Liberal Home Ruler got 10,623 votes; the Labour representative who supported Home Rule got 7,448 votes.</P>
    <P>So, the two pro-Home Rule candidates in this first past the post election had nearly 19,000 votes whereas the man who won the seat and wanted to vote against it got 12,000 odd votes.  This is the system we are being asked to adopt. It produced a result of that kind and will still produce it.  I went on to say:</P>
    <P>The anti-Home Ruler got in with a majority of something like 6,000 votes.  That meant a difference of 2 in the British House of Commons.</P>
    <P>I went on to give another example:</P>
    <P>At Crewe in Cheshire on the 26th August, 1912 the anti-Home Ruler got 6,260 votes.  The Liberal Home <Col N="772" /> Ruler got 5,294 and the Labour Home Ruler got 2,485.</P>
    <P>The anti-Home Ruler got in although there was a very good majority against him.  Another example I gave was Midlothian (Edinburgh) on 10th September, 1912.  The anti-Home Ruler got 6,021; the Liberal Home Ruler got 5,989 and the Labour Home Ruler got 2,413 votes.  Again, the anti-Home Ruler got in on a substantial Home Rule vote.</P>
    <P>I took these two examples as being startling examples that might bring home to the people what they are asked to do.  That is why I repeat them here. But you can still get examples if you have the industry and resources to go through the various election results in England.  In the 1945 election, which I think was the one that knocked out Churchill and put in the Labour Government for the first time, the British Labour Party got a nearly two-to-one majority over Churchill in that election in the House of Commons and they had only 48 per cent of the votes. One hundred and seventy-seven Members were elected with fewer votes than all their opponents combined and all or any of these 177 results could have been changed if the votes of the bottom candidate could be transferred.  That is a fairly recent result.</P>
    <P>Very small shifts in the voting pattern under this first past the post system can produce quite disproportionate changes in the composition of Parliament.  Thus a one per cent increase in a Party's vote can give it three to four per cent more seats in Parliament and a one per cent drop in votes can similarly lead to a three to four per cent drop in the Party's strength in the Dáil.  Under this system an opposition securing 60 per cent of the votes can quite easily be deprived of the opportunity of forming a Government under the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>The figures I have mentioned put beyond all controversy that a Party by reason of the operation of the straight vote system can, by securing merely 40 per cent of the popular vote, secure 60 per cent of the seats in Parliament. That is not a system I would recommend <Col N="773" /> for this country, particularly, as I said some nine years ago, when you are asked to take a leap in the dark. You do not know what you are facing into.  Nobody can give even an approximate forecast of what the results will be in the election if this changeover takes place except that there will be undoubtedly a disproportion between votes cast by the electors and the seats secured by any Party in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It would not be proper for me to pass any comment upon the Mother of Parliaments, the British Parliament, but I think I am entitled to comment on the operation of that Parliament in the last few years in its relevance to this context of the competition, if I may put it that way, between the straight vote and the PR system.  Going back a little before the present Parliament, the history of that Parliament and the working of the British system clearly show that it has not consistently given the government desired by the majority group of voters, nor has it led to the avoidance of coalitions.  We all know that the examination given to the matter here is out of date, since it was made nine years ago, but it may be more obvious and striking now to point out that 2,600,000 Liberals were able to get only nine seats in the House of Commons; the rest of them were disfranchised under this system, in eight of the ten general elections prior to the consideration of this matter here in this House, prior to 1959.  The majority of the seats in parliament went to a party with less than half the votes.  During the 62 years prior to that, over 70 per cent of the British Governments were coalition governments.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that we would be happy here if we had the situation that is confronting Mr. Wilson and his Labour Government at the present time?  Although the British Labour Party got an overall majority, having got only 45 per cent of the votes in 1945, nevertheless from that on when they were put out there was a series of governments, Tory and otherwise, that were hanging on, as we would say, by the skin of their teeth.  Certainly, there was the sort of thing which Fianna Fáil would say was the kind of parliament <Col N="774" /> we would expect from PR.  But it came out of the straight vote and there were coalitions when governments, not able to get in with a Party that had an overall majority, relied on other Parties for support.  This is the sort of thing that it was alleged you would be likely to get from PR but in fact you did not get it from PR but you got it under the straight vote system in England.</P>
    <P>Look at the present Labour Government in Britain.  They formed a Government with a very clear majority of about 84.  Everything seemed grand for them; they had a clear majority and nothing to stop the Labour Party from doing what they wanted.  Did they have a happy time since?  I would say, to use the phrase used by Deputy Norton, that the situation has been very yeasty and very uneasy since Mr. Wilson came into office.  I have the utmost sympathy with him and I am not criticising them at all.  They have difficult problems to meet, difficulties in world conditions and economic conditions at home and abroad.  Yet they have a clear majority and it would be argued here logically, I suppose, by the Taoiseach that if the Government have a clear majority in the House, they are perfectly happy and can meet any situation and solve any problem.</P>
    <P>But the British Labour Party are very far from solving any problem. While they may not have a very solid Opposition, they have a very solid Right and Left conspiracy in their own Party when they are facing difficulties. That is the system we are asked to adopt here, to get this Parliament into something like the situation the British Parliament has been in since they got a clear majority in the last general election.  That is a very broad outline of the British Parliament that was referred to by the Taoiseach in his opening statement in introducing these Bills, the old-established and old reliable British Parliament, the Mother of Parliaments, under the straight vote system.  It is not a very happy result from that system, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>Then he referred to Canada.  In Canada, the Liberal Government had, in 1953, only 48 per cent of the votes <Col N="775" /> but it had a two-to-one majority of the seats.  I do not know how that squares with the question of equality and fair representation.  Certainly it is not our idea of a representative parliament. But, at the following general election they were overwhelmingly defeated by the Conservatives who polled fewer votes than the Liberals. That is Canada, that he holds up to us as a prototype to follow.  The Liberals were defeated at the general election by the Conservatives with fewer votes. In the very short time that they have had this much vaunted system of first past the post, they have had a coalition in the present government and for some time past in Canada.  So that the examples the Taoiseach took in recommending that system to this country fall apart in his hands on examination.</P>
    <P>There is also the contention&mdash;I think it was put forward by the Taoiseach and certainly by some of the speakers since&mdash;that the system of proportional representation entails danger of a Government Party not having a majority of the seats in the Dáil, not being able to carry on a government.  That contention is belied by the record of this House.  Only four times have Fianna Fáil ever secured an overall Dáil majority but for 24 of the 41 years since they entered the Dáil, the country has been governed by Parties which did not secure a majority of the Dáil seats at the preceding general election and for 13 of these 24 years of non-majority governments the Government Party was Fianna Fáil.  And yet, they come in here and say that this system leads to unstable government.  We have had more stable government here since 1922, in spite of the Civil War and the revolutionary times that we went through for years afterwards, in spite of change of government and all that was involved in it when Fianna Fáil became government, than any other country in the world under the system of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>They then fall back on this thing that we are to have a lot of Parties and that proportional representation leads to a lot of Parties.  It leads to <Col N="776" /> representation of minorities and if they are strong enough in the country then they get representation, as they are entitled to, in this House because this is a representative Parliament, or ought to be and certainly is under this system of proportional representation, as it would not be under the straight first past the post system.  Under the present system we have had governments which remained in office on majority from 1922 to 1932.  The people then voted for a change and the Fianna Fáil Government came into office with majorities at each election which held them in power from 1932 to 1948.  In the 1948 election the people did not give a majority to either of what have been termed the big Parties and from that decision came a uniting of Parties in inter-Party Government. After two periods of inter-Party government, the people again gave a decision in favour of Fianna Fáil, giving them a substantial majority in the Dáil and, in 1957, they gave them 78 seats&mdash;an overall majority.  In 1961, they had 70 seats and, in 1965, 72 seats.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with that?  Why is the country to be put into turmoil to do away with a system that produces those results and gives the most stable government in Europe, not to say Europe and America, not to say the world?  Why the necessity for the change?  We all know that Fianna Fáil are now afraid that because of the changing views of the younger people who are coming up to vote, they can no longer rely upon the allegiance of Fianna Fáil of the Civil War and there are not enough jobs to go around to bribe the rest of the voters, as is their habit.</P>
    <P>We have held the view and, in so far as we could, have put it into effect, that the guiding principle of the Constitution under which this country would be governed should be the principle that Parliament shall be a representative Parliament and not merely a machine for creating an all-powerful Government&mdash;which is what is achieved under this system of the single vote.  Election to this Parliament, under the present system, has had, and still has, the <Col N="777" /> fundamental purpose of securing the rights of minorities.  We have always stood for that principle and that is the principle we commend for confirmation and continuance in this referendum.  It is a system that is peculiarly fitted to safeguard those rights and liberties without which a free democracy is nothing but a sham.</P>
    <P>There is more to government than merely securing the election of a government so powerful that it will, as all such governments in history have done, govern at their whim to the detriment of minority rights and individual liberties.  It was all the &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; of Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin that destroyed liberty in Germany, Italy and Russia in the past 35 years.  It is vital, I believe&mdash;and we on this side of the House believe&mdash;in the future of this country that this referendum should not produce a nation of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Over all the range of policy and government, the fundamental case against Fianna Fáil is not their mismanagement of the economy, bad as it is; their system of government by gimmicks; their lack of any consistent or fruitful endeavour in agricultural and social affairs; but, rather, their debauchery of public life.  Now, the Party seek further to limit our powers of expression and protest by attempting to exclude minority opinion from Parliament itself, the democratic arena where not alone the general opinion of the nation but that of every section in it should be voiced and listened to, where free inquiry in debate can compel the justification of any act which is the subject of question.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see what is the purpose of these proposals that are put before the Dáil now and will subsequently be put before the people.  They were defeated some years ago in a referendum, free and deliberate, of the people.  I thought we would see them no more and would hear no more about them, that they would have learnt their lesson.  That is not so.  We are now here again facing an unnecessary disturbance in the public life and economic life of this country at a time when this country cannot afford to be disrupted <Col N="778" /> in its economy or to be diverted from its efforts to bring back the country to an economic level and to improve it. We cannot afford that now.  There is no reason why we should not have gone on as we were before.  There is no reason why they should not have taken the lesson learned at the last referendum, except that they are afraid now that at the next general election they will lose their seats because of the drop in their voting power, and perhaps because of the oncoming of Labour.</P>
    <P>We think it is the duty of all sections of the community to unite for this purpose, to defeat these proposals of Fianna Fáil.  We do so, not in the interests of political Parties, Fine Gael, Labour or anybody else, but in the interests of the people, the interests of the country.  We believe, as we believed some years ago, in 1959, when we persuaded the country to defeat Fianna Fáil at the time they were led by their &ldquo;magic&rdquo; leader, Eamonn de Valera. We defeated them at that time.  I thought we would never see another proposal of this kind in my lifetime. They must be afraid again of losing their hold over the country and over their jobs.  Therefore, in my view it is essential that both Parties, Labour and Fine Gael, as well as Independents should join together to put this Government out, to defeat them on these proposals and to secure that we would have again a Government who would at least have principle and not be guided solely by expediency or jobbery, and that they would bring back some decency and prosperity to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions have been repeatedly asked in this debate why it has been thought necessary to put this question to the people at this juncture.  It seems to me that the answer is a very simple one because I take it that you could only do it when one Party has a majority.  I would find it difficult to believe that you could get agreement with other Parties about putting something like this to the people because it becomes so politically tinged and politically biased that the real issue is completely clouded.  After all, what is this?  It is a referendum and in a democracy, far from being <Col N="779" /> evidence of a dictatorship, surely a referendum should be welcomed at any time, if the issue is important enough, because what it is doing is asking the people to make a decision on some matter&mdash;the people and only the people, and not the Dáil or the political Parties.  Surely there is no more democratic exercise than that?</P>
      <P>It has been said in this House that this is purely a political matter.  As public representatives, we know very well there are at least two sides to every story, and sometimes more, and therefore there are arguments for and against.  Therefore it is our duty to put the case as clearly and as impassionately and impersonally as possible to the people, to show them both sides and to explain the difficulties to them and then let them make their choice. Undoubtedly everybody in this House should be biased in favour of the present system in some way or other because we have all been elected under the present system.  For that reason it is a quite natural reaction that we should favour it.</P>
      <P>The last speaker could not understand why the matter should go before the people.  He felt that we had heard the last of it after the last occasion. Surely the fact that Fianna Fáil have been in power since then, and still think it necessary to go before the people goes to prove that they consider it is a matter of vital importance for the people and the future of the country?  If Fianna Fáil had been out of office in the meantime and had just returned to power and wanted to do this, then I could see some sense in the case being made, but certainly because of the way things have gone, I cannot see any sense in it.  I do not subscribe to the argument that because the proposal was rejected by a small majority nine years ago, the people who have now come to voting age and have an interest in the country's affairs should not be given the opportunity of deciding one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Constitution about which we hear so much, I am old enough to remember when it was put before the people and I remember the <Col N="780" /> reception it got from those who are now anxious to preserve every line in it.  I was not in the House at the time but I did as much as I could outside to get the people to accept it.  It was bitterly opposed by the Opposition Parties.  If that Constitution had not been accepted, if it had been defeated, would it have been consistent for Fianna Fáil to have decided that they would never put the Constitution to the people again?  If any of the big issues of the last 30 years had been impossible to achieve, if the removal of the Oath of Allegiance, or the removal of the Governor General, had both been defeated, should we never again have gone before the people to say: &ldquo;We think this is a matter of national importance and that the position should be altered?&rdquo; It is because we feel so sincerely about this that we keep putting it to the people.</P>
    <P>I admit that there is another argument, that there is something good in proportional representation, that there is something good in the transferable vote, but of the three, I believe the straight vote is the best.  I believe that the multi-seat constituency is the worst and that it is a curse for a country.  I say that from my own experience.  I am a member of a multi-seat constituency and I am very friendly both with my colleagues in my own Party and my colleagues from the Opposition Parties, and I always have been, and my opinion has nothing to do with personalities but just that it is a frustrating experience to belong to a multi-seat constituency.  Other speakers have given the reasons and I do not wish to delay the House by repeating what has been said about the disadvantages.  The last speaker gave reasons why he felt PR was introduced and why it was so successful.  I was only a schoolboy when it was brought in.  He said it was because the minority were terrified, and said so publicly, of any kind of Home Rule which would leave them in fear of the consequences.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that during its course PR has served its purpose; it has allayed those fears and there are no dangers for the minority.  However, it is less than honest to try to compare that with conditions in the Six Counties. <Col N="781" /> In the Six Counties, there was a very different situation.  Proportional representation was introduced for the self-same purpose as it was imposed on us but when it was removed, it was very easy to define the areas in which one section of the people lived and in which another section lived.  That could not be done here.</P>
    <P>In my experience, in Munster, you could not take an area and say: &ldquo;There are the Fine Gael people; there are the Labour people; and there the Fianna Fáil people,&rdquo; because if you took any three houses, you would probably find the three Parties represented in them.  The position therefore is not the same.  It is not fair to try to confuse the issue by saying that we are taking the British system and therefore copying what is happening in the North and that we will have all the evils that followed in the North. I do not subscribe to that, nor will any intelligent person.</P>
    <P>We are also told that the average voter will not be able to go to his Deputy because he will be told: &ldquo;Jump in the river; you did not vote for me.&rdquo; There are many people coming to us in Cork and all of them could not have voted for the five of us, no matter what they say, but they come to us and under the proposed system, the man who wants to keep his seat will be more anxious to work for and listen to those who are not for him than others who are for him, because if he wants to increase his vote, he must do so.  There are two ways of having a Government.  You can have a Government representative of as many sections as possible.  If you want that kind of Parliament, as a Fine Gael speaker seemed to suggest Fine Gael want, that is one way, I suppose, of having a Government, but I do not believe it is an effective way of having a Government.  I do not think every small section should be represented in Parliament.  What people need fundamentally and essentially is a Party with a sufficient majority to carry out the promises they make and the policies they adumbrate. If they do not do that, then, after five years, they must go back to <Col N="782" /> the people and render an account of their stewardship; they must explain why they did not fulfil their promises or implement their policies.  If they do not satisfy the people&mdash;it does not matter whether it is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour&mdash;the people will deal with them accordingly.  The people are realists and they have over the years given the other fellow a chance.  Under the straight vote, it would be a very simple matter for the people to give the other fellow a chance.</P>
    <P>Someone said last week that it was most insincere of Fianna Fáil to say they wanted to get Fine Gael into office as a Government.  I do not believe that is the intention of any man in the Fianna Fáil Party.  We are aiming at the ideal&mdash;a Government and an Opposition, an Opposition capable of forming an alternative Government at any time the people so decide.  That is the ideal situation.  That is what we should all aim at.  I do not say the Opposition would be Fine Gael, or Labour, or a combination of both, or even a new Party.  The Opposition might be Fianna Fáil.  But there would be a Party in Government.</P>
    <P>I listened to the accusations here of Fianna Fáil skulduggery, all the wrongs they have done the country over the past 30 years, and so on.  If there is any truth in these allegations, then the Opposition cannot escape blame, unless they believe the people are fools, because, if Fianna Fáil were as bad as has been alleged, the people would long ago have chosen an alternative Government, if they had had a choice.  I fail to see the reasoning in that kind of argument.  I want a system under which it will be easy for the people to judge and make up their minds.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the references to Miss Lakeman.  She is a professional advocate of proportional representation but she has made very little headway in her own country.  She seems to be spending most of her time and energies on us.  We are the guinea pig apparently. I should like to see her making some progress in her own country before she advises as to what we ought to do here.  As Deputy Costello said, <Col N="783" /> England is the Mother of Parliaments, but they do not seem to have taken Miss Lakeman seriously over there, and she is one of their own.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the principle of one man, one vote.  I cannot understand those who talk about one man, one vote and then advocate proportional representation.  If you have six candidates for one seat, the person who votes for A, who gets the highest number of votes and stays in the count, never gets a second choice.  But the person who votes for the lunatic fringe gets another choice, and the person who votes for the candidate who gets 300 votes gets another choice, and so on.  That is not one man, one vote.  The straight vote is much fairer because every vote is of equal value.  That is the system that operates in most bodies of which I have experience.  I subscribe to the doctrine of one man, one vote.</P>
    <P>There was a case made here about three candidates in a constituency of 12,000 voters: one candidate gets 4,001 votes, another gets 3,999 and another gets 4,000 votes.  The candidate who would get 4,001 votes would be sitting in the hottest seat in the country and he would spend a very busy five years, if Parliament lasted that long, holding his seat.</P>
    <P>I think it is plain to most people that proportional representation worked well here as a result of the major differences created by the unfortunate Civil War.  That was the real reason why proportional representation worked so well.  As time goes on, I think it will be more difficult to get an overall majority under proportional representation.  That is a secondary consideration really and I was glad to hear Deputy Norton make the case he did; to me the greatest menace for the future is the multiple-seat constituency.  I hope that every Deputy will put the case as fairly as he possibly can so that the people will have a chance to examine both sides and make up their minds.  It is the future of the country that is at stake and I do not think we should be too blinded by what has happened in the past, too worried about what Deputy <Col N="784" /> Dillon said in 1936, or Deputy de Valera said in 1937, or Arthur Griffith said in 1911.  What they said may have been very wise when they said it, but we are living in different times and we must act in accordance with the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 1937 Constitution, knowing the bitter opposition to that Constitution and the many issues contained in the Constitution, I think Deputy de Valera was wise in putting in proportional representation at that particular point of time.  The Constitution was carried by a rather small majority.  Had proportional representation been abolished, then the Constitution might not have been carried at all. In his wisdom, then he retained proportional representation because it was not such an important issue as the sovereignty of the State, and let future generations therefore decide about PR. That is the interpretation I give you.  As I say, I was outside the House working on the Constitution at the time, but I feel that would be a much fairer interpretation than to say the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, copper-fastened PR because he thought it was the best system that could possibly be worked under a democratic form of Government.</P>
    <P>In the same way I would not dream of quoting all that Deputy Dillon quoted of what was said at that time because the times were different.  We have to face up to conditions as we find them now and what we visualise will happen in the future.  If we want to have stable government which must be answerable to the people within five years according to the Constitution, and if we want to create an Opposition who can be an alternative Government, then I think the straight vote is the easiest to understand and the one the electorate would find simplest in producing the result required.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Costello giving us the legal and the constitutional side of the issue at stake, I would prefer to approach the matter from the point of view of the man in the street, the man whom we public representatives meet every day of the week.  From the speeches of <Col N="785" /> Fianna Fáil Ministers and from Deputies, one must conclude that they are confused.  We had the Minister for Justice talking about a package deal on Telefís Éireann which was flatly contradicted the following day by the Taoiseach.  We have had the different Deputies from Fianna Fáil supposedly giving us their view which to my mind is a fallacy, and the man in the street knows in his heart and soul they are not speaking with conviction.  They are speaking because the whip has been cracked.  Whether it came from the Park or from the Minister for Local Government is a matter of opinion. However, the Minister for Local Government has nailed his colours to the mast on this issue, that is, first past the post, despite the promptings and the approaches that have been made to try to simmer down what has been proposed.</P>
      <P>If this is to be a first past the post system and nothing else, let the Minister for Local Government carry that out, but for goodness sake, let us not have confusion from Fianna Fáil on this issue.  We know they are confused; the people know they are confused, and that confusion has now boomeranged on them.  They are now trying to find a way of escape from the net in which they have ensnared themselves.  We in the Labour Party have declared our hand from the beginning. We have not changed an iota since 1959.  We have stuck to our guns and the people supported us then, and I am absolutely certain that they will support us more vigorously on this referendum, which we are told will take place in June but which most of us know will not take place in June. We must ask ourselves how this issue came into prominence and what is the reason for it, bearing in mind that there are matters of much more importance to be dealt with at the present time.  We are the only country in Europe which has a declining population. Nothing has been said about that; nothing has been done about it.</P>

    <P>We are told in answer to a question put here by Deputies Murphy, Kyne and myself that the estimated cost of this referendum will be £100,000.  That figure, I am sure, was based on the 1959 referendum.  This is nine years later, and this money is going to be squandered, not alone the £100,000 in terms of 1959 but other money as well; we in the different Parties have to go to our church gates; we have to go from door to door to try to help ourselves along.

    <P>We have seen what has been thrown into it by the people who have done well by Fianna Fáil.  We have seen the lorries decorated with bunting and with Fianna Fáil posters.  We have seen bands on hire from distant counties.  We have seen busloads of fugitives and gangsters and trick-of-the-loop men, all coming in to cheer and wave.  There was a time when it was just a parade up the street with a grey horse and the banners flying around.  It is now the double-decker from the neighbouring counties.  There were tar barrels and turf fires burning along the road.  For the turf fires which they provided, they got back, not tons of turf, but gold, which is now a scarce commodity, put inside their back doors.  All the Taca men were there.  I attended an inquest in my own city recently and I saw the agony on the faces of these fellows. They were wondering what was going to happen now.  These are the people that gang over there has sponsored and brought in here by buying some of them and intimidating others.  They produced these Taca men all up and down the constituency.</P>

      <P>We find that where one man is in control of a constituency, there are many reasons why some of the people will not approach him.  You know that as well as I do: so does every Fianna Fáil representative here. We all know that when pressure is being brought to bear on a Minister or a Department, how strong that pressure is and how it must impress the Minister when there is unanimity on the part of all public representatives in a particular constituency.  We have had our eminent <Col N="789" /> Minister for External Affairs propounding the value of the first past the post system.  Nobody but himself knew what he was talking about, even if he knew himself.  He gave utterance in Clare about what he called the straight vote and he told the people there that our present system was a British system. Could anything be more ridiculous? He was a man who served two masters in his time.  There is no denying that fact.  He tells us that this is a system forced on us by the British and because it was forced on us by Britain, we must hate the guts of it.  At the same time, he is putting out his hand and welcoming any agreements we can make with the British.</P>
      <P>Not so long ago Deputy Costello gave us quotations from Arthur Griffith in 1910 and 1911 and he told us what Griffith thought of proportional representation.  Because of the twist and turn that Fianna Fáil have now given to this issue, they seem like a woman who cannot make up her mind.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan</i>)).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the last occasion I mentioned certain things that got under the skin of the Minister.  I do not want to refer to what he said about me on that occasion, as far as I am concerned I am prepared to stand on my own two feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We introduced this Bill because we believe it is wrong for any individual to have the power to make or break other individuals or firms.  We believe it is wrong no matter what Government are in power, because this power can be abused, has been abused by members of the present Government and is being abused.  We want to see an end to corruption and palm greasing in this country.  We want to see introduced a fairer system where all the <Col N="790" /> children of the nation will be cherished equally.  We hear much of that phrase from the Government.  We believe it wrong that people with political contacts can come to a Minister and because of the action he can take&mdash; and, due to political pressure, very often does take&mdash;he can overnight make wealthy chancers, speculators, or whatever you like to call them.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on the last day, certain people who own certain property were refused planning permission, were refused on appeal, but other people who had the political contacts, who had the friends in court, could buy those properties at a low value, knowing when they did so that they could get planning permission.  As I stated previously, in many cases the value of those properties was increased five, ten and even 15 times what they paid for them originally.  We believe it is wrong to have this power vested in Ministers of the Government Party. Since 1932 they have never hesitated at any time to use their power and influence to further the interests of their followers.  Indeed, they make no secret of it.  It can truly be said that since 1932 they have never hesitated at any time to use the taxpayers' money to keep the Fianna Fáil Party in office and to help further the interests of those who, like the members of Taca and others, support them financially.</P>
    <P>We have introduced this Bill to put an end to what the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about last September in Galway&mdash;low standards in high places.  We want to ensure that all our people, whether they be planners or builders, people with land to sell for building or people looking for planning permission to alter existing buildings, no matter from what stratum of society they come, no matter which political Party they may be attached to, or even if they are attached to no Party at all, get from this Government what under God and an Irish Constitution, they are entitled to, that is, fair play and a fair deal. Unfortunately, they are not getting it from the present Minister for Local Government and they did not get it from his predecessor.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent five days here <Col N="791" /> making an argument against this Bill, but he had a bad case.  He went back to the thousands of appeals dealt with by a previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy P. O'Donnell, but not in one single case could he find any corruption or semblance of corruption.  That is a great record for that Minister and for that Government. We are proud of it.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to another case in my own constituency in the town of Athlone. Mr. Anthony Hughes, Central Terrace, Athlone, was refused permission by Athlone UDC to extend his house to the front.  He wanted to turn it into a licensed premises.  He appealed against the decision of the UDC.  He got his local friend, the Minister for Justice, to contact the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government replied to the Minister for Justice stating that he would look after his friend and that everything would be all right.  He certainly looked after his friend.  The gentleman concerned, who is a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party and an active member of Taca, got permission to extend his house and erect a licensed premises in this area.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, the Minister for Local Government has claimed that information could be got in the Dáil or got by individuals and that reasons would be given why permission was granted or refused in any case.  In this case the Athlone UDC wrote to the Minister asking him to give his reasons for overruling their decision and giving this gentleman permission. The Minister failed to give any reasons.  He merely referred the council to the section in the Act giving him the right to overrule their decision. His letter read very badly in <i>The Westmeath Independent.</i> That was the position, despite the fact the Minister comes in here to tell us that he and his Department are prepared to give the information.  Here is a glaring example of an urban district council requesting a Minister to give his reasons, and getting an arrogant reply that under a certain section of the Act he had the authority to overrule the <Col N="792" /> decision, that he had done it, and that was the only regard he had for the people.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention another case.  Deputy Blaney was Minister for Local Government and he will remember the case very well.  A particular gentleman applied for permission to erect a building at Salthill and was refused. He was a particular friend of the former Deputy Bartley, who was then Minister for Defence, I think.  It seems that in Galway they know the proper thing to do, because Deputy Molloy, the man who has since taken the place of Deputy Bartley, told us in this House that people are coming in their hundreds to him to get these things done. In any case this gentleman approached Deputy Bartley, and Deputy Bartley approached the Minister on his behalf, and the planning authority were overruled.</P>
    <P>The reason I say the Minister will remember that case is that some time afterwards he was in Galway, and he was walking down Salthill with Mr. C. I. Flynn, the County Manager, and he saw this building and said: &ldquo;In the name of God, why did you allow that building to be erected there?&rdquo; Mr. Flynn said: &ldquo;We refused it, but you overruled our objections, and that is why the building is now there.&rdquo; That building should never have been allowed to be erected, but because the gentleman was a friend of Deputy Bartley, the Minister overruled the planning authority and allowed it to be erected.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 2013, volume 232 of the Official Report of 28th February, 1968, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I promised Deputy Belton I would deal with the case which his leader utilised as his contribution to the Opposition campaign in this regard.</P>
    <P>I asked him for the reference and he gave it.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Yes.  Column 651, in which Deputy Cosgrave stated:</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case in my own constituency where at the junction of two roads there was a petrol filling station already established which had access to both <Col N="793" /> roads.  Although the residents objected and the local authority refused permission, on appeal, permission was granted to build another petrol station.  Justification for decisions of that character is not obvious.</P>
    <P>The Minister knew well what Deputy Cosgrave was referring to.  Deputy Cosgrave was speaking of a case in Goatstown where there was an old garage in existence, and a particular man who was a friend of the Government was allowed to build another garage adjoining it.  This is definitely a case where permission should not have been granted.  The Minister brought this in and tried to tie it up with Deputy Belton's case.  Deputy Belton's case was a filling station in Dún Laoghaire.  The local people objected and the Minister overruled the objections. It is very unfair for the Minister to try to tie up that case with the case which Deputy Cosgrave raised, which was completely different.</P>
    <P>The Minister also during the course of his lengthy reply on numerous occasions misquoted a previous Minister for Local Government.  He claimed that the previous Minister said he had not read the files and had merely put his name to them.  Deputy P. O'Donnell said no such thing.  He pointed out the huge number of cases that came before a Minister, that the officials added their memos to them, and he claimed&mdash;I think, justly&mdash;that it would be impossible for any Minister to read everything connected with the appeals.  He was quite in order in stating that, and he said&mdash;which I believe is right&mdash;that he was guided by his officials.</P>
    <P>It is much better for any Minister to be guided by his officials, to be guided by engineers and other officials in his Department, who are not biased one way or another, and who look at a proposition from the planning point of view.  It can be said for our civil servants, as it can be said for our judiciary, that they are above corruption, that they cannot be bought, and do not stand for palm greasing.  It is right that a Minister should be guided by those people who were doing their duty as it should be done.  Deputy P. O'Donnell <Col N="794" /> said he was guided by them in the vast majority of cases.  It is much better that he should be guided by those people, but in the Minister's case, it is quite different because members of his own Party admit that they are approaching him day after day, and Deputy Molloy said they were coming in their hundreds to him.  We think it wrong that politicians should be in a position to get a Minister to grant planning permission to their friends.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1579, volume 232 of the Official Report of 21st February, 1968, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This Bill is ostensibly introduced in order to set up special machinery to deal with planning appeals, to make a fundamental change in the Planning Act which places a responsibility on the Minister and to hand it over to another body.  It is for the purpose of setting up rather elaborate machinery, the function of which would result in what might be described as a lawyers' paradise.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the County Management Act took responsibility and power out of the hands of the local authorities.  The Minister for Labour has certain responsibility which will be dealt with by a judicial board.  The same applies to the Department of Social Welfare.  The final say is not, and should not be, with the political head of the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the innuendoes of the Minister on that day when he referred to what might be described &ldquo;a lawyers' paradise&rdquo;.  Neither the Minister nor any other member of Fianna Fáil should judge those on this side of the House by their own low standards.  They can only see in the powers conferred on them by being in government something to bring grist to their own mills or the mills of somebody connected with them.  They should remember that this measure is not intended to bring grist to the lawyers on this side of the House because those lawyers and solicitors are not briefless but lawyers and solicitors who are making a first-class job of their profession, honest, sincere and hard-working men.  They do not introduce this or any other Bill to <Col N="795" /> bring grist to the mills of any lawyers. It is wrong for the Minister to refer to this as something that might be described as &ldquo;a lawyers' paradise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 27th February, at column 1838, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>That is not the point at all.  The point is that this is a bogus Bill submitted by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>If it is a bogus Bill, why did he spend five days, seven and a half to eight hours, replying to this debate?  I cannot understand his thinking in this regard or how he thinks it is a bogus Bill if it is to take power out of the hands of a politician and put it into the hands of people who will act in a fair and just way.  I do not agree with the Minister's sentiments as expressed then.</P>
    <P>He went on to refer to political activity and said:</P>
    <P>...instead to embark on a deliberate campaign of wholesale slander.  That was a coldblooded decision by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>There was no coldblooded decision taken so far as this Party are concerned. The slanderers and character assassins are on the other side of the House judging by the attack made on Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself, but we can hold our heads high, perhaps as high as, or higher than, some members of Fianna Fáil.  For many years Fianna Fáil have acted as character assassins and their ideas and the Minister's idea, I suppose, in coming in here was like that of the boy with bandy legs who, when if he got into a row at school with any other boy began shouting: &ldquo;Bandy legs! Bandy legs!&rdquo; before the other boys got an opportunity of shouting it at him.  The Minister's behaviour on the last occasion was something about which perhaps the least said at this stage the better.</P>
    <P>At column 1839 of the same report, the Minister also said that Deputy L'Estrange in his capacity as Whip had decided to prevent the majority of the Party speaking on this Bill.  We introduced the Bill and sent in our own speakers.  We cannot interfere with the <Col N="796" /> Fianna Fáil Party who have their rights just as we have.  At no time did we try to prevent Fianna Fáil or any other Party speaking in this House. From the foundation of the State, I think we have a prouder and better record in that regard than the Government Party.  We are proud that we have always stood for free speech.</P>
    <P>At column 1842, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Part of Deputy Cluskey's reasons for raising this was to attack individuals outside the House and I know the Opposition are even trying to brand everyone who engages in business in the provision of houses as being essentially evil.</P>
    <P>We certainly are not.  We and our Government helped in every way people who were themselves prepared to build their own houses or contractors prepared to build houses for others.  The Minister should remember that it was a member and a Minister of the inter-Party Government who gave the second grant of £300 to anybody building his own house or building houses for anybody else.  We are proud of that and we certainly do not condemn as evil people engaged in the provision of houses.  But we do not believe it is right for any individual connected in any way with the Government or with Taca or a similar organisation to use his contacts or his money to buy or get planning permission. That is why we believe the present system is wrong and lends itself to abuse and is being abused.  We think the time has come to take it out of the hands of the Minister and hand it over to the type of body proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the accusations we made against the Minister was in regard to Mount Pleasant.  I think no Minister of State should come to this House and coldbloodedly try to mislead the people because at column 1854, when the Minister was replying to the debate, I asked him:</P>
    <P>Can the Minister answer one question? Will the speculator who bought the land or the original owner get the big profit?  The Minister knows that it is the speculator, not the original owner, who made the <Col N="797" /> big profit and he has deliberately refrained from mentioning it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>If Deputy L'Estrange believes these fantastic stories, let him go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say:</P>
    <P>I do not accept for a moment, because I am not a fool, that there is any advantage accruing to anybody, and nobody with normal intelligence would accept it.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the records of this House that the facts are that the people who own the property applied for and were refused permission and that the Minister knew when he was making this particular statement that it was a Mr. Lahard, who was closely connected with the Fianna Fáil Party and that when the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Charles Haughey, was returning&mdash;I think it was from Paris&mdash;when they were carrying the placard with the words &ldquo;Charlie is the Greatest&rdquo;, his architect appeared in a picture as holding it up.</P>

      <P>It was wrong for the Minister to tell us that he did not know it was the speculator and to try to pretend in this House that it was the people who owned the property who were making the huge profit because this piece of ground which has been bought from these people who were refused permission at a very reasonable sum of money is now valued at £50,000 to £60,000.  It is wrong that any speculator, because he is attached to, or has friends in, any Party should use the powers conferred on a Minister to make twenty times&mdash;that is what he is making on this property&mdash;what was paid for it.</P>

In the course of that speech, I stated that I did not think that this film of this meeting at Roundstone would appear on &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; and the reason I stated that was that Mr. Patrick Gallagher and the people who attended there more or less implied to me that they did not think there was sufficient news content in the happenings of that evening to justify their presenting this film of this meeting on &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; or on any other programme on Telefís Éireann.  Now, I made that statement here that in view of the manner in which the meeting went there was no news content in it. I did not think it would appear on &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;.  It was purely coincidental that some dispute arose in the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Department shortly afterwards.  If Deputy L'Estrange accepts that from me, I will sit down. If not, I will go further and state why Mr. Gallagher did not think there was news content in it, because at that meeting there was a proposal before the meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a planning application for a caravan park on the beach in Roundstone and this meeting was asked to support that application. Later on at the meeting, they were asked to voice a protest at permission being given for the erection of a small house at the entrance to the beach, which was down in a hollow.  These views contradicted each other.  They could either accept one and the other fell but could not accept both because they were contradictory.  That was why Mr. Gallagher was puzzled by what went on in Roundstone and that is why I knew he did not think there was sufficient news content in this meeting for him ever to present it to the people as of news value.  That is the reason I made the statement.  It was purely coincidental that afterwards some dispute arose in &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>W. Brendan Allen operates this firm of solicitors, I understand.  He is a member of the National Executive of Fine Gael and Director of Elections, and a Mr. Connolly is employed by him, and he was a Fine Gael candidate in the 1961 election.</P>
      <P>It is very unfair for the Minister to drag these people into this debate.  They are professional men doing their duty and attending to their duty and any correspondence which they had with the Minister or the Department was because they were the solicitors employed by a particular individual.

      <P>At column 1995, we have the Minister trying to defend Taca.  He stated.</P>
      <P>These people have come together voluntarily to support our Party.</P>
      <P>Further on, he says:</P>
      <P>In general, these are people who, for one reason or another, have not got the same degree of enthusiasm to inspire them to give the same quality of high service as is given by our members throughout the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;the same quality of high service&rdquo; were certainly the operative words.  If they cannot give that quality <Col N="804" /> of high service, it is wrong that they should be in a position to use their money, their influence and their bank books because that is what they are doing for the Government at present. The Minister also stated that they expected sound guidance of the nation's affairs and they got it.  They get it by using their influence, by using their money, and by using their cheque books, as some of them did, to subscribe £100 for a dinner when you have people on the verge of starvation, while others signed bankers orders to pay £100 a year for the next six years to keep the Government in office.  To use the Minister's words, if they have not &ldquo;the same degree of enthusiasm to inspire them to give the same quality of high service as is given by our members throughout the entire country&rdquo;, then we want to see in the future that they do not stoop to the low standards which we have in high places to-day, the low standards referred to by Deputy Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in Galway shortly after the Minister for Local Government had granted this permission to the gentleman mentioned in the articles in the <i>Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>We have introduced this Bill because we believe it is a good Bill, and the people believe it is a good Bill.  We want to see an end to corruption and an end to palm greasing and to see an end once and for all to those chancers and speculators who through their association with different organisations, whether it be Taca or any other, become wealthy and millionaires&mdash;as at least one of them did&mdash;almost overnight. If appeals are being made to the people to work hard, the incentives should be there for all people to work hard and for all to get equality of chance in their own country.</P>
    <P>We want to see all of our people, whether they be members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, or any other Party, getting a fair crack of the whip.  We want to see an end to the corruption and to the Tammany Hall methods which we have in Ireland today.  It is wrong that they should exist, and if the Government are in earnest, they now have an opportunity to take the power from <Col N="805" /> the hands of the political head of this Department and ensure that no Minister, now or in the future, will have this power which can make or break a man, individuals or firms, almost overnight but that it will be handed over to a judicial body as envisaged in this Bill.</P>

Deputy L'Estrange is not a member of the relevant local authority and he does not know that the new main road planned will pass neither of these garages.  I cannot understand how anybody on the particular section could make vast profits, but I can tell the Deputy that this is one of the fastest developing sections in the greater Dublin area.  There are more than half a dozen new petrol stations in the area to cater for the increasing volume of traffic and the increasing numbers living there.</P>
      <P>I understand the purpose of this Bill is to set up a committee to adjudicate on appeals.  The committee will consist of a district justice, someone appointed by the Local Appointments Commission and someone appointed by the Minister.  Perhaps one could describe it as a variation of the authority which administers Radio Telefís Éireann. While someone appointed by the Local Appointments Commission might be willing to sit on such a committee, I cannot visualise any justice acting on it when every justice knows that Fine Gael Deputies, when something goes against one of their own point of view, will come in here and, with their usual slandermania, seize the opportunity to show that the justice was got at by the Minister for Local Government or someone in some of the associations affiliated to the Fianna Fáil Party. What justice would risk that type of slander?</P>

      <P>One of these three people it is envisaged by this Bill would sit on this body would possibly have to sit on it because it is his job; he is paid officially. There would be tremendous reluctance on the part of justices to leave themselves open to the type of abuse we have listened to in this House over the last few days.  The Minister would of necessity have to pick an executive of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party in order to show his impartiality.  That would have to be done regardless of a person's qualifications, and that is the only reaction one ever gets from Fine Gael in regard to this type of thing.  The proposals in this Bill are completely impracticable.  No appeals board could possibly deal with the number of appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying very hard to deal with the Bill and what is in it.  I was referring to the number of appeals that would come up and would be dealt with by one or two appeals boards consisting of three members.  If we go on to section 5 of the Bill and there were more than three members, the situation would become absolutely impossible.  I think that is what Deputy L'Estrange was referring to, that maybe what would have to happen is that we would have so many appeal boards that the Government would have to appoint 30, 40 or 50 judges to deal with planning appeals, and everybody in the legal profession would be very happy. At the moment the length of time between the time an appeal is lodged and the appeal is either upheld or rejected is about seven or eight months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the experience of being told by a person that he was going to build an extension to his house, a <Col N="813" /> garage or a workshop and he started building without planning permission. The local authority then put a stop order on him and said he had to take down the structure already erected and rebuild it in accordance with their plans.  The man had spent whatever money he had on doing the work already done and so he lodged an appeal and it took one year and three months for that appeal to go through. It is only 3½ years since work started in that particular case.  I am sure that other Deputies from all parts of the House have had to take up matters with the Department on these appeals and have had to go back month after month to find out what has happened. It is most frustrating to be told on these repeated visits that the plans have not yet come back from the planning inspector.</P>
    <P>I have had this experience since I was first elected to this House.  There has been an improvement but the procedure needs to be improved still further. It can be improved but not as is proposed in this Bill.  The volume of appeal work cannot be done by two judges with two people appointed to sit with them.  This Bill is a further indication that Fine Gael have abandoned all hope of ever becoming a Government.  They are now seeking to have the Government delegate all their responsibilities and, if they had any hope of ever becoming a Government, they would not do that.  What is needed is more flexibility at local authority level.  For instance, there was a proposal by an individual to build a petrol-filling station.  That proposal was rejected but I am told it is now coming up again.  I happen to know the individual originally involved; he was away for some years, had some money and had various types of business in mind.  He came across this site in my constituency which he thought could be used for a petrol station.  He asked me to visit it with him.  It was only a dump.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As a matter <Col N="814" /> of fact, I had five years experience as a member of the Planning Committee of Dublin Corporation.  As a member of that Committee, I got experience as to the requirements of the local authority and I can advise people how to present proposals to the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish the story.  The plans were lodged with Dublin Corporation and I sought an appointment with the inspector concerned. That inspector told me that if he had the final decision, he would approve the proposal straight away because something would have to be done with the site.  There is a reasonable volume of traffic on the road but a little beyond the site, there is a minor turn.  The inspector said he would have to recommend that the proposal be turned down but added that they might not be so tough in the Department.  The proposal was rejected; the individual concerned made an appeal and that was also rejected about a year later.  I believe it is now coming up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a town-planning expert but I have some expertise as a result of my experience of what local authority requirements may be.  I know how a proposal should be presented and what the requirements of the local authority are.  When I was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1955, the first thing I was told by the City Manager was that there was a High Court order against the corporation as a result of a private action and that unless the corporation produced a town plan within a specified period, I could, although I had not been a member of the body against which the order was made, be fined so much a day or lodged in jail until they produced that plan.  If the officials of Dublin Corporation had wanted to get rid of certain representatives in 1955 or 1956, all they had to do was not produce that plan.  Having given service to and having worked on that body, I am <Col N="815" /> surprised that we were not all locked up.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The High Court order was sought because the corporation had refused to do something the Act of 1934 or 1939 had told them to do.  They had not done it for 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I am not saying that the judge was wrong but that is the source of the problem confronting us in recent years.  The Minister of the time found that the number of appeals was building up and up; it was increasing tenfold.  If I recollect aright, the Fianna Fáil Government were not in power when the court decision was taken but this was the fault of the local authority and not of the Minister of the day.  The succeeding Minister decided to bring in a new Planning Act and he explained in this House that this was a difficult problem and that he thought that all local authorities should make their plans within a specified period but that he wanted to give them more flexibility in deciding what was best for their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He envisaged that the number of appeals would be greatly reduced but this has not proved to be the case. Each individual inspector in Dublin Corporation has before him a typed list of 15 or 20 questions, and unless the proposal before him complies with every one of these questions, that local authority inspector has no power even to recommend to the chief inspector that the proposal should be allowed to go forward.  He can be asked later by the senior planning official, if a councillor makes representation that he thinks it is a bad decision or raises it at the local authority committee, to make an observation as to why he thought it should not go ahead.  The <Col N="816" /> only reply he can make is something like &ldquo;No. 8 in my instruction says there is a tree there and it cannot be cut down.&rdquo; I had the privilege of seeing this list given to the corporation's inspectors.  It gives them absolutely no flexibility at all.  That is where the fault is.  That is where this trouble is starting. This Bill is not the solution.  The solution to this matter is a new Planning Act now which will in some way or other get larger areas for regional planning.</P>
    <P>I attended a town planning conference in Liege, Belgium, in 1956.  All Ireland, all 32 counties, would be treated as a region in France or Germany.  Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Borough Council&mdash;these are surely all one?  Included with them you could bring in Kildare and Meath, and probably Wicklow and Louth.  If we could get more flexibility for the local authorities to make proper overall basic plans, it would not be necessary to have planning appeals and the suggestions and charges that have been made. There would be no need for this Bill, which the Opposition allege is needed. I do agree there are certain difficulties in dealing with planning appeals.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking previously, he referred to certain cases dealt with during the Ministry of Deputy P. O'Donnell.  During that period I had occasion to go to Deputy P. O'Donnell.  He listened to my cases reasonably.  On at least one occasion he granted approval to an appeal I supported. I do not blame Deputy P. O'Donnell for doing this.  If I were to blame our Minister for anything, I would blame him for not being sufficiently liberal in dealing with these appeals.  A Minister should be liberal in these matters.  If I were to take any other view, I could certainly make innuendoes and suggestions here, but that is not my purpose.  All this matter of planning appeals and how to deal with them properly should be dealt with in the first instance by making them as unnecessary as possible.</P>
    <P>If this Bill has been framed for the completely honest purpose of trying to improve the situation, I am sorry if I have been having other thoughts about <Col N="817" /> it.  I feel it was brought in at the time it was for the purpose of trying to dig up dirt at by-election time.  I hope these thoughts were wrong.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Deputy L'Estrange referred last Thursday to the 67-64 OP law case, but in not <Col N="818" /> bringing this to the proper authorities in the first place and raising it in the way he did, he has undermined confidence not only in the democratic system but in our democratic leaders as they exist here today.  It worries me when I see certain pressure groups, mostly the same people&mdash;what the Americans would classify as egg-heads &mdash;who seem to turn up at every little grievance.  I often wonder why these same people turn up.  They are expert and thorough in presenting their case and pressurising for one thing or another.  The fact that they did not appear to operate when we were in Opposition suggests to me that this is a well-organised movement inspired by Fine Gael, or perhaps Labour.  It would worry me to think it was not this.  It would worry me to think that these people were organising themselves only for the purpose of undermining the people's confidence in democracy itself.</P>
      <P>Having watched the methods of these people in relation to Mount Pleasant Lawn Tennis Club, of which I was a member and for whom I have played in a table tennis team in my younger and fitter days, I can say this. There is a brown wall with a David Allen hoarding on it.  The most recent slogan on it was &ldquo;No EEC.&rdquo; Sometimes it is &ldquo;Up the IRA.&rdquo; If you go a bit closer, some things are written on it which I would not like to mention here.</P>

      <P>Any proposed development at Mount Pleasant must be an improvement on the present situation with this wall, the gates falling into disrepair, an ESB sub-station at one end which must not have been painted for 20 or 30 years hidden behind old, rotted and neglected trees. <Col N="819" /> The club could not possibly have afforded to carry out full improvements and I am glad they at least have some money to enable them to improve the facilities there.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out, the duplicity of the Fianna Fáil Party in their approach to this question of the abolition of PR, the confusion that exists within their minds and within their Party, the two-faced approach of some of their Cabinet Members, the denial by the Taoiseach of the statement made by the Minister for Justice on RTE, are now apparent to the ordinary man in the street for whom I speak, and whose views I try to put <Col N="820" /> here before this House on this matter. It is evident and plain to be seen now that this is realised, and we must congratulate the local press and the national press, with one exception, for putting the case plainly and simply before the people.  We have to congratulate our daily papers on that. Fianna Fáil now see that they are in an invidious position.  Some of their Cabinet Members want to retract, to circumvent the situation which was thrown at their feet by the Minister for Local Government and from which, on his statement last week, he is refusing to withdraw.  They are now so confused that it is freely stated throughout the country that the referendum which they had prepared for June is being postponed until October, and from then on, God only knows what will happen.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Fianna Fáil people here and now that we in the Labour Party and in the trade union movement are prepared to fight them on this issue in garden, field or bog, as we did in the past.  We know the outcome of this referendum.  We know the chastising and the defeat Fianna Fáil will get on this referendum.  There will be complete annihilation and fragmentation of the Party as a result. Thoughtful members of that Party are now throwing their minds back on how this happened and why it was placed before them and the people as a <i>fait accompli.</i> It is extraordinary how these things keep recurring like a dúchas dúchas in a family which goes on from father to son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we throw our minds back to the middle and late 40s, we will find that a similar situation arose within the Fianna Fáil Party when the then Minister for Justice defied his own Cabinet colleagues with regard to the treatment of political prisoners.  The executions and hunger strikes of that time brought defeat to the then Fianna Fáil Government. We have a recurrence of that now in the person of his own son who is ignoring and despising the advice of his own Party.  He has persistently said&mdash;and he repeated last week, despite the efforts and promptings to &ldquo;soft-peddle and break a hole <Col N="821" /> in the wall and give us a way out&rdquo;, that he has nailed this referendum to the mast and will not give in one iota on this issue.  That is the position.  The Minister for Local Government is not prepared to withdraw one iota from that statement of his.</P>
    <P>Let us imagine in our wildest dreams that his ambition will be realised. What then will happen?  We all know what will happen.  The first party for the axe will be the trade union movement. We had a sample of that not so very long ago with the ESB Bill.  We will have it repeated again and again, and dare anyone organise themselves into a trade union movement and, having failed in all other approaches, take unto themselves strike action.  We know what will happen.  Let us here and now advise and remind and warn the people of this land that that mind, which, as I have said, has been bred out of dictatorship and ruthlessness and inhumanity, is now operating or trying to operate again to introduce in this country legislation of a tyrannical type, and we will find the jails and internment camps filled over and over again as they never were before, not by people with political views but by the ordinary organised trade unionists. These people will be wiped out by legislation if this should ever come to pass.  Knowing the people throughout the length and breadth of this land as I know them, not as he knows them, I know there is one thing which is repellent to the Irish nature, that is, coercion. It will be fought on all fronts.</P>
    <P>That is what Fianna Fáil are aiming at in these Bills.  We will oppose it, as I have said, in garden, field or bog.  We will oppose it as bitterly as they are introducing it.  I can see, and the workers of the country can see, that this is a move by people who have jumped into opulence and who would be unknown had we a fair government and equal treatment for all citizens. These people would be unheard of, but they are here now with us.  They bought their way in and the wings of Fianna Fáil were spread over them.  These people are now attached to them and their interests must be looked after from now until the end of the Fianna Fáil régime.  I can see, and I repeat, <Col N="822" /> what the man in the street is thinking: this is the last will and testament of Fianna Fáil.  We shall make sure of it and there will be no codicil.  They will be banished and whatever we do, we shall see that there will be no beginning again to the dictatorial powers which these people are trying to take unto themselves.</P>
    <P>They talk about tolerance&mdash;no member of that Front Bench knows the meaning of the word.  Their tolerance depends on one thing only: how deep their supporters can put their hands in their pockets at election and other times when the clarion call goes out for funds.  The unfortunate man going to the labour exchange or the widow to the post office for the widow's pension and the turf voucher for one shilling for a hundredweight of turf to keep her going for a week&mdash;where is the tolerance there?  Intolerance would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>Coming back to today's newspapers and the <i>Irish Times,</i> in particular, we find it quoting Captain O'Neill in the North.  He has given all his support and praised this action of Fianna Fáil: it is a great system.  This is what they want &mdash;to gerrymander the constituencies. They tried that in the local elections in certain boroughs and it kicked back in their faces.  We saw to that in Limerick city.  We softened their cough for them in that local election.  Never before in the history of Fianna Fáil were they without an alderman.  We can and we will do more when the referendum comes and the sooner it comes the better.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party want justice and fair play for all with equal rights for everyone.  They talk about cherishing all our people equally.  Was there ever since Templemore or since Paul Singer such hypocrisy and deceit practised on the people?  Equal rights and equal opportunities, how are you! We know where the rights are.  So does anybody who has any association or connection with the building trades in the last year or two.  This is what they will continue if they get away with this measure but&mdash;the fools&mdash;they have forgotten the intelligence of the ordinary man in the street.  They cannot see the wood for the trees because they are too <Col N="823" /> engrossed with the semi-millionaires and mini-millionaires now fluttering about them.  But the day of reckoning is at hand.  Like all dictators, they can go too far and too far east is west.</P>
    <P>I believe that we shall rejoice as never before when we see once and for all the annihilation of the Fianna Fáil gang.  The man in the street is thinking as I am thinking and speaking.  I meet him and live with him and I know how he lives and works.  That cannot be said for some of the Front Bench Members of Fianna Fáil or even some of their backbenchers.  We know how they feel about the referendum and what they will do about it.  If the truth were known and stated, we know what they would say.  They cannot go back now.  They are nailed to this first past the post idea.  We will nail them to it and no matter how they try or what excuses they produce to circumvent or sidestep this issue, we shall bring it before the electorate, the honest people of the land.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, poor old genial Jack, makes the excuse of the delay and the dragging out of counts but does he forget that a similar tactic was tried in Wicklow last week when the Minister for Local Government demanded that the votes should be here instead of there, or he thought they should&mdash;anything to hold up the count?  If there was any holdup in any count, which was of no importance&mdash;and the delay was of no importance&mdash;it was because of the inefficiency of the counting staff. The late Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Education, commented on it at the count in Limerick during the last general election.  So did all of us, and we complained to the returning officer of his dilly-dallying way and the manner in which he handled the count. The count would have been over 12 hours earlier, had it been efficiently handled, but it was not.  That is on record.  All candidates, successful and unsuccessful, commented on it and the returning officer's approach to it.  There was a similar position in many other places.</P>
    <P>This is the reason given by the Taoiseach for the abolition of PR, with no consideration for what the people <Col N="824" /> want and would like to have.  It is to be done because of a whim, a vicious whim from a vicious man, a man of malice who came and put the gun to the Cabinet and said: &ldquo;This is it.&rdquo; Whether that inspiration came from elsewhere or not, going back to what happened in 1959, I do not know but we have our views.  In 1959, with all the glamour and all the colour they then introduced and the camouflage which was also part and parcel of the issue, it was defeated, but it was nothing to the ignominious defeat it will suffer when this referendum is held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were interested to hear Deputy Healy say this afternoon that he saw virtue in referring this matter to the people for decision by referendum.  At least we now have evidence that the Fianna Fáil Party have come one step forward.  There was a day when they ascertained the will of the people by looking into the heart of one individual.</P>
      <P>Perhaps this change of heart on their part has come about because they fear that in this day in which man has succeeded in transplanting the heart of a dead person into a live person, we might have some contorted vision of the will of the Irish people if somebody in the future were to look into whatever heart was in him in order to ascertain the will of the people.</P>
      <P>We doubt very much if the Fianna Fáil Party are genuine in wishing to consult the people.  What they would prefer to do is to bring in this Amendment without consultation with the people.  This is a new anxiety on their part to consult the people on matters important and unimportant.  To many sensible people, this is one of the least important matters this House could be engaged in discussing at this time. But, if there is now in the Fianna Fáil Party an anxiety to consult the people, we trust they will go a little further and will amend the Constitution so as to provide a genuine form of plebiscite to enable the people to have their opinion directly ascertained on Bills which are submitted by the Government or by others in this House from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> As you are aware, Article 27 of the Constitution allows the reference of Bills to the people other than a Bill which is called a Referendum Bill only where a majority of the Members of Seanad Éireann and one-third of the Members of Dáil Éireann jointly petition the President to decline to sign and promulgate a law on the grounds that it contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>In the present system in which the Government of the day can effectively secure a majority in the Seanad by appointing 11 nominees of the Taoiseach, that so-called provision for a plebiscite is, in practice worthless. Now that we are on such an unimportant matter as this, to delay development of the economy and the social requirements of this country for six months to hold a referendum, we would prefer that the Government would do what they now profess to believe in, that is, consult the people directly on important matters such as social and economic reform.</P>
    <P>It may be that men may forget this outrageous behaviour of the Government. In 1959, the Government were defeated in what they are now proposing. In 1961, the electorate, unfortunately, were prepared to forget the Government's misdeeds of 1959 and it is because the people did not remember them in 1961 and did not put out of power the Government that tried this on in 1959 that we have the same Fianna Fáil Government trying this on in 1968.  If it be that the Government are now doing it, it is the people who elected Fianna Fáil in 1961 and 1965 who are to blame.</P>
    <P>The Government, I suppose, are entitled&mdash;if you have no high moral standards you are entitled&mdash;to try a thing on if the people are not going to express their opposition to the Government by putting them out of power. One can only hope that on this occasion, when the people once again defeat this proposal in the referendum, they will carry through their opposition to Fianna Fáil in the next general election and destroy them once and for all because we have received an assurance <Col N="826" /> here from several Fianna Fáil speakers, and the last one in particular, Deputy Healy, that if they do not get their way in June of this year, or whenever the referendum will be held, they will try it again so long as they are in office.  In other words, we are to have a series of referenda on this proposal, wasting hundreds of thousands of Irish taxpayers' money, wasting the time, energies, skills and experience of Deputies and Senators and public administrators until Fianna Fáil get their way with the corrupt and wasteful and ridiculous system of first past the post, which may be suitable for horse racing and dog racing but is certainly not in the political race or in the governmental race or the parliamentary race, the system we know as the democratic system.  It may be all right to determine which animal is in best physical shape but it is no test of the expression of the people's will; it is no test or, shall I say, it is no fair or genuine test, of the support which any political group may genuinely have from the electorate.</P>
    <P>I take the Bills in the order in which they have been introduced and express my horror that the democratic and fundamental principle of one man, one vote is to be swept aside in favour of a system which, contrary to several Articles of the Constitution, is going to introduce gross inequality in political power in this country.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear Deputy Norton say earlier today that there was a duty, as he conceived it, on Members of this House to see that rural areas are not outvoted by vast hordes building up in the cities.  What are these vast hordes?  Are they of trees, of mountains, of rivers, of stones, of blocks, of animals, of foreigners? They are not.  They are of Irish people. They are of Irish people who have, under this Constitution, if it is anything more than a sham, under every conception of decency and democracy ever voiced in this country, the right to go to the polls convinced that their vote has the same power&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;as the vote of any other Irish man or woman in determining the destinies of this country.</P>
    <P>Why is it important that people, <Col N="827" /> whether they live in Dublin or Donegal, in Kerry or Carrickmines, should have that right?  It is important for this reason, that at the moment 100,000 families in this country, representing nearly half a million people, are living in hovels, in overcrowded dwellings, and they have a right to use the ballot box to protest against the Government who consider that their needs, their human and fundamental needs, must take second place while they monopolise the energies, the public institutions of this country, in an effort to foist upon the people an electoral system the people do not want or which, even if they did want, is of far less importance than the provision of decent housing for our people.</P>
    <P>Why is it important that people should have equality of political power?  It is because at the moment in this land in which a Government smugly boast of providing free education and of treating all the children of the nation equally, there are hundreds of thousands of families unable to educate their children because the economic circumstances of the home will not permit the parents to leave the children at school after 14 years of age and these parents and the children who are denied this education because of the deplorable economic standards and deplorably low income of the homes have a right to protest, whether they are crowded into the cities or sparsely distributed in the valleys and mountains of this country.  They have a right to protest with equal voice, irrespective of their geographical location.</P>
    <P>Why is it important that every man's vote should be equal?  It is important because in this land we have, under the traditional way of ascertaining the number of unemployed as distinct from the statistical device introduced 18 months ago, 78,000 unemployed, most of whom are in the cities and most of whom are from the vast horde which Deputy Norton and others consider are not entitled to an equal voice.  It is important because we believe that the unemployed are entitled to the same voice in determining the country's <Col N="828" /> future as are the wealthy or the well-to-do.  This effort to destroy the principle of one man, one vote must be defeated.  Why is an effort being made to justify the destruction of this priceless right of equality of political power?  It is because we have had so many years of Fianna Fáil government during which the rural parts have been denuded of their population.  The population has gone into the cities and towns and where it has not been stopped there, it has gone further, through our ports and airports, to Britain, America, Australia and across the world.</P>
    <P>This country is bleeding to death and rural Ireland, in particular, is bleeding to death.  It is because of that, because of the failure of Fianna Fáil, that we are now asked to confer a benefit on those who have bled the country, to confer a benefit on those who have sent the people away and are still sending them away at the rate of 40,000 to 50,000 a year.  We are asked to make it comfortable for them so that the areas in which the population has dwindled may give preferential representation to Fianna Fáil.  Moving this particular Amendment at this time, under the pretence of loving the people and wishing to know what is in their hearts, is a fraud when our social standards and the poor and under-privileged, are so neglected, when we have a situation in which the old age pensioners are expected to survive on 57/6 per week and when those people are told, as they were told recently by the Deputy Leader of the Government, An Tánaiste, the Minister for External Affairs, the man from outer space, in a nice quiet, select suburb of Greystones, that the old age pensioner could improve his lot to 77/6 a week, by having two schoolgoing children, when we have in power a Government who believe the answer to our social needs, to the distress of the old age pensioners, is to breed again in their sixties so as to have children going to school in their seventies.  When you have such a Government proposing an electoral trick like this, it is terribly important that the people give their answer and that we preserve a situation in which the old age pensioner's vote, be he <Col N="829" /> living in Dublin or Donegal, Castlegregory or Carrickmines, is of equal strength so that he may protest with equal vehemence against the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe that 70 per cent of our people who are obliged under archaic, Victorian laws to contribute to medical services from which they are totally excluded, unless they are so ill as to be in hospital, have a right to protest against a Government who again and again have promised to change the system and as often as they have promised have broken their promises. The masses of the people in this city, and in every other city and town, who are suffering under that system have the right to protest, particularly when in the towns and cities, there is no difficulty in finding medical aid as long as you are in a position to pay for it, and when there is no justification for delaying the introduction of a proper, comprehensive health service such as every country in Europe has, with the exception of Ireland and the Eskimos in Greenland.</P>
      <P>The Government stand condemned that at a time like this, when all Europe is concerned with the threat of serious curtailments in international trade, when we should be gearing ourselves to the needs which will descend upon us, whether we are or are not members of the European Economic Community, we are fiddling with the fortunes of this nation, wasting time and wasting talent for which our people now and hereafter will never forgive us, in asking the people to concentrate all their thoughts and energies on deciding in an unwanted referendum on an electoral system which, despite all the Government's efforts, is going to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe the Government deserve to be condemned because at a time when they should be doing something to reflate our economy, to increase employment&mdash;which for several weeks past has been decreasing at the rate of 1,500 to 2,000 a week&mdash;they are instead wasting time, energy and public money on this unwanted referendum. Every member of the Fine Gael Party, <Col N="830" /> including our leader, Deputy Cosgrave &mdash;if Deputy Norton had the courtesy to listen to him&mdash;believes that every man's vote should be equal and that every woman's vote should be equal and that every Irish pen when put to paper on election day should have the same influence in determining what policies this country is to implement, the same influence in deciding who is to represent the people, and the same influence in deciding who is to be the Government.</P>
    <P>It is because the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill seeks to destroy this principle that we are vehemently opposed to this proposal. We are certain that notwithstanding all the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Government to play down the weaknesses of rural bias, notwithstanding their efforts to try to stir up what should never be stirred up, animosity between town and country, when this referendum is over and the votes counted, the ordinary people will secure what has been fought for down the years, an equal say and an equal right for all Irishmen in the determination of the destinies of this country.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that there is some difficulty in achieving equality of political representation and the arguments which have been advanced since this very tiresome debate began are quite similar to the arguments advanced in 1959 in this Assembly, and in the other House, and similar to the arguments advanced by the then Minister for Local Government and his colleagues who gave sworn testimony in the High Court which was found to be unacceptable to the judge and two years after that what they said was impracticable was found to be quite practicable; and we have, since 1961, been operating under an electoral system which gives us, as far as practicable, equal representation, equal voting strength, equal political power, equal political influence irrespective of whether or not we live in the city or in the country&mdash;that is assuming that the Government were right in 1961 in drawing up the Act of that year on the basis of the 1956 Census.</P>
    <P>It is important, I think, that the <Col N="831" /> people should know that in 1961 the Fianna Fáil Government deliberately took away staff from the Central Statistics Office working on the Census and gave definite instructions to the Central Statistics Office to take all steps necessary to ensure that the 1961 Census results would not be published before the 1961 Electoral Bill became an Act of the Oireachtas and had been approved by the Supreme Court.  They did that knowing that, in 1961, the population had drifted from several parts of rural Ireland and the population had increased in several towns and cities.  The result was that, in fact, on the true figures of 1961 we even have an imbalance under the present Electoral Act in favour of some parts of Ireland and against others.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Local Government that there are 14 constituencies out of 38 which maintain a correct ratio between the population and the number of Deputies. There are 18 which have a population lower than the correct national average. There are six which are too high; that is allowing for a variation of 1,000 from the national average.  Efforts have been made to justify this situation on the ground that you have in Dublin a higher population of children than you have in rural Ireland.  But the figures which the Minister himself has given indicate that there is not any significant difference and there is certainly no difference, taking one area and comparing it with another, which would not be or could not be balanced out in a 12-year cycle, the period within which we are obliged by law to amend the arrangement of constituencies.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the electorate represents 56 per cent of the population.  In rural Ireland it represents 61 per cent.  The difference is, therefore, five per cent. What the Government are seeking to do in the Bill we are discussing is to provide a variation of 40 per cent for certain parts of the country and one can clearly see that it is a worthless argument to suggest that the justification for having a 40 per cent differential is a five per cent difference in the proportion of the electorate compared with population.  What the Government <Col N="832" /> seek to do now is what they did in 1959, something the courts subsequently condemned as being unconstitutional. When the High Court condemned it as being unconstitutional, the Government did not take the course, which was open to them, of appealing that decision to the Supreme Court because the Government saw clearly, and had to accept, that they were wrong in what they were then proposing.</P>
    <P>I should like now to compare a number of constituencies as arranged under the 1959 Electoral Bill so that Deputies will appreciate precisely what is now proposed.  First of all I should like to give a comparison of three-member constituencies.  The constituency of Galway South under the 1959 Act had a population of 49,726. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown had a population of 69,071.  The difference in population, with the disadvantage being against Dún Laoghaire, was 19,345. Now each of these constituencies was returning the same number of members to Dáil Éireann although the difference was 19,345.  On the basis of the figures in the 1956 Census Dún Laoghaire ought to have had four members and Galway South three.  What the Government are now asking the people to do is to approve of a system which will once again reintroduce this grossly unfair imbalance giving to one part of the country three representatives and to a population in another part of the country, which is entitled to four representatives, only three representatives. Again, another sample of the 1959 Act.  Galway North had a population of 50,724 and Dublin North-Central a population of 67,978, a difference of 17,254.  Both areas were to return exactly the same number of Deputies, although, on the figures, Dublin North-Central should have had an additional Deputy.</P>
    <P>I should like now to compare three-seat and four-seat constituencies.  The constituency of Donegal West had a population in 1956 of 50,101.  It had three representatives.  The constituency of Dublin South-East had a population of 91,833.  The difference was 41,732 and, for that difference, the 41,732 were to be represented by only one additional Deputy.  There you had <Col N="833" /> a situation in which the national average was about 20,000 and yet one Dublin constituency could get only one additional Deputy for an additional population of 41,732.</P>
    <P>I should like to compare three-seat and five-seat constituencies under the 1959 Act.  Dublin South-West, which I have the honour to represent for many years, had a population of 115,641; it was to have five Deputies. The constituency of Monaghan with 52,064 was to have three Deputies. For a difference of 63,577 Dublin was to receive only two additional Deputies.  You will recall my mentioning earlier that the rural constituency with 49,726 was to receive three Deputies; because 63,577 Irish people happened to live in Dublin they were to receive for that number only two representatives.</P>
    <P>Again, Dublin North-East, with a population of 113,812, was to have only five members and Kerry South, with a population of 50,144, was to receive three members.  For a difference of 63,668, Dublin again was to receive only two Deputies, although, on the figures, Dublin was entitled to three additional members.  It will be seen therefore that there is a difference of more than 30,000 per seat in each of these cases.</P>
    <P>Let us take now a comparison under the 1959 Act, which was deemed unconstitutional and which the Government now seek to enshrine in the Constitution here as our electoral system.  A comparison of four-seat constituencies: Kerry North, with a population of 71,928, was to receive four members; Dublin South-East, with a population of 91,833, 19,905 more than Kerry North, was to have the same number of Deputies, although on the figures it was entitled to receive one more. Donegal East, with a population of 71,958 and Dublin South-East, with a population of 91,833, a difference of 19,875, were, notwithstanding that difference, both to be represented by the same number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Let us compare&mdash;my last comparison under the 1959 Bill&mdash;four and five-seat constituencies.  Donegal East, with a population of 71,958, was to have four members; Dublin South-West, with a population of 115,641, a <Col N="834" /> difference of 43,683, was to have only one additional member, five seats&mdash; meaning that that 43,683 were to get only one Deputy at a time when the national average was a little above 20,000.  Kerry North, with a population of 71,928, had four members; Dublin North-East, with a population of 113,812, received five members.  A difference of 41,884 conferred on Dublin only one more seat at a time when the national average was just about 20,000 and Dublin North-East was entitled to two more.</P>
    <P>That is what we are asked now to get the Irish people to accept, a system which is going to give 40 per cent more representation to one part of the country over another.  It is interesting to read the remarks of the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, when he was on oath in the High Court, and I quote from the <i>Irish Press,</i> page 4, Thursday, 12th January, 1961.  Under the caption of &ldquo;One man, one vote&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Mr. Blaney, replying to Mr. MacBride, said he agreed with the principle of one man, one vote...</P>
    <P>You would not think that if you listened to the debate here over the past few weeks.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>and that that principle would become meaningless if any larger group of citizens were given votes which would count for one-and-a-half votes.  He would also agree that it would minimise the impact of that principle if some groups were given one-and-a-quarter votes.</P>
    <P>One-and-a-quarter votes would mean that one part of the country would have 25 per cent greater representation than another, but we are now being asked to approve a scheme which will give 40 per cent greater representation to one part of the country.  If 25 per cent would mean that the principle of one man, one vote would have its impact minimised, I wonder what nicety of the English language would the same Minister use now to describe a system under which 40 per cent additional representation would be given to one part of the country.</P>
    <P>We were again led to believe from <Col N="835" /> the comments of the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, that he was obliged to follow electoral districts, electoral boundaries and electoral divisions and that these could not be tampered with, that any electoral system which we were to introduce or any division of constituencies would be carried out under existing electoral divisions.  Let us again refer to the sworn testimony of the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government. I quote from the same source. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>He thought there was some provision whereby district electoral divisions could be made or altered by an order from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to confirm that the Minister is right.  All this thing we hear about administrative difficulties in fairly distributing population and Deputies is so much tripe, because a Ministerial Order can be made to make any new arrangement fit in with what is fair and proper.  On the same occasion, the Minister was asked if he had not expressed the view:</P>
    <P>There should be a bias of representation in favour of the rural as opposed to the urban community. Mr. Blaney said that was not so, and added that the fact that the end product should appear to be biassed in favour of the rural community did not mean that that was one of the matters which had been taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>If the end product was not taken into consideration and if the consequences of what was done were not taken into consideration, and if they have not now been taken into consideration, they should have been and they should now be.  It is the duty of the Members of this House and of Seanad Éireann and of the Irish people to understand the end product of anything they do, and the end product of what is now proposed is to disqualify a large section of the Irish people from having equal political strength with their neighbours and with their fellow citizens, and that is what we have to consider.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is an interesting document, and apart from the Articles which it is now sought to amend, there <Col N="836" /> are other Articles which would require amendment if the Constitution is not to be a more contradictory document than it in many respects already is. Article 16.1. 2º reads:</P>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Section 1.3º of the same article reads:</P>
    <P>No law shall be enacted placing any citizen under disability or incapacity for membership of Dáil Éireann on the ground of sex or disqualifying any citizen from voting at an election for members of Dáil Éireann on that ground.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is very proper that the Constitution should exclude sex as a qualification for voting, but I think the whole tenor of the article in question is that there should be equality in voting for all Irish citizens, irrespective of sex or any other consideration.  The disqualifications which are allowed by law are applicable to criminals and lunatics, and it is difficult to argue that either of those should be qualified, although indeed some amendment was made in it in recent times which might be an explanation for the continuance of Fianna Fáil in office.  However, the whole tenor of the Constitution is to give equality of say in the nation's affairs.</P>
    <P>It is our argument that to introduce a geographical qualification is to revert to the nineteenth century when only the 40/- freeholders had a vote, to revert to the eighteenth century when only members of a particular religious minority had a vote, to revert to the dim, bad old days when everybody was not equal under the law and when the equality of people in legal and political matters was not accepted.  We are now to insert into our Constitution that the geographical basis is to be determined on whether we are to have a full value for our vote or a diminished value for our vote.  We consider this a wholly unworthy principle, one which must be <Col N="837" /> rejected and we will fight the Government vigorously in the country and in the cities and towns on this issue.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that we should have single-seat constituencies because of convenience but it is not clearly stated whether it is the convenience of the existing Members of this House or the public we have in mind.  One would think from all this that this was a vast continent over which one had to travel thousands of miles to our constituencies, one in which you had to carry with you a couple of bodyguards going into the wilderness to the far-flung outposts of a vast empire.  One would think that Deputies had to travel days and nights in extremely arduous conditions to reach their constituencies. We are one of the smallest states in the world, one of the puniest of states from the geographical point of view. There must be few countries in the world in which Deputies are so accessible to their constituents and in which they can reach their constituents with so little inconvenience.</P>
    <P>In case my remarks are challenged, I would like to quote from a table used in evidence in the High Court case challenging, before we could accept that such distances were valid reasons to alter the size of constituencies, the 1959 Act which was subsequently condemned and which will show the vast distances, the tremendous journeys that have to be undertaken by the members of this House in the discharge of their public duties.  It will be seen how it is that these journeys are beyond the capacity of Deputies to endure and why we are now asking the Irish people to relieve them of these tremendous journeys.  The greatest distance by road miles in any of the constituencies arranged under the 1959 Bill were as follows: Carlow-Kilkenny, 65; Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, 12; Dublin, 36; Kildare, 49; Laoighis-Offaly, 64; Longford-Westmeath, 52; Louth, 40; Meath, 53; Wexford, 61; Wicklow, 49; Clare, 79; West Cork, 76; East Cork, 47; Mid-Cork, 71; North Kerry, 68; South Kerry, 65; West Limerick, 44; East Limerick 43; North Tipperary, 47; South Tipperary, 49; Waterford, 59; West Galway, 63; South Galway, 50; North Galway, 47; South Mayo, <Col N="838" /> 66; North Mayo, 72; Roscommon 66; Sligo-Leitrim, 79; Cavan, 67; West Donegal, 78; East Donegal, 77; Monaghan, 42.</P>
    <P>The distribution of constituencies under the 1961 Act under which we are now operating is very similar, except that in some instances they have been reduced rather than extended.  There is the factual situation.  The longest distance in any constituency is 79 miles and that is in Clare.  Maybe this is why Fianna Fáil are so strong in Clare, that people there do not know what poor Deputies they have, and that if they were nearer to their Deputies, they might see their deficiencies.  Is that the true situation?  Even taking those distances, we would have to assume that the public representatives in all cases live at the extremity of their constituencies and were obliged daily to traverse the whole constituency to the furthermost point away.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this suggestion is the utmost tripe and the sooner the people realise what a fraud it is to suggest that Deputies have to travel these impossible distances the better.  The fact is that in most cases one or more of the public representatives will be situated in the middle of the constituency so that on an average, the longest distance these representatives have to travel is 30 or 40 miles.  There is no obligation on Dáil Éireann to meet in Dublin, and the Constitution provides that in certain circumstances it may meet in other places.  If some Deputies find it inconvenient to journey to Dublin and that these journeys impose impossible obligations on them for which they are not adequately remunerated, the remedy is not to go traversing the country in a referendum but to see that the Dáil meets in other places.  I am sure that the Deputies from Dublin would have no great objection to the Dáil meeting in Cork or Galway, if Deputies so resolved. There is no justification for interfering with the whole national set-up in order to suit the convenience of Deputies who are too lazy to travel around their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>One would think from what has been said here that all Deputies outside Dublin reside in their constituencies. <Col N="839" /> The truth is the contrary. Apart from members of the Government who may be obliged to be in Dublin for three or four days every week, and that is as long as many of them spend in Dublin, there are 20 other Deputies who do not live in their constituencies.  This does not appear to make them inaccessible to their constituents and does not prevent their constituents from re-electing them.  Of all the ráiméis that has been spoken in this debate the most unworthy is that which speaks of inconvenience to electors or the inaccessibility of Deputies because they are so remote from their constituents.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to some more remarks of the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government in the High Court in 1961.  I quote now from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Friday, January 13th, 1961.  On that occasion it was put to the Minister for Local Government that the constituencies of Wexford and Longford-Westmeath had populations of roughly 87,000.  The Minister was asked if there was any reason for one of the constituencies having five seats and the other having only four. The Minister said there was a reason. Wait until you hear the reason.  He said:</P>
    <P>When they came to the allocation for these constituencies</P>
    <P>&mdash;we are not told who &ldquo;they&rdquo; are&mdash; there was one seat left, and it had to go to either one.  Obviously, they could not be given a seat each because the ceiling had been reached.  The population of Wexford was 87,259 and of Longford-Westmeath 87,071, which left the balance in favour of Wexford.  Therefore it got the seat.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Fianna Fáil got a seat which they would not have got if the seat had gone to Longford-Westmeath. One would have thought that on the ground of inaccessibility, Longford-Westmeath should have got it rather than Wexford, but apparently that was not to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also asked on that occasion if it was a coincidence that a group of four counties&mdash;Donegal, Mayo, Kerry and Galway&mdash;in which a <Col N="840" /> strong predominance of Government Party Deputies were returned, should be given a high ratio of representation. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It was difficult to say,</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am sure it was difficult to say; he was on oath, you see&mdash;</P>
    <P>because of the word coincidence but taking the question as it was put to him, he would say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The word coincidence would seem to raise in his mind that the question of the Act and the revision of the constituencies was something that happened out of the blue.</P>
    <P>If ever a man was trying to get out of a tight corner, here was a perfect instance of it.  The Minister was asked to explain why it was that Monaghan, with a ratio of 17,354 per Deputy, should be left as it was, while Louth, with a ratio of 23,064, which adjoined it, should be left as it was in the 1959 Bill and both counties have the same number of Deputies.  This was the Minister's beautiful reply:</P>
    <P>The great difference in the economics of the two counties was also a factor which had to be considered.  He did not agree that the two counties could be taken together to form one constituency, because the way of life in the two counties was so different that a deputy would be almost ineffective because there was a conflict in the interests of the two counties in many matters which would arise, and it was an almost impossible barrier to the joining of the two counties.</P>
    <P>Here we had this drama being enacted, this mosaic of a conflict of interests between the people of Monaghan and Louth.  One can visualise these people out with their guns in bloody feuds. One can see the people of Louth and Monaghan so antagonistic to one another that they will not enter one another's counties, not even enter one another's homes, that people from Monaghan will never marry people from Louth and <i>vice versa.</i> Was there ever a more ridiculous fantasy painted then and now to justify a system which is to give advantageous representation to counties in which the Fianna Fáil Party happen to be strong?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> The Minister gave another wonderful example of the bloody and irreconcilable feuds that exist between people in Ireland.  He said there was a further instance in his own county of Donegal and went on:</P>
    <P>If a Deputy were to represent the whole county of Donegal and a discussion on agricultural matters arose, he would find himself in an awkward position.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is good from the man who was to become Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries later on.  He must have been in many an awkward spot&mdash;</P>
    <P>He would be representing two different elements in the same county. East Donegal was, by and large, a crop-producing area, which sold to West Donegal, so that a Deputy would be in a position that he could not say anything one way or the other.</P>
    <P>&mdash;I do not think I could ever accuse the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the former Minister for Local Government, of being unable to say anything one way or the other&mdash;</P>
    <P>While it was true, he said, that East Donegal was a crop producing area, there were many there who also bought, but the general mind was that what was good for the area as a whole was good for them also. They would be aware of the common good that would come to them from the general prosperity of the area.</P>
    <P>Are we one nation or are we not?  Do we not pride ourselves on the common bond of being Irish?  Are we all proud of our Irish parentage?  Do we all wish to see our Irish nation develop as a nation, or do we wish to separate it into warring clans?  Do we wish to divide the people into the haves and the have-nots, into the crop producers and the crop buyers, into calf producers and beast fatteners, into the rural Irish and the city Irish, and do we wish to maintain those divisions?  Apparently, the Fianna Fáil Party believe that this is a virtue, and not only a virtue but a necessity.  They swore in court, although the evidence was not acceptable to the judge, that all this was necessary, that it would be impracticable to devise an electoral system which <Col N="842" /> would not take cognisance of the lack of common purpose between the people of Monaghan and the people of Louth and which would not allow for the fact that the poor Deputy representing all Donegal would be impotent because he was called upon to represent the crop producers of the east and the crop purchasers of the west.  I doubt very much if you, Sir, who have the privilege of representing Donegal, would go all the way with those remarks.  I can certainly imagine there is a much greater difference of opinion on many matters between the people in the town of Lifford and the people up on the mountainside.  I am sure the difference between those people on many matters is much greater than that of somebody who happens to live on the west side of the mountain and those who live on the east side of the mountain.</P>
    <P>You may very well consider this trivial stuff unworthy of Parliament, and that it is not fundamental.  I would consider that this is a valid viewpoint, but this is the reason which was given in 1959, in 1961 and which has been given here ever since this debate began&mdash;it was given in the sworn testimony of the then Minister for Local Government&mdash;that these were things which we should imagine to exist in this country and that it was all this fantasy which should be the basis of the electoral system.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Local Government was giving sworn testimony in court, he agreed that representation in Donegal West was worth approximately 38 per cent more than representation in Louth and that representation in Monaghan was worth approximately 34 per cent more than Louth.  He agreed that County Kerry was entitled to six Deputies only, instead of the seven provided for in the Act.  He agreed also that it was what he called theoretically possible to provide for a mathematical result by one of two methods: by making Kerry a single constituency, or transferring 16 district electoral divisions and a population of 10,622 from north to south Kerry.  So we have a situation in which the Minister said in court that these <Col N="843" /> things were impossible in 1961, and in the Bill which was subsequently introduced here later that year, and approved here and in the Seanad and in the Supreme Court, it was found possible to overcome these things and to devise an electoral system which would be fair and give equal say and equal representation to all sections of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We say that the previous contentions of the Government have been shown to be false and, on that account, we think it is wholly improper that they should now try to resurrect these unworthy arguments which were so clearly defeated before.  We do not think the Irish people will approve of them.</P>
    <P>The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill in Cuid II says:</P>
    <P>... regard shall be had at a determination of constituencies to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and the need for securing convenient areas of representation and, subject to those considerations, to the desirability of avoiding the overlapping by constituencies of the boundaries of administrative Counties (other than boundaries between those Counties and County Boroughs).</P>
    <P>Why are the Government displaying such anxiety to maintain sacrosanct and secure the county boundaries for electoral purposes when, month in and month out, we hear from Government spokesmen that they have proposals to break down the county boundaries for administrative purposes?  They have indicated that those county boundaries, which have their origin away back in our mystic past, have little relationship with present day requirements.  If that be so in administrative matters, why is it sought now to maintain those county boundaries for electoral purposes?  I respectfully submit this is an effort to pander to parochial jealousies and no more.</P>
    <P>It is of some particular significance that the Commission to supervise the arrangement of the constituencies, consisting of three members from the Government side, three members from <Col N="844" /> the Opposition side and a High Court judge, is provided for in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. In other words, if it should happen by some peculiar stroke of luck that the Government should win the referendum on the Third Amendment and lose it on the Fourth Amendment, there will not be any Commission to arrange the boundaries which will give representation to parts of Ireland with 16,700 of a population against 23,300 in other parts.  This gerrymandering is to be done by the Government themselves.</P>
    <P>The figures I have quoted of what was done in the 1959 Bill are a clear indication of what they will do, because there will be no Commission to supervise it, and no independent assessment if there should be disagreement between Government and Opposition.  What will happen under the Third Amendment, if they get away with disfranchising 40 per cent of the people in the urban areas?  They will create new constituencies which will meet all the fantastic notions which the Minister for Local Government illustrated in his evidence in the High Court.  This is a clear case of seeking a mandate from the people to gerrymander the country to their own advantage. If it were otherwise, why did the Government not provide for the Commission in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill?</P>
    <P>Is it that the Government, having considered the amount of public condemnation of their package deal, have decided that on the balance of probabilities they could carry the Third Amendment but could not carry the Fourth Amendment?  In other words, they might get away with giving advantageous representation to certain constituencies without having a Commission to supervise the setting up of the constituencies, but they would not get away with the proposal to abolish PR.  I think that is the truth.  I think they have taken a calculated risk.  They hope to carry the Third Amendment, and they have decided that they will be defeated on the Fourth Amendment to abolish PR.  In defiance of the finding of the courts in 1961 that the 1959 Bill was grossly unjust, they hope to get <Col N="845" /> around those findings by carrying this amendment which is, in fact, a blank cheque to gerrymander the country to suit their own convenience.</P>
    <P>Who is ever to challenge this?  Who is ever to question successfully in the courts or anywhere else, any arrangement of the constituencies which allows for consideration to be given to the extent and accessibility of constituencies, which is drawn up on the basis of securing convenient areas of representation, and which is drawn up having strict regard to the county boundaries?  That is what they want. They want to do what they did in 1959 &mdash;to take from any Irish man and Irish woman who moves east, 40 per cent of the political power they previously had, and to do that without any interference by any section of the community, and without any High Court judge or any other impartial person saying they should not do it.</P>
    <P>No judge will be called upon to decide whether or not the consideration is overdone as to the extent and accessibility of the constituencies.  No judge will be called upon to say that too much attention was given to securing convenient areas of representation because it will be said that these matters come under the Constitution and as a result of the referendum were given to Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to consider, that the people deliberately avoided setting up an independent Commission with a High Court judge to determine the fairness or otherwise of any such arrangement.  I think this two Bill system which keeps away any independent Commission from the arrangement of the constituencies, if the Third Amendment Bill is carried, clearly indicates that this Government hope to carry that on the basis of developing in this country a war between the countryside and the cities, and on the basis of all this unnecessary disharmony, to create this system of gerrymandering to suit their own convenience.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the all-Party Committee which considered the Constitution did not make any recommendation on the issue of the system of election but did make a unanimous <Col N="846" /> recommendation that any change&mdash;and I repeat the words &ldquo;any change&rdquo;&mdash; should involve a boundary commission. Here, in one of the few cases in which the all-Party Committee made a unanimous recommendation, that recommendation is being ignored.  The Government are endeavouring to make a change and are trying clearly to avoid having a boundary commission.  This seems to me to nullify all the professions of good faith on the part of the Taoiseach and his appointees.</P>
    <P>The Government said that they were prompted to introduce this Bill because of the non-use of the system of proportional representation in recent times. They said that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were not using the system of the transferable vote and that an increasing number of voters voting for Opposition candidates were not using PR.  I hope they will read the results in both Clare and Wicklow last Thursday.  The Clare result is even more significant than Wicklow so far as PR is concerned as it proves that Fianna Fáil voters are using PR. When the Fianna Fáil candidate's surplus was distributed, it was found that there were practically no plumpers in the Fianna Fáil vote and that the surplus was generously distributed between the Labour and Fine Gael candidates, clearly indicating that Fianna Fáil voters are using PR.  Despite their alleged lack of intelligence and education, they are quite capable of understanding from one to three and, I suppose, counting up to ten, although they seldom have that number of candidates in Clare.</P>
    <P>Again, in Wicklow, the voters clearly indicated that they were capable of using and wanted to use the PR system and it is because they used that system when it was put to them as an issue that Fine Gael won the Wicklow by-election. I admit the Government might well have been tempted by the inactivity of some electors in recent times, once they had plumped for their particular favourite, but I think that when this matter has been an issue, as it certainly was an issue in both these by-elections, the Government got their clear answer, and notwithstanding the protests of the Taoiseach and other members and spokesmen in Fianna <Col N="847" /> Fáil, PR was one of the issues, if not the most important issue, in these elections, and particularly so in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that because of this and because of the trend which was clearly indicated as the canvassers of the various Parties went about their door-knocking missions during the campaign, the Fianna Fáil people have decided not to look into their own hearts in accordance with the old tradition because, apparently, the heart of Jack Lynch is not to be trusted or they would not be engaging the services of an independent market research agency. We could save them the bother and the cost.  We think that Clare and Wicklow have given a clear indication and that there is no need for the Government to go any further.  The people want to keep PR and they will keep PR and, that is why the Government are now convinced that the Fourth Amendment is going to be defeated.  As a result of this market research operation, we shall probably find that the Irish people want the fair, full-value voting system and that the main effort in this referendum will be to stir up in rural Ireland the antipathy of people to their friends and neighbours, to their sons and daughters and their cousins in the cities and towns of the country.  Next July, or when the referendum is held, I venture to say I shall be able to say: I told you so.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Fianna Fáil Party have declared an anxiety to maintain for the Irish people a large number of public representatives.  The present Taoiseach and members of the Government during this debate, the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and before him, Eamonn de Valera, explained their difficulties in appointing Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries from their Party and they said that if the membership of Dáil Éireann were to be reduced, it would become increasingly difficult to create Governments.  Let them speak for themselves.  No doubt they have great difficulty in selecting members for their Government.  Goodness knows, all one has to do is to look at the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries <Col N="848" /> we have.  They are the most unfortunate excuses for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries that could be devised in any country, be it democracy or dictatorship.  But that is their concern.  If they find that difficulty, let them resign and tomorrow morning there will be in office an able Government. There will be no difficulty in getting a well-qualified Government in the Fine Gael Party out of the 47 we have.  We would not need to increase the number to the number which Fianna Fáil for the time being have.</P>
    <P>If the anxiety is to have a large number of public representatives so that the people of Ireland will be able to know that there is there a public representative who will attend to their needs, I have a simple way of increasing the number of our public representatives by about 70 or 75 without adding one penny to public expenditure.  At present some 70 or 75 Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are members of local authorities and if we need more public representatives, which I doubt, if the people are starving for them, down on their knees weeping because they cannot find a TD or a councillor to represent them, there is a perfectly simple remedy available&mdash;provide in the Constitution or elsewhere that no Member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann may be a a member of a local authority.  You will find that throughout the land the people will have 70 more public representatives overnight, without any additional cost to the Exchequer.  It is true that the people would have much better service because you would have two people doing the same job and doing it at the same cost as is now being paid to the people who are doing it.  I mean this perfectly seriously.  It is high time that serious consideration was given to this matter and the steps necessary to bring this about were taken.</P>
    <P>It is provided in our Constitution, at Article 15, section 14, that no person may be at the same time a member of both Houses of the Oireachtas and if any person who is already a member of either House becomes a member of the other House, he shall forthwith <Col N="849" /> be deemed to have vacated his first seat.  What we need now, perhaps is a Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, although I do not think it is necessary to write it into the Constitution but, if it is necessary, let us consider it and I believe the Bill would be carried with an overwhelming, massive majority of the Irish people. The Bill would provide that no person may at the same time be a member of either House of the Oireachtas and a member of a local authority and if any person who is already a member of either House becomes a member of a local authority he shall forthwith be deemed to have vacated his first seat.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if such provision is made in the Constitution, there will be no ambition on the part of any Member of this House or of Seanad Éireann to become an unpaid member of a local authority.  There is a simple device, a simple scheme, to provide additional representation for all those far-flung regions of our Irish empire which are so inaccessible that we have to corrupt the whole basis of our parliamentary system in order to provide an accessible public representative for the people of those areas.</P>
    <P>We are told that Members of the Dáil are grossly overworked in having to listen to representations and deal with them.  I think it is true to say that members of local authorities have a similar burden of representations to process.  Most members of this House who are also members of local authorities were members of local authorities before they became Members of the House.  Most such representatives will testify that becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann only marginally increased the burden of ward heeling which they were expected to perform.</P>
    <P>I did it in the reverse.  I was a Member of Dáil Éireann before I became a member of a local authority and I found a negligible increase in the burden of representations which I had to make when I became a member of a local authority.  Indeed, I could not attribute it to my becoming a member of a local authority.  Rather could I attribute it, in all humility to the reputation I was getting for <Col N="850" /> successfully processing representations. Suffice it to say that, year in, year out, the burden of this work continues to increase and I would expect it to diminish if I were to lose either of the public offices which I hold at the moment and another man were to occupy one of those posts.</P>
    <P>Let us seriously consider, once and for all, the introduction of a prohibition on Members of Dáil Éireann or of Seanad Éireann being members of local authorities.  I would be the first to acknowledge the advantages of allowing people to be members of both the local authority and of the Dáil or Seanad Éireann.  It means that Members of this House and, indeed, of the Seanad, are constantly in touch with local affairs and with local needs and if they cannot be pursued at local level, as indeed many of them cannot because we have very little local government left, if we are to understand by local government a system under which local wishes would be met at local level, they can be pursued in the Oireachtas.  I believe that the balance of advantage would lie with a system which would declare Members of the Dáil and Seanad to be ineligible for membership of local authorities. This would be one genuine way of building up a reserve of young people to replace Deputies and Senators and to replace Ministers because, if all the Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann were to withdraw from the local authorities their positions would have to be taken by other persons outside.  I believe that their positions would in the main be undertaken by young people who would have a wonderful opportunity of acquiring skill and experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Tully says, it may well be that there are selfish reasons why Members of the Dáil and Seanad would not wish for such a system.  We have had enough display of selfishness from the Government side in relation to these proposals to be thoroughly sick of selfish public representatives.  If the Government are <Col N="851" /> genuine in their desire to encourage young people to enter politics, then the system and scheme that I suggest is the one which ought to be introduced and applied.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of make-believe was engaged in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he said that the system which they seek to foist upon us, the British system, would encourage youth to enter politics.  Is it not common knowledge that the House upstairs is the graveyard of old TDs who have been replaced in their own constituencies under the system of PR by young people from their own Parties standing against them and defeating them in their own constituencies? PR is a system which ought to appeal to the young people of Ireland because it is a system which enables youth to stand as candidates and to challenge in open, fair combat the old and hoary and, perhaps, lazy warriors who think they can sit comfortably on their quotas here until the Lord takes them into another constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen if you replace the multi-seat Constituency which allows young people to come forward and to stand against the elders of their own Party and other Parties?  If we introduce the system of single-seat constituencies, nothing will ever move an old warrior of the popular Party in that constituency until he decides to resign or the Lord interferes to bring him, as I say, into another constituency. There will be no opportunity for the young people of the Party to challenge the incumbent on his home ground.  There will be no opportunity for the young people of this country to stand in single-seat constituencies.  The opportunity for youth will diminish rather than increase under a system which will facilitate the old warrior to remain unchallenged and supreme as long as the Party following in that constituency remains and, as we know, in any country which has the so-called straight system of voting there are some constituencies where no human influence can ever succeed in removing a Deputy of a particular political Party, for the simple reason that the <Col N="852" /> traditional loyalties of that constituency will be behind a particular Party and, no matter who the standard bearer of the Party may be in that constituency, that person will remain.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of the system which Deputy Colley is recommending to the youth of Ireland, a system which will deny to youth the opportunity which it has had all over the years of meeting the old warriors on an equal footing and presenting themselves to the electorate, on an equal footing, with an equal opportunity, to seek the support of the people.  Not alone have we the rest home for defeated old TDs upstairs but, thank God, throughout the length and breadth of the country there are many cases of former Members of this House who had been defeated, not so much by their political opponents but by younger people from their own Party, because the present system of proportional representation facilitates young people.</P>
    <P>I am not one to be so churlish as to lack appreciation for all that our elders have done, or one who argues that service should not be recognised by continuing support.  In certain cases I believe it is merited and I believe a Parliament which failed to maintain a balance between youth and experience might well not be the best Parliament suited to the country's needs, particularly a country like ours which has such a relatively old population.  What we in Fine Gael strongly believe in is a system which will allow youth and experience to meet on equal terms and allow them to go before the electorate with the same opportunity.  If you do away with PR, that opportunity will be gone and this House will forever consist of old, experienced ones, the conservative ones who do not want a change, who are anxious to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, who are satisfied with things as they are, and resent the criticism, the energy and the ambition and the dissatisfaction of youth.</P>
    <P>All that we have all tried to work for could be destroyed overnight if this Assembly of ours were to become populated, as it would under the single-seat constituency system, with safe seats for old men, old in their ways, <Col N="853" /> old in their outlook and old in their memories.  That is not the way in which we can build up this country into a progressive, dynamic force.  There are a number of mis-descriptions of the electoral systems.  We should consider the worth of votes under the proportional representation system and under the British system which the Government are suggesting.  Proportional representation is a system which gives full value to every vote.  The British system is a system which entirely destroys the value of a substantial number of votes and makes them absolutely worthless.  It is a system which gives an enhanced value to a minority of votes.  Under the British system, which the Government are suggesting we should introduce, you can have a situation in which 30 per cent of the electorate can have full value for their votes, and in fact they can have over treble value for their votes because those votes can control the entire representation in a particular constituency, and if a similar percentage vote is cast throughout the country, that 30 per cent will control 100 per cent of the representation, leaving the other 70 per cent votes cast absolutely worthless because they would be unable to elect one representative if less than 30 per cent of the votes were cast for any particular rival.  That is why I say the British system is a system which makes the majority of votes absolutely worthless and gives an enhanced value to a privileged minority.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the system of PR is a system of full value votes and the reason I say that is that if a person votes for a candidate who is unable to reach the quota, who is unable to be elected on his first preferences, that vote is not destroyed as it will be under the British system.  Such a person gets an opportunity of expressing a second preference and so on, so that the vote never loses its value and it becomes effective when and only when it is cast in favour of somebody who is able to get a sufficient quota to have him elected, or is cast for somebody who although unable to reach the quota is higher than any other person who is unable to reach it. <Col N="854" /> The Minister for Local Government endeavoured to make play of the system of PR which he alleged gave preferential treatment to people who voted for outsiders and gave them more say in the selection of TDs than people who voted for the most popular candidates.  That is a complete fallacy and I am sure he knows it. The person who votes for an outsider under PR does not have that vote taken into account at all in determining the representation of the constituency until the vote is transferred to some person who is in the running.</P>
    <P>That is why I call the PR system the full value system.  It is a system which ensures that every vote cast, if proportional representation is used by all the electorate, will achieve its full value and have a say in the election of candidates.  May I reverse the procedure for a moment?  The Minister for Local Government did not deal with what occurs under the system of PR where the most popular candidate gets more than the quota of votes, where the most popular candidate may get, for instance, two quotas or nearly three quotas.  This happened in Cork in the last general election when the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, got a handsome number of votes, and happened in Dublin when Deputy Lemass was Taoiseach, and it also happened in Dublin when Deputy John A. Costello was Taoiseach, when he got practically two quotas.  In such cases, it could be said there was a waste of votes, that more votes were cast for a man than he needed.  But those votes did not go to waste under the PR system.  They were transferred, in the main, to the candidates of the same Party as the most popular candidate, so that the electorate were able to use their votes to full advantage and to get two TDs into their constituency rather than elect only one.</P>
    <P>Under the British system, you could have a situation in which a vast number of people could vote for a particular candidate and in so doing, would be wasting votes, in so doing, would be concentrating on one man, votes which could be used, if there was a multi-seat constituency, to elect somebody else to represent their interests <Col N="855" /> and to reflect their wish to elect a particular Party.  On that account the British system will be seen therefore to be a wasteful system, a system which gives preferential representation to a minority, which enhances the value of the votes of that minority and renders worthless the votes of the majority in many cases.  On that account it is a system which is grossly unfair and which does not reflect the true mind of the people.  The British system is a system which would devalue the vote.  Our vote would become, like the British £, devalued and that would mean that many votes would be below full value.</P>
    <P>It is utterly unnecessary to have that situation when we have a system here which has operated so successfully and which has given full value to every vote.  The system of proportional representation is a system which cannot give advantageous value to any vote because it is impossible for any person to get elected until all the votes have been sorted out so that, in the final analysis, it can be determined who is the most popular.  One of the difficulties which have arisen and one of the grounds which are being improperly used to criticise proportional representation stems from the undue concentration which has been given to first preference votes rather than to the final count.  First preference votes under proportional representation are of far less significance than the final count when the system has been teased out and the true, effective will of the people ascertained.</P>
    <P>I should like to see greater concentration in future, when proportional representation has been preserved, to the final counts because they are what really matter.  Proportional representation is a system which allows us to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, to sort out the people's minds into an orderly arrangement and that orderly arrangement has been built up here through many viscissitudes, political, military, economic and social; it has given us a stable Parliament and stable government in a much shorter period than that has taken in more sophisticated societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> There are some remarks of Government spokesmen with which I should like to deal.  The Minister, at column 397 of volume 233, said:</P>
    <P>In 1959, a revision of constituencies was made in accordance with the Article of the Constitution which provides that such a revision must be made at least once in every 12 years...</P>
    <P>In fact, the 1959 revision of constituencies was late.  It was made outside the 12-year period and, as we know, it was subsequently condemned as being unconstitutional, unfair, unjust, improper and not achieving equality as far as practicable between all the people.  There was a 14-year period between 1947 and the 1961 revision of the constituencies.  The Minister reflected somewhat on the decision of Judge Budd at column 398 when he said:</P>
    <P>Justice Budd's decision was, in effect, that the revision of constituencies was a purely statistical and administrative problem....</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is, as I pointed out earlier, that the decision of Mr. Justice Budd was never challenged by the Government and, in a most comprehensive judgment, running to 58 pages, Mr. Justice Budd made it clear that he did not consider it was sufficient to be concerned only with statistical and administrative matters in the revision of constituencies.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister for Local Government should endeavour to misinterpret the decision of Mr. Justice Budd in what is one of the most comprehensive judgments ever issued by our courts.</P>
    <P>Again, at column 399, the Minister reiterated his improper and incorrect interpretation of what Mr. Justice Budd said in stating that mathematical accuracy was the only consideration according to the judicial interpretation of the Article of the Constitution.  That is not what Mr. Justice Budd said and that is not what we are suggesting either.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting&mdash;I will make the point without comment&mdash;to note that, despite the poor opinion the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="857" /> other Government spokesmen have of High Court judges&mdash;they propose to appoint one of these as chairman of the Commission to establish the boundaries, if the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution is carried.  I suspect, as I said earlier, that the Government have given up all hope of carrying the Fourth Amendment and this is so much windowdressing.  Perhaps I might comment to this extent: in ordinary, everyday judicial matters, we have every reason to be grateful for the services we receive from the judges and justices presiding over our courts.  Their decisions have, in the main, been impartial.</P>
    <P>An entirely different set of circumstances will arise, however, if a High Court judge is asked to adjudicate on the revision of constituencies because this is substantially a political matter and judges, unless they be totally ignorant of public affairs, will not be unaware of the associations between certain geographical locations and the Deputies who represented them or aspiring Deputies who may wish to represent them in the future.  Our system of appointing judges is the most political ridden system operating in this country.</P>
    <P>In most other sectors, other than the employment of unskilled workers, we have succeeded, thanks be to God, with the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission in doing away with political patronage, but, for some strange reason, we have maintained a system of political patronage in the appointment of our judges.  It is a system I have never been able to understand and it is one I cannot justify.  If this system were used for the appointment of any other officers in the land, it would be called political corruption and I think that is the description to apply to our system of judicial appointments.  We apparently consider it proper to use this corrupt system of political appointments in relation to our judges.</P>
    <P>I do not say that, once they are appointed, they are politically corrupt. They are imbued with the high standards of the legal profession, which they serve for many years before their <Col N="858" /> appointment, but the fact is that of all political persons, our judges are possibly the most politically conscious because they owe their appointment, in the first instance, to political allegiance.  It looks like tempting Providence to ask such persons, so politically conscious in that they have the goodwill of the Government of the day in their appointment, to forget those to whom they owe their judicial appointments.  It is, I think, fair to comment on that.  It is not a reflection on our judiciary so to comment.  We will be asking them to decide what will in the main be issues in which there will be conflicting Party interests and it would be difficult for even a Solomon, I think, to give an impartial judgment in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>At column 410, the Minister says that the considerations to be taken into account in determining the boundaries of constituencies are limited to what he called administrative boundaries and geographical features.  Now, geographical features are not explicitly mentioned in either of the Bills.  There is mention of extent and accessibility.  Accessibility may be governed by geographical features but the Minister has certainly gone further in column 410 than either of the Bills goes.  In the same column, the Minister challenged what he called the attempt of the Opposition Parties to divide the country along the lines of rural areas versus urban areas.  He called it a fraudulent argument.  He said: &ldquo;It is completely unnecessary and a completely undesirable thing to do.&rdquo; I agree with him.  He says that for selfish and ill-conceived reasons, the Opposition Parties are deliberately trying to do this.  Of course we are not but we consider that we have a duty to identify exactly what the Government are trying to do.  As I pointed out in the earlier part of my speech from examples of what was done under the 1959 Act, that is exactly what the Government plan to do.  They can dress it up anyway they want to.  They have been clever enough to leave it without any geographical basis in the Bill itself but the reality of the situation, the end result, which the then Minister for <Col N="859" /> Local Government spoke of in sworn testimony in 1961, is to establish a system which will put the rural areas in conflict with urban areas.  If that is a fraudulent argument, then our understanding of what is fraud is not the same as that of the Minister for Local Government but that does not surprise us.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the disedifying experience of the long counts in the Longford-Westmeath and Dublin North-East constituencies in the last general election.  I do not know what was disedifying about the counts in either of these places.  I was personally present at the count in Dublin North-East and found nothing disedifying whatsoever.  We did see that there was room for human error in the election system.  I am not aware that human error has been excluded in any election system in which humans vote.  It certainly cannot be excluded but the amount of error&mdash;if such one calls it&mdash; was so marginally small as to be utterly insignificant.  It certainly was not statistically significant and was not politically significant.  What I think is significant is that what is alleged by the Government to be a complicated system can work so well and that far less than one per cent of the votes cast are ever disqualified on the grounds of being bad votes.</P>
    <P>I think that is not surprising.  There is nobody under 71 years of age in this country who has voted under any system other than PR.  It is not surprising that people with that long experience behind them, even if they have not received advanced education, know how the system works and are able to operate it very successfully.  What I think is of significance is that all the authorities on electoral law and there are many such across the world, published by the United Nations, and there are many such text books written in America, Australia and elsewhere, written in the English language which I have read, all of which have long chapters on the types of mistakes that are made, on the types of spoiled votes, on the irregularities and departures from the regulations and agreed methods in various countries show that <Col N="860" /> there is no difference in the number of spoiled votes irrespective of the type of system of election used.  Therefore this allegation that proportional representation facilitates the making of mistakes is not justified by the facts. Under other systems there are the same number of mistakes.  I do not think there is any way of avoiding it.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if some people find it inconvenient or disedifying to have long counts, I think it is fair to comment that we are now living in a day in which we perhaps could be voting with the assistance of machines.  We certainly know that machines are in use in the US and in Australia and that the result of these systems is that you can have very speedy results and, we understand, very accurate results. I do not know what precautions are taken to ensure that the machines behave and that no irregularities occur on the day of an election in the operation of the machine.  I have no idea what precautions are taken to provide some alternative way of voting if any particular machine should break down but I have no doubt these sophisticated societies which operate this system have provided safeguards against any of these happenings.  I cannot imagine for one moment that it is impossible for us to introduce here machines which would facilitate the operation of our elections if some people find it inconvenient to have to attend for a number of days during the processing of votes after an election. Certainly the use of computers and other machinery would be justified if it is considered that the all-important thing is to get an expeditious decision after a vote is taken.</P>
    <P>However, I do not know of any instance in our history in which the nation was in jeopardy, in which the institutions of this State were in jeopardy because of delay in the counting of votes.  I can well imagine that in the days of civil war here, in the days of civil strife, in the days in which some sections of our community felt they were justified in using military force to secure their will, government was less stable and the authority of the people less respected than it is now.  In those days there were seven and nine-seat constituencies, <Col N="861" /> have at the moment.  At one time in a Seanad election, the whole country was a single constituency.  Notwithstanding the tremendous length of time it must have taken to complete such counts, I am not aware of any occasion when the institutions of this State were in peril because of delay.  It may well have caused a certain amount of nervous disorder and perhaps indigestion among the candidates and their immediate cohorts to have to suffer the inconvenience of such long counts but that is the very most that can be said about the system of PR, and if in the end result, it achieves a system of fair representation, then I think it is a price well worth paying in order to maintain the system that we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are told also by the Minister for Local Government at column 421 that the British system will confer benefit on the community in two ways&mdash;by more effective representation on local problems and by having a more efficient Dáil to deal with legislative problems.  How can it be argued that we will have more effective representation on local problems under the single-seat constituency?  One of the great drawbacks in local government is the competition which occurs between public representatives who represent different electoral areas.  How often members of local authorities at borough corporation meetings and county council meetings have been thwarted in their desire to get a particular amenity provided in a particular local area because the majority of members of that authority came from another area and on that account would not provide the money for the area in respect of which the amenity was sought?</P>
    <P>Now, if we are to localise our Deputies more than they are already localised, it means that local interests will suffer rather than be properly and adequately represented here.  It means that each Deputy will confine himself to his own particular little cell of the community.  He alone will represent that community against the other 143 Members of this House.  That is not a system which will enhance the <Col N="862" /> opportunities which a Deputy has to improve his local area.  There is no constituency in the country which can afford to ignore local agitation because from every constituency the different political Parties in this House draw support.  We all hope that in every constituency there is a pocket of votes which will succeed in getting a Deputy elected for our particular Party.  If you take away that system and replace it with a system under which only one public representative will sit in any safe seat, no matter what the Government might or might not do, you can take it that these particular constituencies will get nothing from any Government.</P>
    <P>It will be regarded by another Government as being so black as to be beyond redemption and beyond any hope of swinging support.  Take, for instance, the constituency of West Limerick or the constituency of Clare. It would be hard to find two more neglected constituencies.  It is because the Fianna Fáil Party have been assured of a majority in those areas over the years.  It will only be when those areas are rejected by the Fianna Fáil Party that something worthwhile will be done for them.  You can think of other parts of the country where the same operates.  The surest way of getting any attention for local problems is to make it clear to the Government and to Dáil Éireann that there is a danger of losing political support.  When that comes, attention will be given to it.</P>
    <P>The system of PR will ensure that all Governments will be concerned with maintaining their support or increasing their support in nearly all constituencies. It does not happen in every case under PR, as in the constituencies of West Limerick or Clare.  Fianna Fáil have been in power for over 30 years and they will be sure of getting in in those areas even if they leave them the way they are.  If you do away with the system and introduce the British system, local problems will be ignored, certainly in the safe constituencies.  You can take it that most constituencies will be safe for one Party or another much larger constituencies than we just as they are in Britain, Northern <Col N="863" /> Ireland and in the United States of America.  It will only be the minority constituencies which will be so volatile and so sensitive that attention will have to be given to local problems.</P>
    <P>Again, we are told that we will have a more efficient Dáil to deal with legislative problems.  We are told on the one hand that doing away with PR will make Deputies more accessible to their constituencies and that they will find their constituents more accessible to them.  We are told that doing away with PR will mean that we will have more efficient ward heelers so that we will have Deputies so accessible that they can do a variety of work.  We know that some Deputies at the moment do no ward heeling and leave it to others.  Some of those are the best parliamentarians here and in the Seanad.  They are the best legislators. They introduce Private Members' Bills, Private Members' motions, analyse every Bill which comes in, table amendments by the score and argue them on Committee Stage or on Report Stage. That is the kind of work which receives no special attention and is on the whole unrewarded, if you are to measure reward simply by public acclaim.  Those are the Deputies at the moment who do not do ward heeling but who make this Assembly work.</P>
    <P>There are some who are capable of doing both but they are so exceptional that their names occur to me and to all the Members present.  If you introduce a system where every Deputy will have to be a ward heeler, you will have less legislative work done here.  There is a great deal to be said for introducing into our parliamentary system a scheme of parliamentary Committees which would do a great deal of work which now must be done here on the floor of the House and which also could do a great deal of work which is not now being done.  Those are some of the things which we should be concentrating on.  We should be thinking of introducing a system whereby we would be working towards this rather than towards a system which is certainly not going to give this country the kind of really effective parliamentary <Col N="864" /> representation which it needs to have if we are to go forward in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government said at column 423:</P>
    <P>There will obviously be more scope for young, able people to get into public life under the system we are proposing.</P>
    <P>I think I have already dealt with that when I pointed out that you certainly will not have young people entering any Dáil in which the majority of the constituencies are occupied by people who have safe seats who cannot be disturbed because there is no competition from the popular Party within them. He also said at column 424:</P>
    <P>This system is scrupulously fair. It does not discriminate between voters, as the present system does.</P>
    <P>I think I have already pointed out that the present system does not discriminate between voters.  Every vote is an effective vote because the process of elimination of outside candidates and the distribution of votes ensures this.  It is only when PR is not properly used that discrimination applies.  There is no discrimination against a voter under the PR system but there will be under the system in which you devalue the votes of a large number of electors and enhance those who happen to plump for the person at the top.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to Deputy M. J. O'Higgins at column 430.  Deputy O'Higgins had described the present system of PR as being fair. This is what the Minister had to say:</P>
    <P>In fact it is grossly unfair; it discriminates between voters and in a close finish to an election, the system, as I said, is equivalent to drawing the name of the candidate to be elected by lot.</P>
    <P>Where you have a tie, where you have an equality of votes, it is perhaps not unfair to draw the name by lot.  It is done quite frequently in relation to the chairmen of local authorities, Lord Mayors and so on.  It is certainly not an unfair system if there is an equality of votes to draw by lot.  The alternative would be to have a re-election.  The present system ensures that nobody <Col N="865" /> will be elected until he or she is in such a position that his votes exceed the votes of all rivals.  It is usually only in the last seat there can be any element of uncertainty or chance.  Under a system such as the Government proposes, that element of chance will enter into every constituency from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, and in the selection of the first past the post candidate.  I should not say in every constituency because some constituencies will be completely satisfied to leave everybody else outside it other than the sitting incumbent: but you will have the constituencies in which you will have the element of luck entering into the filling of the first seat.  It is quite clear, therefore, that the system is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke of the need for change. He said that if there was anything wrong with this country, it was that we were too static and that we needed to introduce a system which would allow for a more frequent change of Government.  This is a pleasant theory when we examine the prospects in this country.  It is not unfair to say that our political set-up, the number of votes cast for any particular Party, has not very significantly varied in the last decade or so.  I do not think you will have any great change under the single-seat constituency with the nontransferable vote.  But even though there has not been any massive swing one way or the other we have since 1948 had a number of changes of Government.  The Fine Gael share of the vote has grown steadily however.</P>
    <P>If you introduce a system under which one particular Party which can have 36 per cent of the votes with 90 per cent of the seats, you will have greater stagnation than in the past. That is the only change we will have. I cannot see how the Minister for Industry and Commerce can be talking otherwise than with his tongue in his cheek when he talks about a dynamic political system in which you will have changes of Government and you will give the people an opportunity of voicing their opinion on public affairs and on the policies which the State ought to be endeavouring to implement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> On a recent date the <i>Irish Press</i> published some comments by Father O'Connor, O.P., one of the lecturers in UCD, on the Government's proposals in relation to election under PR.  Father O'Connor saw virtue in the Government's proposals and thought PR should be abolished, and there was a rather undiplomatic leader in the same <i>Irish Press</i> which was of greater significance than the theoretical expositions of Father O'Connor.  What the <i>Irish Press</i> was lamenting in its second leading article was that in Lisnaskea, the Nationalist Party was not going to nominate any candidate to oppose the Unionist candidate for the vacancy created by the departure of Lord Brookeborough.  It said that even though the Nationalist Party saw no prospect in the election, it had a duty to put up a candidate for the purpose of giving those who agreed with it an opportunity of expressing their views.</P>
    <P>I think the position of the Nationalist Party in the area in question is understandable.  It saw little point in wasting time in a quite obviously hopeless fight.  That shows the British first past the post system is completely stagnating politically.  If there is any social change in Northern Ireland, if there is any advance, it is because of their association with Great Britain and not because of any dynamic decisions taken by the people in the six north-eastern counties.  Anything that has taken place there has been an overflow of what has taken place in Britain, without expression locally through the ballot box of parliamentary views to effect change in policy, change in outlook or change in social and political affairs.  I do not think that even the most dyed-in-the wool Unionist would suggest otherwise.  The British electoral system in Northern Ireland has brought about a stagnant political entity.</P>
    <P>If we introduce a system which will favour the political Party which for the time being is marginally in ascendancy and in so doing, deprive the remainder of the community of fair representation, there is a real danger that the people will give up trying to change the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> I think the Government have decided on that as the reality of what will happen if they abolish the present system of election and it is on that account they have introduced their proposals.  They want to see a stagnant society; they want to see a society in which the people will not use the ballot box to bring about change or protest against policies with which they disagree.  We have had several speeches from them, all documents containing proposals which they want to implement. The proposed change is for the purpose of stifling and silencing protest against the political system, which will knock the heart and the wind out of those who are opposing them by depriving them of any chance of fair representation and of any chance of occupancy other than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>These are the realities and that second leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the day that Father O'Connor's article was published is of far greater significance than any theoretical pronouncements by Father O'Connor.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the rather sarcastic criticism by a member of the Government who said that people should not express their theories who never had to undergo the competition of the hustings and the uncertainties and sensitivities of the ballot box.  I think his remarks may be applied to Father O'Connor, if you like, and I shall say no more.</P>
    <P>If you do away with the present system, you will negative the prospect of building up in this country Parties with dynamic views, Parties sufficiently strong to ensure that they can replace the present indifferent Government by something more dynamic.  That is why I find it very hard to accept the remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do realise that he was speaking from a prepared brief, not prepared by him.  It was prepared for him, but I do seriously believe that he was not expressing his own views because it is common knowledge that he was very much against the British system of voting.  He was against the system which devalues the vote of so many of our people.  He was strongly <Col N="868" /> in favour of retaining PR which gives full representation.</P>

      <P>He was, of course, in an extremely embarrassing position and perhaps that is the explanation as to why he, being a conscientious man, has been out on a limb in so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned. It must have been a matter of considerable embarrassment to him that he topped the poll for the Fianna Fáil National Executive at the last Ard-Fheis.  Without his knowledge, some of his supporters stole 150 ballot papers and marked them in his favour in the toilet.  I can understand why he has some misgivings about any electoral systems Fianna Fáil might produce.</P>

    <P>I was very interested in the use of the word &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;.  I did not get a chance of consulting all the dictionaries which we used to help us in showing that we were a republic when in fact we were something quite different, but Nuttall's Dictionary defines &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; as &ldquo;the amount by which an engineer's product is allowed to depart from its specified dimensions.&rdquo; As Deputy L'Estrange, who anticipated me, has said, this is a well-engineered scheme.  What is the dimension as understood by the people?  It is one person, one vote.  It is as simple as that.  The dimension which will be specified ultimately here will be something in the region of 20,000 of the population per Deputy, and what the Government want to do is to engineer a deviation from that and they have <Col N="869" /> used what is an engineering term to describe one of the most intolerant, undemocratic, unscrupulous efforts to maintain themselves in power which any corrupt Government ever devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining that &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;the amount by which an engineer's product is permitted to depart from its specified dimensions&rdquo; and as we know, the one-sixth provision in the Bill will allow a deviation of 40 per cent, or two-fifths, which is as we see a great deal more than one-sixth.  You do not have to be a student of higher mathematics to see that the figures I give are the correct ones.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the figures of the 1966 census which we now know, the deviation is of that dimension but that is not taking account of what the Constitution obliges us to take account of&mdash;the numbers in population which we are supposed to take into account once every 12 years.  There is the rearrangement of constituencies on the basis of the population as ascertained in the immediately preceding census. As I have pointed out, the 1961 Electoral Bill was arranged not on the 1961 census, though that could have been done, but the Government of the day deliberately cut down the staff of the Central Statistics Office to prevent the figures being known before they rearranged matters, and the present system of 1968 is based on the population as ascertained in 1956, 12 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the dreadful reality and that is why we have this deviation from this engineering product we are told about &mdash;this thing which in engineering terms is called tolerance but in any other language is called intolerance.  It is because we have not allowed for the movement of population that we have imbalance and we have Deputies here representing trees, fields, mountains, lakes and bogs and other Deputies representing <Col N="870" /> people.  That is not what democracy is supposed to represent.  It is supposed to be people we represent, not stones or other material substances. It is on that account that we are against those now seeking to change the system.  We do not believe this farcical and unfair situation should be written into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some figures which will illustrate what I have been saying.  I can only go on the 1956 Census of Population because that is the basis for the existing system.  It shows that in the urban constituencies the situation has become more inflated and more deflated in the rural areas. In Dublin South-west, there are 3,170 people per 100 acres.  If you go to some of the constituencies where the system is supposed to be advantageous, giving 40 per cent additional representation, you will find that in North Mayo, the population on the same acreage is only 8.2.  In Carlow-Kilkenny, it is 13.4; in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, 207.2; and in Dublin County, 40.9.  However, since 1956 the urban area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has increased its density of population to something near to 2,000 per 100 acres, a vast increase because of the urban sprawl.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Dublin County area has vastly increased its population density in the lowlands but not in the mountainous areas of Glencree and the Dublin Mountains where the population is still rather rare and is likely to continue to be so if the town planning legislation continues in its present form. According to the 1956 Census of Population, the population density per 100 acres in Kildare is 15.7.  In Laois-Offaly, it is 10.8.  In Longford-Westmeath, it is 12.6.  In Louth, it is 34.1. In Meath, it is 11.6.  In Wexford, it is 15.0.  In Wicklow, it is 12.1.  In Clare, it is 9.8.  In West Cork, it is 9.4.  In East Cork, it is 14.9.  In Mid-Cork, it is 13.0.  In North Kerry, it is 14.4.  In South Kerry, it is 7.6.  In West Limerick, it is 13.2.  In East Limerick, it is 35.1. In North Tipperary, it is 11.3.  In South Tipperary, it is 13.2.  In Waterford, it is 16.3.  In West Galway, it is 11.2.  In South Galway, it is 9.3.  In North Galway, it is 11.6.  In South Mayo, it is 11.8.  In North Mayo, it is 8.2&mdash;as I <Col N="871" /> mentioned.  In Roscommon, it is 10.5. In Sligo-Leitrim, it is 11.4.  In Cavan, it is 13.2.  In West Donegal, it is 8.9. In East Donegal, it is 11.4, and in Monaghan, it is 16.3.  Those figures relate to county constituencies based on the 1956 Census of Population.</P>
    <P>That shows that the problem of the rural areas and the problem of representing the rural areas are clearly different from those of representing the urban areas.  According to the 1956 population census, the relevant figures for the population density per 100 acres in respect of the borough constituencies are as follows:</P>

    <P>The figures for the area of the * constituencies are estimated.</P>
    <P>I am sorry these figures bore Deputies. It is important to get away from the tribal feuds the Minister for Local Government spoke about in the High Court where he gave the idea that no Deputy could represent people with conflicting interests: he said the work of any Deputy representing people of different interests would be rendered impossible.  I wonder how Deputy Foley feels about representing the sheep farmers of the Dublin Mountains as well as the people of Ballyfermot and the more well-to-do people in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to think of the more well-to-do area in County Dublin.  I am sure Deputy Foley does not take kindly to the accusation that, because he represents people of different political interests, his work is rendered impossible.  We are led to believe we must have the single-seat constituency so that, for instance, Deputy Foley can become fertile politically, as it were, so that he can become an effective political force by representing one of these conflicting tribes which have nothing in common with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The population density which I have listed has a number of interesting consequences&mdash;not entirely those of difficulty of meeting one's constituents or of the constituents meeting public representatives.  I think any person who has lived in an urban area, any person who represents an urban area, knows that one of the loneliest places to live in is a big city.  The bigger the city, the lonelier one can be, the less people know about their neighbours, whereas the lower the population density, the more the people know about each other in the area. With a sparse population, the people know far more about their neighbours in the same acre and in the thousand adjoining acres than people in the city or town would know about their neighbours living in the same road.</P>
    <P>We are given to understand that rural Deputies have a tremendous difficulty.  I recently tried out a simple test in a rural area and in an urban area.  I asked the better part of 200 people in each of these areas if they knew the names of their local representatives. In the rural area, 99 per cent of the people were able to say who they were.  They knew where they lived and the Party to which they belonged.  In the urban area, less than 20 per cent knew the names of their public representatives, fewer knew where they lived and fewer again knew the Party politics of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the tremendous advantages of the people in rural Ireland is the provincial press which is the greatest means of communication to the people of Ireland.  It carries information about local affairs and local problems. It carries information about what the local representatives are doing&mdash;information that is not available to the people in urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Ó Briain says but the fact is that in the urban areas only the national papers circulate and they have to feature the major international and national news.  No local paper is available in the urban areas to focus attention on local matters.  Deputy Booth is aware of that fact.  He has been obliged to launch a paper of his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth knows the great disadvantage in the urban area and he realises the tremendous need for communication.  The reason for ignorance on the part of public representatives about their constituents is that they do not see their affairs recited in the newspapers and, in a similar way, the constituents are unaware of the hard work their public representatives are doing because that work, too, is not featured in the public press.  All this lack of communication is a feature of the urban areas.  No electoral system will ever balance the advantages and disadvantages so far as the urban and the rural areas are concerned in this matter of communication. Deputies who represent rural areas are well aware of that fact.  Any person who has ever looked at the provincial press realises the wide scope of information given about the area it caters for.  Every town and townland it attended to.  All that is necessary is a good local correspondent.  News items of every description are included about all kinds of private and public activities covering all shades of public opinion, be it Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, <Col N="874" /> the ICA, GAA, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe.</P>
