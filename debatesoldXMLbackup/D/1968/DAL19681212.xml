      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the permission of the Chair to explain something which was referred to last night by the Minister for Local Government?  He accused the Whips of Fine Gael and of the Labour Party of conspiring to prevent him from getting time to answer the debate on the Second Reading of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968. I want to make it quite clear, as far as I am concerned, that the agreement was made in good faith by the Whips.  It was necessary for us to inquire from the Taoiseach if there would be any objection to the amount of time allotted to the Minister for Local Government. He said he would put the matter to a Government meeting and inform us on Friday afternoon and we had to come back here that afternoon about that matter.  There was no conspiracy.  I deplore the conduct of a Minister of State who seeks to disrupt Public Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is ábhar dóchais dúinn an t-eolas a thug an tAire dúinn sna ráitis ar an meastachán i mbliana. Tá cosúlacht ar an scéal anois go bhfuil an dúshraith leagtha ar an bhféadfar forbairt na Gaeltachta a bhunú.</P>
      <P>An dá mhillún, nó níos mó, a chaith an Roinn sa Ghaeltacht le trí bliana, nó mar sin, anuas-méadú géar ar ar caitheadh sa tréimhse trí mbliain roimhe sin-tá a rian le feiceáil i measc pobal na Gaeltachta.  Is léir do mhuintir na Gaeltachta anois go bhfuil dlús á chur leis an bhfeachtas chun teacht i gcabhair orthu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taispeánann an cuntas atá tugtha <Col N="2659" /> ag an Aire go bhfuil an-dul chun cinn déanta le tamall de bhlianta anuas agus go dtig linn a bheith muiníneach anois go bhféadfar ár gcuspóirí don Ghaeltacht a chur i gcrích.  Measaim go bhfuil ré na dúshraithe thart anois agus nach fada go mbeidh gnéithe an fhoirgnimh nua-thógtha le feiceáil ag an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Bhí suim ar leith agam féin agus beidh ag gach duine ar cás leis leas na Gaeltachta sa mhéid a bhí le rá ag an Aire mar gheall ar imeachtaí Ghaeltarra Éireann. Níl sé ach tamall gairid ó tugadh na cumhachtaí nua don chomhlacht sin agus, cheana féin, tá mórthionscail bunaithe a chuirfidh fostaíocht ar fáil do suas le 300 duine. Is dul chun cinn é nach miste bheith mórálach as agus tréaslaím don Aire agus do Ghaeltarra Éireann dá bharr. Is móide ár meas orthu gur cosúil nach bhfuil sna tionscail táchachtacha a luadh sa ráiteas ach tús na hoibre agus nach fada go mbeidh tuilleadh dá leithéid á bhfógairt don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is ábhar sásaimh freisin é a fheiceáil go bhfuil tús maith curtha le Scéim na Miontionscadal.  Már a dúirt an tAire ardaíodh an uasteorainn do na deontais sin go dtí £5,000 tamall ó shin. Measaim nár mhiste é a ardú tuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Nuair a d'fhógair an Rialtas sa Pháipear Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge go gcaithfeadh Gaeltarra Éireann bheith ina phríomhghléas chun gníomhaíochtaí eacnamaíochta da chineál tionsclaíoch a fhorbairt i ngach limistéar Gaeltachta, leagadh dualgas an-trom ar an gcomhlacht sin.  Is léir ón dul chun cinn atá déanta ó shin nár mhiste bheith ag brath orthu chun an dualgas sin a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom féachaint amach romham ar an bhforbairt atá le teacht fós i gcursaí tionsclaíochta i gConamara. Is maith liom tionscail nua a bhfuil fir ghnó páirteach iontu a bheith á mbunú.  Taispeánann sé go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann in ann, leis na cumhachtaí nua a thugamar dóibh, tionsclaithe den chéad scoth a thabhairt go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus nach fada anois go mbeidh tionscail á mbunú ar fud Conamara. Tá tús maith curtha leis an obair cheana féin, le méadú monarcha Arramara i gCill Chiaráin agus le bunú Westsea Ltd. agus Connemarble <Col N="2660" /> Ltd.&mdash;tríthionscal a bhfuil buntáistí ar leith leo sa mhéid go bhfuil maoin aiceanta an cheantair mar bhunábhar acu agus go ngabhann cuid mhaith fostaíochta breise le saothrú na maoine sin.</P>
    <P>Gné de ráiteas an Aire ar fiú, dar liom, suntas ar leith a thabhairt dó&mdash; an cur síos a rinne sé ar na socruithe atá déanta ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i gcomhair leis na hÚdaráis Áitiúla agus leis an bhForas Forbartha chun go dtabharfaidh na húdaráis áitiúla sin aird speisialta ina gcuid clár pleanála agus forbartha do chothú leas na limistéar Gaeltachta. Mar dhuine a bhfuil baint aige le húdarás áitiúil is áthas liom an socrú a bheith déanta anois chun go n-ullmhóidh na húdaráis áitiúla páirtphleanna forlíontacha do na limistéir sin amháin.  Sílim féin go dtuigeann na húdaráis a bhfuil ceantair Ghaeltachta faoina gcúram go bhfuil dualgas ar leith orthu maidir le hoidhreacht na Gaeilge a chaomhnú.  Tá dóchas agam nach fada go mbeidh na pleananna forlíontacha sin ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-thábhachtach uisce reatha a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht le haghaidh na daoine ag a mbíonn páistí acu sa teach agus freisin le haghaidh cuairteoirí chun na Gaeltachta. Dá ndéanfaimís níos mó faoín gcursa sin do dhéanfaí níos mo dul chun cinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cúpla focal le rá agam ar an Meastachán seo.  One is confined on this Estimate and, in my opinion, one should not be confined because this Department consists of a bit of this and a bit of that and a bit of the other in order to make up a Department for the Gaeltacht, and a bit of this is quite likely to encroach on a bit of that or on a bit of the other.  A Deputy who discusses these bits is quite likely to find himself ruled out of order by the Chair on the grounds that the matter raised is more relevant to the operations of some other Department of State.  He is told that he must not widen the scope of the debate.  I believe the debate on this particular Estimate should be considerably widened.  The economy of the Gaeltacht is founded on tourism and fisheries.  I do not think anything else is as important in the Gaeltacht as these two.  I do not think anything else <Col N="2661" /> plays such a part.  Unfortunately, when one talks of tourism, one is liable to be ruled out of order.  The fact is we have tourist road grants and all that goes with them and, from that point of view, one can scarcely avoid stepping over the demarcation line.</P>
      <P>The economy of the Aran Islands is built upon fisheries and tourism.  A great blow has been struck and is to be struck in the next few months against the economy of the Aran Islands.  I say that because we have a service that links the people of the Aran Islands with the mainland.  That service is subsidised to provide that link both for tourist and native alike. I said a blow has been struck and is to be struck.  We had a ferry boat catering for a big slice of that traffic and, from what I hear, this boat is now to be cut off and we know what the repercussions of such an action will be. I should like to see this Department taking a hand in this before the islands are left with a few tourists in the summer only.  The people of the Aran Islands have to live there for 12 months of the year.  We should encourage them to stay there and we should make every effort to encourage the young people to stay there.  This is one of the most important outposts of the Gaeltacht and it should not be forgotten.</P>
      <P>Added to the loss of this second ferry boat which is catering for the islands we have a threat of an increase in freight and passenger fares.  The raw material of the islands, that which provides a tourist amenity, is people themselves. The fish are carried by their own boats.  The fishermen, who are some of the finest on the west coast, have to face the turbulent waters of the Atlantic.  It is no pleasure trip for them.  They have to face the wide Atlantic in their search for a living to reap the harvest of the seas.  Thank God, they have not to sow the harvest. If they had, they would lose.  I should like to see the Department helping those people.  We know there is no such thing as a guaranteed market for fish.  They do not know what price they will get and they have to face conditions for which people in other spheres of activity would get danger money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see more of the <Col N="2662" /> money provided for the Gaeltacht catering for the men on the back roads. I have often described them as the &ldquo;Wellington Brigade&rdquo;.  Year in and year out they cannot go to church, cinema or elsewhere without their wellingtons.  They almost have to turn up in the dancehalls in wellingtons because of the type of roads they have to slush through.  Apart from that, there are people who are now paying tax for cars or lorries, and they are entitled to a better share of the moneys which are allocated.  We should cater for the needs of the unfortunates in the backwoods. These men are expected to stay there and talk the language.  It is not very encouraging for them when they have to live under such conditions.</P>
    <P>When we measure the strides that have been made in relation to the language here in Dublin, never mind in the Gaeltacht, we realise that if a person came back here after 50 years he would find that on this, the 50th anniversary of the First Dáil, we are not capable of carrying out all the celebrations through the medium.  Is mór an naire é sin.  It is about time we examined our consciences to see why these strides have not been made.  We cannot hear the language spoken in the public streets.  As I said in the debate on another Vote, unless a love for the language is created it is finished. Instead of that a hatred is being created.  I should like to repeat what I said last week about those who are in it for what they can get out of it.  I want to warn the Department that they should get rid of that element.  There are leeches who are in it for what they can get out of it.  Instead of love a hatred is being created for the language even among the children, the coming generation.</P>
    <P>This is our country even though we know it is now for sale for £100 to £5 shares being offered by the Government under the heading of Taca.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise.  It has no relevancy whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see in my own area these gentlemen we see around during by-elections getting appointments. If they are not architects they <Col N="2663" /> are engineers or contractors.  That is why I want to warn the House about the country being for sale.  This Department, so far as I can see, has a lot to sell to these gentlemen.  I want to warn them that I will expose them. When we get down to the £5 group I do not know what is to be sold to them.  The big stuff has all gone and only the crumbs are left for the £5 brigade.</P>
      <P>I should like to see more activity so far as the Department are concerned in west Galway and in the Aran Islands.  More money should be spent for the common good of the people and not merely for the sake of spending it for no return.  If we want to save the language we must save the people who get it with their milk. These are the people of the Gaeltacht. Let us keep them from having to go to Birmingham.  Let us make life worth living for them, especially in the Aran Islands.  For those people Boston is their Mecca.  I have met them there and I know.  That is one of the centres they set their target on.  It is pitiful to see the youth of the Aran Islands waiting to get money from those who have gone before them to bring them out there.  If we are to save the Irish language we must save the Irish speakers and not waste public money unless there is some return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Meastachán seo.  Ba maith liom freisin labhairt ar feadh i bhfad i nGaeilge ach tá faitíos orm nach bhfuil mórán cleachtadh agam ar an dteanga mar níl fórmhóir na ndaoine thart timpeall orm i ndán mórán Gaeilge a labhairt. Ar an ábhar sin níl mórán seans agam.</P>
      <P>As I said in Irish, I would like to speak at some length on this Estimate in Irish but I feel ashamed to say that, though at one time I knew quite a lot of Irish and could carry on a conversation with most people, unfortunately because the language in my part of the country is not being spoken as much as it was heretofore one does not have much opportunity to get the practice. Níl an taithí againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2664" /> I feel sure that the present Minister, like his predecessors, is really anxious and sincere in trying to further the cause of the Irish language and all that goes with it-Irish music and Irish culture. I would not like to be guilty of saying anything that would interfere with any progress that is being made, if we are making progress in this direction. I know well that it is not easy to further the cause of the Irish language and of the people living in the Gaeltacht for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>I have no Gaeltacht in my part of the country and in my new constituency there will be no Gaeltacht at all.  At one time we had a Gaeltacht in the Erris area and also in Achill but that is being cut away.  That does not mean that I have not had an interest in these people in the past and will not show my interest in these people in the future &mdash;not because of any votes I may gain or lose but because I feel that these people deserve the best from this State and from whatever Government is in office.  They are people who down the years have had an uphill fight.  I know that from my experience of people in Achill and Erris areas.  Their holdings are uneconomic, in many cases valuations of 10s and £1 or a couple of pounds.  The families generally are large and, consequently the bread-winner has to go over to England or to some other place to find employment. That means that the bread-winner is, for at least part of the year, away from home trying to earn enough money to keep the home fires burning, to fend for his wife and children.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it is understandable that the Department of the Gaeltacht have a difficult problem in order to try to encourage those people to speak the language and to live up to the old culture and traditions.  My daughter did a course in Connemara last year and I would like to commend those courses.  It is a really wonderful experience.  My daughter improved her Irish out there and, not alone that, but I can say truthfully that anybody who lives among those people even for a short time should certainly profit from their good example and from their wonderful culture.  It is a very happy experience for any child to go and live among those people.  Anyone who goes <Col N="2665" /> will have many memories of happy times spent there and the wonderful experience of hearing the rosary and the prayers at Mass said in Irish and to hear children of three or four years of age speaking Irish in the home.</P>
    <P>Anything that can be done for those people, as Deputy Molloy said, such as the extension of water schemes of those areas, I would gladly support at any time.  I know it was a problem last year.  It was a particularly dry year and there was difficulty in providing even drinking water for the children going to school there, not to mention the residents of those places.  More money should be made available to help those people in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as condemning tourism.  On the contrary, I would like to think that tourism would be fostered there.  It can be a great asset from the economic point of view to the people in such areas as Connemara, the Dingle peninsula, the Erris area and many other areas where Irish is spoken.  I would like tourism to be encouraged in those areas but it also creates a problem.  Many of the people who visit those areas from England and even from continental countries speak English.  Because the people living there, due to their economic circumstances, are anxious to supplement their incomes in any way they can, they are anxious to provide holiday accommodation for these English-speaking tourists.  There is an element of danger here because the children are advised to try to learn English so that they will be able to converse with the visitors. Anything the Department of the Gaeltacht could do to prevent that from bringing about a situation in which these young people would start to speak English, and perhaps continue to speak English, should be done.  It should be brought home to the parents and the children that it is of the greatest importance to themselves and for the sake of their culture and traditions that they should continue to speak Irish.  Even if it is necessary to increase the deontas or other benefits now available to these people, we should go to all possible extremes in order to help them.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is a sideline in which the majority of these people engaged in the past and which at times <Col N="2666" /> proved beneficial.  Unfortunately, Irishspeaking people are not greatly attracted to this industry at the present time.  Wage rates in England are attractive. These people are hardworking.  In England they are able to take up practically any type of work but most of them do what is called pick and shovel jobs.  They have a tradition of hard work and that type of employment is fairly well remunerated.  They can earn a few hundred pounds in a comparatively short time and can return then to their families and have a sort of holiday.  It is experience for them and in this way they supplement their incomes.  This also creates a problem in the effort to keep the language alive. Where the bread-winner must go to England for part of the year in order to earn his livelihood, unless he is amongst neighbours who converse in Irish, he must learn the English language.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy of the greatest magnitude if the day should come that the country would lose its language and its culture.  I am not so sure that at all times we are travelling along the right road in our efforts to further the language.  I concede that the present Minister and previous Ministers were anxious to help the language in every possible way.  To this extent I agree with Deputy Coogan, although I do not agree with him in everything.  I do agree with him when he makes the point that compulsory Irish is not good for our mentality, is not good for our people.  If the people could be encouraged to speak the language instead of having it rammed down their throats, a more desirable atmosphere would be created for the fostering of the language and its culture.</P>
    <P>More should be done to help people who engage in Irish music and dancing. The programmes on television such as &ldquo;Bring Down the Lamp&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ceilí House&rdquo;&mdash;call them what you like&mdash; should be continued and improved. There is room for improvement of some of these programmes.  They should be made brighter and more time should be devoted to them.  I can say, boastfully if you like, that in that regard I practise what I preach.  Members of my own family engage in Irish music and dancing and I should like <Col N="2667" /> more people to engage in them. There is a mentality abroad that unless you go in for &ldquo;pop&rdquo; music, you are not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.  It should be realised that people who go in for &ldquo;pop&rdquo; music do not appreciate the importance of their own culture or the beauty of their own language.  One can find Irish music that is a thousand years old.  We should not sell out to this &ldquo;Johnny-Come-Lately&rdquo; pop type of music.  I have nothing against it and enjoy some of it but I would not sell out our own language and culture for that sort of thing.  Tá claonadh agam leis an nGaeilge agus ar an ábhar sin, impím ar an Aire má tá sé ndáiríre a dhícheall a dhéanamh chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Tá súil agam go n-eiróidh leis agus tá súil agam freisin go dtiocfaidh an lá, b'fhéidir sar i bhfad, go mbeidh teanga na hÉireann á labhairt ó cheann ceann na tíre.</P>

An mhonarcha a osclaíodh tá sí á leathnú cheana féin agus meastar go mbeidh fostaíocht do suas le 200 duine sa tionscal sin cleamhnas sa chás sin.  An mhonarcha mhéadaithe faoi lánseol.  Is snáthanna den déanamh búclach atá á ndéanamh faoi láthair agus, amach anseo, déanfar an snáth nua Linron agus snáthanna nua de shaghasanna eile fós.</P>
    <P>Tá mé tar éis cead a thabhairt do Ghaeltarra dul i gcomhar le buíon eile Éireannach chun tuilleadh óstán a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht; <i>Ostlanna Gaeltearmon Teoranta</i> is ainm don chomhlacht seo.  Tuigtear dom go mbeidh an obair thógála ar an gcéad óstán dá gcuid ar siúl go luath i gCo. Chiarraí.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nár mhiste a lua nach ionann an comhlacht sin agus <i>Óstáin na hÉireann Teoranta</i>&mdash;comhlacht eile d'Éireannaigh a bhfuil scaireanna ag Gaeltarra ann agus óstán nua á reachtáil go héifeachtach aige in aice leis an Daingean.  Tá ag éirí go maith fosta le <i>Westsea Ltd.</i> ina bhfuil Éireannaigh i bpáirtíocht le Gaeltarra chun tionscal dúchasach na ngliomach agus na bportán a fhorbairt i Ros an Mhíl.</P>
    <P>Ní fada go mbeidh <i>comhlacht nua eile</i> á fhógairt ag Gaeltarra.  Tá mé tar éis cead a thabhairt dóibh dul i gcomhar le gnólacht mór poiblí sa Bhreatain chun tionscal tábhachtach eile a thabhairt go dtí Gaoth Dobhair. <Col N="2669" /> Bainfear feidhm as an bhfoirgneamh a bhí le bheith mar réamh-mhonarcha againn agus leathnófar é.  Beidh fostaíocht do thart ar 140 duine ar ball sa tionscal áirithe seo. Mhothaigh mé, nuair a bhí an Teachta Coogan ag caint, gurbh é seo an chéad uair agus mé ag éisteacht leis nár luaigh sé na fir ag dul síos chun na báid agus iad ag dul thar lear ag lorg oibre. Tig liom a rá leis anois ó thaobh na forbartha atá déanta againn, go mór mhór i dTír Chonaill, nach fada go mbeidh na fir ag dul síos go dtí na báid i nGlascúagus i Learpholl ag teacht ar ais go dtí na Gaeltachtaí agus go mbeidh obair le fáil acu iontu.</P>
    <P>Maidir le <i>hArdoifig Ghaeltarra</i> atá le haistriú go dtí an Ghaeltacht, tá an obair thógála ag tosú anois sna Forbacha i gCo. na Gaillimhe.  Nuair a bheidh an fhoireann ag cur fúthu ansin beidh teagmháil níos dlúithe fós acu leis na hionaid táirgeachta agus le fadhbanna na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Foilsíodh <i>tuarascáil agus cuntais Ghaeltarra</i> ar na mallaibh don bhliain dar chríoch 31 Márta, 1968.  Shroich na díolacháin £905,000 sa bhliain sin. Chuaigh iomlán na dtuarastal agus an phá go £434,000 agus bhí 755 fhostaí lánaimseartha agus 823 fhostaí páirtaimseartha ag an mBord i ndeireadh na bliana.  Thiocfadh linn tuilleadh lámhchniotálaithe a fhostú dá mbeidís ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tig liom a rá go bhfuil feabhas mór curtha ar an Roinn agus ar Ghaeltarra le blianta beaga anuas ó thaobh eagair agus airgeadais.  Is é barúil an Rialtais, mar sin, gur fearr atá siad gléasta anois ná mar a bhí riamh chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur ar aghaidh. Tuigimid, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil obair mhór romhainn sa Ghaeltacht agus, chun beartas an Rialtais a léiriú, ba mhaith liom litir a chuir an Taoiseach chuig gach Aire ar na mallaibh a léamh:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A Aire, a chara,</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol duit, tá leagtha síos ag an Rialtas nach foláir an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a neartú chun go bhféadfar an Ghaeilge a shlánú.  Is é aidhm atá le beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht gníomhaíochtaí oiriúnacha eachnamaíocha a spreagadh agus a fhairsingiú agus <Col N="2670" /> cúrsaí sóisialacha a fheabhsú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag na daoine a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht, agus arb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáthurlabhra, chun fostaíocht shochrach a fháil agus caighdeáin réasúnta mhaireachtála a bheith acu.  Leagadh síos an méid sin ceithre bliana ó shin, nuair a bhí an Páipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge á ullmhú againn.</P>
    <P>Chun beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht a chur i bhfeidhm, is iad Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann an dá phríomhghléas atá againn.  Tá feabhas mór curtha orthu sin ó thaobh eagair agus airgeadais: le blianta beaga anuas, tá an t-airgead bliantúil dóibh níos mó ná dúbailte againn.  Tig linn a rá, mar sin, gur fearr atá siad gléasta anois ná mar a bhí riamh chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur ar aghaidh.  Chun barr feabhais a chur ar ár n-iarrachtaí, áfach, ní foláir an úsáid is éifeachtaí is féidir a bhaint as gach gléas oibre dá bhfuil ar fáil dúinn.</P>
    <P>Tá feachtas forleathan don Ghaeltacht á leagan amach anois againn lena chur i ngníomh go práinneach. San fheachtas seo, beidh a gcion féin le déanamh ag gach Roinn, gach Bord agus gach Údarás a bhfuil baint acu leis an nGaeltacht.  D'fhonn go n-éireoidh leis an bhfeachtas seo, beidh tosaíocht ag teastáil do gach gné d'fhorbairt na Gaeltachta a bhaineann le do Roinnse agus le gach comhlacht agus údarás atá faoi do chúram.  Táim á iarraidh ort, mar sin, féachaint chuige go gcuirfear an tosaíocht sin ar fáil: tá a fhios agam go dtig liom bheith ag brath ar do dhícheall ar mhaithe le leas na Gaeltachta agus leas an náisiúin.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Le gach dea-ghuí,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Seán Ó Loinsigh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an t-ábhar sásaimh dom go bhfuair mé cuireadh oifigiúil ón Rúnaí Stáit don Bhreatain Bheag agus go raibh deis agam cuairt a thabhairt ar an áit sin ó cuireadh tús leis an díospóireacht ar an Meastachán seo.  Tá líon mór daoine sa Bhreatain Bheag a bhfuil an Bhreatnais á labhairt acu agus suim ar leith acu ina gcultúr dúchais.  Bhí ar mo chumas cúrsaí a phlé le cuid acu agus féachaint ar na <Col N="2671" /> hiarrachtaí a dhéantar ansin chun mórchuid fadhbanna éagsúla a réiteach. Bhí spéis agam i gcúrsaí tionscail agus eacnamaíochta, i gceisteanna sóisialta agus cultúrtha agus, ar ndóigh, i ngnéithe de dheacrachtaí teanga a bhfuil cosúlacht acu lena bhfuil ar láimh againn féin anseo.  Ba chabhair nár bheag dom a bhfaca mé thall chun mo chuid feidhmeanna i bhfus a chomhlíonadh.  Bhain mé tairbhe agus taitneamh as an gcuairt agus tig liom a rá gurbh fhiú go maith an turas a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé le feiceáil agam ansin go raibh na deacrachtaí céanna ag muintir na Breataine Bige a bhí againn fein ó thaobh na bhfadhbanna atá le réiteach againn sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá an teanga á labhairt ag cuid mhaith de na daoine ansin.  Tá dúil mhór acu inti ach sa dóigh chéanna ina bhfuil daoine ag tréigean an talaimh sna tíortha forbartha uilig, tá na daoine ag imeacht leo ón tuaith sa Bhreatain Bheag agus nuair a imíonn siad ón tuaith agus nuair a théann siad isteach sna cathracha móra, go mórmhór i Sasana, is cailliúint mhór í don Bhreatain Bheag, do theanga agus do chultúr na Breataine Bige.  Tá sé soiléir uaidh sin go bhfuil na deacrachtaí céanna ag muintir na <i>Breataine Bige</i> atá againn féin agus, mar a dúirt mé, chuidigh sé go mór liom dul thart le Rúnaí Stáit na Breataine Bige féachaint ar na dóigheanna ina bhfuil siad sin ag déileáil leis na fadhbanna atá acu.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá fosta go raibh anáthas ar mhuintir na Breataine Bige go ndeachaigh mé go díreach ansin le cuairt a thabhairt ar an mBreatain mBeag mar dúirt siad liom gur mé féin an chéad Aire ó thír ar bith a chuaigh d'aon-ghnó go dtí an Bhreatain Bheag.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Mac Giolla Amhlaigh agus an Teachta Diolún tagairt do chúlú ar labhairt na Gaeilge i gcuid de na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Is ceist an-tábhachtach í sin nach furasta a réiteach ach a gcaithfear réiteach a fháil uirthi.  Is cuid í, ar ndóigh, de cheist na hathbheochana sa tír ar fad. An rud a dhéantar go coitianta ar fud na tíre, is é sin is dóichí a dhéantar sa Ghaeltacht freisin: ní cóir a cheapadh gur daoine de chine ná de chineál ar <Col N="2672" /> leith muintir na Gaeltachta seachas muintir eile na hÉireann. Ní shamhlaíonn muintir na Gaeltachta a leithéid leo féin agus níl siad sásta a bheith ina n-ábhar taispeántais nó éagsúlachta ag a gcomhdhaoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tagann de sin gurb ionann, a bheag nó a mhór, an dílseacht a fhaightear don Ghaeilge laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tig liom é sin a rá ar dhóigh eile&mdash;go mbraitheann dílseacht do labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ar a dháiríre a fheictear do mhuintir na Gaeltachta atá pobal na tíre i gcoitinne i dtaobh slánú na teanga.  Más léir do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuilimid uile ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais dáiríre, is é mo bharúil go mbeidh siad chun tosaigh sa ghluaiseacht.  Ach mura léir dóibh an scéal a bheith amhlaidh, ní tógtha orthu bheith patuar nó faillíoch faoin gcuspóir náisiúnta.  Is taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht mar sin is mó atá dualgas caomhnaithe na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht féin.</P>
    <P>Sílim go luíonn sé sin le nádúr.  Coinneoidh muintir na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge má shíleann siad go bhfuil muintir na hÉireann uilig dáiríre faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge ach, má fheiceann siad nach bhfuil muintir na hÉireann sásta an Ghaeilge a labhairt seachas bheith ag caint faoin nGaeilge nó á rá go bhfuil grá acu don Ghaeilge, ní tógtha ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta mura leanann siad sin leis an oidhreacht náisiúnta seo a choinneáil beo.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Diolún fosta ar strainséirí a bheith ag ceannach láithreán tógála i gcuid den Ghaeltacht. Bhí eagla air, is cosúil, go millfí an réimse tíre idir an bóthar mór agus an cladach le tithe de gach aon saghas. Ar ndóigh, tá de chumhacht ag na húdaráis áitiúla faoin Acht Rialtais Áitiúil (Pleanáil agus Forbairt), 1963, tógáil tithe a rialú.  Más Cois Fharraige i gCo.  na Gaillimhe a bhí i gceist ag an Teachta, tuigtear dom nach gnách don Chomhairle Chontae aon tógáil nua-cheaptha a cheadú ar an talamh idir an bóthar mór agus an fharraige sa cheantar sin.  Má bhíonn seantithe le leagan ceadaítear tithe nua a thógáil ina n-áit ach ní dóigh liom gur gnách dóibh dul thairis sin.</P>
    <P>Ní fheicim, mar sin, gur ghá don Stát teacht isteach agus an talamh go <Col N="2673" /> léir ansin a cheannach faoi mar a bhí i gceist ag an Teachta Diolún. Ach, ina choinne sin, tig liom a rá go bhfuilimid ag faire go géar ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus, má fheictear dúinn nach leor na cumhachtaí atá ann faoi láthair chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge a chaomhnú, ní bheidh leisce orainn teacht chuig an Dáil chun tuilleadh cumhachtaí a lorg.</P>
    <P>Tá suim ag an Teachta Diolún agus againn go léir i gcúrsaí cuartaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá eagla airsean gurb é a thiocfaidh as feabhsú na saoráidí saoire sa Ghaeltacht ná go gcuirfear deireadh le labhairt na Gaeilge inti.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé go minic, b'fhearr liom go rachadh daoine le Gaeilge ar a laethanta saoire ansin.  Arís, tá mé á rá nach fiú do Ghaeilgeoirí a bheith ag gearán go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á cailliúint sa Ghaeltacht mura bhfuil siad sásta rud éigin a dhéanamh chun cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta agus dá rachadh daoine le Gaeilge go dtí an Ghaeltacht chuideodh sé le muintir na Gaeltachta agus, chomh maith leis sin, chuideodh sé leis an nGaeilge a choinneáil slán ann.</P>
    <P>Sílim fosta go dtuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta gur fiú an Ghaeilge a bheith ann mar rud éigin a mheallfadh daoine ar a laethanta saoire go dtí an Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom go raibh mé ag caint le cuairteoir ó na Stáit Aontaithe roint bhlianta ó shin agus duirt sé liom gurb é an dearmad is mó a bhí á dhéanamh ag Bord Fáilte Éireann sna fógraí a bhí acu i Meiriceá ná a rá nach raibh deacracht ar bith ann ó thaobh teanga sa tír seo.  Is ionann é sin agus a rá gur Béarla amháin atá ag muintir na hÉireann.  Dúirt sé liom nuair a théann Meiriceánaigh ar a laethanta saoire gurb é an rud is mó a bhíonn de dhíth orthu ná éagsúlacht. Ceann de na rudaí atá de dhíth orthu ná teangacha éagsúla a chlos.  Agus sin é an fáth go dtéann cuid mhór de na Meiriceanáigh go dtí an Iodáil, go dtí an Fhrainc agus go dtí an Spáinn agus gan focal, b'fhéidir, de theangacha na dtíortha sin acu.  Ar an ábhar sin, ba cheart do Bhord Fáilte a rá go bhfuil teanga dár gcuid féin againn. <Col N="2674" /> Chuideodh sé sin le daoine a thabhairt ar a laethanta saoire go dtí an tír seo.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go ngabhann contúirt áirithe don Ghaeilge le forbairt na cuartaíochta.  Ach tá mé sásta gur féidir an chontúirt sin a sheachaint agus go dtig le muintir na Gaeltachta tairbhe na cuartaíochta méadaithe a fháil agus an Ghaeilge a choinneáil san am céanna.  Is é an beartas atá agam ná an chóiríocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht do chuairteoirí a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge.  Tá an beartas sin á chur i bhfeidhm againn sna scéimeanna Roinne a bhaineann leis an gcuartaíocht agus sna socruithe atá ar siúl ag Gaeltara Éireann chun páirt a ghlacadh in óstáin a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht. Tá neart daoine sa tír a bhfuil spéis acu sa Ghaeilge agus ar mhaith leo laethanta saoire a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. Ba chóir go mbeadh oiread díobh ann agus a líonfadh a bhfuil de sheomraí sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh tréimhse na laethanta saoire.  Níl le déanamh ach iad a eagrú i gceart agus tá rún agam é sin a dhéanamh.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, má líonann na Gaeilgeoirí gach seomra dá bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;agus tá súil agam nach fada go líonfaidh&mdash;ní gá aon imní a bheith orainn i dtaobh tionchar na mBéarlóirí.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Molloy ag caint rinne sé gearán nár caitheadh an t-airgead uilig a bhí ag Roinn na Gaeltachta anuraidh ach caithfidh mé a rá gidh go bhfuil a dhá oiread airgead againn anois thar mar a bhí againn trí nó ceathair de bhlianta ó shin, caitheadh an t-airgead uilig anuraidh ach an méid nach dtiocfadh linn a chaitheamh toisc nach raibh na scéimeanna curtha ar aghaidh fada go leor leis an airgead a chaitheamh orthu.  Cuir i gcás, an t-airgead a bhí i gceist ag an Teachta Molloy ba do Chill Rónáin é agus, ag an am sin, ní raibh tosaithe ar an obair ach tá an obair déanta anois agus tá an t-airgead sin beagnach caite.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Coogan faoi Oileán Árann agus an bád ansin.  Tá an Naomh Éanna ansin i gcónaí agus tá an scéal á bhreithniú faoi bhád eile má bhíonn sé de dhíth in amanna áirithe i rith an tsamhraidh.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis gur ceart grá don theanga a chothú ach, mar is eol dó <Col N="2675" /> féin, is &ldquo;beatha teanga í a labhairt&rdquo; agus sílim nach ceart dó nó do dhuine ar bith eile, bheith ag caint faoi ghrá don teanga mura bhfuil siad féin sásta an iarracht a dhéanamh leis an Ghaeilge a labhairt nuair a bhíonn faill acu chuige.</P>
    <P>Labhair sé faoi na bóithre áise agus faoi na daoine nach dtiocfadh leo siúl orthu mura mbeadh wellingtons orthu agus nach bhfuil go leor á déanamh againn ó thaobh cóir a chur ar na bóithre sin.  Ó thaobh na mbóithre áise de chaith muid £78,591 orthu anuraidh, agus tá dul chun cinn mór déanta againn óna thaobh sin.  Chaith muid £14,886 ar na bóithre contae agus is cuidiú é sin ní amháin do na daoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu ar na bóithre sin ach is cuidiú é do Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe chomh maith.  Tá a fhios agam nach mbeimid sásta leis na bóithre go dtí go mbeidh bail mhaith orthu uilig.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fosta a rá go n-aontaím go mór leis an Teachta O'Hara as ucht an méid a dúirt sé mar gheall ar chultúr na tíre agus, go mórmhór, gur chuir sé san áireamh teanga na hÉireann chomh mhaith leis na damhsaí, leis an gceol agus mar sin de. Is oidhreacht iontach an oidhreacht atá againn.  Tá sí ag teacht chugainn le 2,000 bliain anuas agus sin ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach sin an teanga a shábháil mar is cuid de charactaer daoine an teanga. Sílim go gcaithfimid uilig a admháil go ndéanfadh sé dochar dá gcaillimís rud a mhúnlaigh muid ar feadh 2,000 bliain.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair ar an meastachán agus a rá go bhfeicim go bhfuil misneach ag teacht chuig muintir na Gaeltachta cionn is go bhfeiceann siad go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh mor á dhéanamh againn agus go bhfeiceann siad an lá ag teacht nach mbeidh orthu imeacht as a n-áit dúcháis le hobair a fháil ach in ionad sin go mbeidh na daoine a d'imigh i gcéin ábalta teacht ar ais agus obair fhiúntach a bheith le fáil acu ina dtír féin.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Deputies.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm five Orders made during 1967, under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962. It is a statutory requirement that such Orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made, if they are not to cease to have statutory effect at the expiration of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these Orders (No. 161) provided for an increase in the minimum specific customs duty on pneumatic <Col N="2680" /> tyres for certain mechanically propelled vehicles imported from countries other than the United Kingdom from 12/6d each to £3 each.  This action was necessary because, with the termination of global restrictions on tyres on 1st July, 1966, imports of these goods had increased considerably and were threatening the Irish industry.  With the agreement of the British Authorities, quota restrictions were imposed on United Kingdom tyres at about the same time.</P>
    <P>The second Order (No. 162) changed the licensing provision attached to the duty on manually operated lawnmowers so as to permit the issue of duty-free licences for the importation of these goods, which are not now manufactured in this country.</P>
    <P>The third Order (No. 164) was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance. It provided for the second tariff reduction on goods of United Kingdom origin in accordance with the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement, the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of goods of Northern Ireland origin; the exemption from revenue duty of cameras which are designed solely for medical or surgical purposes and certain minor editorial changes in the form of Customs tariff to take account of amendments to the Brussels Nomenclature which had been made by the Customs Co-operation Council.</P>
    <P>The fourth Order (No. 165) provided for certain duty concessions on imports of completely knocked down and fully built-up motor vehicles in accordance with the scheme for the motor assembly industry.  The purpose of this scheme, which was agreed with the manufacturers and assemblers of British motor vehicles, is to ensure the continuation of the Irish motor assembly industry at its present level at least, on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>The fifth Order (No. 166) was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance. It provided for the implementation of certain tariff concessions arising from the Government's accession to the GATT; the elimination of the duties on lignite and coke which had no protective <Col N="2681" /> effect and the attachment of the licensing provision appropriate to ordinary protective duties to a number of minor revenue duties&mdash;certain sugar articles, starch and dextrin, bottles and jars, and unprinted paper&mdash;which were no longer required for revenue purposes but had a protective effect and to some duties which had a restricted licensing provision limiting the issue of duty-free licences to goods intended for use in a manufacturing process or for the equipment of an industrial undertaking. The ordinary licensing provision permits the issue of duty-free licences in respect of goods which are not manufactured in this country.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Donegan on today's Order Paper:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann refuses to give a Second Reading to the Bill, inasmuch as it involves implementation of the Anglo Irish Free Trade Agreement, until such time as an equitable revision of that Agreement has been negotiated by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is merely to avail of a procedural method to enable certain matters to be discussed in connection with this Bill.  It is not our intention to press the amendment. The purpose is solely to enable us to discuss the Bill and certain other matters affected by the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this measure at the present time we are concerned at the recent action by the British Government, action regarded, I think, by all who have considered it as a breach of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  The recent decision to introduce the import deposit requirement is naturally viewed with concern not merely by all Parties in this House but by industrialists, manufacturers and traders who feel that their interests will be adversely affected.  When this matter was raised here some weeks ago we expressed the view that there was natural satisfaction at some action being taken to assist <Col N="2682" /> our exporters and manufacturers to overcome the effects of this import deposit by an arrangement with the banks.  That does not, however, minimise in any way our concern at the fact that this imposition is a breach of the Agreement and, because of that, we are anxious to get from the Government now some information as to what action it is proposed to take to offset the particular charge, now being met by the Exchequer, and in meeting the interest charges involved.  There are two aspects to this question&mdash;the actual amount of the charge, which can only be determined at some later stage, and the manner in which that will have to be paid off, either by regarding it as a capital charge, in the same way as the import levy was regarded three or four years ago, or by direct taxation.</P>
    <P>There is then the other aspect that this was a breach of the Agreement. Under Article 18 of that Agreement, when balance of payments difficulties arise, either party to the Agreement can take certain action.  There is provision then in two subsequent Articles &mdash;Article 23, dealing with consultation, and Article 24, dealing with the interpretation of certain terms.  Suggestions have been made that, because this was the procedure adopted, it conflicts with the terms of the Agreement and, so far as we are aware, no prior consultation took place.  There was, I think, the very minimum notification given when it was proposed to do this.  Consultation did not take place.  Since then officials, representing the Departments affected, have been holding discussions in London and further talks, according to press reports, are to take place apparently in the New Year.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter and it is one I am anxious to discuss because of the terms of the Agreement and the effect of a further reduction in tariffs next July.  This Agreement, as does any agreement of this character, depends for its success on its being operated in good faith and in full by both parties.  Under Article 23, subparagraph (3), there is provision that, where there are any variations of the terms of the Agreement, either party at the request of the other shall enter into consultation.  If, as now appears <Col N="2683" /> certain from the recent British Government decision, the import deposit requirement lasts for a full period of 12 months at a minimum, then we are entitled to say that there shall be no further tariff reductions at the rate of ten per cent each year as provided for in the Agreement.  Under this Bill we confirm the Order which gave effect to the reduction of ten per cent last July.</P>
    <P>It is our view that where this agreement has been breached a continuance in the rate of tariff reduction at 10 per cent should not be proceeded with, and we raise this matter to express on behalf of the Opposition as well as the Government the concern that is felt at the British decision to impose this deposit requirement.  In 1964, when the special levies were imposed and, again when this import deposit requirement was made effective, the British Government decided against quantitative restrictions. It is obvious that they cannot apply quantitative restrictions against this country while they are not applied against others in the non-discriminatory GATT clause.</P>
    <P>The effect of this decision is to create uncertainty as to the operation of the trade agreement.  The terms of the agreement, if properly enforced, would provide protection at present against the recent decision.  A number of us remember many years ago under the 1948 Trade Agreement the concern we felt as to the situation that developed because of the suggestion that the requirement in respect of coal would not be honoured and, at that time, we had to enter into negotiations with the British Government on the matter. Nowadays the position of coal is obviously less important in our economy but, in the immediate postwar situation, it was of vital significance.</P>
    <P>One of the defects of certain phraseology in agreements of this character, as was true at that time, is that while the Government intend to use their best endeavours to meet certain situations, these phrases are common character, if you like, or commonly adopted in agreements but, when they <Col N="2684" /> come to be interpreted in precise and actual terms as applied to a specific situation, their vagueness becomes fully apparent.</P>
    <P>In this situation I feel the Government have an obligation to make clear the national concern which is felt here. In this regard I feel that the advantage of a discussion of this character is to emphasise to the British Government the concern of the Dáil and the concern of the country at the present breach of the agreement.  It is true that, under the terms of Article 18 of the Free Trade Area Agreement, either Government may take action in respect of balance of payments difficulties.  It is equally true, and provided for in that section, that the party which has not taken measures&mdash;in other words in this case the Irish Government&mdash;may propose at any time other measures designed to moderate any damaging effect of the restrictions or to assist that party to overcome its difficulties.</P>
    <P>As well as the present action the future situation is giving rise to concern because of the announcement by the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, indicating that it was proposed to continue what was described as a policy of selective expansion which has been followed since 1965.  While that may be strictly true as a statement of policy, the situation has changed since 1965 in that this agreement was negotiated in the very closing days of 1965 and took effect from the beginning of 1966.  Under this selective expansion policy, widespread concern has been expressed at the indication that cheese imports in Britain from this country, or exports from this country to Britain, might be restricted in quantity.</P>
    <P>When we take the two things together, the imposition of this import deposit requirement and the continuance of a fairly clear indication of a variation in the terms of this selective expansion policy in respect of agriculture, it becomes obvious that there must be considerable national concern at the trend of British policy.  Naturally, we sympathise with and understand the British in their economic difficulties.  It is a fact of geography as well as trade that these two islands are closely <Col N="2685" /> associated and, if difficulties are encountered in Britain, they must affect us here.  We have long since advanced from the situation in which anyone believed there were large alternative markets.  That does not mean we should not exploit and attempt to expand and develop markets elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When this agreement was originally negotiated it was negotiated on the basis that it was a step towards this country's entry into the EEC.  This now seems to be no longer a practical possibility in anything like the relatively near future.  That means we must seek and develop alternative markets if we can elsewhere.  We should certainly examine the situation and explore the possibilities.  We should, at the same time, realise that geographic and trading conditions make it reasonably certain that the vast bulk of our trade for so long as most of us can see ahead will continue to be between this country and Britain.  That makes it all the more important that agreements of this character should be balanced agreements.  We should endeavour now when discussions are taking place, as we are entitled to under the terms of the agreement, to consider and consult. Article XXIII (3) provides:</P>
    <P>Should either party consider that an obligation under this Agreement has not been fulfilled or that any benefit conferred upon it by this Agreement is being or may be frustrated or that any cases of special difficulty have arisen or may arise, or that a change in circumstances necessitates or may necessitate a variation in the terms of this Agreement, the other party shall on request enter into consultation immediately with a view to seeking an equitable and mutually satisfactory solution which preserves the balance of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>While it is true, as I have said, that the vast bulk of our trade is with Britain, it is not all one-sided.  The extent of our trade with Britain and Britain's trade with us now exceeds over £250 million a year on a two-way basis.  That is a sizeable figure by any standards.  While we gain advantages from the size of that trade we also provide a market for British exporters <Col N="2686" /> to this country and we are anxious to ensure that the future operation of this agreement will be undertaken within the terms of Article 23 so that an equitable and mutually satisfactory solution will continue to operate to preserve the balance of the agreement.</P>
    <P>We expressed at the time this agreement was negotiated certain doubts about particular aspects of it which anything that has happened since has confirmed.  At the same time, we believe that we should exploit and develop whatever advantages are in the agreement rather than attempt to terminate it in a situation in which no one can foresee what the future European trading arrangements will be.  One of the defects of the agreement is the fact that it is irrevocable but there is a power in it to consult and to discuss and to reach what are described as equitable and mutually satisfactory solutions.  We believe that when this recent decision was taken, accompanied by the recent statement of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries in Britain, the time has arrived for a full review of the agreement that we are entitled and that the Government are entitled in the New Year to undertake a full review to see that the terms of the agreement are respected and that our position, the position of our exporters and workers is safeguarded. No doubt concern has been expressed and one of the Orders which is confirmed here provides protection in respect of rubber goods and tyres and is designed to avoid a situation which caused redundancy in Dunlops 12 or 18 months ago.  These are the aspects of the agreement which have caused doubts among workers and caused some concern.</P>
    <P>The prospect of the whole European trading situation has altered since this agreement was negotiated, certainly altered to the extent that despite efforts in a number of quarters there appears to be no immediate prospect of a change.  It is therefore obvious that the claims that were made that free trade conditions would become more widespread in the immediate future do not appear to be realisable in present conditions to the same extent.  Certainly the action of the British Government, or indeed the action of some other Governments, <Col N="2687" /> either of an administrative character or of character comparable to the import deposit requirement, make it obvious that when difficulties arise Governments will take action to protect their situation.  I believe that we have an obligation to take the same action to offset the effects of this agreement and to seek a review within the terms of the agreement so that the operation of it will provide an equitable and satisfactory solution and preserve the balance of the agreement in the interests of our farmers as well as our manufacturers and traders and all those who are employed in Irish industry and in Irish concerns.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to know how to approach this particular subject and particularly the amendment in the name of Deputy Patrick S. Donegan with regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I regret that the Taoiseach did not think it was an opportune time for a pretty full debate on the operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in view of recent restrictions imposed on industrial exports from this country to Britain.  I am not enthusiastic about the amendment that has been spoken to by Deputy Cosgrave but, on the other hand, I regret that he does not intend to press it to a division.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan, in the amendment, calls for an equitable revision of the agreement.  I want to reiterate the stand that the Labour Party took when this Agreement was being debated in the House in January, 1966.  We did not believe it was a good agreement.  We did not believe that there was an advantage for Ireland in the agreement and, as it has turned out now and as has been said by Deputy Cosgrave, even in the working of the agreement to which we objected the balance of advantage appears to be overwhelmingly on the side of Britain.  I regret, therefore, that the Fine Gael Party are not pressing this amendment.  We have not yet decided whether or not we will call for a division on it.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the amendment itself I think, while it is related to the Bill, certainly could be taken apart from any provisions which I agree the Minister has included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, what the Labour Party believe is that the agreement should not be reviewed but that it should be scrapped&mdash;that may be a crude word for it&mdash;and that a new agreement should be drawn up.  I do not want to make a long speech on this.  If I were to, I would merely repeat the arguments I made in January, 1966.  In any case, it appears that we have got the worst side of the bargain in this Agreement and, mark you, I would say this as far as the agreement is concerned: the Irish Government appear to have behaved like gentlemen, too much like gentlemen as a matter of fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that the British Government, in order to correct their balance of payments problem, took certain steps without consultation.  It was stressed very much in the debate in 1966 that, if there were to be any moves made by one side or the other, there was to be prior notification and consultation.  The Taoiseach admitted himself here a few weeks ago that he was notified as to what the British were going to do with regard to industrial exports from this country, but there was no indication from the British Government that there was to be any sort of consultation because, in fact, there was no time for it.  What the Taoiseach did when he went to London I do not know.  But, with all due respect to him and to the Government, I think all he did and all he intended to do was to make a token protest.  The whole thing seems a bit suspicious to the Labour Party and particularly to me.  On the day we asked the Taoiseach if he were going across to Britain to try to negotiate better terms in respect of these restrictions, he told us that there were no arrangements made and, lo and behold, in three, four or five hours he was on a plane to London.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he did.  I did not hear him or read it in the newspapers, but maybe I missed that.  Anyway, it seems that the Irish Government were treated somewhat with contempt by the British Government.  The British, because they had a balance of payments problem, took certain physical steps to control the importation of Irish industrial goods to that country. I know that we have used a certain device to surmount that, and I will refer to it later on.  However, we also had a balance of payments problem. The Taoiseach, as acting Minister for Finance, was very worried about it when he spoke in this House when introducing his mini-Budget.  He said that if we did not take corrective measures the balance of payments problem would be three or four times as big by the end of 1969.</P>
      <P>What did we do?  We did not impose physical controls as the British have done.  We introduced a mini-Budget. We believed that the best way to correct our balance of payments problem was to tax cigarettes and drink and to increase postal charges and the various other things in the Budget.  We did not introduce any sort of measures such as were introduced by the British Government. We were advised by the Central Bank recently that credit would have to be restricted except for certain productive purposes.  Now, the Bill here provides for approval of a reduction of ten per cent in our tariff protection from 1st July of this year and what we are anxious to know is&mdash;and this is what we asked the Taoiseach&mdash;did the Taoiseach tell Mr. Harold Wilson or the British Government whether or not we were still going to proceed with the reduction of ten per cent of our tariff protection from 1st July, 1969.  That is why I say we are behaving too much like gentlemen as far as this agreement is concerned.  The British take steps to restrict importation of Irish industrial goods.  What do we say?  We say that we are going to make it easier for the British to send industrial products to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, therefore, to know from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he has that information, to tell us what are our intentions.  We were told a few years ago that there <Col N="2690" /> was urgency about this because Europe was right around the corner.  It was stressed year after year since 1959-60 that we would be in the European Economic Community by 1970.  Might I suggest&mdash;and I do not want to give any solace to those Irish industrialists who are not preparing for free trade at some time&mdash;that the situation is not so urgent now and I think certain sections of Irish industry and those employed in it should be given a chance, particularly in the light of what the British Government have done with regard to the industrial products which we usually export to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, therefore, that we should have to stick entirely to the terms of the agreement and the spirit of the agreement, as was mentioned by the Taoiseach, to such an extent that we will strip ourselves further of protection from 1st July, 1969, at the rate of ten per cent.  The crunch is now coming or will come if this ten per cent reduction in insisted on from 1st July, 1969.  Our tariff protection was so high in its initial form, in 1966, that it was more or less prohibitive.  It was absolute protection in that it was 60 per cent and up to 75 per cent in respect of countries other than those in the British Commonwealth, but the effect of the ten per cent reductions will certainly be felt with the next reduction; and if we proceed to reduce protection by a further 10 per cent in 1970, in my view, Irish industrial employment will take quite a beating.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, we are going to provide £25 million for six months in order to facilitate the export of Irish industrial goods into Britain and by that method&mdash;and I suppose we can do nothing about it in present circumstances in view of the type of agreement we have&mdash;£25 million will be available to the British Treasury for six months. This is what we are doing in order to help Britain with her balance of payment problem whilst, on the other hand, they do not appear to be too concerned about the balance of payments problem that has been described to us in this House by the Taoiseach as acting Minister for Finance.  We have to service this £25 million that is to be made available to the tune of approximately <Col N="2691" /> £2 million or a little less but, in round figures, £2 million and now the Irish taxpayer, who has been asked to pay more in the mini-Budget for certain commodities in order to redress our balance of payments problem, will also be asked to pay £2 million in order to assist Britain in her balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is quite good enough.  That is the reason why we believe that this agreement should be terminated and that the Taoiseach and his Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance and Agriculture should go to Great Britain and negotiate a Trade Agreement in which there are no loopholes such as we have experienced in the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>The British have broken their side of the bargain and, as I have said, we are going to behave like gentlemen, going to do everything that is right. That is all very well but when people are dependent on these decisions, when Irish industrial employment is dependent on these decisions, we should not alone protect our balance of payments by physical methods, by restrictions on imports of British goods, but take steps to safeguard our industries and the people who work in them.</P>
    <P>We believed when we discussed this in July, 1966, and we still believe, that the balance of advantage was with Great Britain.  We said in the House, despite what the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, said, that there was no real advantage for Irish agriculture.  I do not think that anybody, even the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, could say that there has been any dramatic improvement in agriculture or in farm income or in agricultural exports since this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was signed.  There has been no dramatic improvement as far as industry is concerned, no dramatic improvement in the provision of jobs in Irish industry.  We are getting about the same kind of average as we got when we had not got the agreement.  So, there is no advantage in it for this country.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, said <Col N="2692" /> that the farmers of this country in the first year of operation of the agreement would get an extra £10 million income.  All I say in that respect is, tell that to the farmers.  They have not seen this.  We have not got anything from the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement as far as industry is concerned. If there has been any improvement, it is not because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we are to proceed like this there should be a selective dismantling of the tariff barriers.  I know there are provisions whereby certain industries can be singled out for special protection and attention but this has not happened.  There are very few industries in this country that have not been hit by the two ten per cent reductions since the agreement came into operation or who will escape from 1st July, 1969.</P>
    <P>There are industries in this country who do not need protection; there are industries that need a degree of protection and there are industries that need a lot of protection until they get on their feet.  It is not so much the fault of Irish industry that they have not progressed as they should as it is of various Governments who have been in office, because up to about seven or eight years ago industries were led by all Governments and by all Ministers for Industry and Commerce to believe that this protection would last for a long time.  I believe that these industries were not ready for the stripping of protection and, if there is to be stripping of protection, it should be done in a selective way in order to ensure that all industries that are in any way worthwhile will survive.</P>
    <P>Again, we are in trouble.  Because the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was mentioned here, I want to mention very briefly&mdash;I think Deputy Cosgrave mentioned it also&mdash; the position as far as the exports of cheese from this country are concerned. It is a pity that we do not know what decision, if any, has been arrived at as a result of the negotiations between the top civil servants who went to England to discuss the question of cheese and other agricultural imports to Britain from this country.  It was a loosely <Col N="2693" /> worded agreement.  There was much mention of understandings, and all this sort of thing.  There was an understanding that our butter quota, for example, would be increased.  I think it is now at about 26,000 tons.  As far as we can gather, apart from there being no prospect of an increase, there is a likelihood that this may be reduced.  If that is one of the results of the agreement, it appears to me that what we believed and said two or three years ago is now justified.</P>
    <P>There has not been this dramatic increase, as I have said, in the export of butter from this country to Great Britain and it seems that a move may be made to decrease the amount of cheese we send to that country because, from reports we get, it seems that the British market is flooded with cheese from all over the world.  As I said, I regret that the Taoiseach and the Government did not decide to have a full dress debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  I do not know what their motive was but I believe that they are somewhat ashamed of this agreement. It was not all that it was claimed to be when the various Ministers spoke on it when it was announced here.</P>
    <P>On the actual Bill there are a number of points on which the Minister might enlighten me.  He says that:</P>
    <P>The first of these Orders (No. 161) provided for an increase in the minimum specific customs duty on pneumatic tyres for certain mechanically propelled vehicles imported from countries other than the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Does this refer to tyres when it says &ldquo;from countries other than the United Kingdom&rdquo; or vehicles?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the second Order changed the licensing provision attached to the duty on manually operated lawnmowers so as to permit the issue of duty free licences for the importation of these goods, which are not now manufactured in this country.  There must be a big market for these lawnmowers or are people so well off now that they are all using electric or petrol driven <Col N="2694" /> motor lawnmowers?  It appears that if the Minister wants to do anything to promote Irish Industry he might induce industrialists to engage in this business. The fourth Order, he said:</P>
      <P>provided for certain duty concessions on imports of completely knocked down and fully built-up motor vehicles in accordance with the scheme for the motor assembly industry.  The purpose of this scheme, which was agreed with the manufacturers and assemblers of British motor vehicles, is to ensure the continuation of the Irish motor assembly industry at its present level at least, on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any comment in respect of the importation of knockeddown parts in respect of Continental cars?  Naturally I am concerned with the industry in my own constituency, that of Renault's.  I am sure there are others who assemble other Continental cars and I would like to know how they stand in regard to this Order which is, as the Minister said, only in respect of British motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about the Deputy's query.  Does he want to know the rate of duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, how do Continental parts stand as far as import duty is concerned, as against the British?  That is all I wish to say on this Bill.  As I said already, it is a pity that we did not have a full dress debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  I regret that the Fine Gael Party are not pressing this amendment.  I do not want to engage in sharp political practice by calling for a division, I do not think that this brief debate is one in which we can or should challenge the Government on the whole issue of the Free Trade Agreement, but I trust that as soon as the Dáil re-assembles, or even, if conditions worsen with regard to the agreement, the Taoiseach will call a special session of the Dáil as he did by telegram on 4th January, 1966.  The situation is more urgent now than in 1966 in view of the British Government's action with regard to our industrial products.  If not now, perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;I know he must be concerned about <Col N="2695" /> this&mdash;will induce the Taoiseach at a future date to have such a debate so that we can get an Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in which there will be advantages for both sides, in relation to our industry and our agriculture and so that the British Government will not be able to play ducks and drakes with us as they have been doing with the Agreement negotiated by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy Corish and I sympathise with the sentiments he expressed. I am, however, a bit surprised that he has not appreciated that instead of complaining about the Government's refusal to permit a debate on the Free Trade Agreement situation and instead of griping about it the Fine Gael Party have done something about it.  We have tabled this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Deputy Corish complains that time was not given to discuss that motion and I think time should have been given.  I agree entirely with him. However, instead of griping and complaining in that regard we have taken action in regard to this Bill by tabling this amendment so that this debate can take place.  It is in that sense, that there may be an exchange of views here because this matter is of deep concern to the people, that we have tabled the amendment.  We seek information and we hope that as a result of this debate the information may be forthcoming. Deputy Cosgrave said, and Deputy Corish agreed with his point of view, that there is a feeling of very deep concern with regard to the present situation of our trading relations with Great Britain.  There is deep concern particularly among those employed in our various industries who feel a certain sense of insecurity, an insecurity which stems chiefly from a lack of knowledge of what precisely is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can remember three years ago almost when the Free Trade Agreement was introduced and debated here. <Col N="2696" /> From the Ministerial speeches at the time one could detect a certain definite air of euphoria in relation to what they were saying.  The Agreement was introduced by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, as something which must be a tremendous boon for agriculture and industry.  He made two points. He said that this Agreement was sought by the Irish Government, that it came about on the initiative of the Irish Government, and he said that it was an irrevocable Agreement designed and intended to represent a permanent statement of our trading relations with Great Britain.  He was followed by other Ministers, in particular the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, who assured the farmers that for the first time they were getting clear and definite access to British markets on a permanent basis for expanding production.  Every farmer was assured that from the following July his income would increase significantly and that £10 million was suddenly going to pour into the pockets of the farmers.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is understandable if one is making a case that one may be inclined to err on the side of exaggeration but the exaggerated claims that were made from Ministerial benches three years ago are very hard to understand now that the people have been able to temper this agreement in the hard light of experience.  We in the Fine Gael Party had expressed very definite doubts and reservations.  We did not wish to act in this House in any irresponsible manner so far as our Party was concerned.  Traditionally, we have always felt that there should be order and system in our trading relations with Britain and, indeed, with other countries.  At times in the past we have had to keep down wild men with one hand and build with the other, always aspiring towards a proper trading relationship with Great Britain, even when certain people held the view that it would be better for Ireland if every ship carrying Irish cattle could be sunk in the sea.  Therefore, when we were expressing our reservations and our doubts three years ago, we were not doing so in any irresponsible manner.  We were faced with the fact that this Agreement drawn up by the <Col N="2697" /> Fianna Fáil Government on their own initiative&mdash;as we were told by their Leader&mdash;was an Agreement which repudiated the existing Trade Agreement of 1948.</P>
    <P>That Agreement of 1948 had stood the test of time.  It was&mdash;and I use this phrase in a parliamentary sense&mdash; a damn good bargain so far as this country was concerned.  It was an Agreement which enabled our agricultural products and our industrial products to find expanding markets.  It was an Agreement which served this country, on balance, reasonably well. Of course, there were things that might have been in it that were not in it.  There were new positions that this Government could legitimately have aspired to get into an extension of that Agreement or, indeed, get into a new Agreement three years ago.  The fact is that, when the present Free Trade Agreement was introduced here in January of 1966, it had replaced the 1948 Agreement, and if Dáil Éireann had failed to approve of that Agreement, the situation would have been that we would have had no trading understanding or agreement whatsoever with Great Britain.  We would then have been back in a position of chaos and anarchy which I do not think would have been profitable or good for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It had been cancelled and was finished with. However, it is only a slight point; it does not matter.  One of the things that concerned us was, first of all, the fact <Col N="2698" /> that this Agreement containing the imperfections that we pointed out was now to be irrevocable, a permanent expression of our trading relations with Britain.  I remember saying at the time in that debate that it struck me as extraordinary that, after two or three Ministerial visits to London, even though the Ministers were backed up by high-powered civil servants and all the rest of it, any team of Ministers could be so convinced of their omniscience that they would be able to say: &ldquo;For all time we have done a deal with the British.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would have thought that such an agreement would have taken years of study and a careful assessment of what the expansion of our economy could mean to our people, to employment, to industry, and so on.  But a few short visits and back they came and said: &ldquo;Now we have done a deal.  We sought it ourselves.  It came from our initiative and, apart from refinements, and so on, it will be a permanent expression of our trading relations with Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Certainly, it was not so accepted by the Fine Gael Party.  The only basis upon which we could tolerate, and did tolerate, the introduction of such an agreement was that it represented a stepping-stone on the way to European union.  It was in the sense that, before this agreement could ever have its full effect, this country and Britain would have been part of the European Community and this agreement, with its imperfections, would have disappeared under the Treaty of Rome.  It was only in that sense that we regarded the agreement in any kind of reasonable light.  I should add that we made it perfectly clear that if the Free Trade Agreement was to stand on its own, divorced from Europe and divorced from any possibility of this country entering the European Community, then we would oppose it vehemently and if we had the power we would cancel the agreement and repudiate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not a question, as was made clear at the time, of repudiating the Agreement in defiance of its terms, because this agreement in its preamble is based on the understanding that both countries would be in the European Community by 1970.  If that assumption <Col N="2699" /> is no longer possible, if the idea of entering into Europe has receded into the distance, then the entire basis for this agreement has disappeared.  It is not a question of breaking the agreement if one says now something else has to take its place.  It means that there never has been a consensus <i>ad idem</i> in the proper sense to bring about an agreement if the terms upon which it is based no longer apply.</P>
    <P>It is because three years later, at the end of 1968, that we now must regard the possibility of European membership as having receded into the distance that we are forced now to regard the terms of this agreement in a very cold, analytical and realistic manner.  The agreement does not suit the trading relation between Great Britain and Ireland in the circumstances that both countries are outside Europe.  I hope no one in this House will ever forget that prior to 1921 there was a free trade area between this island and the island of Great Britain and that free trade area had existed for many hundreds of years.  We know the consequences.  We know the desire of our people to end it. It would indeed be an extraordinary thing if it were ever thought in the national interest to restore that kind of free trade, completely isolated and removed from free trade in the larger community of European nations.</P>
    <P>In accepting this agreement, in the sense that it was to be regarded as part and parcel of our advance into Europe, there were two or three features of it that we welcomed.  One feature undoubtedly was the provisions in Article 18.  Article 18 is the Article which deals with balance of payments difficulties.  I think it is no harm to remind the House that, in the autumn of 1965, the people of this country, particularly those involved in industry, were shocked at the sudden imposition by the new Labour Government in England of import levies on our goods going into the British market.  Our people were shocked because here was a sudden imposition which, in fact, was a tariffing of our exports to Britain.  That was done in the autumn of 1965 without consultation by the British Government. Concerned, as they were, and as <Col N="2700" /> British Governments traditionally are, primarily with the interests of their own economy, and without thinking of the harm they might do to others, they proceeded to impose import levies. They offended every member of EFTA. They offended us.  They were acting in defiance of the 1948 Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement: they were acting in defiance of the EFTA Treaty&mdash;but they did not mind.  Comparatively speaking, they were the powerful economy and they were doing just what suited them.</P>
    <P>I always thought it extraordinary that, stemming from that breach by the British of the 1948 Agreement, there should have come the Fianna Fáil initiative of 1965, the initiative of which the former Taoiseach was so proud, the initiative to seek permanent agreement with the British&mdash;but it came from that.  One of the extraordinary things about this agreement when it was introduced here was that it adopted the import levies: they were never repealed. They were adopted&mdash;swallowed by us&mdash;but a lesson was learned and, in Article 18, provision was made that, for the future, never again would we have anything like tariffs or import levies even in the interests of balance of payments difficulties.  That Article specifically provided that, while either parties to the agreement would be entitled to take unilateral action in relation to balance of payments difficulties, the action would be limited to the application of quota restrictions.</P>
    <P>I want just to say this about that particular Article.  As was stated at the time on our behalf, we welcomed that Article because it was a pity the illegal imposition of import levies by the British had been tolerated by our Government and at least they had come back with this safeguard that import levies or duties could never be imposed again and that the only action the British could take would be the imposition of quotas&mdash;because we knew that the British could never, in fact, impose quotas.  I must say I thought&mdash;we thought&mdash;that Article 18 represented a brilliant victory for Irish negotiation.  We thought our team of Ministers had codded the British into a situation in which they could not take any action against us in relation <Col N="2701" /> to balance of payment difficulties.  One might think that if they were restricted to quota restrictions then, under the GATT set-up, they could not impose quotas upon us unless they imposed them upon every other country concerned in GATT.  One might think that under the non-discriminatory clauses in the GATT organisation, they were prevented from imposing a quota on us unless they imposed it upon everybody&mdash;and, in Britain's trading position, that would be unthinkable.  Therefore, Article 18 appeared to us to be the one redeeming feature in the Free Trade Area Agreement of three years ago.  It meant, in fact, that, in relation to balance of payments difficulties Britain had deprived herself&mdash;probably because of the gain she was going to get&mdash;of the wide powers which she had exercised so callously in the past of imposing duties and tariffs on our goods coming into her markets.</P>
    <P>It is because of that background that we asked the House to view&mdash;with the dismay and anxiety which, from these benches, we seek to express&mdash; the action actually taken by the British Government in the past few weeks in relation to their present balance of payments difficulty because what they did was to do, under another name, what precisely they did in the Autumn of 1965.  They have now, by calling the requirement an &ldquo;import deposit&rdquo; provided for the imposition of duties upon Irish goods entering the British market.  By no means can what they did be termed a quota restriction.  Under no circumstances could it be regarded as a quantitative restriction nor, under any circumstances, could it be regarded, under the definition of Article 24, as any prohibition, quota, licence or other measure with equivalent effect.</P>
    <P>So, it is not a quota.  It is not a quantitative restriction nor is it something with equivalent effect.  If an importer or exporter, as the case may be, wishes to send in £1 million worth of goods, he can send in as much as he likes but, in relation to each part of what he sends in there will have to be a deposit or a duty.</P>
    <P>It is not, therefore, a quantitative restriction or a quota, or anything of that kind, or anything happening with <Col N="2702" /> an equivalent effect.  It clearly is a duty and a levy on goods coming in.  It really becomes a matter for concern when one finds, in fact, that Ireland's cause is raised in the British House of Commons by the Conservative or Tory Party.  It is worth recalling that on a motion two weeks ago by the present Opposition Party in the British House of Commons that Party raised with the British Government what they said appeared to them to be a clear breach of the Free Trade Agreement with Ireland.  They referred to the fact that what was done by their Government appeared to be the imposition of a levy or a duty and not a quantitative restriction which alone was provided for under the Agreement.  I read the debate that took place and I must confess I found it very difficult to follow the case made in defence of the British action by the British Attorney General. I do not think he was able to make any case.  He seemed to concede, in fact, that the imposition of a deposit was equivalent to the operation of a duty but he said that, under the definition of quantitative restrictions, pretty well anything was permitted.  If that is the interpretation by the British in respect of their own language then we obviously speak a language of our own. It is perfectly clear that what was done was done in defiance of the terms used in both Article 18 and Article 24.</P>
    <P>It is in the circumstances of the British doing something which appears to us, unless we are completely confused, to be a flagrant breach of the Agreement that we view with concern what seems to be the complacent attitude of our Government.  Deputy Corish says the Government have been acting too much like gentlemen.  Perhaps they have.  Certainly for the Leader of the Government to describe what the British have done as being in breach of the spirit of this Agreement is making a tremendous concession. Surely the correct attitude is and should have been the attitude we are expressing on these benches, that this is in breach of the terms of the Agreement, and that is the attitude we should maintain at all times in relation to our discussions with the British.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2703" /> Just think of the British Government !  Their own Opposition, the Tory Opposition, say they broke the terms of their Agreement with the Irish.  But the Irish Government say no such thing.  What, in heaven's name, did the British Prime Minister think of the <i>cri de coeur</i> from Government Buildings here: &ldquo;Will you ever spare me half an hour or so.  I want to see you&rdquo;?  It was, of course, a token visit. Nothing else.  The Taoiseach, before he went to see the British Prime Minister, had prevented himself from having any grounds for argument or complaint.  He started off by approving the proposition that this was a breach of the spirit of the Agreement and he then went across to London to say &ldquo;Tut, tut&rdquo; to the British Prime Minister. He said himself he was like the boy who went to the fair&mdash;he did not expect to get much and he came back not disappointed.  Of course, he was not disappointed.  Of course, he did not expect to get much.  How could he when he had carefully ensured that no member of the British Government would take his visit as anything more than a token gesture to prevent misunderstanding and criticism at home.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing&mdash;I think it is Gilbertian&mdash;that a trade agreement made by a Fianna Fáil Government on behalf of this country should be upheld not by them but by the Tory Opposition in the British House of Commons.  That is the position in which our country now is.  We appear to have in office a Government which is clueless, which does not appear to know the strength of its own position, which does not appear to prize or value the agreements which it negotiates on our behalf.  It does not even appear to understand the import of and the necessity for having in international discussions and bargaining a position from which one can fight. It is an intolerable situation.  It is for that reason, before the drift gets worse and a bad situation becomes really intolerable, that we want to get certain assurances from the Government.</P>
    <P>We are told that civil servants are at the moment discussing matters with the British.  What are they discussing?  Why <Col N="2704" /> cannot we be told?  Remember what is involved in this is the bread and butter of thousands of Irish families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They must be in the context of a new agreement more balanced in the interests of this country.  Europe has receded into the distance.  The circumstances set out in the Preamble to this Agreement no longer apply.  We are, and will remain, a weaker economy.  We are a small economy with a small population.  If we are to survive, in those circumstances, as an independent, economic entity we must get particular and special guarantees in relation to any trading arrangements with the British. That seems common sense.  I cannot understand how any member of this Government can be so utterly complacent in relation to certain important aspects of our country's future.  Jobs are at risk.  Industries are at risk.  Factories and plants are in danger.  If this Agreement continues to operate and if we cannot get into Europe many facets of our Irish economy are at considerable hazard and risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked in this Bill to approve the reduction by ten per cent of the tariff level last July.  Fair enough.  That is so much water under the bridge. But what will happen next July when another ten per cent is supposed to go? Are we to stand idly by like so many <Col N="2705" /> pretty little gentlemen observing not merely the letter but the spirit of our Trade Agreement with Britain, and allowing the hard-headed Saxon to have it both ways?  Surely the time has come to have a bit of common sense. I would not be sending high-powered civil servants across to London trailing their coats with their opposite numbers in the British Board of Trade.  I would have high-powered ministerial delegations across in London hammering out a good bargain on behalf of this country, a realistic bargain, a bargain which would be expressed in terms which could be understood and operated.</P>
    <P>If Britain and Ireland are to go into Europe some day, whenever it may be &mdash;perhaps when other voices are heard in France and elsewhere&mdash;surely it should be the aspiration and wish of both Governments that each should go in with a greater degree of mutual trust than they now have, with their economies stronger than they now are, and with more people in profitable employment than there are at the moment? Surely that should be the aim of any mutual arrangement and relationship between these two islands?  If it is to be the aim it cannot be achieved under an arrangement which dismantles the Irish economy long before the possibility of entering Europe is a reality. That can only mean that the economy of this country is sucked dry by the comparatively powerful British economy and, if and when Europe becomes more proximate, we will be entering as a tattered limping invalid on the heels of Britain.  That is not a desirable prospect. It is something that should be avoided.</P>
    <P>We have tabled this amendment to urge again upon the Government that clichés and phrases and bromides issued at dinners and luncheons will not do.  A serious situation is looming up and there should be evidence before this Dáil goes into recess that our Government know what they are doing and are proceeding to do it.  Let us have no more phrases such as we had from the Taoiseach about the boy going to the fair not expecting to get much and therefore not being disappointed.  That will not do.</P>

Let us have no more of the Minister for Industry and Commerce issuing clichés to the effect that we will be able to face up to the challenges when they come.  I am sure our people will, and I am sure those engaged in industry will.  When I say I am sure those engaged in industry will, I do not merely mean the owners of the plant and the owners of the capital, because there should be a partnership between management and workers. There is certainly a joint interest, and definitely a joint responsibility, and I am certain that the challenges that are waved around the place, whatever they may be, can be met only when that partnership goes into action with a determination to win.  They cannot do that in this atmosphere of uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trade Agreement appears to operate now as a one-sided arrangement, with us observing both the spirit and the word and, so far as Britain are concerned, neither the spirit nor the word being applicable if it suits them. Added to that we have vague talk about discussions with the British and visits by civil servants, but no one is told for what purpose.  We now have the situation in which the Leader of the Government refuses to give time to discuss this important matter, a matter which is of vital concern to all sections of our economy.  Time is refused. A measure of recognition is due to the fact that it was Deputy Donegan on reading this Bill who realised that under the terms of the Bill and the amendment he tabled, this discussion could take place today.  For that reason it is taking place not in any partisan spirit, and not seeking to score any Party political advantage, but in the exercise of our right as the Opposition to ensure that we will get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if we cannot get it from the Taoiseach, some account of what is being done in our name and on our behalf by nameless civil servants in some peculiar refinement of the terms of the Agreement. <Col N="2707" /> At least I hope we will be able to get this, and also an assurance that the anxiety we express in relation to this entire Agreement with Britain will be reflected in Government action.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to imagine having fresh discussions with the British.  It is not difficult to imagine a new arrangement being worked out with the British. Both the British Government and our people here have a very definite joint interest in mutual growth and understanding. I am certain the British will appreciate that we are peculiarly vulnerable and sensitive because we are developing our economy and we have to be very certain about any arrangement we conclude with them.  I am certain that with the proper approach, not cap in hand for that would not be right, and not going to the market expecting to get nothing but a kick or a blow, not an approach in any servile sense, but in the same traditional way as we have sought in the interests of our people to build up and safeguard our economy, we would make progress, but it is urgent that we do it and it is urgent that this Government be spurred into doing it.  Let us hope that the next few weeks will be spent thinking along these lines and that as Europe disappears, as it may, as it recedes certainly, this Agreement will be put on the shelves, put aside and a new transitional agreement pending our entry into Europe concluded with the British, an arrangement which would recognise that a liberalisation of our country <i>visá-vis</i> the British cannot be a three or four years operation.  If we are to think merely of the British our protection must be spaced over a much longer period.  Other terms, other provisions obviously will require immediate attention; but just hammering in a nail to cover over a slight little aperture that has appeared in this Agreement is not going to solve the problems of our country <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment standing in my name has ensured that this Dáil can discuss the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement at this juncture and that was the purpose of my Party. I want to make it clear that we understand <Col N="2708" /> that the legislation that must now go through would affect the Dunlop Tyre Company in Cork if it were delayed and many others and this would be extremely serious.  Therefore, this amendment will not be pressed to a vote.  However, it has shown one thing.  I do not claim myself, even though Deputy O'Higgins attributed it to me, credit for having this discussed but my Party were in a position to see that it would be discussed.  Any ill effects that might arise if this Bill did not become law within 18 months shall not arise because this Party will not impede certain provisions that are necessary.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it is absolutely necessary at this juncture to discuss the position in relation to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
      <P>I want to approach it, as the spokesman on matters of industry and commerce in my Party, on the basis that I am quite clear that at the time the Agreement was signed there was no other course, that in fact when the Fine Gael Party took that line and agreed with the Government at that time they were correct.  I would also point to the fact that certain good results have ensued.  It would be wrong and churlish to say that the whole thing was wrong, to say that the whole business was improper, ill advised from its birth and that in fact it has brought no advantages to this country.  Of course, it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face the fact that the removal of duties on Irish industrial goods into Britain has had a very good effect.  It is also true that it has endangered very many jobs in industry here because of the reduction in tariffs that is proceeding at this time. It is of the utmost importance that we now have a second look at it and in fact the Government should come to this House quite soon and tell us of the results of the operations of their civil servants in London and what benefits have been got.  The Taoiseach's admission that he did not go hoping for much and he did not get much either must be improved upon.  The matter is too serious for industry and employment here to approach it in any partisan spirit.  It is quite clear that at this time there is need for a look at this Agreement, a very serious look at it and <Col N="2709" /> decisions by both Parties in good will to try to get the most for everybody and particularly in our case the most for ourselves.  There is a provision in the Free Trade Agreement whereby after five years we could look at the situation here as these tariffs were removed. There is a provision also whereby if unemployment were caused or there was a serious situation in any sphere of industry or any industry here that certain quantitive restrictions could be put on for a period of 18 months.  These were safety provisions. They could be implemented by us if there was any danger that we were being affected by the imports of British goods.</P>
    <P>At this time of course, the boot is on the other foot; but I would like to point to the fact that, while newspaper reports last week giving the figures from the British statistics available indicated that the gap had widened, the difference between the imports and exports of Britain and Ireland <i>vis-á-vis</i> one and the other was £15 million last year and £31 million this year.  I would suggest after sober reflection that this is not the end statistic and that, in fact, the truth is that our exports increased spectacularly.  That is something we must face.  I have my criticisms of the Government, of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make later but we may as well face the fact that our exports did increase spectacularly.</P>
    <P>We may as well face the other fact, too, that the action taken unilaterally by Britain concerning exports was to try to stop the demand for goods which was putting wrong their balance of payments. Perhaps we could look at our own position in that regard.  When we look at a statistic that was in one of the papers last week&mdash;that the gap had widened by £31 million&mdash;we might take into account the fact that our own imports here of consumer goods may have something to do with it.  There are two sides to this coin&mdash;the imports here from Britain and the exports from here to Britain&mdash;so that if we have consumer goods coming in here in greater quantities this could be something we must look at.  Let us face it: the Government&mdash;wrongly, in my view&mdash;introduced the mini-maxi Budget to try to <Col N="2710" /> stop consumption of these goods here. The real truth is that when one rules out politics or the desire to criticise the other side and comes down to the hard economic facts of industry, one finds that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement is to some extent working. One must admit that, and while it has its very bad aspects it has its very good aspects, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching this matter honestly.  I have my criticisms to make later but I am approaching this, as I have done over the last few days when preparing my speech, as seriously and as responsibly as I can.  I must draw attention to the facts and that does not mean I am not going to criticise the Minister and the Government.  I am, but among other things one must point to the 25,000 tons of beef which is now included in the British subsidy.  We must point also to the fact that in our man-made fibres, which have got free access, there has been a spectacular increase in exports.  However, that does not mean that everything is right.  That does not mean that the first cause of the Agreement, namely movement towards Europe, still exists.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out we have gone further away from Europe.  Britain is hoping perhaps in seven, eight, nine or ten years to become a member of the EEC.  At the same time, we have in this Agreement a chapter which I read last night which indicates that, where the policies of either country are going to affect the situation in the other country, that country will have regard to that.  Mark you, the British had not great regard for this when they announced they were going to increase their agricultural production by £160 million.  In fact you could read into that the prospect that they might not need 638,000 store cattle or the amount of beef they are importing from us at present.  In fact, they have acted in many ways&mdash;there are two instances in the last month&mdash;quite against the spirit of the Agreement.  If they are going to increase their agricultural production for home consumption by £160,000,000 <Col N="2711" /> worth, surely that is against the spirit of the Agreement, apart from anything else?</P>
      <P>One examines the Agreement in detail and comes to the conclusion that the British when they took action to stop imports, in their desire to keep themselves within the framework of the GATT took it unilaterally, against everybody.  This was quite improper and was against the spirit and word of the Agreement.  They should have acted unilaterally and then come to us.  Let us face it, GATT allows a free trade area to operate.  The EEC is a customs union where you must have a common external tariff.  Within the terms of the GATT, as I see it, if they desired, they could have excluded us from the unilateral provision of 50 per cent of all imports and so informed their customs officials and they could have talked to us about what the problem was or could have excluded us completely and allowed us to carry on in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Let us now come to the question of whether or not the British did impose a fiscal charge in asking for this deposit. I hold that they did impose a fiscal charge, as mentioned on page 67 of the Free Trade Area Agreement published by our own Stationery Office and that, in doing so they acted absolutely contrary to the spirit and word of the Agreement.  My reason for saying that is that, if we are going to lodge £25 million the interest on that £25 million, as has been said, would mean, if this went on long enough&mdash;if we did it by taking it from the taxpayers or providing for it in the Capital Budget and refunding it in the usual way&mdash;spending some £5 million of our people's money.  That seems to me to be a fiscal charge.  Article IV of the Agreement says:</P>
      <P>Neither party shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  apply directly or indirectly to imported goods any fiscal charges in excess of those applied directly or indirectly to like domestic goods, or otherwise apply such charges so as to afford effective protection to like domestic goods;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House. Deputies can read it for themselves. <Col N="2712" /> When they have read it they will find that there was a direct breach of the spirit and word of the Agreement.  That is the statement that I want to emphasise here today and to get across absolutely and completely.  I know the Minister may argue back that it was not a fiscal charge, that the fact of having to deposit money does not mean that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Then we come to the Government gaffe.  This was, in my view, a breach of the Agreement. If you study this Agreement, as I have done in detail in the last couple of days, you could probably produce arguments for two or three other breaches of the Agreement in the action taken by the British; but I am pinning my colours to the mast in respect of page 67 of our publication and am saying unequivocally that they broke the Agreement.  The British having broken the Agreement, what should have been the action of our Government here?</P>
      <P>I would have thought that what should have happened was that our Ambassador in London should immediately have delivered a note to Downing Street on behalf of the Irish Government indicating that the British had broken the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and, at that stage, such a note would have been of such a serious nature that I would have expected that Mr. Wilson would immediately have made himself available to see the Taoiseach and that the strongest team, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce and many others, that could have been provided from here, would have been in Downing Street with no action taken by the Irish Government but an absolute determination on their part to impress upon the British that the Agreement was broken and that we were not having it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would have placed Mr. Wilson and the British Government in a very different situation from the position in which the Taoiseach placed them. The Taoiseach went into conclave with the bankers&mdash;there is nothing <Col N="2713" /> wrong with that&mdash;and produced his own scheme, that he would pay the deposit and, if there was interest thereon, he would pay the interest.  Nobody has been informed, and the city is rife with rumours, as to the method by which this shall be done within the banking structure of the city.  If it is done by the repatriation of £25 million of Government securities lying in Britain&mdash;and a lot of them are getting bad interest in any case&mdash;that is one way of doing it.  The expenditure of £25 million would appear to be a very improper method.  If this is done, the interest factor may be delayed.  If our banking institutions are going to say however, that the amount of extra credit this year will be so much&mdash;so much of which will be available for the private sector and so much for the public sector&mdash;and that, of course, they are allowing this amount of extra credit and are not reducing the amount of credit available by £25 million because of this lodgment we have to make&mdash;that would be another way of doing it.</P>
    <P>We are not being told but signs are on the wall.  If one reads the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of yesterday one sees an undefined credit squeeze because the Central Bank has indicated to the banks of this country that they should see to it that their advances are for productive purposes and that there should be no advances for non-productive purposes.  That is a bit of a change from the announcements that have been coming for the last two or three years.  The people of this country, the Opposition and Parliament have not been told what is the manner in which this £25 million is being produced. So that we will not know until we see the figures, maybe a year and a half later, whether it is being produced by giving out less credit here&mdash;which will result in less employment and certainly a slowing-down of the industrial pace&mdash;or whether it is being done by the repatriation of certain Government securities in Britain, or how it will be produced.</P>
    <P>The most important thing of all is that, instead of delivering a note to the British Premier, instead of notifying him that he had broken three or four <Col N="2714" /> sections of this agreement in the spirit and the word&mdash;but I am pinning my flag on one, that in relation to the fiscal provisions&mdash;the Taoiseach, without going near Downing Street, without protesting, without stating that the Agreement was broken, produced £25 million and nobody knows from whence it will come.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach committed the greatest gaffe of his career&mdash;and mark you he has committed a few and he has allowed Ministers to commit a good many more.  I do not want to go into details but we know all about the activities of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and of the Minister for Local Government, and the gaffes in regard to the referendum and of the Minister sitting opposite because he was so slow in allowing the prices of raw materials to adjust themselves.  On two occasions he reduced the profits of a certain public company by £½ million and on one occasion had to come in here seeking £½ million for another industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister came in here with a supplementary estimate.  I want to suggest that the Taoiseach made a complete mess of the job.  He did not protest and he produced £25 million as if it were 25 million pence.  He has now created a precedent whereby the British can again, if they want to, try to break this agreement. We on this side of the House wish to support the Government in this particularly serious matter to let the British know, if they read the Irish papers, or if anybody reads them, that the Opposition here is saying to the <Col N="2715" /> Government, as Deputy O'Higgins said: &ldquo;Spur on and make every effort to see that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement is adhered to.&rdquo;  What my colleagues said is obviously true.  The question of looking at this agreement after five years is not sufficient now. We have got to look at it on the basis of the changed situation in Europe.  We are much further away from Europe now than we were when we made the agreement.  Therefore, the agreement with its advantages and disadvantages must be looked at again.</P>
      <P>The sort of silence we have had when civil servants, or the Taoiseach, or various Ministers returned from talks in London, will just not do.  A militant attitude should have been followed when we saw what was being done by what some people call &ldquo;perfidious Albion&rdquo;.  It should not have been allowed to pass without a spirited protest.  As the Taoiseach had not got the guts to do it the Opposition, by the artifice of putting down this amendment, have ensured that the discussion which had been refused, did take place.  I am proud that my Party were capable of producing the artifice that has allowed the Government to be spurred on and to be whipped&mdash;like the donkey that is reluctant to move&mdash; to do their job.  The gaffe of the Taoiseach, the greatest in his career, has meant that we have to lodge this £25 million when we could have protested and fought the case with all the vigour that was demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Labour Party asked for a debate on the Free Trade Area issue and the Taoiseach refused it on the grounds that time was not available. Subsequently we asked him, in view of the fact that the business would be finished today, to sit tomorrow and then we found that it was not time that prevented this; it was because he did not desire to have the debate.  He did not want these matters discussed.  Even though, as Deputy Donegan said, the artifice of the Fine Gael Party did have the matter opened up here, I am afraid it does not give us the scope we would have liked to have to discuss all the matters that should have been discussed <Col N="2716" /> before we make any more mistakes with Britain.</P>
      <P>Hindsight is a wonderful thing.  I am glad that the Fine Gael Party can now see this agreement as it is.  Although they did not vote for it they did not vote against it in 1966 and I believe they decided that while it was not as good as the 1948 agreement we were still going to get something from it. What has been the result?  We have not got anything out of it and, as a matter of fact, we find ourselves in a much worse position as a result of the agreement. What is the use of making an agreement when the other party make up their minds that it does not suit them and if they want to they can back down?  What is the use of making an agreement which one party considers to be one thing and the other party another?</P>
      <P>Is it not true that after 1966 the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries repeated again and again the wonderful victory they had won over British negotiators?  Right down through the ages, if one reads history, one sees scattered around the scrapheaps of the world the people who felt that they had beaten the British negotiators but who later found that they had been codded, just as our negotiators have been codded.  Indeed, I am not clear that the agreement has been broken except in one respect, in regard to the giving of notice, where I think they did break it, but you will probably find that Britain will claim that they did not break the agreement, that the loopholes were there in the small print and they found them while our people apparently did not see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sending a large number of civil servants over to Britain to negotiate with their opposite numbers in Britain after the Taoiseach met the Leader of the British nation and found that he could not move him an inch, seems to be a futile exercise.  I do not know what the Taoiseach hoped to gain by going over there, going over in secret, sneaking off without anybody being aware that he was going.  Even members of his own Party here were unaware that he had left.  The agreement is being held out to the country as a way in which <Col N="2717" /> the industries of this nation will be saved as far as exports are concerned but it appears to me to be a rather shabby trick by the British Government because surely the whole object of the arrangements they are now making was to reduce their imports by £400 million? If they are going to allow this and other nations to subsidise imports into Britain, is it not true that they are getting a loan of cheap money for which they will have to pay no interest and that they are not interested at all in stopping imports into Britain?  Is that not what they are doing?  This is just another trick.</P>
    <P>The other point about it is the effect of the 10 per cent reduction.  Again and again in this House I have heard various Ministers of Industry and Commerce, including the present occupant of that office, saying that Irish industrialists were becoming prepared or were on their way to being prepared for the Common Market and that they were gearing themselves to such an extent that they would be able to compete with Britain.  It was almost suggested that they could drown the British with their industrial goods because they would be able to gear themselves so well.  What has happened?  Although only a few weeks old, this idea is already having its effect on closing factories.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last week they laid off 30 men.  The Minister very nearly made a good job of closing it last year and except for the pressure brought by the boot and shoe operatives it would have been closed down. This sort of thing is just not good enough.  It was agreed that the speeches would not be long.  I do not want to go into a lot of detail, but I am sure the Minister is aware, and, if not, his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, must be aware, that because of a little tricking which was done on <Col N="2718" /> the fuel supply front, the generating stations for the production of electricity that were to be in operation in 1972 have not been built.  Nobody heard about it until now, until hundreds of men are being laid off from work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that until the Minister and the Government reach a position where they can agree to have a continuation of the existing arrangements, people who are running factories on a shoestring are unable to go along on promises.  The Minister must be aware of this just as well as I am, and if not, he will be hearing a lot more about it within the next few weeks from people who are badly affected by it.</P>
      <P>As I was saying when the Minister intervened, literally hundreds of people on the bogs are being laid off because of a trick worked behind backs by the Department of Transport and Power with the co-operation of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Surely we should not have a situation such as we have had in this House where, on the one hand, a Minister kicks up a row because he is allowed only an hour and a quarter to reply to a debate which took only about seven hours, and, on the other hand, the Taoiseach says the House has not time to debate such an important item as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement?</P>
      <P>I do not propose to take any more of the time of the House, but I want to state here very emphatically that when the debate was held here in 1966 the Labour Party opposed the agreement tooth and nail, and if one gets the Official Report of the debate one will see what was said from the Labour benches and, to a certain extent, from the Fine Gael benches, and one wonders why the wonderful agreement we were supposed to be getting, which was so full of milk and honey, now can produce nothing but ashes in the mouth of those who negotiated it.</P>

That being so, while there are a number of things which I would normally like to say, I feel myself precluded from saying them in order not to make the task of our negotiators more difficult.</P>

    <P>Since some doubts seem to have been expressed here in the course of the debate, I should, perhaps, say that the consultations which have been taking place at official level were, in the first instance, the normal consultations provided for under the agreement to take place at regular intervals, but on this occasion they were extended in order not only to deal with the normal review of points of difficulty which might have arisen since the previous meeting on the operation of the agreement but also to cover, in effect, <Col N="2720" /> a full-scale review of the operation of the whole agreement.  The further negotiations which may take place following on that meeting will be on that basis.</P>
    <P>I said in reply to something Deputy Donegan said that I have no intention of arguing the British case in relation to any aspect of this agreement.  I do say, however, that the action which was taken by the British was clearly and without any doubt a breach of the spirit of the agreement.  As to whether it was a breach of the letter of the Agreement, this is not something on which I propose to expound my views in public at this stage.  The arguments which may be advanced in negotiations between ourselves and the British would not be enhanced, in my view, by being advanced here in public.  I do, however, want to make clear a few points that were raised in the debate.  We are not being spurred on by the Fine Gael Party, as suggested by Deputy T. O'Higgins, followed on by Deputy Donegan, to negotiate with the British on a full scale review of the operation of the Agreement.  We had arranged and announced this before Deputy Donegan put down his amendment.  Let us be quite clear about that.  I mention it only for the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point. Furthermore, I want to say that the action which was taken by the Government in conjunction with the banks to counteract the effect of the British deposit scheme was prompt and effective. This is very much appreciated not only by managements but also by all the workers concerned in the industries affected.  Any suggestion that we should not have taken that action will not be welcomed, particularly in Deputy Donegan's constituency, by the workers concerned in the industries so much dependent on exports to Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Deputy Donegan's suggestion is that <Col N="2721" /> we should have protested and argued with the British before we took this action.  I may say we considered that possibility, but rejected it because we were convinced that the effect would have been that we would be arguing for days&mdash;we might still have been arguing&mdash;with the British, and yet their scheme was coming into operation within a few days.  Our overall approach was that we were not going to allow our industrial exports to be interfered with in any way because they are too important to this country, and to employment in this country and to the prospects of increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make quite clear to this House and to anybody outside who is in any way interested in this debate that the difference in the situation in having Fianna Fáil in power and in having a Fine Gael Government or a Coalition Government in in power with the Fine Gael Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;and perhaps Taoiseach&mdash; is that, with a Fianna Fáil Government in power, action is taken to ensure that our exporters and all their employees do not suffer.  With a Fine Gael Government, we would still be arguing and, in the meantime, our whole exporting situation would be in jeopardy and the employment of thousands of people would either be gone or about to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest at this. May I ask the Minister a question?  The Minister is implying about my Party and myself that if there were a Fine Gael Government and a Fine Gael Minister for Industry and Commerce we should go on arguing and do nothing.  Why not make your deposits as the days go on and argue and then nothing would adversely be affected?  It is quite improper and dishonest of the Minister to suggest that the workers and management would find themselves in a quandary if there was a Fine Gael <Col N="2722" /> Government.  We could make the deposits as the days went on, and argue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not deal with that suggestion, which Deputy Donegan made in the course of an interruption, because I did not think it was necessary. However, since he wants me to do so, let me point out, in the first place, that if he suggests that the deposit could be made day by day he should talk to the people concerned in exporting and hear their views as to whether they think it would work. Administratively, what kind of a mess would they be in?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy insists on demanding replies to such suggestions, he must accept the consequences.  A question was asked as to the payment of interest on these deposits.  As has already been said in this House by the Taoiseach&mdash;but I shall repeat it&mdash;it will be paid out of taxation unless other methods of paying it may be found, arising out of our negotiations with the British.  The question also was raised as to whether or not we shall continue with the tariff reductions next July.  The possibility of not making these reductions or of having reductions of less than ten per cent is something we certainly would contemplate depending, again, on the situation and the overall situation for us is the effect of such steps on our economy, not on the British or any other economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As most Deputies will, I think, appreciate, it is not necessarily the position that if we postpone the reductions we do a good turn for Irish industry: we may not do that at all. But whether or not we take such steps will depend on our assessment of its effects on the economy and also the consequences of our negotiations with the <Col N="2724" /> British.  This is a possibility: I am not saying it is a probability.  It is an option which we have and I want to keep that option open.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to be making the point that he and his Party believed, when the agreement came before them, that the effect of it was that if the British&mdash;only in the circumstances which have recently arisen of a balance of payments difficulty&mdash;wished to impose quantitative restrictions by way of quota they would not, in practice, be able to do this because, under GATT, they would have to apply it to every country Am I interpreting the Deputy correctly?

      <P>I shall not dispute that. On the other hand, I do not propose to allow some of what I regard as misrepresentations of the position to go unrefuted.</P>
      <P>A point was made in relation to what I might call the statement of intent by the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the effect it may have on the benefits accruing to us under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  I think it was suggested that the Government here said nothing about that.  I want to say again something that was said about that by the Taoiseach to the effect that he had received a clear assurance from the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that the implementation of what I would call the statement of intent will not frustrate the agricultural objectives of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. Subsequently, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, not only endorsed this assurance but agreed that our respective Ministers for Agriculture should maintain close contact in order to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
      <P>There has been some suggestion made&mdash;not, I think, in this debate, but in previous reference to this whole matter both here and in the press&mdash; or some impression created that this is what might be termed the second occasion on which the British have committed a breach of the Free Trade Area Agreement in regard to our exports to them.  Just to keep the matter in perspective, I want to say that the British imposition of imports levies occurred in October, 1964, while the Free Trade Area Agreement did not begin to operate until July, 1966, so that whatever one may say about the imposition of the levies by the British in the past, it was not in breach of the Free Trade Area Agreement because that agreement was not then in existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the fact that, in regard to whatever agreements we enter into, when it comes to special difficulties arising for a country governments take action and &ldquo;to hell with the agreement&rdquo;. That is true to some extent, but agreements such as our Free Trade Area Agreement recognise this fact and endeavour to control the kind of action taken to deal with difficult situations like balance of payments problems.  They also recognise other kinds of difficulties that can arise and we have already availed of some of the provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement to deal with the problem that arose, for instance, in Dunlops.  I should point out, too that any action which may be taken by the British Government and whatever may result from the negotiations between our Government and the British Government will be a two-edged weapon.  What the British are entitled to do we may be entitled to do but any steps we take must naturally have regard to our circumstances and to the fact as to whether or not they would be to our advantage.</P>
      <P>There have been some suggestions that we ought to apply restrictions on imports from Britain.  I do not think it has been suggested that that should be done in a spirit of retribution but rather because we have had difficulties with our balance of payments and we are, therefore, entitled to take action. We are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, with a suggestion that came in the course of the debate. What I want to make clear is the fact that in the application of any such restrictions we might impose we must have regard to the effect of those restrictions on our employment position. We are much more vulnerable in that respect than most other countries are, particularly having regard to the fact that the raw materials for many of our industries are imported, sometimes in a completely unmanufactured state and sometimes partly manufactured, and any such restrictions, therefore, would have to be very delicately imposed and applied in order to ensure that we do not do more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To listen to the speakers in this debate, apart from Deputy Donegan, one could reasonably be forgiven for concluding that this Free Trade Area Agreement has operated disastrously for us and that the Government were crazy to have entered into it and are even crazier not to see that now and do something about it.  I do not think that is an unfair paraphrase of the speeches made, with the exception of the speech made by Deputy Donegan; he was the only one, as I commented at the time, who said that there was evidence we had benefited under this agreement.  It really is not good enough for Deputies to come in here and make speeches, full of innuendo, about the disasters which have befallen and will befall us under this agreement, without being specific.  I do not recall, apart from the points made just towards the end by Deputy James Tully, which, as far as I can gauge, had nothing whatever to do with the action of the British Government, as he alleged they had, any evidence being produced to substantiate the general theme.  Now I want to remind the House of some facts, which will show, I hope, that we have benefited, and benefited considerably, from the operation of the Free Trade Area Agreement to date.  Deputy <Col N="2728" /> Corish said that we had got the worst of this bargain; he was talking about what had happened up to now.  I want to point out that in the two years since the agreement began to operate our imports from the United Kingdom increased by 17 per cent over the level of the 12 months preceding the operation of the agreement.  In the same two years our exports to the United Kingdom increased by 32 per cent and, in the case of exports of manufactured goods, other than food, drink and tobacco, the increase was over 50 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>And, despite all that, we have a balance of payments problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we have because we trade with countries other than Britain.  An aspect of this agreement which is not always obvious but which is of great importance is the setting up of new industries here.  It is not merely a question of trade between the two countries.  There is also the fact that the agreement opened free access to the British market for all our manufactured goods.  This has had an important effect as far as the attraction of industry is concerned.  Although there have been restrictions on capital exports from Britain for this kind of purpose and, indeed, from the United States of America and, although these have operated to our detriment, the number of new industries set up and the amount of employment created have steadily increased since the operation of the agreement.  I do not say this satisfactory position is due entirely to the agreement but it has undoubtedly been a contributory factor, a contributory factor to the extent that, in the present year, we will be away ahead of anything we have ever had before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that restrictions on investment abroad by both Britain and the United States have operated to our detriment.  Had these restrictions not been in operation our position would be considerably better but, even despite that, the facts show that there has been a very considerable improvement in the number and size of new industries, in the capital investment involved and, of course, <Col N="2729" /> in the employment involved since the coming into operation of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  The Labour Party, as I understand Deputy Corish, say that this agreement should be scrapped.  I do not know what alternative the Labour Party have in mind.  I do not know how they propose to provide the considerably increased employment we need.  They have never told us that.</P>
    <P>They keep on telling us what is wrong with the agreement, but they have never told us what the alternative would be, especially in the light of the movement of world trade at the moment, in the light of the impending Kennedy round tariff cuts, and in the light of our enormous dependence on foreign trade.  It is no use telling us that the Free Trade Area Agreement is bad, that it is to our detriment, without producing evidence to support that contention, and if they do not offer a reasonable alternative which will take account of current trends in the world, of our dependence on foreign trade, and the enormous job that has to be done in providing more employment for our people.</P>
    <P>We have yet to hear of any alternative to the existing Free Trade Area Agreement which would have regard to the factors I have mentioned and be to the advantage of this country, and give us an opportunity not only to expand our trade but consequently to expand our employment.  The industrial growth, particularly in the export oriented industries, has been spectacular in the past few years.  The employment involved has been very important.  It has been growing at a considerable rate and that is where the only hope for the future lies so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

Now we think we are against it but we are not sure.&rdquo; This type of thing which Deputy O'Higgins made a valiant attempt to describe as being responsible is simply indecision.  The country could not simply afford this kind of thing if it were to be unfortunately afflicted with members of the Fine Gael Party in Government.  We cannot afford this kind of shilly-shallying. This is the kind of thinking that was behind Deputy Donegan's suggestion to which I referred earlier.  You go on arguing about your rights and you forget all about the realities of trade in this country and people's jobs.  The main thing we have got to do is to keep the existing pattern of trade on an even keel and as far as possible to expand it and go to almost any lengths to prevent interference with that.</P>

    <P>I talked about the innuendo situation being created by almost all of the <Col N="2736" /> speakers except Deputy Donegan.  Deputy O'Higgins talked about bromides, clichés and such things delivered by the Taoiseach and myself.  He then proceeded to give us the greatest list of bromides and clichés that I have heard in a long time.  Then he made the, in my view, very naïve suggestion that I ought, when replying, be able to say to the House exactly what was being discussed in the negotiations with the British.  I do not think that even the Fine Gael Party is that naïve.  I do not think Deputy O'Higgins is that naïve.  I think he just got carried away by his own eloquence but do not talk to us about bromides in a speech in which that kind of suggestion is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of this case but I suspect that Deputy Tully's version of the trouble is not correct, because the scheme is so designed that if a firm has export orders it can get the deposit.  If this firm cannot do this, there is some snag, that it has not got the export order or is not going about the scheme in the right way.  I have urged the representatives of industry whom I met, various groups, the Federation of Irish Industries, the Irish Exporters' Association, the Congress of Trade Unions, and so on, and I now want to urge again, that any difficulties found in the operation of the scheme should be brought to the attention of my Department immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity of saying that if any difficulties are experienced in the scheme we want to know about them immediately because the overall approach all along on this and the approach we still have is that we want to ensure as far as it is humanly possible that the growth of our exports, industrial exports particularly, to Britain will not be interfered with in any way and that we will ensure that we maintain the potential for growth which is so important and which has been demonstrated in the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, in that last two years, our <Col N="2739" /> industrial manufactured goods exported to Britain increased by 50 per cent.  The importance of this, not only to our balance of payments but to the workers involved in the industries, is enormous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>How enormous?  How many new jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not prepared to jeopardise these jobs and the potential for new jobs involved in this in any way and this is why we are not prepared to have time spent arguing instead of making sure that our exports went on and that our jobs were maintained and that new jobs could be created.  This is the approach of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It does not appear to be the approach of the Fine Gael Party and, as far as the Labour Party is concerned, I think it would claim that it was its approach but its only way of demonstrating that that is the approach the Labour Party has is simply to say that the Agreement does not work, ignore the fact that is has worked well and offer no alternative.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by saying this much: I have tried to demonstrate that this Agreement has so far worked satisfactorily as far as this country is concerned.  The things which have occurred recently are matters which, in my view, do not help the operation of the Agreement and, clearly, are not to the advantage of our economy, although it may be that the action we have taken to counter them may put our exporters in a better position in the British market than they were in before they took place; but I do want to make clear that as far as we are concerned, if there are possibilities of detrimental effects coming from the operation of this Agreement, then we want to take steps to deal with those detrimental effects and this will be very much in the minds of our negotiators in the negotiations with the British.  As I said at the beginning, I am somewhat handicapped in this debate because of that situation of negotiations taking place but, within these limits, I have endeavoured to answer the points raised in the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he or Taiscí Stáit Teoranta were consulted about the change in the Board of Verolme Dockyard; if so, when; and if he will state the amount of any grant, loan or other financial investment or assistance made available by the State to that company or to any associate thereof.</P>

      <P>On 25th June, 1968, when introducing the Estimate for his Department in this House the Minister for Industry and Commerce told the House that the Government had approved certain proposals for the reorganisation of the Cork Dockyard and that the new scheme would involve the provision of £1,390,000 from State funds, partly by subscription for ordinary shares, partly by loans and partly by grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a condition of the provision of this finance that the Board of Directors of Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd. should be reconstituted so as to provide for representation by the State. The necessary amendment of the Company's Articles of Association has now been made, and Taiscí Stáit Teoranta which is providing the loan and share capital have recently appointed two directors to the Board, one of them as <Col N="2742" /> chairman.  There is provision in the revised Articles for the appointment of three directors by the Dutch interests and these appointments have also, I understand, been made.  Under the new arrangements Mr. Cornelis Verolme who was previously governing director of the company has the office of president.  He will not be a director but may act in an advisory capacity for the company.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sum of £1,390,000 mentioned above, of which very little has yet been paid, the following financial assistance has been given by the State to Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd.&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many of the staff of the First and Second Dáil are still serving in the Civil Service, (b) their present grades, (c) the number of former staff of the First and Second Dáil who are now on pension and (d) if, in view of the forthcoming anniversary ceremony of the meeting of the First Dáil, he will recognise the distinguished service of these men and women by promoting serving officers by one grade and increasing the pensions of retired staff on the same basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, within the time available, it is not possible to supply the details requested at (a), (b) and (c) of the question.</P>
      <P>As regards (d), the superannuation position of persons who were appointed to the Civil Service of Dáil Éireann has already been dealt with under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, the Superannuation Act, 1936 and the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963.  I regret that it would not be possible to adopt the Deputy's suggestions as it would be difficult to deal with this group in isolation.</P>
      <P>I should add that the vast majority of former Dáil civil servants are exceptionally retained in the Civil Service until they reach the age of 75, instead of the normal retiring age; this, in my view, is the most practical method of recognising their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that obviously so few can be affected by my suggestion and in view of the fact that the matter of their promotion is not one which should cause any great difficulty so far as superannuation and so on is concerned, would the Taoiseach not consider that the gesture of permitting them to work until they reach the age of 75 is really not a very beneficial one?  Would he not reconsider the whole matter in view of the fact that we are about to commemorate <Col N="2744" /> the 50th Anniversary of the foundation of Dáil Éireann?  Would he not endeavour to make things somewhat easier for such of these men as are now on pension or still in the Service?  Would he not agree that we owe these people a rather special debt over and above that due to other sections of the Service?  I would ask him, and I feel I am expressing the view of all Members of the House and of the people, to reconsider this question of the promotion by one grade of these servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of questions there.  The first one the Deputy raised and with which he also finished, was the question of the promotion to a higher grade.  The first problem is that promotional outlets may not be available within the rank or grade of the person involved and, if there is, that person may not be the person considered most suited for the position.  If he were to be promoted in these circumstances obviously there would be a grievance on the part of somebody else.  So far as the right to exceptional treatment beyond that extended to others is concerned, there are other classes who could claim, possibly with more force, exceptional treatment as well and it would not be fair to these people to single out the others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's comment about the availability of promotional outlets, would he not agree that it has been known in the history of the Civil Service that people have been given promotion where there were not immediate vacancies? Is it not also true that vacancies have been created for some of the favoured in the past and special jobs created for men who were said to have given services of a special nature, and in the light of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Furthermore, the police powers in these Acts of the Oireachtas are not nearly as wide in scope as the powers in the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, 1922, which operates in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that about 10 Dutch trawlers were fishing about half a mile from the foreshore of Crosshaven on Saturday, 30th November; and that these trawlers were back again on Monday, 2nd December, Tuesday, 3rd December and Wednesday 4th December; that although the corvette was summoned at 12 noon on Saturday it did not arrive until 4.30 p.m.; and that when it was called on Wednesday it could not arrive until the following day; and what measures he proposes to take to improve the fishery protection services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>No report was received about any foreign trawlers fishing off the coast near Crosshaven during the periods mentioned in the questions.  Reports that vessels were fishing off Ballycotton were received at 12.50 p.m. on Saturday the 30th November and at 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday the 4th December.  The corvette <i>LE Cliona</i> proceeded to the area as quickly as possible in each instance and also passed through the area on Monday 2nd December but no illegal fishing was observed on any of these occasions. A corvette has been patrolling the coast between Cork Harbour and Wexford regularly since the start of the current herring fishing season and at present there are two corvettes patrolling that general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my reply to a previous question on this subject on the 21st November last consideration is being given to the question of replacement of the corvettes and the suitability of different types of vessels for fishery patrol duties and also for naval purposes is being examined.  Pending the solution of this problem the aim is <Col N="2758" /> to maintain the existing corvettes in service so that the Naval Service may be in a position to provide the best possible fishery protection with existing resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister understand, in relation to the meeting between the parties tomorrow, to which he refers, that there is a very serious position here?  The Board for the Employment of the Blind is completely unrepresentative and is in the hands of one or two people.  There is to be a march through the city this evening by blind workers in the employment of the Board.  What is called for is an immediate meeting to reconstitute the Board.  Would the Minister for Labour immediately consult with the Minister for Social Welfare on the matter so that such a necessary meeting will no longer be delayed?  It will require more than tomorrow's meeting to solve the issues in dispute.</P>

      <P>The Board is completely unrepresentative at the moment.  The problem is now so grave that it would need the reconstitution of the Board to solve the situation.  A meeting has been requested between the union representing the workers and the responsible Minister.  The most essential thing at the moment is a meeting between the Minister and the League of the Blind with a view to doing something about reconstituting the Board.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Board for the Employment of the Blind have, in fact, threatened the Labour Court?  They threatened to go to a higher court of law.

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is not at all sympathetic to the idea of questioning the authority of the Labour Court or of not supporting an award made by the Labour Court.

The <Col N="2760" /> Labour Court itself did, in an earlier situation, say that it was not entitled to examine but when it did decide to examine the dispute and make an award, as I have often told the people on the Labour Benches before, we would naturally like the Labour Court award to be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if redundancy payments will be made to those dismissed on the Lisadell estate, County Sligo, after it was intimated that a Redundancy Bill was being introduced, as those people owing to their age and the nature of their employment are unable to get suitable employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Qualified workers who lost their employment on the Lisadell estate since 1st January, 1968, have received redundancy payments.  There is no provision in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, which would allow its application to redundancies which occurred before 1st January, 1968, when the Act came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, however, that the workers concerned are at liberty to make application to the President of the High Court for the payment of gratuitous redundancy compensation <Col N="2762" /> from the estate of the owner.  I also understand that there is a possibility that the Land Commission, which has acquired most of the land, can consider the question of paying cash gratuities to the workers who have lost their employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Redundancy Bill was introduced on 17th May, 1967, and, on 19th May, two days later, six people, five of them qualified, were dismissed on the Lisadell Estate?  Is he further aware that there was no reason for the dismissal except to escape redundancy payments to these men because, the following autumn, hay and oats were left uncut on the Lisadell Estate due to lack of labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that. The person who made the decision is now deceased but, if he were to avoid responsibility under the Redundancy Payments Act, he could have done this to a number of people, people who lost their employment on 5th January, five days after the commencement date.  He also allowed people to remain on the estate in rent free houses after they had lost their employment.  I would not, therefore, accept that he was attempting in any way to avoid his responsibilities.  He was instructed by the President of the High Court to reduce expenses in the running of the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister did, on 1st June, 1967, indicate to the House that, if he got evidence of employers putting people out of employment because this Bill was in the offing, he would consider inserting a section in the Bill to cover such people, will he now amend the legislation because these people regard themselves as having had an injustice done to them?  I would ask the Minister to investigate this matter.  I believe an injustice has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the comment he made about the Land Commission being entitled to give gratuities to people in this category is not correct because they would not be in the employment <Col N="2763" /> of the owner and they would have to be before they will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to certified industrial schools.</P>
      <P>It is the normal practice in industrial schools to provide the children in care with such education, including post-primary education, as is suitable to their aptitudes and from which they are capable of benefiting.  Many are sent to local secondary or technical schools or provided with instruction in commercial or manual subjects.  Extension of a further year in the term of detention of children in care for the purpose of further training is readily granted to the school managers on request.</P>
      <P>In the case of orphans whose term of detention expires at the age of 16 or 17, the conductors of the industrial schools arrange either to place them in occupations suited to their abilities or to retain them for further training or education, in some cases extending as far as university courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that, by and large, the managers of industrial schools discharge faithfully and conscientiously their responsibility of providing education, <Col N="2764" /> training and supervision for those children committed to their care and in this respect go far beyond what is required of them by law.</P>

The mood of the House during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Education, and my view too, was that children should not be going to school in the early hours of the morning.  I issued a circular to the effect that the managers were free to allow schools to be opened at a later hour.  The extraordinary thing is that by and large&mdash;and this is the reaction that came back to the Department&mdash;the parents objected to this because it interfered with the home routine and with people going to work at a certain time.  In fact, they were in favour of the early hour to enable the children's meals to fit in with their meals.  My view and the view of the House was that we could have later opening of the schools.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my replies to questions on 13th December, 1967, and 18th June, 1968, about this school.</P>
      <P>The investigations in this case have been completed and a final decision has been taken in my Department, to provide a new two-roomed school at Glen in replacement of the existing school. The reverend manager has offered a site and the Commissioners of Public Works have been requested to report as to its suitability.  They hope to do so early in the new year.</P>
      <P>In view of the urgency of the case my Department has asked the Commissioners to consider the question of having the school built by industrialised building methods, so as to eliminate delay in erection.</P>

      <P>The cost, based on the recommendations of the Steering Committee on Technical Education, of providing the nine Regional Technical Colleges was estimated at £8,531,000.</P>
      <P>The detailed design and cost studies carried out by Building Design Associates in association with officers of my Department enabled this figure to be revised to £7,129,000.  Furthermore, as a result of bulk sub-contracting and supply procedures evolved by Building Design Associates, this overall cost figure is being maintained despite considerably increased building costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving is in regard to the preliminary planning and design work.  In regard to the actual <Col N="2783" /> construction work, the lowest tender obtains; but the planning is being done on a uniform, national basis, so that there has been a considerable saving there.  Rather than dealing with each building project on its own, in isolation, the whole project has been regarded as one and a similar type of design plan and approach has been adopted towards the nine.  This has resulted in a saving of £1½ million to the State.  These are the facts of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This cannot be because if the usual system operates of the lowest tender, if these Building Design Associates, or whatever these people call themselves, were not there at all, the ordinary quantity surveyor's and architect's work would be done by other firms and they would get their normal fee of five per cent and outlay, which these gentlemen are getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is used to dealing with percentages.  I am concerned about getting work done.  Of the nine colleges proposed, five are already under construction, the actual bricks and mortar work is going on.  It is being done in a remarkably speedy time on a uniform system of planning design which saved the State £1½ million and, as far as the contractors are concerned, this has been a matter completely open and above-board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the £1½ million saved if it is only a question of saying, &ldquo;This will cost £9 million&rdquo; and it is revised to £7½ million? Surely the first £9 million is a speculative figure which has no basis in fact? This is all codology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Building costs have appreciated in the past two years since the figure of £8½ million was set and, despite the appreciation in building costs in that period of over two years, the reduction from £8½ million to £7 million for the nine regional colleges is, to put it mildly, very spectacular.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme is intended to enable deserving students to proceed <Col N="2794" /> to third-level courses leading to a university degree or its equivalent.  As the course of training for national teachers is at present not accepted as the equivalent of a course leading to a degree, trainee national teachers are automatically excluded from participation in the grants scheme.  A loans scheme on the same means basis as the higher education grants scheme is, however, available to trainee teachers so that no candidate is excluded from training by reason of his parents' inability to pay the fee.</P>

      <P>The scheme of free electricity administered by my Department was devised primarily to meet the needs of the necessitous aged who are living alone.  The definition of living alone was extended in the case of an eligible pensioner who is an invalid to include one other adult whose presence is necessary for the purpose of looking after the invalid.

Last February, a toy and card fair was held to encourage the purchase by the trade of Irish-made toys and cards for Christmas.  A special exhibition of Irish-made Christmas goods is being held from now until the 21st December at the Association's display centre at 3 St. Stephen's Green. Retailers throughout the country, business, trade and voluntary organisations, professional associations and school principals have been contacted and urged to promote the sale of Irish-made goods during the Christmas season.

It is not correct, however, to say that this number of jobs has been lost as a result of these closures since many of the workers were re-employed by the firms which acquired the closed factories or were absorbed by other firms either before or after the closings.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that in reply to a question by him on 13th March, 1968, he was informed that the reduction, in recent years, in the number of Irish-owned ships using the Port of Dublin had seriously reduced the volume of ship repair work available.  Since then the main Dublin shipyard has been taken over by a Scottish firm and I am aware that the new owners have under consideration proposals for modernising and expanding the yard's ship building and ship repairing facilities and they will, of course, be facilitated in this matter in every way possible.</P>
      <P>While I am not in a position to secure ship building and ship repair work for any particular yard, I am prepared to support, where possible, suitable proposals towards that end.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware, in view of the large number of mining licences that have been issued, of the danger of all mining rights in this country falling into the hands of a few people with no opportunity for others or attractions for them to come to this country; and what steps he is taking to avoid such a situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of granting prospecting licences in the first instance is to encourage the exploration and development of our mineral resources by people competent to do so.  In considering applications for licences the closest attention is paid to the character, financial standing and technical qualifications of the applicants and their proposed programme of work. No arbitrary limit has been set to the number of licences that may be granted to an individual or company but before granting a licence I must be fully satisfied as to the capacity of the applicant to carry out a satisfactory programme of work in all licensed areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2812" /> Prospecting licences are granted only for one year and are renewed only where past performance and future work programmes are considered satisfactory. In this way a degree of mobility in the issuing of licences is preserved and the objectives of the Minerals Development Acts can be attained by ensuring that those who have shown themselves competent and willing to undertake minerals exploration will have prospecting licences available to them.</P>
    <P>I might add that the number of licences current on 1st December, 1968, was 850, the number of licence holders was 50 and the area of the country covered approximately 25 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is open to anyone to apply for a prospecting licence and that until a few groups came into the country very little of this work was done?  Surely there is no reason why those who show they have the ability to prospect should not be given an opportunity at least?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputies are referring to the report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services.</P>
      <P>The Council has recommended that a number of existing county hospitals should be retained and developed to become General Hospitals and that the remaining county hospitals should have their rôle changed to what was described as Community Health Centres.  This designation is somewhat misleading.  The centres would continue to be hospitals and would provide inpatient services for normal maternity patients, for certain kinds of medical cases and for geriatric patients.  In addition, they would have a wide range of well-developed consultant out-patient services, including radiology and pathology.  Detailed recommendations were not made about the staffing of the Centres but it was proposed that general practitioners would have access to them and it is an important part of the plan that they would be visited regularly by consultants in different specialties from the nearest General or Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county hospitals which according to the recommendations of the Consultative Council might eventually become Community Health Centres are those at Bantry, Cashel, Clonmel, Dundalk, Ennis, Kilkenny, Longford, Mallow, Manorhamilton, Monaghan, <Col N="2817" /> Mullingar, Naas, Navan, Nenagh, Portlaoise, Roscommon and Wexford.</P>
    <P>While I have accepted in principle the plan of reorganisation which has been drawn up by the Consultative Council, the detailed recommendations in relation to individual hospitals will have to be carefully examined in consultation with the various interests concerned before final decisions are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister last week if he would make a general statement if I put down this question and I am grateful to him for having done so.  Would he not agree that the plan he proposes is one which it would hardly be possible to operate before the turn of the century in view of the fact that it means spending millions in Dublin to enlarge the hospitals so that they will be able to take patients?  In addition, the proposal which he now makes about these community centres&mdash;which are badly named I agree&mdash;and about the district medical officers having access to them is a slight variation from what was originally stated, which was that the district medical officers would be responsible for looking after their patients.  Would he explain how it is proposed that district medical officers could do this work in view of the fact that many of them are already overworked in their own areas and some of them, in fact, have two dispensary districts?</P>

      <P>The determination of eligibility for a medical card is a matter for the appropriate health authority and there is no statutory level of income which automatically entitles a person to a card.</P>
      <P>Health authorities are required by section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, to provide general medical services for persons &ldquo;who are unable, by their own industry or other lawful means&rdquo; to provide these services for themselves or their dependants.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that there is a rule of thumb which has been applied to this sort of thing over the years and that his predecessor in the White Paper announced that it was intended to set down definite figures?  Have the Department of Health not made an effort to work towards preparing those figures?  Is he aware that the greatest cause of discontent in many a workingclass home is the fact that the people in that home, though they believe they are entitled to a medical card, cannot have free medical treatment while their neighbour, who has a lot more than they have, has a card and can get free medical treatment when required? Would the Minister not make an attempt to remedy this situation? <Col N="2821" /> Legislation is not needed.  Has the Minister any comment?</P>
