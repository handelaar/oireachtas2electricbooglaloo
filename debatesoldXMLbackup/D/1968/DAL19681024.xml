      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was making the point that there are a number of young farmers' organisations such as Macra na Feirme whose members are very interested in agriculture and in procuring farms of land. Owing to circumstances outside their control, they are unable to provide the money for the purchase of land.  This <Col N="1245" /> applies particularly in the west of Ireland.  It would help to stem the tide of emigration if the Department of Lands had a scheme whereby capital would be made available to these people for the purchase of land.  That money should be provided free of interest because the rent and rates demands would be high and they would be unable to pay the high rate of interest demanded at the moment.</P>
      <P>The drainage of land is another matter that should get greater consideration from the Department of Lands than is the case at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Lands follows a very familiar pattern every year.  The Minister in charge gives the House information with regard to improvements which have been carried out in the year under review and Deputies comment on what they consider is wrong with the administration of the Department.  I am quite sure it is understood that when Deputies make these complaints there is nothing personal about them.  In recent years Ministers have developed what may be a tactic of pretending that they are being personally attacked when comments are made about the Department. I am sure that Deputy Faulkner, the Minister for Lands, is not the type of person who would do that.  However, I want to warn him in advance that the comments I am about to make are not an attack on him.  He has not been very long in the Department. There are certain things which should be said and I propose to say them in my own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us start with the Land Commission. The Land Commission has been carrying out a certain task. I am afraid the Land Commission administrators look at it in one way and those of us who represent the public who are interested in land division look at it in a different way.  Originally, the Land Commission was set up to do a specific job.  That job should have been done by now.  This has not happened and the Land Commission appears to be a permanent section of a Government Department.  I do not think it. was intended when it was first <Col N="1246" /> set up that it should be a permanent institution.</P>
    <P>The operations of the Land Commission have been related in the main to two operations&mdash;the acquisition and distribution of farms and the vesting of farms which have been allocated.</P>
    <P>I am speaking mainly for my own constituency, County Meath.  Deputy Murphy has already put the Party point of view in a general way.  We in Meath have been complaining over the years about a system which seems to have been devised for the purpose of bringing people from outside into Meath and allocating farms to them at a much lower rate than the Meath people could obtain land, and whether or not they knew anything about farming. There is nothing so annoying as to hear of a reasonably good farmer, who has been taking conacre and who has been attempting to make a living over the years on a very small acreage of land, being completely ignored when an estate is divided and someone else being brought in who would not know a plough from a television set.</P>
    <P>I had an interesting question for the Minister for Lands earlier this year. I asked him the average size of the farms which these people give away for the purpose of getting a portion of land in Meath or elsewhere.  The acreage is very small.  They come in on transfer and, because they are on transfer, they are immediately vested and can do anything they like on their new farms.  The people who have been writing to the press recently about the Land Commission giving away land do not know what they are talking about. The Land Commission do not give away land.  The people who get land buy it and pay for it.</P>
    <P>We opposed the last Land Act as strongly as we could.  It allows people to be brought in from outside and to get land at half the annuity while the local people, if they are lucky enough to get land, must pay the full annuity. I do not know how any Government can justify such discrimination.  There is not the slightest doubt that, if that matter were taken up in the High Court, the High Court must rule against such a decision.  You find two <Col N="1247" /> farmers side by side both allocated farms of the same size, both with new houses, and one paying as much as £14 per acre while the man beside him, simply because he did not live in the area, and for no other reason, pays £7.</P>
    <P>The other problem is the question of the amount of the annuity which is being paid.  I accused the former Minister for Lands of deliberately introducing this system of the full annuity for the purpose of discouraging local people from applying for land.  I mentioned in the House before the case where land had been set for a number of years in the grass for £10 per Irish acre and when it was divided by the Land Commission some local people who were lucky enough&mdash;or unlucky enough&mdash;to get a portion found that the annuity was £13 6s per statute acre. It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Lands had a stock phrase which he threw at me every time I raised this matter.  He said: &ldquo;Look at what these men were paying for the land they took in conacre.&rdquo; The Minister for Lands, not being used to dealing with the people in this particular area&mdash;the people who make their living in this way&mdash;did not understand.  I am sure the present Minister does understand because he lives among the type of people I am talking about.  The people who take land in conacre take it this year if they can afford it.  If next year for any reason they cannot meet their commitments, then they do not take it.  If you get a farm from the Land Commission you have it this year, next year, and every year.  You must be prepared to pay the annuity or get out.  That is the difference which the former Minister for Lands did not seem to appreciate. He never seemed to be able to understand that this was the position.  I am sorry if I seem to be attacking the former Minister but he had a number of such phrases which he always used. I should like the present Minister to look at this matter to see if he can do something to improve the position.</P>
    <P>The former Minister said that a dairy farmer was not a farmer.  Work that one out for yourselves.  A dairy farmer is not a farmer! What he was <Col N="1248" /> saying was that a man who built up a herd of cows on conacre, on grass which he had taken on the 11 months system, even if he spent all his time looking after those cows, and had to rear his family on the produce of the dairy herd, was not entitled to be considered for a portion of land if a farm was being divided.  That is utter nonsense. Unfortunately, because that has been laid down for a number of years, that is the way it has been operating in Meath.</P>
    <P>I quoted the case of the man who was moved off three estates.  He had built up a herd of 40 cows but he was dumped off three estates and eventually had to emigrate because he could not get land.  There are a number of such cases.  I mentioned the case in Navan of the person who worked in a furniture factory and who was told he should get out in the open air because the indoor life did not agree with him.  He started with two cows and now has a herd.  A number of farms have been divided and in no case has he had more than a very brief visit from the Land Commission inspector who advised him that he would be considered along with everyone else in the area.  Other people seem to be able to get portions but he is left out.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which I mentioned before and which I will now repeat.  As a public representative I will make representations to the Land Commission for other people and recommend them if I think they are suitable.  I will ask the officials of the Land Commission to meet me to discuss the matter and I will leave the final say, as I must, to the officials of the Land Commission.  I should like other public representatives to do the same.  I have heard people say: &ldquo;There was a farm coming up and I had to pretend to be a member of the Fianna Fáil cumann or I would not be considered.&rdquo;  That is all wrong.  I am told that there is interference and I know that peculiar decisions are being taken.  It is a shame if Land Commission officials are being interfered with by politicians who think they have pull, or who think they can twist the division of land in a certain way.</P>

      <P>If I produce letters from some Members of the House telling people they are arranging to have them given land, I wonder would the Minister or Deputy Carter be so smug as they are now when they say this is not so, and that is not true, that these things do not happen.  I am not accusing the present Minister&mdash;I want to make that clear&mdash;because he was not involved in that.  However, if Members of this House are attempting to persuade and apparently in some cases succeeding in persuading the Land Commission to give land in a certain way, I consider it wrong.  If the Land Commission is supposed to be above politics let them be above politics and do not let us have this race every time a farm is being divided in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago it was the practice of the Land Commission, for what reason I do not know, to take over a farm and either set it for tillage or for grass for year after year after year.  Ten, 12 or 14 years might go by.  The people who had originally owned the farm might have given a little employment in the area, but the Land Commission, having taken it over because they considered it was not properly used, proceeded to be worse than the original owner. The Minister for Lands said that he had stopped all this and that it was the general practice, unless there was some particular reason, for farms to be divided in roughly two years from the takeover.  The Minister can check the files and I shall be putting down questions to help his memory within the next couple of weeks showing that in County Meath alone that general practice seems to have disappeared and we are now going back to taking over land and setting it for a long time. Apart from the fact that this leaves people who are seeking a bit of land in the position that they do not know <Col N="1250" /> whether they will get it or not the original owner might set it in small lettings but the Land Commission apparently find it much more convenient to set it in very large lettings.  The result is that very few small men are able to avail of this facility at all and it means they are completely out while the Land Commission are there.</P>
    <P>It used to be the story that the Land Commission were losing money every year they held on to the land.  The Minister for Lands, of course, assured me the Land Commission were not holding on to farms for the purpose of making money out of them; they were waiting until it was possible to rearrange them in a certain way or waiting for some other farm to come up in the area; or there was a lot of agitation in the area and they were waiting for it to die down.  This situation was supposed to mean a loss of money to the Land Commission.  I do not agree that could be so, and I think the Land Commission, if they hold on to farms for a number of years, must be making money on it.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Land Commission to set the farms at the earliest possible date.  I could give the Minister a list of farms I know in the possession of the Land Commission for a number of years.  While normally it is more convenient to wait until a certain amount of land comes in and it is an easier allocation, at the same time it is not right that the Land Commission should hold on to land for such a long time.  One farm was divided in Meath about two years ago or a little more.  There was one man who lived on that farm, who had a wife and family and who had got on in years. For some reason the Land Commission decided he was not a suitable person to whom to give land and after a considerable period they offered him a certain sum of money, but as the sum of money would do nothing with regard to rehousing him, the Land Commission then decided they would give him the sum of money, the lodge in which he was living and a small portion of land surrounding it.  This seemed to be acceptable.  He was making the best of a bad job and he agreed it would be all right.  Everybody <Col N="1251" /> else who was being allocated land on the estate got the land, but this man got neither the money nor the land, as far as I am aware, up to a fortnight or three weeks ago.  There must be some reason why this happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like writing to the Minister.  It might mean putting the man on the spot and I do not like doing that.  I have usually written to the officials, and I have written to the officials in this case, but as far as I know the case has not been dealt with yet.  This is the Lismullen Estate.  I am sure the officials would recognise the estate, and I do not want to go any further in regard to it.</P>
      <P>There is another thing which should be taken into consideration.  The Land Commission have a regulation that, so far as I understand it, employees of an estate are the first people to be considered if an estate is being divided, and they are either compensated or given a portion of land.  If there is a big number of men employed on an estate it is not unusual for the owner of the land to dismiss all those he can get along without as soon as the Land Commission are near completing the deal with him; he may keep one or two employees on.  For some extraordinary reason the Land Commission disclaim any responsibility for people who have been dismissed before they take possession of the farm.  The result is that poor old Johnny Smith might be 40 years on the farm and he is the first to be let go, and when the farm is being divided he is told: &ldquo;We cannot consider you.  You are a landless man. You are not in occupation of your job and you are not losing your job as a result of the Land Commission taking over the farm.&rdquo;  In fact, he is losing his job because the Land Commission took over the farm and the Land Commission are very well aware of that.  Therefore, when the Land Commission are deciding on former employees, it is only fair that they should also consider the people who were employed up to a few months before the farm was handed over to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Another question is how far the Land Commission will go in regard to the provision of additions or accommodation plots to people in the area. The rule of thumb is&mdash;I do not know whether it is in writing or not&mdash;that a cottier within half a mile may be considered for an accommodation plot and that a farmer within a mile may be considered for an addition.  That was introduced, I suppose, when the ass and cart was the usual way in which a small farmer brought his machinery or seed from his home to the farm.  Now that the tractor has replaced the ass and cart it is ridiculous to say that a man who is more than a mile away from a farm is not able to work it economically.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have got to change this system.  I attempted, by way of motion here in this House some years ago, to have this altered and it was opposed.  The extraordinary thing about it is that it was the time of the last inter-Party Government and it was supported by quite a number of the members of the present Government. They do not seem to think it is as important since they went back into office as when they were in Opposition.  I suppose that is only human nature.</P>
    <P>Again in County Meath we have a situation which is unique.  Over the years the Land Commission have been allocating land to migrants.  Those migrants now, particularly those who are a long time in the area, consider themselves as much Meath people as we who were born in the county.  I am glad to say, while we opposed the bringing in of migrants, when they come and live there they are usually accepted and there is no friction whatever between the local people and themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We give them a royal welcome.  Some weeks ago I had a meeting with a group of people who asked me to meet them.  A farm was being divided in the area and they were anxious to get recommended for portions of it.  I explained to them that further than making a recommendation to the Department I would not go.  I <Col N="1253" /> am not prepared to put any political pressure on, but the extraordinary thing about this was that the people who met me were insistent that they did not want any migrants put in.  They had small farms in the area and they felt they were entitled to an addition to their farms before anybody else was considered.  Eventually I had to point out to them that from my own knowledge all the people concerned were, in fact, ex-migrants themselves but, having lived in the area, they realised it was a stupid policy to continue bringing people from outside into the area while those living in the area had not got economic farms.  If the ex-migrants realised that, the Land Commission should also appreciate it and something should be done about it.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Land Commission study the local newspapers.  I know it would be a big job to study them all but in the advertising columns of those newspapers&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Flanagan is well aware of this&mdash; you find such gems as &ldquo;non-residential farm of 400 acres&mdash;or 500 or 600&mdash;for sale&rdquo;.  It should not be necessary for Deputies to have to bring these matters to the notice of the Land Commission. The Land Commission should take immediate action if they see such farms being offered for sale.  There is no point in waiting until they are sold and saying that it would be difficult then to acquire the farms as the price would have gone sky-high, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission will have to have a new look at this whole question of land division.  They send down an inspector, usually a very decent man, and I do not know how he selects those he visits in order to get information. I found that on one occasion he passed by a man who had about ten acres of land and who also had a wife and a rather large family, and he passed him by on the grounds that the man was working outside the farm, that he had other work and, therefore, was not entirely dependent on what he was producing on the farm.  I should like him to tell me how a man with ten acres of land&mdash;and, indeed, there <Col N="1254" /> was another case of a man with five acres&mdash;was supposed to be able to rear a family from what he would make on a farm of that size.  He said that this man could not be considered an uneconomic holder.  Further down the road there was a commercial traveller&mdash; and the only difference between them was that the other man was a supporter of mine and the traveller was a supporter of Fianna Fáil&mdash;who had only about four acres and only occasionally visited the place but he was given a full-sized farm.  Can I or the people be blamed for saying that there does appear to be political patronage about this?  I do not want to go any further than that.  This is something which should be dealt with by the Minister.  He should insist that under no circumstances should anyone be allowed to exert political pressure on the officials of his Department.  The Minister is in the unique position that up to now every Minister for Lands came from the far side of the Shannon but the Minister is living in what is rightly known as the small farm area of County Louth.  Unless this is stopped I can see queues of potential allottees outside his house day and night.  The sooner it is stopped the better it will be for his peace of mind.</P>
    <P>The question of employment by the Land Commission is a rather tricky matter.  The Land Commission employ a certain number of people on building, the making of roads and the erection of fences.  I would appeal to the Land Commission first, as far as the erection of houses is concerned, to have some liaison with the local authorities before they decide to build them, because they do not have to ask for planning permission, and, secondly, before they make new roads.  It looks stupid to see a new Land Commission road leading to nowhere but the middle of a field which, if it had been realigned a few degrees, could have been made into a connecting road with another road in the area.  Another thing is that there is no point in the Land Commission making a road and having it looking wonderful for a while until the first heavy rain comes and then it collapses into a quagmire.  This is not intended as a reflection on the people who made it; certain quantities <Col N="1255" /> of material go into it and afterwards it is found that there was no proper foundation.  Neither is it right for the Land Commission to make a road which is so narrow that it cannot be developed by the local authority.  It may also be a road with elbow bends which make it even more difficult for the local authority if they agree to take it over.</P>
    <P>This is a matter for simple co-operation and it could be dealt with if the officials were prepared to co-operate with the local authority.  I do not know why but when the Planning Act was being passed here it was agreed that this sort of development would be exempted development and, therefore, the Land Commission can put houses anywhere they like and we have still got this happening.  As I say, it is a simple matter and it should be dealt with.  In regard to employment, the Land Commission have always claimed that they are not prepared to lead and, therefore, they must follow the general trend.  This year we have had an example of something which was nothing short of disgraceful.  The Forestry Division was involved in this too.  We had a wage offer of 15/- a week increase when the general offer was £1 and at a later stage the £1 was conceded.  Service pay was also conceded to employees of local authorities and in private firms from the 1st April.  However, the Land Commission and the Forestry Division decided, I assume because the inter-Departmental committee who deal with these things so decided, that the service pay offer for these people should be conceded from the 1st July.  There was no justification for that.  There was only one reason for it.  They knew there was nothing the people concerned could do about it.  If it was a question of people going on strike and holding up production in such a way that it would affect the general community or some section of the community it would have been the 1st April but because the &ldquo;Great White Fathers&rdquo; decided it should be the 1st July these employees had to take it.</P>
    <P>Three items were being discussed by the trade unions and the Department of Lands.  The third question was in <Col N="1256" /> regard to holidays.  The trade unions refused to accept an agreement unless it included an assurance that holidays would be dealt with in a matter of weeks but that was about four months ago and the matter has not been dealt with yet and there does not appear to be any prospect of it being dealt with in the near future.  This is all cod. Some years ago when the bonus system was being introduced for forestry workers the then Minister gave an assurance through his officials that a committee would be set up to investigate complaints.  This committee was not to be set up until the bonus system was being operated all over the country. The bonus system has now been in operation all over the country for some years and yet the committee has not been set up.  Deputy Lemass, when he was Taoiseach, told me in what must have been almost the last speech he made before he resigned that he proposed to introduce a system of conciliation and arbitration for State employees. This has not been done; his word has not been honoured by his successor.  Neither has his word been honoured by the Minister for Lands nor the Minister for Finance and we find that we are in the very same position as before.</P>
    <P>It may appear that I am attacking the Minister personally or his officials but what I am attacking is the system &mdash;a system which means that if you are high enough up on the tree you have conciliation and arbitration but if you are only an ordinary worker you have not and we are put in the humiliating position, no matter how courteously we are received, of going in to meet these officials and, with all respect to them, holding the case before the devil and having the court in hell.  We have no redress.  We either take it or leave it.  It is sheer nonsense that this sort of situation should obtain in regard to what are called the lower grades of employees.  The people at the bottom, the manual workers, are not entitled to anything.  If we had access to the Labour Court all these matters affecting the workers would have been dealt with and cleared up long ago.  We have no right of access to the Labour Court because, apparently, those in authority <Col N="1257" /> revel in their right to be God and to say: &ldquo;We will give you this.  We will not give you that.&rdquo;  I am told that in most cases it all goes back to the Department of Finance.  No matter what the officials of the other Departments decide it is the Department of Finance who arrogate to themselves the right to make up their minds on these matters.  It is about time the Department of Finance made up their minds, particularly in regard to holidays. While everybody else has got a concession the State will not grant that concession to certain categories of workers.  The sooner this matter is dealt with satisfactorily the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister is new to the Department and I ask him now to do something about having some type of appeal against decisions made, decisions unacceptable to workers, by Departmental officials and about which the workers affected can do nothing.  God knows, they are not looking for anything wonderful. A wage of around £10 per week in 1968 is not something which will interfere with the balance of payments. It will not enable these employees to rush out and buy luxuries because, by the time they have bought the bare necessities, they have spent all they have got, and perhaps a little bit more.</P>
    <P>Last year there was introduced&mdash;we are grateful for it&mdash;a type of sick pay scheme.  It is not a good scheme.  It is a pretty poor one because, while most other employments and State Departments have a sick pay scheme which ranges from ten weeks to six months for employees other than manual workers, the offer made&mdash;it had to be accepted&mdash;in the case of the manual workers was confined to six weeks.  That is discrimination.  It is wrong.  It should not have been introduced. Because it was better than nothing we took it.</P>
    <P>We have been working for a pension scheme for these people for many years. The arguments advanced against the granting of a pension scheme are so ridiculous that I cannot understand how sensible people ever even attempt to make them.  One of the stock arguments against it is that these people <Col N="1258" /> are casuals.  A man who has been 35 to 40 years in employment is described as a casual.  I know he has not got security of tenure.  He has not got a document which says he cannot be dismissed. He is not a civil servant.  All public employment is granting pension schemes to workers and it is a little bit ridiculous for the State to stay behind everybody else, thereby making those who work for the State a lesser breed, second and third class citizens not entitled to consideration or fair treatment. That is why these people are not getting a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>We are told they can get a long service gratuity.  I do not know whether those concerned in this have ever gone to the trouble of checking these things but, as a trade union official, it has been my job to go very deeply into matters affecting workers when they come to retire.  The long service gratuity means that for seven years service the workers get nothing; from seven to 15 years service they get a week for each year; for anything over 15 years they get two weeks for each year.  If they are lucky, this will yield them something around £100 to £150. What can be done with £150 at the present time?  A man left with less than £3 a week to live on, with no supplement to his social welfare, is in a very precarious position indeed.  This is an insult.  I might add that it takes quite a long time to get these gratuities dealt with.  They may drag on for months. I have one or two cases in which years have elapsed.  Would the Minister please have something done for forestry workers and for others in the employment of the Land Commission&mdash; gangers, overseers, foremen, or whatever the official designation is&mdash;who have been employed for many, many years?  These should all be in a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the ridiculous situation in regard to those who work in a supervisory capacity.  The amount of money they get for doing this work is very, very small.  The Forestry Division tell us they are waiting to see what the pattern is elsewhere.  Two years last February a case was made to the Land Commission for a certain type of employee known as a Land Commission <Col N="1259" /> ganger; the case was made in regard to travelling expenses, an increase in the differential and certain other matters.  I know the section which deals with this is a very busy section, but I do not think we can be blamed when we complain that all this is still under active consideration.  If decisions finally made were made retrospective to the date of application we might, perhaps, be a little bit more patient, but I think the Minister will agree that taking 2½ years to come to a decision on a simple matter is just a little too ludicrous for words.  That is the situation and I want the Minister personally to check on this to see if what I am telling him is correct.  Will he also see why these people are not being dealt with? Mark you, most of the people about whom I am speaking are supporters of the Minister's Party although they are members of my trade union.  I do not know whether they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; last week, but I do know they are supporters of the Minister's Party.  They make no secret of the fact.  Yet, they are treated in the way I have described, for some extraordinary reason, by his Department.</P>
    <P>The 11th round increase has been in operation since 1st April last, but drivers with the Forestry Division are still awaiting their increase.  This is October.  It is not good enough simply to say that the Forestry Division are still awaiting the pattern elsewhere. Everybody, except State employees, has got the 11th round.  The State have not yet got round to deciding what they will pay.  They have given the service pay.  They have given the holidays. They have not given a wage increase. If the people affected were senior officials of the Department they would be kicking up a much bigger row and they would get their money with retrospective effect.  But these are only workers.  That seems to be the attitude adopted by somebody, perhaps, the Department of Finance, but somebody is responsible and it is about time the people concerned realised they are dealing with human beings who are as much entitled to their increases, to whatever is coming to them, as anybody else.  They are as much entitled to have it paid to them as those who <Col N="1260" /> are receiving high salaries.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of land by the Forestry Division is a very tricky problem. I know the difficulties officials have had during the years in trying to keep up the stock of land for afforestation.  It would be a tragedy if it were not found possible to keep available a reasonable supply of land for afforestation.  We shall soon reach a stage&mdash;I suppose we have reached it already&mdash;when our forestry products will pay off to a certain extent and we should soon have reached a stage where afforestation will be paying off in a big way.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan yesterday spoke about the position in Austria.  I remind the House that I spoke a few years ago about a scheme which might be operated here by farmers who have patches of bad land. In Austria they have a system whereby, when a daughter is born, the farmer plants an acre of timber.  When she reaches 21 years of age he has a very nice dowry for her.  It has not been tried very much in this country.  Farmers may think that the boggy land they have is useless for anything like the planting of trees.  However, it might be a good idea to encourage the Austrian system here.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of cutaway bogs which Bord na Móna will be abandoning in a few years.  It should be remembered that the end of their turf operations will come in practically every bog in 25 years.  A number of bogs will be reaching the end of their use within the next five, six or seven years.  Therefore, the Forestry Division should make a major effort to acquire these bogs and set about planting them now because if they do not it is possible these bogs will go back into general disuse and will be an eyesore for generations.  Apart from anything else the question of the employment which the utilisation of cutaway bogs would give in rural areas deserves a great deal of consideration.</P>
    <P>We have had here on a number of occasions representations by various people about the acquiring of cutaway bogs and also of bad patches of land by the Land Commission.  The prices offered, though they have increased in the last few years, are still too low. It is not the amount the farmer would <Col N="1261" /> get for the bog or patch of bad land from somebody else that should be considered but what its value would be to the Forestry Division.  If that situation prevailed much more land of that type, useless for anything but for the growing of trees, would come into possession of the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we find the situation in which the Land Commission have taken over a farm and they find there is on it a portion of wood or scrub.  Recently the arrangement has been that the Forestry Division take over that portion, whether good or bad.  That is not a good idea.  If such portions of land can be turned into arable land they should be included in allocations to local people instead of using it for afforestation.  God knows, we have enough bad land and we should attempt to use as much of it as we can. Therefore, all good land possible should be allocated to people who will use it.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;I have repeated this again and again&mdash;if somebody writes to the Department of Lands a letter in the English language he should get a reply in the English language.  Replies come to people on thin paper, stuck together, and usually people down the country do not know where to start opening it. It does not really matter what the contents of the letter are about.  Usually the contents consist only of an acknowledgment saying the person's letter has been received.  My point is that the Minister should arrange that a formal, typed circular in an envelope should be used so that the whole country will not know that the person concerned has written to the Land Commission or the Forestry Division.  Such letters in envelopes should be issued to people in the normal way.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy I have to make representations on numerous occasions, not to the Minister, but to the Land Commission. I have got back simply a stereotyped reply.  This might be all right as an acknowledgment but a Member of this House, who goes to the trouble of writing to the Land Commission and giving details, is entitled to a personal reply.  Without overtaxing the section of the Land Commission who deal with this, I suggest that should be done and I should be grateful <Col N="1262" /> to the Minister if he could arrange that it be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  One of the burning questions of our time is that of land.  In reply to one of the suggestions made here by Deputy James Tully I wish to say categorically that I have been in the House almost 25 years and I have never known any member of the Land Commission to give land to anybody through political influence.  I have often made representations on behalf of people and will continue to do so, but I never asked the people on whose behalf I made representations what their political views were because I look on our system of land division as a national institution under which anybody who is entitled to land should get it irrespective of their political affiliations.  I have held this view all along and, as far as officers of the Land Commission are concerned, I have found them to be honourable men who listen to a case and if a man has a case which can be stood over the application will be considered sympathetically. The Land Commission will not bend to political pressure.  Of course, we are all human beings and, naturally, when I take up a case I want to win it.  Any Deputy is not worth his salt if he does not follow up a case no matter what it is, and that is the whole point of taking up a case on behalf of one's constituents.</P>
      <P>May I digress for a moment to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I hope he will do well in it and remain there for quite a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I am anxious that the Land Commission should buy on behalf of the people all the land coming on the market in so far as their resources permit this to be done so that all people living on uneconomic holdings may have these holdings increased.  The target set for a viable holding is 45 acres of good land or its equivalent.  Since we gained national independence thousands and thousands of acres of land have been given out by various governments.  Coming from the land myself and having had experience of the struggle for existence on a small farm, I say that the holdings given out by the Land Commission <Col N="1263" /> years ago were too small.  In those days a man with a holding of 21 or 22 acres was neither a farmer nor a labourer.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy Tully about conacre.  People came to me in Dublin and in other places and said that with 24 acres of land they were not able to carry on.  I am not saying that the present Minister can cure all this immediately.  He at least came from one of the best-farmed counties in Ireland.  The farmers of County Louth work hard and are very industrious.  The Minister realises what it means to a small farmer if he has to go out and get conacre.  For that reason we must do everything we can during our time to try to give the people economic holdings.  Where there are a few hundred acres of land to be divided in an area I do not want to see five or six people brought up to 45 acres.  I want to see it divided among them all.  I do not want to see it done with one or two.  If there is land to be divided I want to see it divided equally so far as possible among the people who require it.</P>
    <P>At Rush, County Dublin, the Land Commission inspectors and the divisional inspectors could not have done better.  They gave land to 55 people, a few acres of land to each of them.  It was as fair as it could be done in a place like that.  There was a good-humoured approach to the whole thing and I should like that to continue.  I must say that we in County Dublin&mdash; I am sure the Minister has it in County Louth too&mdash;have this particular type of letter asking for a dairy holding by a farmer who comes under the conacre category.  We have been told over many years that he is a landless man. I appeal to the present Minister.  I know the general policy is to relieve uneconomic holdings but there are distinctions among landless men.  The man who has proved himself able through his own energy, through his own initiative and ability, to get conacre land, is in the position, when a farm is divided, of being able to apply for 30 or 40 acres of that particular farm.  But, for one reason or another, he is not recognised although he might <Col N="1264" /> have worked it for years.  I feel that, while rules are made for the guidance of society, in the case where a man has proved himself he does not compare with the man working somewhere else or with the cottier or landless men. I am concerned about all sections of people particularly where, in my opinion, there may be an injustice to some people.  A number of these people could never get enough money to buy a farm although they might have 30 to 40 acres on conacre and may be trying to live and pay for seed, manure and machinery and carry on from hand to mouth.  Nevertheless, they are living by the land and on the land.  The Minister knows very well what I am speaking about.  He has that problem in his own county as well as in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is also this point of the mile limit.  The mile was, I know, the yardstick fixed on a number of years ago. I know it is very hard if there is only one small piece of land to be divided to go outside the mile and bring in too many others.  But I also feel in certain cases again that the mile should be stretched to two miles at least where it will relieve so many uneconomic holders and people worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>With reference to another point made by Deputy Tully that a man with ten acres could live by the land if he has to work outside&mdash;the Land Commission inspectors, the divisional inspectors and the Land Commissioners themselves believe this man is worthy of a chance if he has ten acres and can hold it.  He is in the same category as a man with 21 acres.  He has not enough land to carry on.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin we have given land to cottiers and some of them have made a good job of it and some have not.  Things are not so bad at all, on the average.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Land Commission roads have improved.  I believe that any place where the Land Commission are about to make a road the best thing they can do is get in touch with the county council and ask them to take over the road when it is finished.  Otherwise you are going to have agitation over a number of <Col N="1265" /> years to try and get the road finished.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see the number, type and architecture of the Land Commission houses have been improved. It used to be a rubber stamp affair.  If you saw one you saw them all.  The county council cottages were all the same.  I am delighted to say the agitation we carried on in the House and in other places to have the architecture of these houses improved&mdash;they looked shocking and there was nothing architecturally pretty about them one way or another; nor were they, in my estimation, very comfortable&mdash;was successful and things have improved.</P>
    <P>In Rush, County Dublin, the Department had to pay a high price for the land.  I believe the local applicants know land is dear.  I know the people in my own constituency are anxious to get land.  They do not mind paying the price for the land in Rush and they are trying to get it.  They are paying up to £30 an acre for conacre. If the Land Commission are in doubt at any time and feel the land in my constituency is too dear, it would be well for them to consult the public representatives and the people of the district.  The people are prepared to pay if they get the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few points to make on this Estimate. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him the best of luck in trying to carry out a very difficult job, especially in so far as my area is concerned.  I can assure him of my co-operation and help in solving any of the problems affecting the west of Ireland.  In passing, I would also like to pay tribute to his staff, from whom I have got the utmost co-operation in the past.  There may be a few matters where snags arose which I will refer to later.  However, much has been done by the Land Commission and by the solicitors' section of the Land Commission in the past, and we must give credit for that. Quite a lot remains to be done.  I would like to point out and to impress on the Minister the urgency of the acquisition and distribution of more land in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> It appears to me that one of the main functions of the Land Commission would be to keep the people of rural Ireland on the land and to give them a reasonable standard of living. In that, I am sorry to say, it has failed in the west of Ireland because, during the past 10 years, 44,000 people, mostly young people, have left the land in the province of Connaught.  Those figures indicate that much urgent work is required by the Irish Land Commission in the west.  There does not appear to me to be any concerted plan to relieve congestion in the west.  As far as I see it, we are faced with a tremendous problem and we have not got into it at all.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that 44,000 people have left in ten years, that one can travel the countryside and see houses closed down, schools being closed&mdash;apart from amalgamation at all, automatically closed&mdash;people leaving the land and putting the lock on the door.  This is the most serious aspect of it.  These people can be gone in the morning, telling nobody where they are going and not even setting the land.  They go in desperation and frustration.  Frustration and cynicism has crept right through the west, so that at the moment it is difficult to see how the land could be arranged.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister's Estimate is increased by £413,000.  That is a healthy sign but I think much more is required.  I am glad to see that he intends to reorganise the Land Commission and that the inspectorate is to be increased and strengthened.  In my constituency one of the greatest difficulties has been in getting sufficient inspectors to carry out the amount of work which requires to be done.</P>
    <P>The life annuity scheme appears to be very disappointing.  Out of 339 applicants only 11 annuities have been set.  Those figures speak for themselves. I think there should be more personal contact between the Land Commission officials and those people.  I would suggest to the Minister, and I think he would find it successful, that he should ask his inspectors to go to those elderly people, sit down and chat with them and explain the position to them. Quite a number of them do not know <Col N="1267" /> about it and, of course, some do not want to know.</P>
    <P>Regarding the scheme to enable farmers in congested areas to buy viable farms and to make their existing farms available to the Land Commission, here again the response by the Land Commission to the number of applications leaves something to be desired.  From the figures I have got there appear to be 120 applications and only 40 negotiations have been authorised.  I was interested in some of those people in my constituency and I know one man in particular who applied more than one and a half or two years ago.  The Land Commission inspectors investigated his case, and his neighbours, but no price has been fixed.  This man, and I am sure there are others like him, has come across land that he is anxious to purchase but he has to let those farms go by the way because he has not got the money to buy.  If the Land Commission would give a decision on it and state a price he could proceed from there.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Lissadell estate and to bring a few points to the attention of the Minister.  This estate, I understand, will be coming into the hands of the Land Commission before very long, as a result of a recent court decision.  There are many families there who have derived their livelihood from working as farm hands on the estate for up to three generations. Most of those people are landless people and I feel that is where a snag may arise.  I would ask the Minister to consider those cases very carefully because most of the people there at the moment are beyond the age at which they could adjust themselves to any other type of living, to industry or anything else.  They have been brought up from childhood on the estate.  They have worked it all their lives.  Most of them are in the 40 to 50 age group but there are some up to 70 and they could not be expected at this stage to readjust themselves to any other type of life.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister to give those people every consideration in the <Col N="1268" /> allotment of that estate.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to refer to in connection with Lissadell is that the estate is scattered all over the county.  I should like that the gaming rights of the estate be considered by the Game and Wildfowl Branch of the Department.  Game is dying out where the lands are not preserved, and some of those lands, especially in South Sligo, are not preserved.  I would suggest that the gaming rights be given to some person of repute, such as a hotelier, so that foreigners coming in could shoot snipe, duck and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the things I should like to mention here is the acquisition of land. This has been very slow.  I doubt if much land has been acquired in Sligo during the past 12 months.  They apparently worked mostly in the distribution of land already acquired. Some of the land now being distributed has, as other speakers have mentioned, been held up for a long time. We have land in Sligo held up for as long as three to four years after acquisition. Some of that has now been distributed.  Sometimes it is hard to understand how this acquisition takes place.  I know of land which has been offered to the Land Commission for some time but they have not acquired it.  They have refused to acquire some land and there are other lands which they did not visit at all.  In this regard there are lands that I know of in the County Sligo vacant for 20 years and over and the people concerned have emigrated.  I know of a case where the owner is in Australia for 20 years. Others are in America, and so on. These lands have been brought to the notice of the Land Commission but no effective action has been taken.  A few months ago I led a deputation to the Land Commission and we went through the lists.  The lists compiled five to ten years ago have now changed as business people with money came in and bought some of the land.  There are some farms still there and the Land Commission have now sent a ganger to inspect them.  I do not think that it is correct that, having waited for years for inspection by the Land Commission of land vacant for 20 years, a ganger should come in to inspect it.  However, <Col N="1269" /> we are waiting for the result of that.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to refer to what is happening where lands are vacant for a long time.  Big business magnates are coming out from towns buying up these lands.  Small farmers have not the capital to compete with those business people.  That is being done in Sligo.  I know the Minister is sympathetic towards some of the cases I discussed with him where businessmen came in from another county eight miles away and purchased land.  The right of free sale is still there and I do not know whether anything can be done by the Land Commission in this connection.  I should like the Minister, even if it means legislation, to try and cover this point of business people coming distances of eight to ten miles and purchasing land in congested areas and getting away with it.</P>
    <P>I know of one man who has purchased land from the shores of Lough Gill to Cairns Road, a distance of two miles.  He got away with one purchase, then bought another farm and another. I have reported some of the lands several times to the Land Commission so that they could be acquired.  We are told the right of free sale is there and that the man went in and bought.  That is happening all over Sligo.  I cannot speak for Leitrim but in Sligo we have people coming from Castlebar and Ballina, from South Mayo and everywhere buying up the land and the small farmer has not a chance because he has not the capital.  It is clear to me that the small farmer is being squeezed out little by little and gradually we will have the west of Ireland going back into ranches once again.  That is all I have to say on the acquistion side.</P>
    <P>On the distribution of land I have found that it has been done relatively fairly.  You cannot satisfy everybody but, as far as I am concerned, I have found it fair except in two cases.  I am obliged to mention them because of severe pressure.  One was a case in north Sligo of a fully-qualified man with a young family, a hardworking farmer of £7-£8 valuation.  The land was going beside him and there was only a wire fence with posts between and everybody thought he would get the land.  He got nothing and a man with a high valuation got it.  Some people <Col N="1270" /> maintain that this was a case involving politics.  I do not believe it was.  The man who did not get it was a Fine Gael man and the man who got it was Fianna Fáil, but I do not subscribe to the contention that there were politics involved.  Something wrong happened here.  All Parties agree on one thing: that this man was entitled to the land and should have got it.  It was a public scandal that he did not get it. I do not believe there were politics in it.  Certainly the man in question suffered, whatever happened in that case.  I think the Minister knows about it.  A degree of injustice has been committed here.  The Minister will find that out and satisfy himself that grave injustice has been committed, and I would urge that that man be remembered when the Lisadell estate is being divided and that he will be recompensed for what has happened.</P>
    <P>I have another case in another part of the country where a man with 66 acres got an additional 30 acres and a qualified person with 12 acres right beside the farm got nothing.  A man with 60 acres got 30 more and a man with 12 got nothing.  The latter was a qualified person and the fact that he got land afterwards proves that he was qualified.  He did not get it at his door but on the same estate at the opposite end when a row was kicked up.  Those are the two exceptions to which I wish to refer and I should like to point out that otherwise I have nothing to complain about.</P>
    <P>All that is not intended as criticism. Those are hard, cold facts of something that went wrong.  In regard to the case in north Sligo&mdash;and I do not know whether this had anything to do with it &mdash;the Land Commission inspector who dealt with that particular holding when this happened was changed from Sligo when a row was kicked up.  I would ask that that particular man in north Sligo be considered for the first allocation of land in that area.  I shall give his name to the Minister but I think the Minister knows the name of the man about whom I am speaking.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer.  It is in relation to a case which I have and which is difficult to solve.  I have not yet approached <Col N="1271" /> the Minister.  A man whose wife owns land eight miles away wants to sell in order that he will be able to buy a farm nearby.  This has been in the hands of the Land Commission for at least 12 months.  Both of these farms are in congested areas.  The gist of what the Land Commission said was: &ldquo;This is a pilot area and you must give it to us&rdquo; but they have not offered a price. She has two neighbours who will buy the land and give a good price.  At home they have, I think, only a valuation of £5 and there is a nice little farm of land beside them which they could buy if they could sell the farm eight miles away but they have no money to buy it unless they sell and my information is that the Land Commission will not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I shall be in the Land Commission today in regard to this case.  I have been in with them twice already.  As I have said, I have received the utmost courtesy from the Land Commission always and this is the first time in my life I have not received a reply from them.  I asked for a reply on two occasions and I have got none.  It may be a slip-up.  I am not offering that as a criticism but I hope I will get a reply after today.  That is a very genuine case.  As I have said, those are only three exceptions to the rule.  I think the Land Commission are endeavouring to do a very good job with the money and the inspectorate under their control.</P>
    <P>Where the Land Commission are using public sand roads&mdash;I have one such in mind&mdash;and using machinery on them to get into their forests I am not sure if they make a contribution towards the upkeep of the roads.  I am talking about county roads, not roads of their own.  If they do not make a contribution I think they should.  I have a particular road in mind at Ballinafad. The Land Commission make a pretty bad mess of it going in there with machinery and all the rest.  It is a county road and the county council repair it only once in a while and in between it is in a pretty bad mess.  I should like to know whether the towards the upkeep of county roads which they use.  I would recommend which they use.  I would recommend <Col N="1272" /> that they should.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister once again the urgency of providing more money for the acquisition and distribution of land in the west of Ireland and for afforestation.  There are in my constituency thousands of acres suitable for afforestation.  It seems to be criminal waste to see the sides of those mountains all over the place that could be turned into forests and would give employment opportunities for the many people looking for work and, perhaps, lower the incidence of emigration and at the same time produce materials that I would like to see used in an industry in that particular area. We have plenty of places in Sligo, especially my home town of Ballymote, where there is no industry at all and if there was afforestation on the hills we could, perhaps, have a chipboard factory or some kind of wood industry which would help to arrest emigration in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House would hope that the Minister will be successful in his task of trying to allot and rearrange lands and to make better provision for the smallholder especially in congested and semi-congested areas and towards this end I noted in his statement that he has made provision for supplementing the field inspectorial staff.  It is always held against the Government and against Departments of State that the services are too centralised.  Here is one Department which is using the best possible method of decentralisation, namely, having the staff working over the ground.  All of us in the House would subscribe to the view that the inspector and his assistants who work in the various counties and know the people, know the terrain, know the shortcomings of the areas in general, are better fitted to deal with the problem of resettlement than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who have any experience of the Land Commission and of living conditions in rural areas will subscribe to the view that the greatest setback to the activities of the Land Commission in the purchase and allotting of lands is the price factor.  It is a very difficult exercise and in the past I have heard quite experienced members of this <Col N="1273" /> House blame outsiders for increasing the price of land when it was, in fact, our own internal forces interacting on each other which caused the price of land to increase.  A strange fact is that when one provides loans even at a reasonably high rate of interest for the purchase of land those loans can have the effect of driving up prices and the fact that the Land Commission is known to be interested in a farm in any area has also a hardening effect on the vendor of any particular piece of land. It is very difficult to relate land resettlement to the price problem.  There is no use in allotting an area of land to a farmer unless he has a reasonable prospect of being able to pay the annuity and at the same time meet the other overheads connected with the land.</P>
    <P>We are now in the age of power and what constituted an economic holding in the past is no longer relevant.  Even a 50 acre farm can no longer be said to be viable.  We know that power has come to stay and that power is the only way we will be able to get production. If we want to have power on the holdings we are driving up costs and we must, therefore, make provision by way of larger holdings when allotting land to the various applicants.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Minister supplementing his staff.  This leads one to believe that he is sincere and earnest in trying to solve this problem in a workmanlike fashion.  We know from experience that it is not an easy problem.  I was very disappointed in the 1965 Land Act because a certain area in north Longford was not deemed to be a congested area and was not included in the scheme for halving the annuities and was not, therefore, taken into account when this matter was before the House.  The former Minister said he was empowered to deem an area to be a congested area if it was generally thought the area was entitled to be so regarded.  No provision is made to have this part of the county classed as a congested area for the purpose of halving the land annuities.  That land in that northern part of the country is very poor and, in my opinion, it is entitled to be included under this scheme as are many other parts of the country. <Col N="1274" /> I, therefore, ask the Minister to see if anything can be done about it.  It is a highly congested area of very small holdings and when a smallholder is allotted an area of his neighbour's land it constitutes a hardship on him to have to pay the full economic rent. Particularly in this area there should be a review to see if it can be brought within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>One could make many points about the acquisition and division of land which, I suppose, by and large, will always be governed by the amount of money available.  I was very interested to read the Minister's report&mdash;I had only time to run through it&mdash;regarding the special scheme to encourage ageing smallholders to surrender their land to the Land Commission for reallotment to younger men.  I gathered from the Minister's observations that the scheme is proceeding and is not doing too badly but I think something more could be done by the Minister to popularise the scheme.  For example, a smallholder, perhaps, in bad health and anxious to surrender his holding to the Land Commission either on an annuity basis or for part cash and part land bonds does not know exactly what the land bonds system means.  Land bonds are too remote from the people and the Minister should make a special effort to bring them to the fore because if we subscribe to the principle that land is a permanent asset and worth the money we are investing in it we should agree that more should be known about the land bonds fund.  It is my experience that people who should be well versed in the land bonds system are not well versed.  They are those who are in close contact with smallholders, bank managers, solicitors, auctioneers and others who are in a position to advise their neighbours or others as to the land bonds system or what they would be accepting in exchange for the surrender of their holdings.</P>
    <P>The booklet the Minister has mentioned in relation to this scheme for aged landholders should be available at every post office and should be sent by the Land Commission to every bank manager, broker, solicitor and auctioneer because these people are in a position to speed up acquisition and <Col N="1275" /> help the Land Commission in a voluntary fashion by advising aged landholders to surrender holdings.  We all know there is a general reluctance on the part of the aged to part with land. I do not know why but it seems that one could part them from money far more readily than from land.  I think it was Lenin who said that land was at the heart of revolution.  The Land Commission could carry out a peaceful revolution here by popularising this scheme and in order to do so the facts concerning the land bonds system should be in the hands of those I have mentioned.  The Minister would have the goodwill of this section of the community and, I think, of most people who subscribe to the aims of social progress.  It would be one way of getting more land.  We are living in a time when production will count.  We are all familiar with the rural pattern and all too familiar with the ageing bachelor or spinster living remote from present ideas.</P>
    <P>The younger men will no doubt have a difficult task to face when allotted land.  If we cannot give this type of claimant some hope in the next five years our basic rural problem will not be solved too easily. I know of quite a large number of people who are toying with the idea of surrendering holdings.  There are many factors which come into play. Take the case of an aged bachelor living in a closely-knit townland.  He decides that he would like to give up his holding because he is unable to work it and get a decent income from it but feels that he has his neighbours to consider.  Sometimes he seeks advice from a TD; more often he will go to a solicitor and sometimes he will go to a bank manager for assistance in this matter.  This is the reason why I say that all such people should be fully familiar with the scheme and that land bonds should be made more attractive if they are to be offered to this type of farmer.</P>
    <P>If he succeeds in overcoming the first problem of acquainting his neighbours of the fact that he is going to surrender his holding, he has to meet many other problems.  Members of this House should try to put themselves <Col N="1276" /> in the position of an ageing landholder of this description.  We should try in our legislation and by other means to help these people if they apply to the Land Commission and we should make the process of surrendering a holding as easy as possible.  In that way we could hope to make some inroads&mdash;and only some inroads&mdash;on the land question.  I do not suggest for a moment that the scheme would solve the whole problem.</P>
    <P>One welcomes the fact that we now have a senior inspector attached to each pilot area.  This should eliminate unfounded and loose charges of corruption, political interference and so on.  The fact that there is an experienced inspector working in close contact in a pilot area with the agricultural advisor for the area will lead to better understanding, swifter surrender and exchange of land and to a smoother system under the Minister's control.  The agricultural instructor and the Land Commission inspector would be in a position to assess the ability of an applicant for land in a pilot area. They would know what his output was and have a good idea as to his ability in the event of his being migrated or of his existing holding being supplemented.</P>
    <P>I would be very much in favour of proceeding to supplement the holding of good smallholders in pilot areas. While migration solved some of our problems, it created others.  If one migrates the best farmer out of a townland, a vacancy is left in the townland. The townland loses leadership.  To this extent it could be said that, while there are advantages, there are also certain disadvantages inherent in the system. If possible, it is better business to supplement the holding of the man who is making progress on his own ground.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to game preservation which is coming into the picture now in a fairly big way.  There are regional game councils and there are game farms.  In the past, game preservation was left to the gouty colonel, to the landlord or to the lord of the manor.  Even at this stage, the managers of game farms and regional councils could learn something from the work done by these men in the past. <Col N="1277" /> Last summer a game farm released pheasant chicks and a number of birds. A number of the birds nested in meadows for want of better shelter on the edge of a bog.  When the meadows were being mowed the nests were destroyed.  Game farms that are engaged in the promotion of game should provide coverage and windbreaks for birds so as to avoid this waste.  We all know that birds that are released nest in whatever shelter is available in the locality.  At certain periods of the year, especially in the late spring and early summer, they nest in meadows.  The mowing machines cause destruction to the nests.  I would urge whoever in the Land Commission is in charge of the game section to have regard to this matter of providing shelter for birds that are released, and to provide windbreaks at the hinterland of the bogs as the old landlords used to do in the past.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Forestry Vote I see that expenses have increased.  I also see that the Minister is determined to try to secure all the plantable land he can. It all depends on what one means by plantable land.  In general, land offered for planting is not very attractive as a proposition for any other sort of production. It calls for heavy development when the Forestry Division take it over. To this extent the increased costs can be foreseen.  At the same time, it is good development, and development which should be encouraged.  It is development which later on will pay its way.</P>
    <P>It was always my hope in dealing with the forestry that we could have a forester attached to every committee of agriculture in the country.  No matter what improvements are made to farms and out-buildings, one never sees a properly standardised shelter-belt.  We who are so fond of talking about housing and management of livestock, and we who produce livestock in a very big way for export on the hoof and otherwise, should subscribe to the view that every holding should have a proper shelter-belt in order to supplement the housing accommodation and to provide better conditions for the livestock.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a subsidiary activity in the Forestry Division is now <Col N="1278" /> developing in saw-milling.  One welcomes this activity.  One sees a number of saw-mills coming into production throughout the country and one hopes that this will continue at an accelerating pace.  While complimenting the Minister I would ask him to consider the points I have raised and, if at all feasible, to have the areas I mention classed as congested areas for the purpose of participating in the annuity scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from an area where there is fairly good forestry activity, an area in which a large number of people depend for their employment on the forestry estates&mdash; particularly the areas covering the Comeragh, Knockmealdown and Slievenamon mountains&mdash;I should like to urge the Minister to take whatever steps he can to ensure that there will be adequate land available for planting purposes in the years to come to provide continuous employment for the people in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I would also urge him to give consideration to making available to uneconomic holders in the mountain areas, where land has been acquired for planting purposes, portion of that land which would be suitable as agricultural land, and which could be added to the holdings of the small farmers living on the mountainside and trying to eke out an existence for themselves and their families.  At present we find that there is a reluctance on the part of the Forestry Division to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few such places in mind where the Forestry Division acquired a couple of hundred acres of land and where 20 acres were suitable for agricultural purposes.  I sent to the Forestry Division recommendations from the chief executive officer of the county, pointing out the suitability of that land for the growing of crops, but despite that I have not met with any success.  That is to be deplored because it would be a great asset to the uneconomic holder on the side of the mountain, struggling to make a living, to have an extra 20 acres made available to him.  It would make all the difference between his being able to <Col N="1279" /> continue to live there on his holding or perhaps emigrating.  That is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>It would also be to the advantage of the farmers in the areas adjoining these forests if timber were made available to them for the purpose of fencing. At present the tendency is to sell off timber in rather big lots which are not suitable to the requirements of the farmers in those areas.  This makes it rather difficult for them.  They want to purchase small lots.  That is the only way in which they would be interested in purchasing timber.  Farmers should be facilitated in this way.  Although in the area from which I come there are quite a lot of forests, nevertheless farmers experience difficulty in getting timber suitable for fencing and other purposes because of the method by which the timber is sold.  I would ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention briefly the conditions under which forestry workers are working at present.  I believe that the wages they are being paid are altogether too small.  I believe that their holidays are not satisfactory.  I believe that adequate shelter-belts should be provided for them at their place of employment.  A forestry worker is employed mainly on the mountainside far away from shelter of any kind, particularly at the time of planting.  Very often when he arrives at the end of the road leading to the mountain, he has to go a further three or four miles up the mountain to reach the spot where he works.  This is unreasonable. Once he arrives at the point of entry this should be taken as the time of commencing work because he has to travel maybe five or six miles to reach this entry point and, having reached it, has to proceed a further three or four miles to the mountain top. This is asking too much and I would request the Minister to give particular attention to the conditions under which forestry employees are asked to work at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division have suffered great loss from time to time due to fires, particularly at the height of the tourist season and the dry season. <Col N="1280" /> Many of these fires, to my mind, could be avoided by the employment of suitable caretakers.  Caretakers are employed at the present time in a rather haphazard way.  Permanent caretakers should be employed and adequately paid.  The wages or salaries they would get would be many times saved to the Forestry Division in the prevention of fires which can cause a considerable amount of damage.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with the acquisition and division of land.  Some speakers here this morning wanted to create the impression that there is political &ldquo;pull&rdquo; in the allocation of land.  We know, and I think those speakers know as well, that nothing could be further from the truth, that the Land Commission inspector who goes out to select the people who are to get this land does not want to know and does not try to know the political affiliations of those people.  That is only as it should be, and it is very wrong for any Member of this House, from whatever side he comes, to try to create the impression that we, as Deputies, have any say whatsoever in connection with the division of land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that he could produce letters received by applicants for land from people on this side of the House, letters creating the impression that the allocation of land rested with these particular Deputies. All I can say is that if Deputies are engaging in this kind of activity they are bound to bring about their own downfall.  Everyone knows that for the one person who will get land there will be 10, 15 or maybe 20 people disappointed and it would be a very foolish Member of this House who would engage himself in this kind of misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is very hard to justify the action of the Land Commission in regard to certain estates.  I have in mind something that happened in West Waterford not too long ago, something which I have been unable to justify or explain to the people.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to pay special attention to what I have to say in connection with this matter.  I hope <Col N="1281" /> when he is replying that he will deal with it because the people of West Waterford, knowing what took place there, have lost confidence in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Down in Affane there is the Walsh estate which contains 215 acres.  This estate has been worked by the owner for a considerable length of time.  Many Deputies, Deputies from the South Tipperary end of the constituency and Deputies from the Waterford part, had made representations to the Land Commission in connection with it. Nevertheless, the Land Commission failed to take any action in regard to it. Then we found there was a very big owner in that area interested in purchasing this estate, and we were asked to exert pressure to ensure this would not happen.  We exerted all the pressure we possibly could, but without success. This dragged on for a couple of months and in November, 1966, we were told that the Land Commission were now going to take steps to acquire this holding and that the necessary notice of intention to acquire had been issued.  However, following this we were told that a purchase had taken place on the day prior to the notice being served and, this being so, that it would have to go to a hearing in the Land Court, and there it would be decided whether this farm would be acquired by the Land Commission or not.  I might say at this stage that the purchaser was known to us to have at least 800 acres of land and to have bought another fairly large estate in that area five or six years previously, an estate known as the Hearne estate in the Mellary area.  Again, even though strong representations were made to have the Hearne estate acquired and divided in a congested and mountainy area, which the Mellary area is, our attempts failed.  We were very perturbed to find that here was the same landowner, having purchased 215 acres of land, and that this was going to a hearing.</P>
    <P>I might say, too, that the locals in the area kept on saying to me and, I am sure, to other Deputies also: &ldquo;This hearing does not matter at all.  This man is saying openly that this is only a matter of form and that this will be <Col N="1282" /> sanctioned.&rdquo;  We kept on telling the people that this might not be so, that there would be a fair hearing and that maybe this man would not be successful. However, we were very much surprised to find when the hearing came off that he was successful.</P>
    <P>I may be told by the Minister that this matter is not finalised as yet, but my information is that he was successful to the extent that the hearing was adjourned and that the sale to him would be sanctioned provided he made a small amount of this estate available to meet the needs of two uneconomic holders adjacent to this farm.  There is one portion of this estate which is a complete bog.  This owner is now going to drain this bog and when he has, before this comes for hearing again, this is the portion that will be made available to the two uneconomic holders.  This is not acceptable to us. The extraordinary thing about it is that even in the West Waterford area at this time there was another estate which came up for hearing.  It is known as the Lineen estate and contained 46 acres.  Before the notice of intention to acquire was issued it too was purchased by three landowners living adjacent to it.  They were not three big landowners but three small landowners. In the words of the former Minister for Lands, Deputy Ó Móráin, replying to a question here, this estate was purchased by three medium-sized farmers, but nevertheless it was going to hearing.</P>
    <P>That hearing came off and the sale to the three farmers was not sanctioned. What a great difference between the way the Walsh estate was treated and this estate was treated.  It does not make sense.  No wonder the people of West Waterford have lost confidence in the activities of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition of estates. Although this was some considerable time ago the Lineen estate has not yet been divided.  The three farmers who purchased it have paid their deposits and they have manured and limed the land and it is altogether regrettable that, although they were informed that the sale would not be sanctioned, this land has still not been divided.  Perhaps one of the three would qualify for portion of it if it were divided, but it is wrong that its division should be held <Col N="1283" /> up for this length of time.  It was altogether unfair to the owner, who is a very old man, who is at present in the County Home in Dungarvan and who up to recently had not been paid for the land by the Land Commission.  If the Land Commission did not sanction the sale they should at least have paid for the land and carried out the division of the land among the smallholders in the area.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me why the Land Commission allowed the Walsh estate to be bought by this large landowner who already had 800 acres. Indeed, it might be 1,000 or 1,200 acres but certainly not less than 800. If I am wrong I should like to be told so.  Another matter which was mentioned here was the question of roads to Land Commission farms where houses have been built for people on estates.  We have one of those estates in our locality, in Villierstown, where the people have been living for three or four years.  The road provided by the Land Commission was a good road but unfortunately it has deteriorated to such an extent that it is impossible to travel over it now.  The drivers of the lorries sent to collect milk, the bulk tankers now in operation, refuse to go over the road because of its condition. Waterford County Council, I am afraid, did not live up to their responsibility by taking over the road and seeing that it was kept in proper repair and free of water.  There should be more co-operation between the Land Commission and the local authority in regard to such roads.  These roads cost a considerable amount of money and if the inlets for water are not kept open and the road is allowed to deteriorate then that is money wasted as far as the State is concerned.  The local authorities as far as possible should take over the maintenance of these roads.  In conclusion, I should like to wish Deputy Faulkner well as Minister for Lands. He is facing a very big task but he is equal to it and I assure him that he has the co-operation of each and every one of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my concern once again about the undue delay by the Land Commission <Col N="1284" /> in dealing with the acquisition and division of land in my constituency.  It is exasperating in the extreme for those of us in public life, and especially for the smallholders concerned, to have to wait a long number of years before a division is made.  It is difficult to understand why this delay should occur.  There is a number of estates that quickly come to mind and about which I am concerned.  We are concerned about the cumbersome approach of the Land Commission in not moving quickly to secure a farm or an estate before it goes for public auction and is filched from them.  This is happening too often and I wonder if the Minister can tell me if he feels the Land Commission have sufficient authority or power to compete on the public market for land.  If they have not we can attribute to them complete insincerity in regard to grappling effectively with the problem of congestion.</P>
      <P>Unless the Land Commission have all the necessary power to compete on the public market with auctioneers and others, and for the speedy acquisition of land, it is obvious that large tracts of land will be filched from them.  In this way the problem of the congests is being pushed aside altogether.  In addition, when they take over estates for division there is the difficulty of providing proper housing accommodation for the farmers concerned and also proper access to their farms by way of roads and so on. There seems to be undue delay in fitting up the houses properly to the satisfaction of the new holders and providing access paths to their homes and farms.  For years I have been making representations for the provision of passageways which in fact were conceded by the Land Commission in the early stages but which have not yet been provided.  The Minister, a comparatively young man, coming into this office, needs to ensure that the Land Commission will be more progressive in matters of this kind, and act with greater despatch in dealing with the acquisition of land, the proper housing of the farmers and the provision of the proper amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that in many instances he <Col N="1285" /> is not conferring any benefit on the farmers in allotting them extra land. Indeed, he is inflicting hardship on them.  The Charteris Estate at Cahir was acquired by the Land Commission a number of years ago.  Part of it was set aside for afforestation and part of it for, if you do not mind, a golf course.  The remainder was allotted amongst the smallholders in the area. The farmers were pleased to have economic holdings but, when the valuation was struck, they immediately felt deeply aggrieved.  The impact was such that many of them were inclined to give up their holdings.  I appreciate that this is probably a matter which does not come within the Minister's jurisdiction but, nevertheless, he should have regard to the financial obligations likely to be incurred by such smallholders in the sphere of rates.  I would ask him to have a look in particular at the manner in which the valuation was decided and see what he can do to reduce this very heavy burden.  This estate was exceptionally highly rated and, when the provisional rate for the smallholders concerned was struck, the figure was divided up over the number of farms and borne equally by each of them. This was grossly unfair because no regard was had to the difference in the quality of the land and other factors. There was an appeal but the reduction was minimal and gave little or no relief to the farmers concerned. This is a matter of deep concern and I would welcome the Minister's intercession with the valuation officials to see what can be done to secure a fairer deal for these particular farmers.  The rates at the moment are millstones round their necks and they cannot be expected to work their new farms economically and maintain a decent standard if the prevailing rate is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Travelling around the country I am struck by the number of farms which are obviously not being worked properly. I wonder is the Land Commission diligent enough in this regard. Is stock taken of these tracts of land, some of them of very high quality, which are not being worked properly? It is saddening to see land going to <Col N="1286" /> waste when there are smallholders in the area working their land from ditch to ditch in an effort to eke out a decent livelihood.  Those who do not utilise land should not be allowed to continue on that land.  The land should be acquired for those who will put it to much better advantage.</P>
    <P>I anticipated that the Minister's opening speech would show a progressive outlook and that some hope would be held out for the congest.  I was disappointed because there is nothing spectacular and nothing revolutionary in the speech; there is nothing designed to give hope to the farmers that they can look forward to economic holdings in the not too distant future.  Even the schemes launched some years ago have not been successful.  The scheme for compensating the aged and incapacitated, if they gave up their lands, has not been a success.  I join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to make these people more fully aware of the scheme and of the benefits that can accrue to them and to society at large if they can be induced to hand over their farms to the Land Commission for the benefit of those who will make the best use of the land.  The idea of compensating these people through the medium of Land Bonds is not attractive.  People are rather suspicious of compensation by means of bonds rather than hard cash.  I do not know why the Land Commission insist on bonds.  If they compensated these people in cash there would be a greater readiness to hand over the land.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands does not seem to appreciate the intrinsic worth of afforestation and the contribution forestry workers make.  There is constant opposition to every proposal designed to improve the lot of the forestry workers.  It is only by dint of agitation and effort, sometimes of a most protracted kind, by the unions concerned that wage increases are conceded. Very little progress has been made in respect of better conditions of work.  Very little effort at all has been made to better working conditions, such as reducing the hours of work, granting longer holidays and the provision of sick pay and pension schemes These are concessions which are <Col N="1287" /> enjoyed by most other workers in this country today, and it is saddening that the Forestry Division show such a lack of appreciation of the worth and work of the forestry workers that they continue to oppose in such a conservative fashion every move towards betterment of their wages and conditions.  This is to be greatly deplored.  It ill becomes a State body to seek to depress&mdash;and this is what they are doing&mdash;the standard of living of workers under their control.</P>
    <P>I know some improvement has been made in that regard in recent months in respect of an increase in wages, which was general throughout the country, and a reduction in working hours, but the over-all picture of the forestry worker is still one of insecurity and financial difficulty and certainly one of very great hardship.  I do not know of any other category of worker in this country who works so utterly hard, in primitive conditions and so close to nature, as the forestry worker. He still is obliged to work mainly by hand because the modern devices of man have not yet come to the forest to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Many forestry workers must travel 20 miles each day to arrive on the roadside outside the forests in which they work.  Then they must traverse by foot many more miles to the point of work and back again in the evening. Their duties throughout the day are arduous in the extreme, whether they involve planting, cutting or digging, and I do not know of any other category of worker who works so utterly hard, devoid of modern appliances or amenities.  Regard should be had to this.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the manner in which these people are paid by way of time and motion study.  The application of the stopwatch to men who do work of this kind leaves a lot to be desired.  Some of my colleagues in the trade union movement regard the stopwatch as being more appropriate for use on horses and dogs than on human beings, particularly on men working in forests.  There is the feeling that the harder one works under this system the less one earns in the long term, and there is the feeling that there <Col N="1288" /> is constant interference with the times supplied by those who are charged with timing the job.  The pattern of wages in this country under this system of time and motion study leaves a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and others dealt at length with the position of forestry workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department.  I want to emphasise another aspect of their conditions of work to which the Minister should give immediate attention. It is ludicrous to regard a forestry worker in the same way as a higher civil servant in that he does not come under PAYE for income tax purposes.  How long more will we have to harp on this in this House&mdash;that a forestry worker is not permitted to pay his income tax, as the mass of Irish workers do, on a weekly basis under PAYE? The forestry worker is treated as a higher civil servant who has £4,000 or £5,000 a year&mdash;his income tax is deducted at the end of the financial year.  As public representatives we know this is a very great hardship on the men concerned&mdash;this annual demand made for a substantial amount of money, £40 or £50&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I hope I have made my point to the Minister.  The conditions in which these men work leave much to be desired.  The problem of protective clothing is another matter that has been adverted to.  It is time the Minister saw to it that each man was supplied with protective clothing, including wellingtons or boots as the case may be, for the kind of work they perform, and having regard to the weather prevailing.  For instance, the footwear these men have to use are unhygienic having regard to the conditions <Col N="1290" /> in which they have to work.  It is a hardship on men to have to wear boots or shoes of a size which do not fit.  My size of boot might not fit other men.  It is time we provided for these men adequate protection against inclement weather by way of clothing and footwear.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the approach of the Department in respect of the recognition for services rendered by forestry workers by the payment of appropriate gratuities.  The Minister will recollect that I have made representations to him from time to time asking that a generous gratuity be granted to certain forestry workers of long standing who were obliged to retire mainly on health grounds.  I am concerned, firstly, about the delay which seems to ensue before a decision is made on the payment of such gratuity.  I am also concerned about some gratuities on which I made representations recently.  The Department seem to take the view that the workers concerned do not qualify.  I have submitted some further information in respect of these cases and I feel sure the Minister will look sympathetically at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What concerns me in the matter is that the full period of work with the Department is not being taken into account in certain cases.  Where we can prove conclusively to the Department that men commenced work on a certain date and give evidence to show the foresters under whom they worked, I am concerned that the full term of service is not being taken into account.  It is only being taken into account from the period where these men were reinstated or re-employed by the Department. I would hope that the Minister will be generous in respect of the gratuities for forestry workers who rendered long and loyal service to his Department, all the more so because we do not have a pension scheme as such for forestry workers.  It is our aim and ambition that forestry workers would have a proper pension scheme, where every year of service would be taken into account and where they could look forward to retirement in the clear knowledge that they would have something worthwhile for the service they rendered.  The gratuity is something <Col N="1291" /> very much less than that.  That is all the more reason why the Minister should be more generous in that regard.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier in my remarks about the undue delay involved in the acquisition of land.  I am also concerned about the price for land which the Land Commission and the Forestry Division offer from time to time.  I welcome very much the departure from that instruction or regulation which precluded the Land Commission from paying more than £10 an acre for land for afforestation purposes.  It is heartening that that figure has been improved upon and one can now secure £40 to £50 per acre depending on the nature of the land.  This, I would hope, will assist the Minister in gathering in large tracts of mountain land in particular for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>I want to express the anxiety of forestry workers in my constituency who have been talking to me on many occasions and expressing their concern for their future employment due to the fact that land for afforestation purposes is running out.  I will certainly co-operate with the Minister in respect of his own wishes expressed in his opening speech in bringing before him what we consider to be tracts of suitable mountain land for afforestation purposes.  I hope the Land Commission will act more speedily in the matter than they have been known to heretofore.</P>
    <P>With respect to the price of arable land for land division purposes, from what I hear I am not too surprised that so much land is slipping from us to private purchasers because I feel the Land Commission are not inclined to pay proper amounts of money for land on offer.  I have a case in particular&mdash;I do not wish to give names but I can give the Minister particulars privately if he so wishes&mdash;of a very excellent holding of some 30 acres of land on which there was a good substantial dwellinghouse together with attractive mountain land on which the owner had sheep-grazing rights.  After long negotiations with the Land Commission the most they would offer for this land, house and holding, was £500.  The owner concerned took it as an affront <Col N="1292" /> and insult and the negotiations were quickly broken off with the Land Commission. That house and holding was sold a short time afterwards for over £1,000.  This is one experience I have had recently in respect of the price offered by the Land Commission which certainly could not be said to be fair or equitable or in conformity with present market values.  If the Minister wants particulars on this aspect of things I will be only too pleased to give them to him.  I do not want to hold up the House unduly.</P>
    <P>I also wish to avail of the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his elevation to his new office and to wish him well in all he undertakes for the betterment of our rural community and for the betterment of the farming people.  Anything he embarks on to provide more economic holdings for our people will have my support and that of my colleagues.  We have been concerned that, instead of eliminating this chronic problem of congestion, the position seems to be that we have more and more small holdings and we have also the tendency of the big estate to come back into vogue again.  The evidence we see in this country from time to time shows a tendency towards larger farms and the bigger estate making it more difficult for the small-holder to secure an economic holding.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task and I want to assure him of our support and respect in all his undertakings.  I hope he will have special regard for the workers under his charge whom I have mentioned here today and whose problems I have outlined very briefly.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention just one more point before I conclude.  It concerns the purchase of land by aliens. I know legislation enacted in this House in recent times has precluded aliens from purchasing large amounts of land any longer.  Nevertheless, it is rather surprising to see the amount of land, and particularly the very important rich land, still falling to aliens in this country.  Many of these aliens are people who respect the rights and traditions of our people in respect of rights-of-way and such things.  Others, I am afraid, are arrogant and <Col N="1293" /> domineering types.  They are people, in effect, we could well do without.  We have been concerned about attempts by aliens to purchase large tracts of mountain land including most beautiful country and mountainside in my constituency.  I refer to the Nire Valley area and the very genuine unrest that prevailed at the time of this proposed take over of a large tract of mountain land together with the lakes and all the beauty that goes with it.  This was obviated at the time but the Minister will need to keep a close eye on this whole question of aliens coming into our country who as I have said have little regard for the rights of our people, who come here merely to exploit and who have shown flagrant contempt and hostility to local people. Indeed, to my own knowledge, instances have occurred which have outraged local people in respect of the overbearing and arrogant approach of these people when they get a foothold in our country.</P>
    <P>We welcome people of progressive outlook in our country but we expect them to respect us as a people, respect our traditional rights and we do not expect to see any tendency towards the use of the jackboot when they come among us.</P>
    <P>With these sentiments I wish, an tAire Ó Fachtna every success in the discharge of his new duties.  I feel sure that he will bring to the Department enthusiasm and sincerity and we hope for many good things from him before his term as Minister is finished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to thank the Deputies who have congratulated me on my appointment as Minister for Lands and also to thank the Deputies who took part in the discussion <Col N="1294" /> on the Estimate.  I can assure them that the points raised by them will be carefully considered.  They have all put forward solutions as to how these very difficult problems could be overcome.  I do not necessarily agree with the solutions put forward, nevertheless, I can assure them that they will get full consideration.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised during the course of this debate to find some Opposition Deputies putting forward proposals which were tantamount to asking me to interfere with some of the ordinary workings of the Land Commission.  This House has given the Land Commission certain statutory functions.  These include that the Land Commission decide on the persons from whom land is to be acquired, the price to be paid for such land, the persons to whom the land is to be allotted and the price which the allottee will pay.  These statutory functions are the basis for the trust of the Irish people in the Land Commission and this is as it should be and as I wish it to be.</P>
    <P>I know that there are certain people who hold grievances against the Land Commission, particularly unsuccessful applicants for land.  I suppose this is a natural reaction.  I know that on rare occasions an injustice may have been done unwittingly, but it is generally accepted, on good grounds, that the Land Commission performs its duties impartially and does its best to be fair to everyone.  An examination of the files in the Land Commission bears this out.</P>
    <P>I should like to state here categorically in reply to Deputy Tully and to other Deputies that there is no political interference with the Land Commission. When Deputies write to me in connection with cases in which they are interested I pass on their communications to the Land Commission for consideration.  When Deputies write direct to the Land Commission their letters go to the Land Commission and also are given full consideration.  There is no political pressure of any kind put on the Land Commission to make particular decisions.  It makes its decisions in the way it believes is right, free from any interference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> I am glad to have the opportunity of making this statement here.  With regard to the question, raised by Deputy Flanagan, of receiving deputations I do not know of any regulation of my predecessor or of any other Minister for Lands preventing them from meeting deputations but I do know from my relatively short experience in the Department that requests to receive deputations in that particular Department are exceptional and if I were to accede to all the requests then I would have to devote all of my time to them to the exclusion of everything else.</P>
    <P>I can only say that where I find it practicable I will receive deputations but Deputies will appreciate the position as I have already stated it.  It may not be very often practicable, but in any case I will make available the officers of my Department to meet deputations.  Deputies can always be assured that any representations that are made by them will be passed on to the Land Commission and that these representations will be given the full consideration that they deserve as coming from Deputies of this House.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Flanagan's efforts in the course of a long speech to be all things to all men.  He asked the Land Commission to grant land to all possible types of applicants starting with the ex-employees of estates, acquired by the Land Commission, right down to the landless men and then immediately accused the Land Commission of not giving permission to a certain man to buy an estate.  He neglected, however, to let me know where we could get all the land to satisfy all the needs of all the applicants. In my estimation if we were to get the Six Counties, completely devoid of the population, we would still not have sufficient land to satisfy the claims of all applicants.  The Land Commission have a list of priorities beginning with the ex-employees of estates acquired by them, the number of which is relatively small.  The next category is married uneconomic landholders, rearing families, farming for a living and doing a good job on the land which they have.  These are our main concern <Col N="1296" /> and while the other categories, including landless men, are given fair and reasonable consideration I think it will be accepted that the other group I have mentioned is entitled to precedence. This is not to say however, that other groups are not considered or do not get fair consideration.  They do. Nevertheless, I think that all Deputies will accept that the uneconomic land holder, who is bringing up a family should be first in mind for any land which is available to the Land Commission for distribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Murphy has condemned my predecessor for proposing that an economic farm should be in the region of 45 acres and he said that this is not a practicable proposition if we were to keep our people on the land.  In my view it is a practical proposal in the sense that unless a farmer can get a reasonable standard of living he will not remain on it.  He wants and is entitled to a standard of living which compares generally with standards of other people, and this he cannot have on a farm of low valuation. As well as keeping our people on the land, the emphasis should be on keeping our people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy suggested that this could be done by providing industrial employment in rural areas.  Surely the Deputy should be aware that this is Government policy and that the small industries scheme is especially devised for this purpose.  I might add that in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht I concentrated on this particular element in the Gaeltacht for the past three years and with considerable success, as will be clear, I think, in my Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I am a firm believer in the efficacy of rural industry to keep our people living in rural Ireland and I have a typical example of this in my own constituency.  I do not agree with Deputy Murphy when he says that such industry would provide part-time employment for small farmers.  You cannot operate industry on this basis but it would provide employment for his family and with their help thereby strengthen the economy of his farm and make it a much more economic <Col N="1297" /> unit for himself and his successor.  The Deputy can be assured that I am deeply interested in this particular matter and that my Department will give all help and assistance to the Department of Industry and Commerce and any other body engaged in this work.</P>
    <P>I am also examining how we can strengthen the economy of the small farmer by encouraging more co-operation. I announced some time ago that I was studying the results of experience elsewhere where combined or group farming is practised with a view to devising a scheme which could be appropriate to our circumstances. An estate in County Meath has been chosen for this experiment.  An area of about 200 statute acres has been set aside for the accommodation of four migrants and four dwelling-houses are in the process of being built.  These houses are dispersed but are spaced only about 200 yards apart.  It is intended to erect a small shed at the rear of each house for fuel etc.  and a big hay barn byre outoffice complex for use by the four migrants.  The work of designing these out-offices is about to be put in hands.  A list of migrant applicants who may be prepared to participate has been compiled and it is hoped to discuss matters with them within the next fortnight.  It is envisaged that the four migrants will form a limited company and details of a suitable agreement will be worked out in the near future.  This will be entirely voluntary and each participant will be free to withdraw, after a specified period, and revert to farming on his own, taking with him the value of his contributions.</P>
    <P>I feel that the main reason why we have not been as successful as we would like in the field was that the main ingredient, which was the land itself, was not involved and I believe that this experiment involving as it does the land, has a much better hope of success. I should like to emphasise that I am very much aware of the problems and difficulties involved but I feel that, with the co-operation of all concerned, the migrants themselves, the Land Commission and the agricultural advisory services, the experiment can be a success.  Should it prove to be so, <Col N="1298" /> I am hopeful that a new dimension can be added to the scope of Land Commission activities which can result in this type of co-operation taking place in areas where there is no land readily available for division and also among the general body of small farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred to the attendance of Land Commission inspectors at auctions and suggested that they did not attend at sufficient auctions.  This is not the case.  In fact, the Land Commission has made regular use of its powers to hold up sales of estates until it had an opportunity of deciding whether or not it was interested in taking over the lands for the relief of congestion.  I have a note here which indicates that in the last year, that is the year ended 31st March, 1968, under section 13 of the 1965 Act notices were issued in 502 cases.</P>
    <P>On the question of the price paid for land, which was raised by a number of Deputies, the Land Commission must concern itself with the price the tenants to whom the land is being allotted are capable of paying.  I am glad to be able to say, on the general question of land acquisition, that the amount of land in the machine this year is a record and it augurs very well for the intake of land in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The life annuity scheme has been criticised mainly for what is suggested to be its lack of success.  In the first place, I feel this scheme has not yet got a fair trial.  We must remember that the scheme is only in operation for a year, and, I think it must be recognised that there is a very difficult psychological problem involved.  We are dealing here with elderly people who are settled in their ways and, understandably, do not like change.  I feel that, if we could prevail on a further reasonable number of these people to accept the scheme so that others could see for themselves how it works, we would then have the key to the situation. I would appeal to Deputies to assist me in whatever way they can in making this scheme known to people in their constituencies who can benefit by it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> I have asked the inspectors of the Land Commission to seek out, as far as they possibly can, those people and explain to them the conditions of the scheme.  We have in the Department a number of booklets explaining this scheme and we will be glad to provide Deputies with copies, if they desire them.</P>
    <P>The self-migration scheme is also in the same category in the sense that it is something new.  It takes some time to sell such a scheme to the people concerned and, again, I would appreciate any assistance I can get from Members of the House in helping to increase the number of those who are willing to take part in it.  I should like to stress also in relation to these two schemes that they are not in substitution for but are complementary to our ordinary methods of acquisition.  Therefore, every acre of land which becomes available to us under these schemes is a gain.  In fact, we stand to gain about 2,000 acres at the present moment from these schemes.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made by a number of Deputies about the length of time lands have been held up by the Land Commission.  They have stated that they feel that these lands should be divided more quickly.  I should like to say that every effort is made by the Land Commission to have the land divided as quickly as possible and I would like to point out that the total amount of arable land on hands is never greater than two years' total intake of land from all sources.</P>
    <P>I agree that some lands are held for a considerable time but this is usually because there are legal difficulties involved such as title or in some instances because it is deemed necessary to get further lands in the particular district concerned to make a more effective division.  I can assure Deputies that, contrary to opinions expressed by some of them, the Land Commission does not hold over land for the purpose of making money at auctions.  In fact, because of the outgoings such as the servicing of bonds, for example, sometimes the Land Commission does, in fact lose money.  The Land Commission <Col N="1300" /> would be just as pleased as the Deputies or as anybody else if they could get this land off their hands more quickly.  However, we are concerning ourselves with this problem to see in what way we can speed up the allocation of land.</P>
    <P>As I have said, due to the increased work in pilot areas and in other schemes there has been a considerable increase in the inspectorate but this needs to be further increased and I propose doing this by having non-professional officers appointed.  This would again help in speeding up acquisition and disposal of land.  I want to point out that we are having considerable difficulty in recruiting professional staff.  Deputy Flanagan stated that he could not understand why we have this shortage and that in fact there should be no difficulty in recruiting staff.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Land Commission inspectors are university graduates&mdash;engineers and agricultural scientists.  These professional people are in short supply and there are many bodies and many institutions competing with us for their services.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the difficulties we face in recruiting personnel such as these I will give the results of some well-publicised competitions which were held in the last few years.  In 1965 a competition for agricultural scientists was held.  Twenty-two people were successful but only 13 took up duty.  In May, 1967, there was a competition for engineers and only one officer was recruited. In October, 1967, there was another competition for agricultural scientists.  There were 19 successful candidates and only five accepted.  It is on account of this continuing shortage of professional personnel that I have decided to recruit a new type of sub-professional outdoor officer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also spoke on the question of foreigners buying Irish land although I had already explained in my statement that permission would not be granted to non-nationals to purchase land in order to engage simply in those forms or lines of production commonly practised by our farmers but only if the properties concerned were properties unlikely to attract Irish buyers.  I have here some cases of lands <Col N="1301" /> which were sold last year.  We had for example an area in Kerry of 128 acres which had a valuation of only £2.  We also had cases of stud farms being bought.  It can be taken that we are particularly careful about any lands that are being sold to foreigners and no land is being permitted to go into the possession of foreigners for the purposes of ordinary agricultural pursuits.</P>
    <P>With regard to the game legislation we are bringing this in next year.  It is difficult to say precisely when because, as I am sure Deputy Flanagan and others will recognise, consultation must take place with a considerable variety of interests so as to ensure that the Bill will be generally acceptable.  This has been going on for some time and I can assure Deputy Flanagan and the House that it will be brought in as soon as it is possible.</P>
    <P>Some praise was given to the work done in Kennedy Park.  The very large number of visitors to Kennedy Park and to other centres in our forests is proof of the need for such parks.  We are anxious to provide more amenities of this kind and we hope in the future to be able to continue this type of work in other forests.</P>
    <P>I should like to add another word to what I have said in relation to the improved price for forestry land.  As well as this we are endeavouring to streamline our land acquisition machinery in relation to forestry.  Under the old system detailed inquiries were made in the Land Registry about each offer received before it issued to the inspector for report.  This involved a long delay before inspection of the land. The new arrangements now coming into force provide that all offers will go immediately to the local acquisition officers for inspection as quickly as possible.  Again, under the old system an area found suitable on inspection was reported back to headquarters and such matters as sub-division requirements were cleared before a written offer was issued to the owner.  This entailed still further delay before the owner knew whether we were prepared or not to buy and also before he knew how much we were willing to pay.</P>
    <P>Now, under the new system the inspector <Col N="1302" /> will return soon after his original inspection with power to close the deal at the approved price subject to verification of ownership and clearance of any questions in relation to sub-division.  As these new arrangements come into force we will be able to offer a much quicker service to anybody offering land to us.  There must still be some cases of delay in clearing title and so on but in all cases the man offering the land will be able in the minimum possible time to find out whether the land suits us and how much he is likely to get for it.  In relation to the payment for forestry land the two assessments we have to make are firstly the volume of timber that can be grown on the land and the value of the timber, and the other is the cost of development.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the planting of cutaway bogs.  There are many areas where manually cutaway bog has been acquired over the years and these have been successfully planted.  The only sizeable area of cutaway acquired so far from Bord na Móna is at Lyreacrompane in Kerry.  In 1965 550 acres were acquired there.</P>
    <P>The planting of this area is proceeding. Bord na Móna have indicated that no further extensive area of bog will become available for a considerable time.  They cannot release areas piece-meal or on a staged basis because their mechanised method of operation requires the use of the whole area for the entire life of the bog.  The Forestry Division has research work in progress on a small area of mechanised cutaway bog at Clonsast.  The work so far confirms that no difficulty will arise in raising forest crops on such a site, provided sufficient depth of peat is left on the bog after Bord na Móna operations have ceased.  An Foras Tionscal also have experimental work in hands on the use of cutaway bog for agricultural and horticultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the matter of consultation between the local authorities and the Land Commission when houses are being built or roads laid by the Land Commission.  In fact, this consultation does already take place <Col N="1303" /> and the Land Commission, so far as I am aware, tries to bring the roads up to the standard the county council would like to have.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of holidays for forestry workers and said that my Department had given an assurance that a settlement would be reached within a few weeks.  That is not correct: the Department did not give such an assurance but the matter has been actively followed up and it is hoped that a decision will soon be possible.  Also, in regard to the 11th round for lorry drivers, this matter has been settled and instructions for payment of arrears have been issued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the matter concerning the magazine <i>Build.</i> He was rather perplexed by the startling allegations made in this publication concerning the activities of the Forestry Division and the Land Commission in the Rockingham estate. May I assure him that, if he were a regular reader of this publication, he would merely have been amused?  The allegations were, of course, completely wild and the writer relied on a combination of carefully selected photographs and misleading statements to suggest a campaign of neglect and deliberate destruction being pursued at public expense.</P>
    <P>Rockingham estate was acquired in 1959.  Rockingham House had already been destroyed by fire in 1957. Subsequent to the estate's purchase, much further damage to the woodlands and to various buildings and bridges was caused by Hurricane &ldquo;Debbie&rdquo; in September, 1961.  Subsequent further damage by vandalism occurred notwithstanding the best efforts of my Department and local responsible bodies.</P>
    <P>Portion of the estate was taken by the Land Commission for the creation of migrants' holdings and the balance was in the first instance acquired by the Forestry Division for normal forestry development.  It was subsequently decided to develop the Forestry area as a national forest park and the allocation of the estate between Forestry Division and Land <Col N="1304" /> Commission was revised so as to include in the forestry area the amenity parkland as well as the woodand areas.</P>
    <P>While planning of this new project was proceeding, actual work up to 1967, apart from a small harbour project financed by Bord Fáilte, was confined to the Land Commission's normal development of the area for which it was responsible, at a cost to the State of £51,500, and forestry work on clearance of storm damage at no significant cost.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out now that this is all that happened prior to the publication of this article and that the cost up to that stage was £51,500. Plans for the further development of the forest park project were published in November, 1967 and development has since got under way.  The project is a very ambitious one, jointly sponsored by the Forestry Division and Bord Fáilte, and no effort is being spared to make this one of the finest forest parks in Europe.  I need hardly say that in our planning we are trying to preserve all that we can of the earlier estate amenities and we have, indeed, gone to great trouble to restore features damaged by storm and subsequent vandalism.</P>
    <P>Even today, if Deputy Flanagan were going in that direction, I should be glad if he would call in and see for himself the progress made.  I think he would be very satisfied that the work done by the Department is first class.  In a couple of years the first stage of the park project will be completed.</P>
    <P>If there is anything to which I have not replied and if the Deputies concerned will get in touch with me I shall be very glad to reply to any points they have raised.  I can assure all Deputies that points raised by them on this Estimate will get full consideration from me and my Department.  Again, I want to express appreciation of the various contributions made by Deputies on this Estimate.</P>

      <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom go bhfuil méadú arís i mbliana ar an airgead atá á chaitheamh againn ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Agus, mar a luaigh mé anuraidh, bhí méadú faoi dhó tagtha ar an airgead sin in imeacht na dtrí bliana roimhe sin.  Is mar seo a leanas atá na príomhshuimeanna i Meastachán na bliana reatha:&mdash; £275,000 le haghaidh scéimeanna tithíochta&mdash;ardú £49,000 ar ar caitheadh anuraidh; £425,000 le haghaidh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;ardú £200,000 ar ar caitheadh anuraidh; £255,000 le haghaidh scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha &mdash;ardú £45,000 ar ar caitheadh anuraidh; £107,000 le haghaidh eagras áirithe Gaeilge&mdash;ardú £17,000 ar ar tugadh dóibh anuraidh; £130,000 do Ghaeltarra Éireann le haghaidh na ndeontas a íoctar chun mórthionscadail agus mionthionscadail a chur chun cinn&mdash;ardú £73,000 ar ar tugadh don Bhord anuraidh, agus £120,000 do Ghaeltarra le haghaidh caiteachais reatha&mdash;laghdú £123,000 ar ar tugadh don Bhord anuraidh: is amhlaidh atáimid ag súil le feabhas mór ar chursaí airgeadais Ghaeltarra feasta. Tá glanmhéadú de bhreis ar cheathrú milliúin punt sna suimeanna sin atá luaite agam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le trí bliana go leith anuas&mdash;is é sin sa tréimhse ó Aibreán, 1965, go dtí Meán Fómhair, 1968&mdash;tá breis agus dhá mhilliún punt caite ag an Roinn <Col N="1306" /> ar dheontais chun leasa don Ghaeltacht. Níl an £800,000 a íocadh le Gaeltarra mar dheontais-i-gcabhair san áireamh ansin.  Níl san áireamh ach oiread an £260,000 a tugadh d'eagrais Ghaeilge ná an £150,000 a íocadh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn trí thréimhseacháin agus trí ghearrscannáin. B'fhéidir nár mhiste tagairt a dhéanamh do na príomhscéimeanna faoinar tugadh na deontais ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht sa tréimhse atá i gceist agam.  Íocadh £800,000 faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht); ar na hoibreacha a críochnaíodh bhí: tithe nua&mdash;621, tithe feabhsaithe&mdash;1,038, soláthar uisce&mdash;1,180, saoráidí séarachais&mdash;1,083, seomraí folcaidh&mdash;1,020, méaduithe speisialta do chuairteoirí&mdash; 198, seallaí saoire&mdash;66 agus brúnna&mdash;4. Íocadh £740,000 faoi scéimeanna feabhsúcháin agus san iomlán sin bhí £230,000 a caitheadh ar bhóithre, £182,000 ar mhuiroibreacha, £65,000 ar scéimeanna poiblí uisce agus séarachais, £137,000 ar scéimeanna talmhaíochta, £30,000 ar choláistí Gaeilge agus £23,000 ar hallaí; ar na hoibreacha a críochnaíodh bhí: bóithre&mdash; 340, muiroibreacha&mdash;60, foirgnimh feirme&mdash;3,427 agus feabhsú talún&mdash; 8,000.  Íocadh £540,000 faoi scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha; bhain £308,000 de sin leis an Deontas £10 agus íocadh £166,000 eile mar chabhair chun daltaí a chur chun na Gaeltachta ar feadh tréimhse saoire nó téarma scoile.</P>
    <P>Is léiriú na figiúirí sin uile go bhfuil suimeanna maithe airgid á gcaitheamh ar na scéimeanna éagsúla&mdash;a bhfuil sonraí ina dtaobh ar fáil i Leabhrán Eolais na Roinne&mdash;agus is féidir a dhearbhú dá réir go bhfuil feabhas nach beag ag teacht ar chor eacnamaíoch, sóisialach agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta.  Caithfimid a thuiscint i gcónaí, áfach, go bhfuil slánú na Gaeltachta ag brath cuid mhór ar leathnú na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre i gcoitinne agus is chuige sin atá roinnt airgid á chaitheamh ag an Roinn lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom toradh fónta a bheith ag teacht ar an gcúnamh airgid atá á thabhairt againn do Ghaeltarra Éireann agus ar na cumhachtaí breise a tugadh don Bhord cúpla bliain ó shin.  Bhí 755 fhostaí lánaimseartha <Col N="1307" /> agus 823 fhostaí páirtaimseartha ag Gaeltarra ar 31 Márta, 1968, agus chuaigh iomlán na dtuarastal agus an phá don bhliain a chríochnaigh ar an dáta sin go £434,000.  Lean na díolacháin de bheith ag méadú agus shroich siad £905,000 sa bhliain sin. Bhí suas le 50 post breise curtha ar fáil de thoradh Scéim na Miontionscadal faoinar íocadh deontais suas go £2,000 in 14 chás agus bhíothas ag súil le fostaíocht do bhreis agus 50 oibrí eile i gcásanna ina raibh deontais ceadaithe.  Faoi mar is eol don Dáil, tá an uasteorainn do na deontais sin ardaithe go £5,000 ó shin.  Deontais a thugann Gaeltarra do dhaoine gan dul i bpáirtíocht leo atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na mórthionscadail ina nglacann Gaeltarra páirt i gcomhar le daoine eile, fógraíodh na cásanna seo a leanas: Ambler of Donegal Ltd., comhlacht atá ag sníomh sainsnáthanna i nGaoth Dobhair don tionscal fíodóireachta agus atá ag cur leis an spás monarchan cheana féin; Connemarble Ltd., comhlacht atá ag próiseáil marmar Chonamara in aice leis an Spidéal; Westsea Ltd., comhlacht atá ag stóráil gliomach agus ag próiseáil portán i Ros an Mhíl agus atá ag iascaireacht chomh maith, agus Óstáin na hÉireann Teo, comhlacht atá ag reachtáil óstáin nua in aice leis an Daingean. Meastar go mbeidh fostaíocht do suas le 200 fear agus 100 cailín sna tionscail sin.  Tá cainteanna ar siúl san am i láthair le tionsclaithe eile agus, bíodh go bhfuil an-dóchas go dtiocfaidh toradh sásúil ar chuid acu go luath, ní thig liom eolas ina dtaobh a scaoileadh go fóill.  Níl aon amhras orm ná go n-éireoidh le Gaeltarra gan ró-mhoill fostaíocht shochrach a chur ar fáil do roinnt mhór daoine sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom go bhfuil cuid mhaith forbartha ar siúl fosta ag Arramara Teoranta, comhlacht ina bhfuil formhór na scaireanna agam. Ní amháin go bhfuil siad tar éis an mhonarcha atá acu i gCill Chiaráin, Conamara, a leathnú ach tá monarcha nua tógtha acu in aice le hAilt an Chorráin i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Dá thoradh sin méadófar an fhostaíocht d'fhir sa dá mhonarcha ó 40 go dtí 50. <Col N="1308" /> Méadófar dá réir na híocaíochtaí le bailitheoirí na feamainne agus na slata mara a cheannaíonn Arramara chun min a tháirgeadh lena cur thar lear.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Dáil, tá an tAire Rialtais Áitiúil tar éis a iarraidh ar na húdaráis áitiúla lena mbaineann an scéal aird speisialta a thabhairt ina gcuid clár pleanála agus forbartha do chothú leas na limistéar Gaeltachta agus páirtphleananna forlíontacha a chur á n-ullmhú do na limistéir sin amháin.  Ag an am céanna mheabhraigh sé do na húdaráis gurb é atá ag teastáil sa Ghaeltacht ná go ngríosófaí agus go n-éascófaí forbairt oiriúnach den uile chineál.  Mar chabhair chuige sin tá staidéir phleanála ar siúl do na limistéir Ghaeltachta faoi scáth An Foras Forbartha.  Sna staidéir seo tabharfar aird ar thábhacht chaomhnaithe agus leathnaithe na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra agus scrúdófar tosca daonracha, cultúrtha, sóisialacha agus eacnamaíocha.  Beimid ag súil le moltaí fiúntacha a chuideoidh le forbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé de bhua ag an nGaeltacht gur inti atá cuid de na háiteanna is breátha agus de na radharcanna is áille sa tír.  Tig linn a bheith cinnte, mar sin, go rachaidh líon na gcuairteoirí ar na ceantair sin i méid feasta ó bhliain go bliain.  Caithfidh an Ghaeltacht bheith ag ullmhú agus ag réiteach do na cuairteoirí sin.  Ag an am céanna ní foláir féachaint chuige nach millfear an Ghaeltacht le cuairteoirí ná le cineál cuartaíochta nach dtugann aird mar is cuí ar an nGaeilge.  Sin é an fáth a gcuirimid de choinníoll leis na deontais fhorlíontacha d'óstáin Ghaeltachta go socrófar, a mhéad is féidir, gur daoine le Gaeilge a fhostófar, gur i nGaeilge a dhéanfar gnóthaí reachtála agus poiblíochta agus go dtabharfar tosaíocht do cheol, siamsaí agus déantúis na Gaeltachta.  Tá coinníoll na Gaeilge ag dul, le fada anall. leis na deontais faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Tá an coinníoll sin fosta i scéim a thugamar isteach i mbliana&mdash; Scéim na Saoráidí Saoire faoina dtugaimid deontais chun seomraí do chuairteoirí a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge a chóiriú, a fheistiú agus a throscánú chun dealramh na dtithe ón taobh amuigh a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> Aithnímid, ar ndóigh, gur ceart na hiarrachtaí a dtacóidh an Stát leo a chuimsiú go háirithe ar dhaoine a bhfuil fonn orthu an Ghaeilge a labhairt a tharraingt chun na Gaeltachta. Táimíd ag brath ar chomhoibriú na nGaeilgeoirí&mdash;agus na n-eagras Gaeilge go háirithe&mdash;chun féachaint chuige gur cuairteoirí a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge a rachaidh isteach in óstáin, i dtithe aíochta agus i dtithe cuartaíochta uile na Gaeltachta.  Má líonann na Gaeilgeoirí gach seomra dá bhfuil ann&mdash;agus tá súil agam nach fada go líonfaidh&mdash;ní gá aon imní a bheith orainn i dtaobh tionchar na mBéarlóirí.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta, Gaeltarra Éireann agus Arramara Teoranta gléasta go maith anois chun leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus cabhrú le caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra.  Dá thábhachtaí an fhostaíocht shocradh, áfach, ní leor í chun an Ghaeltacht a shlánú mar Ghaeltacht sa chiall atá agamsa leis sin&mdash;daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge. Creidim go bhfuil an slánú i ndán don Ghaeltacht má leantar den obair le díograis.  Ach ní hé díograis an Rialtais amháin atá i gceist agam: caithfidh gach aon duine, laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, ar mór aige an Ghaeilge a chion féin a dhéanamh chun í a chur agus a choinneáil á labhairt.  Ní féidir bheith ag súil go mbeidh fonn ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta cloí leis an Ghaeilge mura léir dóibh go bhfuil na daoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht dáiríre i dtaobh athbheochan na teanga.  Dá bhrí sin ba maith liom, mar fhocal scoir, a iarraidh ar gach duine dár gcine a bhfuil bá aige leis an teanga iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur san áit is dual di mar theanga labhartha in Éirinn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> I have been caught on the hop and I have not prepared anything for this debate so I should like to say a few words only.  The effort being made to save the Irish language is praiseworthy up to a point.  It should be clear to everyone by now that the job of restoring the Irish language as the spoken language of the country will be a gigantic one.  Indeed it is difficult to say whether we can hope for success in that field.  Our efforts should be concentrated on keeping the language alive especially in the areas where it is spoken.  It is our national heritage and without our national language we could not lay claim to being a nation.  With that in mind every effort should be made at least to maintain the language in the areas where it is spoken.</P>
    <P>I see a tremendous difficulty in this. I travelled through the Gaeltacht areas in the past couple of years.  Indeed, I have visited every one of them.  I can see the difficulty of maintaining the language at its existing level as the spoken language.  For instance, in Connemara where I spent a month I came across children out on the road with donkeys.  They were nicely dressed, and well dressed.  Foreigners came along and put the children up on the donkeys and took their photographs.  The children had to know English.  I listened to them and they were speaking English although Irish was the language of their home.  This is an economic problem or, at least, part of the difficulty is an economic problem.  The parents send those children out to earn money and they must know English for that.</P>
    <P>I went into a premises in Carna and I was surprised to hear English being spoken.  One man was on his own and I asked him: &ldquo;An mbeidh pionta agat?&rdquo; He understood that all right.  I asked him why he was speaking English. He told me he was brought up in a home in which Irish was the spoken language.  He was a fisherman by occupation but this was seasonal work, and during parts of the year he had to go to England or Scotland, and for that reason he had to learn English.  These are the problems we are up against and which we will have to resolve in some way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> In north Connemara I found very little of the Irish language.  I found the same in west Connemara.  I found that it was dying out in Roundstone.  I know there are people here who know more about this than I do, but I am telling it to the House as I found it. The difficulty appears to be an economic one.  It will be difficult to arrest that trend.  I am glad to say that in official quarters and in offices and hotels, and here and there where people meet, the Irish language is spoken to people who understand it.  If people who have knowledge of the language do not speak it, it is very difficult to expect others to do so.</P>
    <P>I am outside the Gaelthacht areas but I know that in them assistance is being given in an effort to place the people in an economic position so that they can maintain their own language. I am not sure if it is sufficient but every effort should be made in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word about the Gaeltacht.  I see an immense danger at present developing and it is the unorganised purchase of land all along our western seaboard.  I want to suggest to the Government that they should buy all the land which lies between the coast roads in the Gaeltacht and the sea, and stop on fair and equitable terms promiscuous development of a most undesirable kind of the land which lies between the coast roads and the sea.  Justice must be done to the people who own the land.  It has increased in value fantastically.  I remember the time when you could buy it for a £1 an acre.  Recently you could buy it for £4 an acre.  Now it is being sold at £100 a rood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a situation is allowed to continue in which any Robin Run-the-Hedge from any part of Europe can buy the plots of land between the coast roads and the sea, the whole Gaeltacht will be turned into a Costa del Sol slum, and anyone who has seen what Torremolinos has become in the past few years will not wish to see a similar fate overtaking the Gaeltacht for which the Minister is responsible.  Everyone lets this thing drift on until it becomes too <Col N="1312" /> late to take effective measures.  What I am suggesting is useful, desirable and necessary and should be done forthwith if we seriously believe in the preservation in the Gaeltacht of an atmosphere, a way of life, and a whole approach, which give us some hope for its survival as a unique cultural asset to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem arose in relation to intoxicating liquor legislation and not from the registration and grading system operated by Bord Fáilte. As I explained to the Deputy in reply to his question on this subject on 11th July, 1968, it is not possible to set aside registration regulations made under the Tourist Traffic Acts for the purpose of permitting the guesthouses involved to renew their licences.  These regulations specify certain criteria for registration with Bord Fáilte and they must be applied in accordance with objective standards to all premises. Any action in relation to the guesthouses in question would require an amendment of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts and would, accordingly, be a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>The company installations at Bantry Bay referred to by the Deputy do not fall within the limits of authority of any statutory harbour authority.  Harbour dues are not, therefore, payable and this was a factor in the company's decision to locate their operations at Bantry Bay.  On the other hand, the company are providing for themselves all the facilities which would normally be supplied by a harbour authority.  The company will, of course, be a substantial payer of rates to the Cork County Council.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not lucky to have an excuse?  It is five years since this matter was first aired in this House and consistently, every three months or thereabouts, it has been aired since. We are the only country in Western Europe that has not some bookvending machines outside post office premises.  If, as alleged, the machine is proving satisfactory, why does it so often bear the notice that it is out of order?  It is more often marked &ldquo;Out of Order&rdquo; and unable to dispense stamps than it is available to dispense stamps for the public who want to use it.</P>

      <P>The ICMSA case for an increase in the price of milk, which was recommended by the National Agricultural Council, is being considered by the Government and their decision will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion in one of the Questions that there has been a severe reduction in the income of dairy farmers in the creamery areas this year, I would point out that it is estimated that, after allowing for cost increases and without taking account of the higher value of calves, the income of creamery suppliers from milk this year will be about £2 million higher than it was in 1967.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that the dairy farmers in creamery areas have suffered a very substantial reduction in income this year by reason of the reduction in the price of skim milk and the increased Bord Bainne levy?  If and when the increase in milk price is given, can the Parliamentary Secretary say that it will be given retrospective to June last?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1968 Estimate allows for the increase of the Bord Bainne levy as from 1st July last and, allowing for increased costs on the farm&mdash;fertilisers, rates, and so on&mdash; it is estimated that the net income for creamery milk this year will be £2 million higher than it was in 1967.

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention about unrest in the farming industry, which has had two of the best years ever in 1967 and 1968.</P>
      <P>While it is true that, as in other industries, production costs in agriculture have increased appreciably, these increases have been more than offset by the very substantial rise in the value of agricultural output, and, even allowing for higher costs, family farm income in 1968 will be considerably above the 1967 level.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister if in fact he did not personally receive complaints last Wednesday at one of the polling stations in Ballyfermot concerning people who fall into the category I described here&mdash;people whose names had been previously listed as voters and who for some inexplicable reason did not appear on the voters' lists at all, though they had long residence in that area.  Has he not had observations from his own Party <Col N="1339" /> in respect of other parts of the city? In one case in Ballyfermot, there were 12 members of a religious community, who have been there for years, who were not on the list.  In the light of that, does he not agree it is high time that this matter of the compilation of the register was tackled properly and that the present haphazard system, which has been found by members of all Parties to be unsatisfactory, should be dealt with and put on a proper basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that at every election people are discovered not to be on the register who should be on it.  Occasionally we have cases of people, who have been on the register for some time, inexplicably left out.  The registration authorities are pressed by my Department to exercise care in the compilation of the register. In addition, every possible means is taken to bring to the notice of the public generally, at the appropriate time, the fact that the draft register has been compiled and the desirability of inspecting it to make sure they are entitled to vote.  In addition, public representatives are exhorted to co-operate in this.  I think everything possible is being done.  In so far as Dublin County Council are concerned, they have set up a special franchise section, employing special staff, to take over from the rate collectors the work of compiling the register.  I appreciate that, despite all these things, these inexplicable mistakes occur but, as I have said, all possible steps are taken to ensure they will not occur.  People are advised at the appropriate time to inspect the register to ensure their names are on it.</P>

Is it not obvious that we should do something to modernise the system.  Might I suggest to the Minister that the example set by Dublin County Council be recommended to Dublin Corporation and possibly to all other public <Col N="1340" /> bodies throughout the country, to try to secure a greater degree of accuracy in the listing of names.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the county registrar in Laois on Polling Day, 16th October last, received a communication from the Custom House, from the Minister's Department, that an officer spoke to him saying he was transmitting by telephone the Minister's express instruction to the effect that an esteemed member of the staff in Portlaoise, William Davis, was not to be employed on the counting staff the following day.

These objections were conveyed to the returning officer. The returning officer decided himself that he would not employ this man on the count on this occasion and asked that a letter setting out the objections be sent to him.  A letter was sent to him setting out the objections.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether, having regard to serious inconvenience to householders, tenants and the general public and obstruction of the public highway, with potential serious risk in the event of the obstruction of fire brigades or ambulances, arising from the refusal of landlords to permit tenants to park their motor cars in the gardens of their houses, he will introduce legislation to amend the law so that, subject to the approval of a local planning authority, tenants may so park their cars irrespective of the landlord's refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 57 and 58 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, provide, generally speaking, that a landlord may not unreasonably withhold his consent to the tenant's making minor improvements to, or his changing the user of, leasehold premises.  Section 29 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, enables a leasehold tenant to do these things without the consent of the landlord so long as he has complied with planning requirements.  These provisions enable many leaseholders to adapt gardens for car-parking.  As the Deputy is aware the Landlord and Tenant Commission are examining the whole law of landlord and tenant and I understand that the question of extending the rights referred to here is being specifically dealt with by the Commission.  When I have the Commission's Report on the <Col N="1351" /> subject I shall consider the necessity for amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, it must be shown that the landlord is withholding permission.  Then they are under the obligation of going into court.  These people are people of limited means, certainly not the kind who would embark on litigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that in very many cases where this question of the landlord's consent is involved it has to end up in court. The Deputy also, I am sure, is well aware that the trend of the decisions in the courts down through the years has been to lean in favour of tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice what steps he is taking or proposes to take to assist the holders of intoxicating liquor licences granted under paragraph 2 of section 2 of the Licensing Act, 1902 who are now impeded by the provisions of section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, was designed to give substantive effect to a recommendation of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission to the effect that the special privilege afforded to hotels to get liquor licences should in future be reserved to premises satisfying the Bord Fáilte standards for registration as hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question is applicable only to a small minority of guesthouses &mdash;less than 20 of the existing 500 registered premises&mdash;which, since 1960, obtained licences as hotels even though the law was quite clear and explicit that <Col N="1352" /> these licences could not be renewed.</P>
    <P>While I have every sympathy with the people concerned, I can see no possible justification for giving them preferential treatment as compared with the many other guesthouse owners who had exactly the same right to apply for a licence but who were deterred from doing so by the clear provisions of section 20.</P>
    <P>Neither would I be prepared to sponsor legislation which would extend to all owners of guesthouses with ten bedrooms the right to a licence.  This is precisely what the Commission objected to.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that guesthouses, as such, have no obligation to provide any service, such as a meals service, to the public-at-large and there is no possible reason for putting them in a privileged position as compared with restaurant-owners, for example.  Some of the guesthouses, of course, do in fact provide an excellent meals-service, but this does not arise out of their obligations as guesthouse owners.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that if the law is to be changed, some more appropriate criterion than whether a premises is a guesthouse will have to be sought.  Needless to say, any change that might be made would need to be very carefully considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that he is talking nonsense about this whole question.  Is the Minister not aware that there was a Supreme Court decision in April of this year that gives these people the right, whether they got the licence after 1960 or before 1960, to get an ordinary publican's licence and have it transferred at the district court without notice to anybody?  Is the Minister going to insist pursuant to that judgment that these people will have to buy a licence?  Is the Minister not aware of that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned with here is not any High Court decision but section 20 of this particular Act, the Intoxicating Liquor Act (No. 15 of 1960) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for a certificate for the renewal of a licence in respect of which effect was given to <Col N="1353" /> subsection (1) of section 42 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, or which was granted after the passing of this Act by virtue of paragraph (2) of section 2 of the Act of 1902 shall not be granted unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court hearing the application for the grant of the certificate that the hotel is registered in the register of hotels kept by Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
    <P>That Act was enacted by Dáil Éireann as a result of the unanimous recommendation of an independent commission set up to deal with all these matters.  What the Deputy in effect is asking me to do is to repeal that section.  That I am not prepared to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1354" /> for Justice the result of the police inquiry arising from a recent High Court action (details supplied) in the course of which planning permission played a prominent part; when the inquiry was decided; and the steps now proposed to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegations in this case were brought to the attention of the Garda authorities on 11th March, 1968 by the Chief State Solicitor on the direction of the Attorney General at the request of the Department of Local Government of that date.</P>
      <P>A detective superintendent of the Garda Síochána examined the relevant court documents, including the statement of claim and the defence, together with all supplementary statements.  He interviewed all the persons who were involved in any way in the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what was suggested in this House, these court documents contain no suggestion that the defendant alleged that improper influence was ever in fact used or attempted. What they show is that the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had held himself out as being able to use such influence.  Even that appears only as an allegation, and the documents contain no evidence in support of it.  The plaintiff, for his part, did not, as suggested in this House, claim that he had in fact used such influence and demand payment on that basis.  His claim was that he had assisted in the making of the case for the appeal.  Both the context in which this appears and other documents go to show that this reference by the plaintiff was a reference to legitimate assistance and there was no admission whatsoever of impropriety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the other investigations carried out by the detective superintendent, the position is that all the people concerned in the civil action refused, for one reason or another, to make statements, and of course they cannot be compelled to do so.  For completeness, may I add that Deputy L'Estrange, who made allegations in this House, was also interviewed by the detective superintendent who reported that the Deputy said that anything he had to say was said in the Dáil and <Col N="1355" /> that he was making no further statement.</P>
    <P>The Garda inquiries lasted from 12th March to 8th April and the results were communicated to the Attorney General on 11th April.  The Attorney General's decision was that there was no evidence on which to base a charge against any person.</P>
    <P>If the allegations finally made in the amended defence filed in this case are true I deplore the sordid transaction to which directors of this company were a party whereby they thought they could secure their objectives by improper means.</P>
    <P>I may say that the Government have given specific consideration to the question of the establishment of a Tribunal of Enquiry under the Tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, but have been advised by the Attorney General that witnesses could not be compelled to give evidence incriminating themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister serious in saying that there is nothing in the pleadings of this case that did not clearly indicate that planning permission was obtained as a result of moneys paid and further moneys promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I say that in amended evidence filed by the defendants in this case if this allegation was made it was made by one side and denied by the other.  This case was struck out.  It was settled by Order here, but no Order was made, on the 7th March, the date on which Deputy L'Estrange raised the matter in this House and quoted here from the pleadings.  The matter was first mentioned in this House and the first intimation the House got of it was when Deputy L'Estrange mentioned it on the 7th March and made certain allegations here.  That was the day evidently on which the case was settled. Immediately then the matter was put in the hands of the Garda the result of which investigation I have given to the House now.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has the pleadings, and I take it the Minister <Col N="1356" /> has had a look at the pleadings in this case with the assistance of the Attorney General, does he not know that it was a claim made for a specific sum on foot of cheques, the payment of which had been stopped because the planning permission came before the date of the payment of the cheques, and the defendants very properly thought they had given enough to the plaintiff for whatever information he as a Donegal man had for the then Minister for Local Government, another Donegal man.</P>

Is it not further suspicious that the plaintiff is a Donegal man, that the then Minister for Local Government was a Donegal man, and that when the allegation was made by Deputy <Col N="1357" /> L'Estrange it was promised that the then Minister for Local Government would come in and defend it but he never came in here.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the arrangements for the operation of the helicopter ambulance service, which was established at the request of the Department of Health, the local Health Authority concerned in each case is responsible for the payment of the appropriate charges arising from the provision of a helicopter to convey a sick or injured person to hospital, provided that the request for the helicopter was approved by the Authority. Accordingly, where requests for the conveyance by helicopter of sick or injured lighthouse personnel are approved by the Health Authorities concerned these authorities bear the charges involved.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights were advised of this position in February, 1966.</P>
      <P>Health Authorities have an obligation to approve medical services for these personnel equally with other citizens who are entitled to such services in accordance with the Health Acts, and the cost of conveying them by the helicopter ambulance service when they are sick or injured would not be a proper charge on the Vote for Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>We act as agents in this service and the service is paid for on a certain basis.  The helicopter is asked for by the local authorities if they wish to move sick people and it is on that basis that this service is <Col N="1360" /> provided.

      <P>Is the Minister not just seeking refuge behind statutory rules and regulations?  Is the position not that in the first case in which payment was demanded from the Commissioners of Irish Lights and paid for the reason was that they were not aware of the fact that they could escape payment by transferring the responsibility to local health authorities?  In fact, it does not matter who orders the helicopter the service is one that I think the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the lighthouse personnel have every reason to expect the Department of Defence and the Irish nation to render for nothing for the personnel who lead very lonely and difficult lives on lightships and islands off our coasts.</P>

      <P>The taxpayer is being salted.  The simple truth is that the real cost is negligible because the Defence personnel are being paid anyway and the helicopter is also in existence.  The only additional actual cost involved is that of the petrol consumed between the time the helicopter leaves the aerodrome and the time it gets back.

Is the Minister aware that there are many pensioners and eligible people in urban areas who live in flats in which electricity is supplied through coin meters? The meters in question are registered in the name of the landlord and because of that simple fact those people cannot benefit at all under the existing regulations.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that children in the Balbriggan area of County Dublin are being refused free transport to the secondary school in Skerries traditionally attended by children from this area; and if he will have the necessary free transport provided to enable those children to continue to attend the school in Skerries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the free transport scheme is to make post-primary education available to children who hitherto were denied it because they lived too far away from the nearest post-primary school.  The scheme is, therefore, limited to the transport of children who live three miles or more from the nearest school providing free post-primary education. As such free education is available in the two Balbriggan post-primary schools, no pupil living in the town or within three miles of it is entitled to free transport.  There could be no question of departing from this generral principle in any individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we now have a situation in Balbriggan in which one child who had previously been going to the school at Skerries is getting free transport to Skerries and a brother who has come along now and wants to go to Skerries is debarred from doing so because he will not get free transport as he is a new student in Skerries even though traditionally these children would go to Skerries?  Is this not compulsory vocational education for families who do not want to pursue a course of vocational education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the fact that this discrepancy arises between members of the same family is due to an attempt to assist the children by the Department of Education, because some children had already commenced school at Skerries and so as not to interrupt the continuity of their education and also because at one stage the vocational school in Balbriggan had not got a full intermediate course.  For this reason children were allowed to avail of the scheme to go to Skerries but now that a full intermediate course is available those who would be commencing their education cannot expect to be treated on a more favourable basis than any others in other parts of the country under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be so but, if it is so, it is due to a misconception on their part as to the value of the education available to them now.  This will probably sort itself out in time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is aware that a special arrangement was introduced in September, 1967, whereby school managers were authorised to have urgently required improvements &mdash;including, where necessary, improved heating facilities&mdash;carried out at schools.</P>
      <P>In very many instances managers proceeded&mdash;as it was intended they should&mdash;with arrangements for improving their schools without giving prior notice to the Department, and claims for grants are coming along only as the schemes are completed.  I am aware that, in other cases, arrangements are in train to provide heating of a suitable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> Inspectors of my Department, in the course of their normal visits to the schools, take note of instances in which the standard of heating, or of other amenities, is unsuitable and, besides reporting the deficiencies to the Department, they bring them to the notice of the manager, where necessary, with a view to having them put right.  Pending receipt of claims for grants and returns from the inspectors, it is not possible to state the number of cases in which schemes of improvement still need to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the steps which have already been taken and the consultations which have taken place with the Catholic Clerical Managers will result in a position in which all schools will be brought up to a satisfactory standard in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The building of larger school units and the closing of small and unsuitable schools has contributed much towards the solution of the problem.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not reconsider this matter because quite a number of people are affected many of whom, if they were not in receipt of a British contributory pension would, in fact, qualify for a non-contributory pension in this country? It has now become a question of whether it would pay them better to refuse to accept the British pension and apply for a non-contributory pension here.  In order to prevent that happening, the Minister should further consider it.</P>

      <P>The free electricity scheme is administered on a selective basis.  It was introduced originally for <Col N="1373" /> lonely pensioners who had no support other than the pension.  Later it was extended to those who had one member of the family taking care of them if they were invalids.  It is different from the free travel scheme which applies to all pensioners and is not operated on a selective basis.  Many British pensioners are already in receipt of a part non-contributory pension here and they are eligible.  I would not be able to say what number might qualify of those who are living alone.  I do not think it would amount to very many, but it would cover that category of persons who might be living alone and who would not be in poor circumstances but might be comparatively well-off.</P>

      <P>We are inclined to think of those who return here from working in England.  The Deputy must remember that there are quite a number living here who do not come under that category.  In fact, some 2,200 of these people who have returned here and who have a British pension are getting part Irish non-contributory pension too and, if otherwise qualified, are eligible for the free electricity.  This scheme could take in quite a number of people. I will have the matter examined further and will be able to give further information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that unemployment benefit is being withheld from a person (name supplied) in <Col N="1374" /> Donegal because of the operation of the Unemployment Benefit (Contributory and Additional Conditions) Regulations, 1966; and if in view of the dissatisfaction experienced by persons excluded from benefit by these regulations he will re-examine the entire position with a view to introducing regulations which will liberalise the conditions on which benefit may be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on this subject earlier this year, women employed in private domestic employment were always excluded from cover for unemployment benefit up to 1966 for the reason that, since there was practically no unemployment amongst private domestics, it was considered to be unnecessary and unfair to seek contributions from such women for unemployment insurance when few could qualify for unemployment benefit. When the question of extending insurance cover for unemployment benefit to female private domestics was revised in 1965 it was found that the absence of such cover was a hardship in the case of older private domestic workers of long service.  Such persons, once they became unemployed, could find it difficult, for age and other reasons, to obtain further suitable employment. Accordingly, provision was made by legislation and relevant regulations for the extension, as from 31st October, 1966, of cover for unemployment benefit to female private domestics at a special reduced rate of contribution. Title to payment of benefit was limited to women who had a substantial record of employment as evidenced by the contributions paid over a ten-year period.  Female domestics of 65 years and over are not, however, subject to this test and they, therefore, can qualify for unemployment benefit in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>As I said before, the 1966 legislation constitutes a considerable advance on the previous position by giving cover for unemployment benefit to those older domestics who are most likely to need it, in return for a modest increase in the contribution rate and I do not propose to alter the existing position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister remembers that the farm workers were in the same category until it was realised that they were not secondclass citizens and they were included the same as everybody else?  Is he aware that there are numerous cases of domestics who, despite what he said about full employment, have over the years been working when they could get work and unemployed when they could not and because of the fact that no benefits were attached were not signing at the labour exchange and that the average of stamps that these people have over a period of 20 years may not qualify them for any benefit? Would the Minister have another look at this?  This is a matter that should not be done by half.  The Government have created a selective group who would be entitled and the remainder are left out.  That is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully and I have had question and answer on this in the House several times.  I cannot at all agree with him in his allegation that this operates unfairly towards the younger domestics.  Indeed, the records do not show that a big number of them are victimised&mdash;few if any. Fortunately, there is good demand and competition in the market for this type of employment and they can command very good conditions.  They can pick and choose nowadays.  They get considerably improved wages on what they used to command not so many years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the idea of getting cheap labour for housework is still in the back of some people's minds.  Possibly, the Minister is not aware that I received a reply from his Department today in regard to a domestic who for over 15 years had only an average of 24 stamps and is, therefore, ineligible for benefit even though she worked every time she could get work.  If I send the particulars to the Minister, will he have the matter looked into?</P>

Details of any offshore oil or gas exploration facilities granted in the future will be set out in my half-yearly reports to the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government is to secure the most thorough and efficient exploration and development of the natural resources of the continental shelf by providing, as in the land area, attractive facilities to private enterprise concerns, Irish and foreign, having the necessary financial resources and technical expertise.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say approximately what area he includes in the licence area for the continental shelf?  What size is the licence area he is granting compared to the land one?</P>

      <P>That question is a little complicated to answer because, as I mentioned, there are three applications under consideration at the moment. One is from a company which claim certain rights pre-existing on the continental shelf and the licence which will be granted to them will be the result of negotiations which have taken place with them, and the licence which will be granted in other cases will relate to the conclusion of these negotiations. I do not know if I make myself clear.  The matter is rather complicated. The Deputy might ask me that question again when I may be in a better position to answer it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state for the year 1967 how many (a) major operations and (b) minor operations were performed at each of the county hospitals listed on page 135 of the Report of the Consultative Council on General Hospital Services; how many out-patients were seen; and how many people were X-rayed at each county hospital.</P>

      <P>As the reply to this question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As information concerning the number of operations performed is not readily available, the statement contains instead the number of surgical patients treated during 1967 in each of the hospitals concerned.  The particulars concerning persons X-rayed relates to the year 1966, as this information is not readily available for 1967.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, having regard <Col N="1385" /> to the number of autistic children from the midlands who are on the list for admission, he will make inquiries as to when children from outside Dublin will be admitted to Saint Loman's Hospital; and when likely vacancies will exist in respect of the applications from County Offaly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Admissions to the Children's Unit at St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, have been restricted for some time past to children from the Dublin area, and children from County Offaly and from other areas outside Dublin are accordingly not on the list for admission to the unit.  I have been concerned for some time about the need to provide a further unit, or units.  A new unit for mentally ill children, including autistic children, is now being built in Dublin, and should be ready next year.  Children from outside Dublin will be admitted there.  Further residential accommodation for such children will also be provided in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that there is a difference between autistic children and mentally deficient children, may I ask the Minister if it is advisable that when a child is assessed as autistic a reservation should be made right away so that when the additional accommodation is available next year there will not be any doubt about the admission?  To whom is application made?</P>

      <P>When I concluded on this Estimate before questions I was urging on the Minister the necessity for protecting the area of land which lies between the shore road and the sea throughout Gaeltacht areas, if necessary by acquisition on the equitable terms to the present owners of leaving it open to the Department of Lands <Col N="1389" /> to lease or let the land back to the original owners for agricultural use but primarily to ensure that the amenities of the whole area will not be irretrievably destroyed by the acquisition of this land in small parcels by persons at home and abroad coming here and building all sorts of structures between the road and the sea, as many of the scenic roads in Gaeltacht areas closely adjoin the seashore.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht is, of course, primarily concerned with the preservation of the Gaeltacht as we knew it 40 years ago.  It is the source of the language and the living spring without which the language must necessarily die.  I have watched in my life-time the diminution of that spring.  I remember in Donegal when I first went there as a student to the College at Cloughaneely Irish was the vernacular language from Falcarragh all round the west and from there down to the Rosses and Dungloe.  The area of the Gaeltacht in that district where Irish is the vernacular has fallen back by about 20 miles.  I doubt if it would be true to say that Irish was the vernacular east of Dunlewey and the Rosses today. The House ought to face the fact that while we are improving the tourist amenities of the Gaeltacht on the one hand, we are destroying what we pretend to be concerned to preserve on the other hand, because the arrival of tourists in the Gaeltacht is finally killing the language as a spoken language. That is a dilemma which the Department has to face.  I should be glad to hear the Minister's view about what the Department's attitude to this dilemma is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is a queer thing.  If ever there was a concrete example of the love of money being the root of all evil I cannot help thinking sometimes that tourism is the very personification of that biblical aphorism.  I do not know if Deputies are familiar with the newly-developed tourist areas in Spain as compared with similar areas in Portugal.  The area from Malaga to Gibraltar, the coastal area in Andalusia in Spain had a very special beauty and was preserved in a very special way. Within the last ten years, so short a time as that, that country has practically <Col N="1390" /> disappeared.  There is now substituted for it in that area of Andalusia an international sub-culture of the most revolting character which is spreading like a cancer over an area which to Spain is much what the Gaeltacht is to Ireland.  I compare with that the southern coast of Portugal and for reasons which it is not expedient or necessary to go into this strange rot of tourism has not penetrated there yet and so there survives in the South of Portugal the atmosphere of Portugal, the civilisation of Portugal, but not the money of international tourism.  Some day we will have to ask ourselves&mdash; perhaps it is too late to ask the question now&mdash;are we resolved to sell everything for money.  I can assure the Minister that the Gaeltacht contains an enviable sort of peace, &ldquo;calm and untouched, remote from roar, where weary men may from their burdens cease on a still shore.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is something the international jet set are prepared to pay a lot for now, quite oblivious of the fact that with their arrival the very thing they seek to purchase becomes irredeemably destroyed.  I doubt if when the chips are down the Department of the Gaeltacht will prove strong enough to resist the influence of the love of money but I suggest that one of the steps they might take to protect the Gaeltacht in some measure from the worst variety of exploitation would be to ensure that at least that area immediately adjoining the seashore would be protected from promiscuous exploitation by people who care for nothing but the temporary enjoyment of amenities which they are quite prepared to destroy and then flit elsewhere leaving ruins behind them and perpetrating the same devastation in southern Portugal or some other part of the world as yet untouched by their unclean hands.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what is being done in the Gaeltacht now under the Land Project.  I remember being greatly abused by the former Deputy Bartley when he was the Parliamentary Secretary here at one time because I had charged the Land Project with the task of blasting the rocks in Connemara.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may raise his eyebrows <Col N="1391" /> when I mention the Land Project in the context of the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht but the Department of the Gaeltacht was established&mdash;I was present at its birth; I stood by its cradle&mdash;for the purpose of co-ordinating the activities of all the other State Departments in Gaeltacht areas.  I should like to ask the Minister if that general co-ordinating power remains with his Department?  The original objective was that the activities of local authorities, the Department of Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education and every other Department would be co-ordinated into a joint development scheme which would preserve areas like The Rosses, West Cork, South Kerry and any other areas, which were included in the statutory definition of Gaeltacht for the purpose of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I should like to know if that co-ordinating function still subsists in the Minister's Department and if it does not it ought. I do not know whether the Minister is charged with telling me what the other Departments are doing to assist in the economic and social survival of the Gaeltacht.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us, so that I may know whether I am within the rules of order in querying him.  Does the Minister have any responsibility in that context?</P>

      <P>Is the Land Project still functioning on the special basis provided for in Connemara and in other parts of the Gaeltacht?  When I was Minister for Agriculture first I provided that the people in Connemara would have special terms under the Land Project. Then, when the Department of the Gaeltacht was set up under Deputy Patrick Lindsay, the concession was, I think, extended to the area for which he was responsible as Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The Connemara scheme, in fact, is now extended to the whole Gaeltacht area.  Perhaps the Minister has now discovered, coming, as he does, from Louth, that the removal of rocks from the exiguous quantities of land available in the Gaeltacht areas is not so fantastic an undertaking as Deputy Bartley, who was born and bred in Clifden, seemed to think it was.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister, when he is concluding, how that scheme is now progressing in the Gaeltacht. I am primarily concerned about the coastline and the Minister's attitude to the whole question of which is to prevail, the preservation of the Gaeltacht as the foundation and source of the living language or its exploitation for the &ldquo;divarsion&rdquo; of tourists and others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment very briefly on this Estimate.  It is an Estimate in which Members, particularly members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, must have a very special interest, remembering that it was the <Col N="1393" /> inter-Party Government which took the first practical and positive steps towards saving the Gaeltacht by the setting up of the Department of which the Minister is now the head.  For many years there had been an outcry over the vanishing Gaeltacht.  It was being denuded of its people and the Irish language was slowly dying.  Because of the conditions under which the people were living in the Gaeltacht the inter-Party Government decided, and rightly so, to set up a special Department to deal with the Gaeltacht, appreciating the importance of keeping it alive. They realised the importance of the language, of Irish customs and Irish culture.  They also realised that the people in the Gaeltacht had very special problems, problems widely different from those in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>What positive steps are being taken at the moment to improve the standard of living of the people in the Gaeltacht? Because of the quality of the land and the size of the holdings the special problems in the Gaeltacht call for special attention and special action. The lifeblood of the language is in the Gaeltacht and it would be a great tragedy&mdash;it would be a national calamity&mdash;if the Gaeltacht were allowed to disappear.</P>
    <P>A sum of £107,000 is being provided for Irish language organisations.  My visits to the Gaeltacht have been few and far between.  During the time in which I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture in charge of Fisheries I visited the Gaeltacht. I had the pleasure of visiting a number of areas in the Gaeltacht.  I was impressed by the industry of the people, by their skill, by their general standard of behaviour, by their sincerity, their comradeship and, above all, by their love for their language, their pastimes and their culture.  They are the real Irish.  Emigration by these people to Canada, the United States and Britain spells a considerable loss to the Gaeltacht and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3,000 is being provided for halls and other amenities to make life more attractive and, by making it more attractive, to induce the people <Col N="1394" /> to remain there.  I wonder is this sufficient.  Have those responsible examined into any new schemes which would improve the standard of living of the people in the Gaeltacht and make life there more attractive for them?  Tourists love the Gaeltacht but, from time to time, foreign journalists and others visit the Gaeltacht, perhaps not for the purpose of enjoying a holiday but to compile articles to publish about the Gaeltacht which, in my opinion, have not reflected the true picture of our people in those districts.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Dublin Electricity Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am compelled to raise this matter on the Adjournment by a sense of indignation at the manner in which the ESB have neglected, in the most disgraceful fashion, three households in the area of Forest, Swords, County Dublin, which is situated exactly on the fringe of Dublin Airport and, it might be said, on the land of Dublin Airport.  The position is summarised by a letter which I have received from one of the parties concerned and which I shall read for the convenience of the House in order to set the matter in perspective. Mr. McLoughlin of Forest, Cloughran, Co. Dublin, wrote a letter to me on 22nd October, 1968, as follows:</P>
      <P>I have been going around the ESB offices in the past two years&mdash; the one in Swords, Coolock and Fitzwilliam Street&mdash;as well as writing and speaking to them by phone, but it has come to nothing as they keep on saying that they are waiting for the Minister for Transport and Power to give his consent in writing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I may say that these three people, these three households, have not got electricity for domestic use.  They have no electric light.  The three households are on the grounds of Dublin Airport, at the fringe of the runways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;it has come to nothing as they <Col N="1395" /> keep on saying that they are waiting for the Minister for Transport and Power to give his consent in writing, and still he gave it by phone.</P>
    <P>The blame lies somewhere and in the meanwhile we may put up with the hardships and candle light and pray that our young children won't get burned to death all because of the delay in one man trying to make up his mind.</P>
    <P>There is a simple statement of the position.  I took an interest in this matter in 1966&mdash;two years ago&mdash;at the request of the people concerned.  On that occasion, in December, 1966, I made direct representations to the Secretary of the ESB and pointed out to him the extraordinary situation that here we have Dublin Airport which, as we know, is ablaze with light every night, as is the area immediately surrounding it, and, right beside are three households occupied by ordinary citizens and the ESB were making difficulties about providing for that supply.</P>
    <P>My interest in the case began in 1966.  In December of that year, I had a letter from the ESB to say that they were looking into the matter and would write to me further.  In March, 1967, having heard nothing further, I reminded the Minister of the position by phoning his office.  I also wrote to the Minister's office and, that month, I received a reply signed by the Minister stating that he had asked for a report from the Board&mdash;this was in 1967&mdash;in regard to the cases referred to with a view to ascertaining the position about the supply.  From that, nothing ensued.  On Tuesday, 23rd May, 1967, I asked a Dáil Question on this matter the reply to which read as follows:</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that there are four potential consumers in the townland of Forest, Co. Dublin.</P>
    <P>There were three existing households ready to take supply and there was a prospect of a fourth coming into existence at the time.</P>
    <P>The question of supply to these persons has been under consideration for some time past&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" />&mdash;that was in May 1967.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to determine that an overhead supply to the consumers would not cause interference with airport operations.  It is expected that an acceptable route for a line will be settled very shortly and that the ESB will then be in a position to offer supply.</P>
    <P>In October, 1967, I received a letter, signed on the instruction of the Parliamentary Secretary setting out certain charges which were proposed in respect of supply.  I continued to make representations in an effort to get the job done and, indeed, I was in touch with the ESB's Coolock office in February, 1968, on the matter.  At that time, I was told that an official of the ESB would go to see the parties concerned in regard to the finalisation of the matter.</P>
    <P>I was in touch with the Minister's Private Secretary in regard to this matter in June of this year and I had a letter, dated 23rd July, 1968, signed on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary, again saying that the matter was receiving attention.  There was a letter from the ESB to Mr. McLoughlin on 31st July of this year in the course of which it is said:</P>
    <P>I now have pleasure in quoting new terms, based on the revised Government subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>It sets out what would be required to be paid&mdash;which was acceptable to the people concerned, as they indicated at various stages all along the line.  The letter stated further:</P>
    <P>The extension of supply would still be subject to approval by the Minister for Transport and Power due to the proximity of the Airport.</P>
    <P>In July, 1968, the ESB said they were writing further to Mr. McLoughlin, one of the principal parties concerned in this case.</P>
    <P>The most recent letter I had from the Parliamentary Secretary's office is dated 23rd October, 1968, in the course of which it is said:</P>
    <P>A report in this matter has been received from the Electricity Supply Board.  Following the review by the Government, earlier this year, of the position with regard to high <Col N="1397" /> special service charges, reduced terms for supply were quoted to Mr. McLoughlin and two other householders in Forest.  These terms were accepted by all three householders. Following the acceptance of terms it was necessary for the ESB to get formal approval from this Department for an overhead supply line.  This approval has now been granted and the ESB are at present making arrangements to extend supply to Forest.</P>
    <P>The Board say they take into account wayleave across adjoining land and that this may not be determined before 31st January, 1969.  They add that it may be possible that supply will be extended before Christmas.</P>
    <P>This is an example, a very good instance of the manner in which the ordinary citizen's rights may be destroyed, trampled on, and in which the ordinary citizen may be frustrated by what are nothing less than bureaucracy, laziness and delays.  This is a simple matter of three householders, surrounded on all sides by electricity &mdash;on one side by the Airport, possibly one of the largest centres of ESB consumption in the country.  It is just a few yards away from the houses in which these three families live, who are deprived of the service simply because they are three ordinary citizens who have been put on the long finger, not from week to week or from month to month but from year to year down to the present day, and now it is suggested that it will be next year before they will be given an ordinary supply of lighting for their houses, in which they are using candles or paraffin oil at the moment.</P>
    <P>The thing is a damn disgrace.  I told the people to whom I was talking on the telephone that I would raise it in the House.  This is not an exercise I enjoy.  It is a duty that falls on me because it seems there does exist in these semi-State bodies and in the Civil Service a mentality which says that they are all right, that they make damn certain they are all right.  They are the people who are writing these letters, making these reports.  They are all right during the winter and it does not matter that three unfortunate families, <Col N="1398" /> surrounded on all sides by electric light, cannot have it.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter here because I want to expose this and try to put a stop to this attitude of mind which apparently exists.  I believe it does not exist in every Department or, indeed, in the case of every official, but it does exist in some cases as is made evident and revealed here&mdash;an attitude which seems utterly to disregard the elementary rights of the people.  Just imagine what it means to a housewife with young children living in one of these houses, trying to carry on without the aid of domestic electric lighting, leaving aside altogether the other electric appliances, the normal requisites in any house today for cooking or whatever it might be.  These people rely on candles and oil lamps for domestic lighting, implements of domestic use which have been out of use for almost a half century in even the most remote parts of the country.  Even in some of the remote parts of the country referred to in the debate just adjourned, if such conditions prevail, I am sure tourists would be brought along to be shown cottages with oil lamps in them as an illustration of the ancient romantic Ireland that is dead and gone.  They do not have to go to the west because they can go out to the Airport, a couple of miles beyond Santry, where they will find that situation.</P>
    <P>I want to denounce the people who are responsible.  Whoever they are, wherever they are, whichever Department they are in, they are guilty of absolute disregard of the welfare of the ordinary citizens.  As I have said, I am satisfied that if they themselves found themselves in such a situation they would put up a mighty squeal about it and that they would get results.</P>
    <P>This thing has gone on a long time, even before I became concerned with it during the past two or three years. It went on long before that.  Now they are told they will be guaranteed supply when the winter is over, before 31st January.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me on behalf of these people, so that they will get some hope this winter, that supply will be extended within the next week or fortnight. There is no obstacle except one, which <Col N="1399" /> is conjured up to cause delay.  It is called &ldquo;wayleave&rdquo;.  Many county council members know that council gangers use wayleave.  It is simply a form which is handed to landowners to indicate that the local authority intend to proceed across or through land.</P>
    <P>In this case there is no need for this delay in the matter of wayleaves.  If there is it should be ended.  It should have been ended long ago.  I do not think there is any need for this delay. The matter of wayleave is just an excuse to prolong the agony of these people.  I conclude by asking the Parliamentary Secretary to give us a definite date, within the next couple of weeks at least, and to tell us he will see to it &mdash; and he has the power to see to it&mdash;that the ESB will stop this nonsense and give these people the supply to which they are entitled. If he does I will be satisfied, though the whole business has been a disgrace as, I am sure, the Parliamentary Secretary will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at Deputy Dunne's approach to this.  On the face of it he seems to have made a very good case but, in fact, it is the flattest case I have heard him make for many a long day.  I suppose there is every reason for this simply because he had not a case to make in the first instance.  I have heard him wax eloquent on numerous occasions on behalf of the unfortunate downtrodden in one way or another, but this attack this evening quite appals me.  He quoted from correspondence between my Minister's office, my office and himself during three years, the period during which he has been championing the cause of those three, as he describes them, unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take away from the fact that they are unfortunate in so far as they have not electricity, but Deputy Dunne has not played fair with the House in this matter and certainly not with the Department.  I want to say I very much resent, on behalf of the officials of the Department of Transport and Power and of the ESB <Col N="1400" /> the allegations, the insinuations and the innuendoes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to show up Deputy Dunne who quotes portions from letters.  Up to this year the situation was that, in fact, those three people could not have got electricity supplied to them at a charge which would be payable from their point of view.  The correspondence which took place prior to this year in this particular matter indicated that an inquiry some two years ago terminated in those three people being informed in June of last year of the terms under which they would need to accept the electric current and they were quoted special service charges individually of £6 per house in addition to their normal fixed charge which in two instances was 11/9d and in the other instance 16/-. Those terms quoted to them in June, 1967 were unacceptable to them and certainly unacceptable to Deputy Dunne who was informed at that time and did not come back until earlier this year when I had made an announcement that we were reviewing the special service charges in respect of the ESB supply.  I do not think Deputy Dunne should make such a fuss and talk about the fact that those three people are any different from about 40,000 people in rural Ireland in general who, up to now, have not been in a position to take electricity or who have not been in a position to get electricity in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the situation which had developed a number of people were not in an economic position where they could take electricity.  The Department of Transport and Power, <Col N="1401" /> through the Minister, and the ESB, made arrangements this year for a large-scale cut-down in the special services charges which were debarring people from installing electricity in their homes.  It was arising from this that these three people renewed their applications.  On 6th August this year the new terms which were considerably less than the terms which had formerly been quoted to them were finally accepted by those people.  In the three cases terms of special two-monthly service charges were quoted at the rate of £1 16s per two months in two cases and in the third case £2 6s 8d was quoted.  These terms were below the terms quoted last year and proved attractive to those people and at that stage we had their acceptance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talks about gangers with the Dublin County Council handing out wayleave permission every day of the week.  In this particular instance we, of necessity, need to take 1,100 metres of overhead line, and to provide poles, and to bring the poles across farmers' land in this area.  I hope Deputy Dunne is not suggesting to me or to the officials of the Department of Transport and Power or to the ESB we should ride roughshod over any objection farmers might have and that we should not try to come to an arrangement with the farming community with the view to obtaining permission to go over their land.  Deputy Dunne suggested that the ESB having had their terms accepted in August should now be in a position to disregard any objection or any negotiation with landowners through whose land they will have to go.  This is the 14 weeks which we anticipate from date of acceptance until time of provision of this service&mdash;a very normal length of time for the ESB to take.  I think Deputy Dunne has been overplaying his hand in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Today in the House I had to answer questions from Deputies in the west of Ireland asking if people who had been passed over in view of the fact that they could not afford to take electricity last year could shortly get it.  My reply was that it <Col N="1402" /> would be three to five years before they can be re-canvassed because of the planned programme of spreading rural electrification all over the country which, in fact, was initiated in the same area as the Forest area near Swords, County Dublin.  Deputy Dunne is clearly playing to the feelings of these three people.  Maybe this is the system he has.  He is endeavouring to make what capital he can, blaming the officials, from the Minister to the lowest official in the Department of Transport and Power, and blaming the ESB for not being in a position to put up the poles, put up the wire and switch on the following day.</P>
      <P>The letter Deputy Dunne quoted which he received probably yesterday from my Department in this regard did mention that we will be providing it. The information I have from the ESB is that they will be in a position to extend to Forest by the 31st January next at the very latest and it is hoped&mdash; and every effort will be made to have this service provided&mdash;before Christmas. I would prefer to be in a position to be able to reply to the Deputy and say we can arrange with the ESB to have the supply provided for the three people and their three households before the end of this week or before the end of next week, but if I were to accede to that type of demand and were in a position to issue an instruction to the ESB, which I do not claim I am, if I assumed the function of doing that, Deputy Dunne would be one of the first people coming to me about the manner in which I was ruling the State-sponsored bodies, as he is adept at doing in relation to another body under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>It just goes to show the depths to which he is willing to stoop. The ESB are doing their job with regard to having the matter cleared with the Department of Transport and <Col N="1403" /> Power.  That clearance was given within seven days.  The officials should be commended for this.</P>
      <P>I want to refer again to the insinuation which the Deputy made as to the use of power by me to give instructions to the ESB to oppose every possible objection from landowners in that area to erect poles and put wires across their land without reference to their feelings. He would be very annoyed if something of this nature were done by the ESB.  I think that the picture the Deputy painted of young children being burned to death because of the people having to use candles was rather melodramatic because we have this particular situation in the country at the present time and all steps are being taken in an effort to spread rural electrification.</P>
