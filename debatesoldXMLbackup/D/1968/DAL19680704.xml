      <P>As was said when this amendment was discussed on Tuesday last, its purpose is to substitute the Revenue Commissioners for the Minister for Finance.  While there has been some criticism in the past of leaving a discretion in certain respects to the Revenue Commissioners, there is, I think, an even greater objection to giving a discretion in a matter of this sort to the Minister.  In fact, one of the aspects of this section as it is drafted is that the Minister can waive <Col N="351" /> statutory conditions.  It might be possible to consider a revised amendment under which the Minister would have the discretion, on the recommendation of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>It is also, I think, worthy of note that, in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, no reference was made to the fact that this discretion was being conferred on the Minister. While these explanatory memoranda are not regarded as definitive, nevertheless I think, in a matter of this sort, it is important that the full implications of the section should properly and adequately be explained. There is a strong case, in a matter of this sort, for not having unfettered discretion allowed to the Minister.  For that reason, the amendment was put down by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins as was a similar one by myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, on the whole, this is not an unreasonable proposition on my part. We are dealing here with something which is new and complicated.  It could well happen that a company concerned might be in breach of the conditions for only one day of the year.  As I mentioned before, what we are concerned with here are marginal departures from very stringent conditions.  I feel the House will get a better understanding of this if I explain that already we have had to change what we had in the Bill originally to meet particular cases. If we had gone ahead with the original conditions laid down in the Bill as we devised them they would have been quite useless in so far as some of the organisations were concerned and we have had to revise them already.  I feel we must leave some way out here to cover the case where, for example, a company might be in breach of one of the conditions maybe for a couple of days in the year so that the discretion to deal with that situation should reside in the Minister.  Of course, the exercise of any such discretion would only be on the advice of the Revenue Commissioners; in fact, it could only come to the Minister through the Revenue Commissioners because it would be the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="352" /> who would be dealing with the company's liability for tax.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that what I propose should meet the case, that the discretion would rest with the Minister but if he exercises the discretion he must publicise that fact in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Therefore, the matter could be raised here in the House at any time.  It would be undesirable to substitute the Revenue Commissioners for the Minister in this respect.  As I said, Deputies on that side of the House, and indeed Deputies on this side of the House, from time to time have been very critical of our giving any discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not think we should do it on this occasion. After all, it is the Minister who is politically accountable and that is the way it should be.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that any exercise of this discretion by the Minister could only be on the advice of the Revenue Commissioners.  Perhaps if the Deputy would agree to withdraw amendments 30 and 31 and let my official amendment 32 stand then between now and the Report Stage we might see if some further words might be inserted to make it clear that the Minister would only act after consultation with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The Bill proposes that this rate of interest should be determined by the Minister for Finance.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 propose that it should be fixed by the Central Bank.  I think that is based on a misconception and it would be very much out of line with the normal practice.  All these rates are fixed by the Minister for Finance as part of his operation of the Exchequer.  The Post Office Savings Bank and the ordinary rate of interest payable on the deposits of trustee savings banks are fixed by the Minister for Finance as part of his management of the Exchequer funds, savings and so on and I suggest that these amendments might be withdrawn.</P>

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1968: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to raise the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund which now stands at £250 million as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Issues from the Fund since its establishment in 1935 amounted to £234 million at 31st March last, or £16 million short of the limit of £250 million.  The Capital Budget provides for issues from the Fund of over £30 million in the current financial year, so that the limit again needs to be raised to enable further issues in this and future years <Col N="355" /> for the purposes for which the Fund is utilised.</P>
      <P>These purposes cover a wide range of activities by local authorities particularly housing, sanitary services, vocational schools, certain hospital building and some harbour works and miscellaneous services.  Of these activities, housing is by far the most significant. Issues from the Fund for housing amounted to £181 million, or 77 per cent, of the total of £234 million at 31st March last.  Local authority housing, for which £115.7 million was issued, accounted for almost two-thirds of the housing expenditure.  The balance was in respect of house purchase loans and supplementary grants given by local authorities to private individuals providing their own homes. Issues in respect of these loans and grants amounted to £51.4 million and £13.7 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Fund is virtually the sole source of capital for the housing operations of local authorities.  In 1966-67 it provided as much as 93 per cent, and last year 97 per cent, of the capital expenditure of these authorities on housing. The increased limit sought in the Bill is an assurance of the Government's intention to maintain this extremely important source of capital for local authorities in tackling their housing problems.</P>
      <P>The Fund is also the principal source of capital for sanitary services, covering mainly water and sewerage schemes to meet the growing needs of housing, industry, dairying and tourism.  Issues from the Fund amounted to £31 million by 31st March last and accounted for over 13 per cent of the total expenditure from the Fund.  Thus, housing and sanitary services together absorbed over 90 per cent of the total issues from the Fund since its establishment.</P>
      <P>The increasing emphasis on post-primary education has resulted in expenditure on vocational schools becoming a more important constituent of total expenditure from the Fund. Total issues to 31st March last amounted to £10.3 million and expenditure currently amounts to almost £2 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> The balance of the expenditure from the Fund is attributable to works on local authority hospitals, county homes, dispensaries, etc., and to a variety of miscellaneous services such as harbours, public libraries and bridges.</P>
    <P>Mainly because of the increasing scale of housing activity by local authorities, issues from the Fund have grown from about £7 million in 1960-61 to £26.5 million in the last financial year and are estimated to amount to over £30 million this year.  A very significant factor in this growth is the increasing demand of Dublin and Cork Corporations for finance for housing and allied operations.  These authorities together drew £10 million of the total of £26.5 million issued from the Fund last year.</P>
    <P>It is clear that to meet requirements for some years ahead, the existing limit on issues from the Fund of £250 million needs to be materially increased. Accordingly, the Bill proposes to raise the limit to £400 million.</P>
    <P>I commend the provisions of the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I want to raise on this Bill. First of all, the money issued to local authorities from the Fund in respect of housing covers houses built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts procedure.  One of the difficulties which arises in the operation of these Acts is a problem which affects Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council more particularly, I think, than it does other local authorities.  It is the system under which the local authority issues a loan on the basis of a valuation which is fixed by the officials of the authority concerned.  The invariable experience of applicants for loans is that the actual cost involved in building a house far exceeds the valuation fixed by the responsible authority for loan purposes. The result is that applicants are obliged from their own resources&mdash;in many cases this places a considerable strain on them&mdash;to make good the difference.  In some cases the applicants may be in a position to put up a deposit or provide money from savings but, because of the gap between the actual valuation placed on the house <Col N="357" /> and the amount of the loan, which is determined by the valuation, falling short of the actual cost involved a very serious problem arises for the applicants.</P>
      <P>This is probably a matter for the Minister for Local Government really, but I think the Minister might consider the problem involved because the actual provision of the funds falls within the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  It is certainly a matter which should be the subject of discussion with the appropriate Department and the local authorities to see whether some more satisfactory arrangement can be made.</P>
      <P>The other point then is the dissatisfaction caused by the frustrating delays in getting sanction from the Department of Local Government in respect of water supply schemes.  Some years ago the present Minister for Agriculture announced a system of regional water supply schemes and a good deal of planning and discussion went into the preparation of these schemes.  Then, after some time, the decision was revised and there was a reversion to some form of group schemes.  Irrespective, however, of the type of scheme, or its description, it ought to be possible for the Department to notify to each local authority the amount of money which will be available in the particular financial year, thereby allowing them to plan the schemes ahead in the knowledge that the money will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for allocating a block grant for the selection of individual schemes within the local authority area should be a matter for the authority itself.  The general experience is one of frustration because of the constant transmission of plans backwards and forwards to the Department; almost interminable delays occur, sometimes delays of 18 months and, in one case about which I heard recently, the schemes have been prepared now for a period of almost three years.  Failure to get a decision causes not merely frustration but a feeling among local authorities and, to a greater extent, among the people immediately concerned, that some official or Minister is responsible for delaying <Col N="358" /> a particular scheme or schemes planned by local authorities and which those immediately concerned realise is necessary.  If a system of block grants were decided upon under which the local authority was notified in advance or had a certain sum allocated to it, then the responsibility for allocating and selecting priorities in a county council or other area would be on the officials and members of the authority concerned.</P>
    <P>I think a great deal of useful and constructive work is being done under the method of financing provided here and over the years the amount of money has, of course, grown.  The very substantial rise in costs of construction of all kinds obviously means that more money is necessary even to undertake schemes to a comparable extent.</P>
    <P>The two matters I have mentioned are giving rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction and, indeed, in some cases, hardship to the people concerned.  A simple change in the method of operation would ease the implementing of the actual proposals, to the benefit of the local authorities and the people primarily concerned, the applicants for housing loans, and, indeed, would greatly reduce the amount of correspondence and discussion with the Department concerned in the sense of making it more directly the responsibility of the authorities concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party believe that this is a very sensible decision by the Government to increase the amount of borrowing from the Local Loans Fund to £400 million. However, I think the Minister might have in the Bill or, if he finds it is not necessary to do it in the Bill, might consider making, certain regulations which would make the working of the Fund a lot easier for local authorities. We have several complaints from local authorities all over the country, mainly about the delay which occurs from the time an application is made for permission to borrow for the purpose of erecting houses or for water and sewerage schemes until the permission is finally granted.  We have even still what I consider to be the ridiculous situation where a local authority who <Col N="359" /> require to build houses for people who are badly in need of houses prepare a scheme, submit it to the Department of Local Government and after seven months or maybe longer get permission to advertise for contracts; the scheme is advertised; the contractors send in their figures; the local authority selects a contractor, submits the name to the Department of Local Government, they delay the matter for a further six months or longer and then send back permission and then the application to the Local Loans Fund is made.</P>
      <P>I put down a Question last week to the Minister for Local Government, asking if he would consider the position and try to find out if it would be possible to have the Minister for Finance considering the application for the amount required from the Local Loans Fund at the same time as the Minister for Local Government was considering the tenders submitted.  The Minister made what I consider to be a rather stupid reply.  He told me that the application to the Local Loans Fund could not be made until the amount of money required for the contract was known.  I am afraid that I pointed out that I appeared to be wasting my time, was on the wrong wavelength, that, in fact, what the question mentioned was the tender which contained the figures, which was before the Minister.  So, the exact figures were known.  The Minister said, eventually, that it could not be done.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance, who is a reasonable sort of man, would look at it, he would realise that the system in operation at the present time, not alone causes unnecessary delays, but very often creates a situation where, because of the delay, by the time the houses are finished, the contractor finds that costs have increased and through his prices variation clause is able to ask for an increase in his contract price and must get it.  This has occurred far too often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is the situation where, for instance, in County Meath, we have an application before the Minister for Local Government for a considerable time for a housing <Col N="360" /> scheme for Slane and Oldcastle.  It appears that money cannot be found. The Minister has not notified the council that the money is available.  We have before him a scheme of 57 rural cottages in Meath for several months.  I am told that there is still no decision by the Minister as to whether or not the money is available.</P>
    <P>Possibly, as the Minister says here, the amount of money being required by local authorities is causing a strain on the Fund and, therefore, it might be necessary to defer schemes until legislation such as this has gone through the House.  If that is so, we would be prepared to accept that as being reasonable and that would be all right but if it is delay just for the sake of delay on the part of Departments who do not give permission to borrow for up to six months after the application is made, or even three months, which is the more general thing, I think it is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it which the Minister should look at, that is, the question of the amount of subsidy which is granted.  As the Minister knows under the present system, the limit is on £1,600.  Nobody can build a house for £1,600 at the present time. According to information given to me by the Minister for Local Government, contract prices have gone up in Dublin to £2,250, in Meath to £1,880, in Westmeath to £1,880.  Yet the subsidy would be paid only on £1,600. The Minister might have a look at this aspect and might be able to deal with it in a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>There is the question of regional water schemes.  The Minister for Local Government made it clear earlier in the year that he was looking for priority lists on which applications would be considered and talked about £15 million worth of work being planned over the next two or three years.  He came back a few months afterwards and said the amount of applications had gone up to £35 million. If my memory serves me correctly, the other day he said the figure had gone up to £87 million and it was impossible to meet the applications for loans to proceed with these schemes and he was waiting for priorities to be decided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Priorities have been decided by a number of local authorities and have not been decided, apparently, by a substantial number of local authorities. Is there any reason why the Minister could not give permission to those local authorities who have decided their priorities to go ahead with the schemes they have selected?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very much Local Government matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has the final say in this because in each case the money has to be borrowed from the Local Loans Fund, and unless the Minister for Finance deals with the applications which are before him, then they cannot be started.  Whether they are Local Government or not, the final say rests with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like to refer to is the question of the rates of interest on the loans.  The original applications for loans over the years exhausted, or practically exhausted, the amount of money being made available.  Naturally, there must be a pay-back.  There must be a certain amount of that money coming back. Perhaps the Minister would say what the actual amount of money at present outstanding is and how much has been repaid?  If he has the figures available, I should like him to tell me when he is replying to the debate how much has been repaid over the years and how much is still outstanding.</P>
      <P>The rates of interest now are reaching the stage where it is not easy to continue to build, even under the Local Loans Fund.  Costs are far too high. Somebody borrows £2,000 to build a house and finds that for that £2,000 he has, with principal and interest, to repay over £10 per £100.  It is almost £4 a week.  As the Minister will agree, this puts it completely out of the reach of many people who might be tempted to provide themselves with houses if the rate of interest were a little more reasonable.  I know in some countries grants have been suspended and instead of grants, a subsidised loan is given.  I suggest that this might be considered here.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="362" /> The rate of interest on the amount of money borrowed has a very big bearing on whether or not a person will build a house for himself or apply to the local authority for housing.  The amount of money a person can borrow from a local authority is so limited that when somebody reaches the stage where he feels he might be in a position to pay the interest and to meet the repayments required, he is also reaching the stage where the Local Loans Fund say: &ldquo;We are very sorry but your income is too high and you cannot borrow from us.&rdquo;  This is an aspect the Minister might look at.  Perhaps he would say when the present limit was set and how long was it since it was adjusted.</P>

      <P>1964.  Deputy Cosgrave raised the matter of the limits of SDA loans and the valuations made.  The question of valuations for the purpose of SDA advances is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and I will bring the point to his attention.  I should point out that the maximum loan which can be made was increased on 24th June last to £2,700 except in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford where the limit is now £3,000.  I think that should help meet the point made by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>The other point raised by Deputy Cosgrave was whether or not local authorities could be notified of the amount available to them in any year for regional water <Col N="363" /> schemes so that they could proceed to plan and operate on that basis.  Again, the allocations made to different authorities and the breakdown of the allocation to any particular authority are matters for the Minister for Local Government and not for myself as Minister for Finance.  I will mention that point to him also.</P>
      <P>However, I do not know that it would be possible for the Minister to do anything about this.  He has to manage things as best he can.  His resources are, of course, limited by me. I do not give him all the money he wants and he has a whole host of competing demands.  Most people would agree &mdash; I know the Minister takes this view &mdash; that housing should be the first priority.  That does not mean, of course, that he can neglect the other matters completely, even in the interests of housing.  If he does not look after water and sewerage schemes, his housing will be slowed up eventually. He has a very difficult job of management to do in regard to these allocations.</P>
      <P>I do know local authorities are given allocations at the start of the year in regard to commitments which they may have, but whether anything more than that can be done I doubt very much. This whole business of local authority financing is very complicated. There is always work in progress at the beginning of the year, new starts made during the year and at the end of the year, there is always an amount due in respect of commitments.  I do not know that the Minister could in any year lay down a hard and fast rule as to the exact amount which will be allocated to each authority for water schemes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of applications to the Local Loans Fund. As far as I know at present, apart from a few applications which are under inquiry, all sanctions are virtually up to date.</P>

      <P>We will have to look at that.  In regard to the figures asked <Col N="364" /> for by Deputy Tully, the latest figures I have are the figures at 31st March, 1966.  I think they might help to give a picture of the way the Fund operates. At 31st March, 1966, the total advance which had been made from the Fund was £196 million and a total of £40 million in principal and £71 million in interest has been repaid.  There was a small number of loans written off and the total amount outstanding by borrowers was about £166 million in principal and a very small amount of interest in arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £45,286,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on <Col N="366" /> the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain Services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for Sundry Grants.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for my Department for the current financial year is £45,286,000.  This represents the amount which the Exchequer must provide to meet its share of the cost of the social welfare services.  The Appendix to the published Estimate gives details of the estimated expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund, and taking these figures into account, and also certain expenses borne on the Votes of other Departments, the total estimated expenditure on Social Welfare is over £72,000,000.  This is quite a substantial figure, and, as Deputies are aware, it will be further increased when the various improvements announced in the Budget are implemented. The Estimate before the House does not make provision for the Budget increases, and a supplementary estimate will have to be introduced later in the year for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for 1968-69 shows an increase of £49,000 on the Estimate for 1967-68 which, of course, includes the Supplementary Estimate of £2,681,000 taken in March last.  The main increases arise under Subheads E, G and K.  The increase of £433,000 under Subhead E represents the additional amount which the Exchequer must contribute to the Social Insurance Fund to meet the expected deficit on the Fund's operations in the current year.  The increase of £487,000 on Old Age Pensions&mdash;Subhead G&mdash;is due almost entirely to the additional cost for a full year of the rate increases granted from the beginning of August, 1967.  In the case of Subhead K&mdash; Miscellaneous Grants&mdash;the increased cost arises in respect of the free travel and free electricity allowances introduced last year.  The only other appreciable increase is £70,000 on Subhead E&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash; which is due mainly to the creation of two new sections in the Department, one to administer the occupational injuries benefit scheme, and the other <Col N="367" /> to implement the free travel and electricity allowances.</P>
    <P>Two subheads show decreases as compared with last year.  The provision for Unemployment Assistance&mdash;Subhead I&mdash;is down by £1,235,000 because of the extension of the maximum duration of unemployment benefit from 156 to 312 days, which should appreciably reduce expenditure on unemployment assistance.  The reduction of £71,000 under Subhead J is attributable mainly to the continuing decline in the number of non-contributory widow pensioners.</P>
    <P>The trends in the various social insurance services can be seen from the Appendix to which I have already referred.  The increase of £745,000 in the provision for disability benefit reflects the additional cost in a full year of the increase in the rate of benefit which came into operation at the beginning of January last.  This is also the principal explanation for the increases of £875,000 and £850,000 in the provision for old age contributory pensions and widows' contributory pensions, respectively.  In addition, the number of pensioners under both these schemes is continuing to increase from year to year.  In the case of unemployment benefit the rate increase accounts for part of the extra sum of £2,231,000, but the greater portion is attributable to the extension of the duration of benefit from 156 to 312 days.</P>
    <P>Income of the Social Insurance Fund is expected to increase by approximately £4½ million.  Of this, £4 million is attributable to the increase in contribution rates from January last.  An increase of about £½ million is expected in receipts under reciprocal arrangements.  The greater portion of this increase is due to a revision in our favour of the method of calculating transfer payments from the British Fund in the case of disability benefit claims.</P>
    <P>I have now explained briefly the main changes in the Estimate for Social Welfare for the current financial year as compared with last year's figures.  As I mentioned at the outset, the Estimate does not include the cost of the recent Budget increases, and accordingly I do not propose to refer to them in detail.  As Deputies are <Col N="368" /> aware, legislation to implement these increases will be necessary, and I expect to bring this legislation before the House very shortly.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to Deputies to have a brief report on the progress of the occupational injuries scheme which came into operation on the 1st May, 1967.  Insurance benefits became payable by my Department in respect of occupational accidents and diseases arising on or after that date.  In addition, those in receipt of workmen's compensation in respect of earlier occupational accidents and diseases were enabled to receive full disability benefit in addition to their compensation payments when the compensation had lasted for six months.  The outlay on these benefits will, naturally, increase over the years according as long-term pensions for disablement and death accumulate.  The amount paid on claims allowed in the period from 1st May, 1967 to 31st March, 1968, is approximately £540,000, but as I have explained, this figure will grow substantially.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have seen the recent announcement that this country has ratified International Labour Convention, No. 102, concerning minimum standards of social security.  This Convention, which has been in operation since 1952 has been ratified by only seventeen countries out of the 119 affiliated to the ILO, including five of the six members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should mention that certain improvements were made in the schemes for free travel and free electricity for pensioners authorised in the 1967 Budget.  For instance, the free travel facilities were allowed to British and Northern Ireland retirement pensioners over 70 years of age who reside in this country, and the classes of person who may reside with a pensioner without making him ineligible for the free electricity allowance were extended as a result of cases of hardship that came to notice.  The number of pensioners in receipt of the free electricity allowance is approximately 27,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party are only too glad to support the <Col N="369" /> expenditure for which the Minister seeks approval in this Social Welfare Estimate.  Our regret is that it is not for a great deal more, as we in the Fine Gael Party are strongly of the view that we are not doing nearly sufficient for the less well-off members of our community.  The truth is that the whole social welfare code in Ireland is a sorry, ill-fitting, carelessly designed patchwork quilt, covering ill-assorted and overlapping laws which reflect the conscience-prickings of politicians, administrators and do-gooders for the past century and a half.  That it works at all is not due to the skill of the men who designed or administer it, but rather to the kindness of Providence.</P>
      <P>Our whole social welfare code is a hit and miss affair, and unfortunately an increasing number of our people are being missed in the application of the social benefits and social schemes which have been designed.  It is on that account that we in Fine Gael are of the view that mere increases in monetary payments are not the answer to the social problems of our age and that in order to make a just society a living reality in the daily affairs and the lives of our people, we must examine our social schemes in depth and in breadth. If not we will find they are failing in many respects.</P>
      <P>In the view of the Fine Gael Party, there is no justification for the separation into two different isolated Departments of State the aspects of health and the aspects of social welfare.  These two are so closely interwoven in real life, these activities so dovetail into one another in the daily and family affairs of our people, that it is entirely wrong to operate the institutions of our State in such a way that health and social welfare operate in individual watertight compartments.  Even the Department of Health administer their own schemes which could clearly be considered to be of a social welfare or monetary kind and not peculiar to Health.  The Department of Social Welfare are now operating many health schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occupational injuries scheme and the disability benefits scheme depend upon the skilled advice and co-operation of the medical profession. We find as an individual item in the <Col N="370" /> Estimate which the Minister puts before us today, payments to the medical profession in relation to medical certificates for the operation of those schemes.  Social assistance and home assistance schemes which the local authorities and health authorities have to pay to maintain body and soul together by a tenuous link are administered by health authorities but, because it is not accepted by the Department of Health as a health problem, that Department make no contribution towards it and it is something which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>That is why when Fine Gael are in Government we will amalgamate the Ministries of Health and Social Welfare. That is why the Leader of my Party has given to me the dual responsibility, as it were, of marking both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare.  I must say I do not find it an impossible burden to bear because they are so interwoven that we think this is the only way in which we can approach the problems of our people.</P>
    <P>There are some elderly people in our midst who are not poor, who have means, but their misery and loneliness and malnutrition and ill health exist. They have a real need, not through any inability to purchase services, food and goods, but through the failure of our social system to provide for those people in their old age the kind of personal services they need.  This is an area in which the Minister for Social Welfare should operate.  This is real social service.  It is as necessary to elderly well-off people as it is to elderly poor people.  It is an indication of the failure of our society to grasp that fundamental fact.  As long as we continue to operate the Department of Social Welfare as a mere paying agency and no more, so long will we continue to have these pockets of social needs unnecessary and unrecognised in our society.</P>
    <P>In <i>Studies</i>, Winter, 1966, Dr. John Fleetwood said:</P>
    <P>Sometimes I am asked, &ldquo;If you had unlimited means what would you supply for the aged?&rdquo; The temptation is to reply, &ldquo;Something of <Col N="371" /> everything&rdquo;, for though the basic necessities of life are supplied from either statutory or voluntary services it is no exaggeration to say that many people live on the margin of malnutrition, have unsuitable housing and require <i>much more</i> of that <i>personal service</i> which should be the birthright of our older fellow citizens who have given much, who ask but little and all too often receive nothing at all.</P>
    <P>We need what Dr. Fleetwood wrote in italics &ldquo;much more&rdquo; of that &ldquo;personal service&rdquo;, and the failure of our social services to provide that personal service for our people reflects our failure as a society.</P>
    <P>It is not inappropriate to recall that we are now fast approaching the golden jubilee of the first meeting of Dáil Éireann in January, 1919.  On that great occasion our predecessors in this Parliament published an inspiring &ldquo;Democratic Programme&rdquo; declaring to the nation and the world that political, military and economic freedoms were insufficient if those freedoms were not used to develop social policies to answer the needs of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but on an Estimate such as this, the debate is confined to matters of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was being careful not to advocate increased monetary benefits, which I appreciate are a matter for legislation.  Even within the ambit of the powers available to the Minister at present, there is plenty of opportunity for developing social service schemes of one kind or another which would not necessarily involve monetary increases.  I will, however, certainly bear in mind your timely reminder about the scope of the debate.  That &ldquo;Democratic Programme&rdquo; stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their <Col N="372" /> proper education and training as citizens of a free and Gaelic Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Republic fully realises the necessity of abolishing the present odious, degrading and foreign Poor Law system, substituting there-for a sympathetic native scheme for the care of the Nation's aged and infirm, who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation's gratitude and consideration. Likewise, it shall be the duty of the Republic to take such measures as will safeguard the health of the people and ensure the physical as well as the moral wellbeing of the Nation.</P>
    <P>I think we still have an attitude of mind which regards our aged and our infirm as a burden and which does not recognise the entitlement of the aged, the poor and the infirm in our community to the nation's gratitude and consideration.  If we did recognise as of right their entitlement to a higher standard of living, we should not condemn one-ninth of our people, as we do, to mere subsistence living, to a level of life which is unbecoming to the dignity of human beings.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Social Welfare, we have not even one qualified sociologist.  Our universities are producing, year in year out, qualified sociologists.  They are lectured to by experienced, qualified sociologists.  Our Department of Social Welfare has not got even one of these graduates on its staff.  It has not even one research social worker on its staff.  The pleas of the Fine Gael Party and of the Labour Party over the years to Fianna Fáil Ministers to have such qualified people in the Department of Social Welfare have fallen on deaf ears.  That appears to be an extraordinary attitude of mind.</P>
    <P>One would think the Minister and his advisers would be only too glad to have available to them the advice, skill and experience of qualified social workers.  We have many social graduates who have been obliged to go abroad on account of the failure of our State to use them.  They have marvellous experience in social fields in other regimes.  Such persons would be only too glad to return here.  Within <Col N="373" /> the hundreds of administrators and administrative posts in the Department of Social Welfare, there is certainly ample opportunity to employ such people.  One would hope that, at long last, the Minister would use the millions of pounds he has available to him to see that such skilled people are brought in.  It may be that the Minister is unable to persuade his colleagues in the Government to accept the wisdom of this procedure.  I should like to point this out to him.  It is quite possible that proper social welfare schemes here could cost, in some respects, less, than some of the ill-advised schemes we are operating at the present time.  If we had a skilled social worker, such a person might be able to suggest economies and remedies which could be of advantage.</P>
    <P>The Estimates the Minister submitted to us show that, apart from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Social Welfare is the biggest spender in the State.  That is as it ought to be.  The function of the Department of Social Welfare is to redistribute income, to manage transfer payments so that no people are required to live below an adequate human standard. That the Estimate is of such dimensions is only a partial acknowledgment of the extent of the problem which needs to be met.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a few queries to the Minister in relation to the details of the Estimate and to ask him to be good enough to give me the benefit of his detailed knowledge in relation to them when he is replying.  It is very difficult, as the Minister probably knows, to absorb, in the few minutes while a Minister's speech is being read to the House, all that the address contains. If, in the course of my remarks, I repeat something which may already be explained in his opening address, I trust the Minister will be good enough to accept that I did not absorb it during the time he was reading it.</P>
    <P>The amount of contribution by the State under the heading of Social Assistance to the widows' and orphans' non-contributory schemes is reduced by £71,000.  Am I right in thinking that this is because some of the people who formerly would have been within the social assistance <Col N="374" /> scheme are now within the contributory scheme and that this is a reflection of the reduction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Subhead K&mdash; Miscellaneous Grants&mdash;we find the sum of £854,000.  The Minister says the increased cost arises in respect of free travel and free electricity allowances during the year.  That, to my mind, is no more than a subsidy both to public transport and to the Electricity Supply Board.  The truth is that very many journeys which old people are now taking and some of the electricity which old people are now consuming are consumptions and services which would not have arisen if the State were not providing the money for these particular services.  In relation to free transport, for instance, old people are forbidden&mdash;in the urban areas, certainly&mdash;to avail of public transport free of charge during certain hours of the day when the capital equipment already available is fully in use.  The only time they may use public transport facilities free of charge is when all the seats would not be occupied in buses and trains.  Quite clearly, this is not a social welfare payment: this is a payment to the advantage and to the relief of our public transport services. This is an income which our public transport services would not receive were it not that the State is subsidising these old people.  It seems to me to be wrong that our Social Insurance Fund and our social welfare fund should be charged with this payment and that this should be taken into account in measuring the kind of money the State is paying for the benefit and support of our less privileged in the community. This is a subsidy which would have to be paid to CIE in some other form directly by the Department of Transport and Power or some other agency if CIE did not receive it out of social welfare funds.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> I mentioned that the intention of the Fine Gael Party when in Government is to abolish the Ministry and secretariat of the Department of Social Welfare and to amalgamate the functions of the two Departments, Health and Social Welfare.  This we observe from the Estimate would result in a direct saving of some £26,000 a year which is a not insignificant sum, particularly when we are satisfied that operating the two Departments under one harness would lead to substantially improved social welfare and health services for all.  I observe too that under the heading &ldquo;Unemployment Benefit and Unemployment Assistance&rdquo;, there is a reduction on the staff side in relation to salaries and wages of £12,000.  That is a rather big reduction from £76,170 to £64,500 and I would be grateful if the Minister would explain how such a reduction takes places, particularly at a time when we would have expected, on account of the changes in unemployment benefit, that the staffing might be increased.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to query the Minister at Question Time about the long delays which unemployed people have to endure in some exchanges, at Werburgh Street in particular.  I was assured by the Minister that the average waiting time was 20 minutes, and that perhaps it was shorter.  However, the trouble is that it is very dangerous to use an average figure because if somebody is required to wait 20 minutes, it means that somebody else gets away in ten minutes and somebody else has to wait 40 minutes.  My information is that on several occasions in recent months unemployed people at Werburgh Street have been obliged to wait for an hour or two hours.  I am informed that several hatches which formerly had been opened are now frequently closed and that the number of officials available to interview, assist and advise unemployed people at Werburgh Street have been reduced.</P>

      <P>It may be, but of course <Col N="376" /> the Minister for Labour is simply acting as an agent for the Minister for Social Welfare who is the principal and when a principal's agent is not doing the work properly, then the obligation falls on the principal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that if the Minister has the obligation to pay the money to the unemployed, he would see to it that the administration of the employment exchanges would improve. If he finds that his agent is not doing the job properly, it behoves the Minister to take it back again from the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to examinations in the Custom House is another piece of social administration which is causing some considerable complaint. The quarters there where disabled people or people who are ill or injured are required to attend for examination leave a great deal to be desired.  Again the long waiting periods which patients are required to endure when awaiting examinations are something they should not be asked to suffer.  I would strongly urge the Minister to take steps to improve radically the accommodation in the Custom House for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice under another heading, &ldquo;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&rdquo;, that there is a subscription to the International Social Security Association of £3,600.  Would the Minister be good enough to give us some information about the Association and say if reports, records or recommendations of any kind are received from this Association.  If they are, I wonder if we could urge the Minister to make these available to Members of the Oireachtas by placing them in the Library?  We are very scarce in social thinking and social material of all kinds.  We have been inclined to rely on increasing marginally the monetary payments made by the Department of Social Welfare but that is not an adequate contribution to the social needs of our times, and any information we can collect from across the world, from Europe in particular, in relation to social needs should be placed at the <Col N="377" /> disposal of Members of the Oireachtas and not simply filed away in the Department or elsewhere where we have not even got qualified sociologists to interpret it and apply whatever lessons we have learned.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous Grants&rdquo;, Subhead K, we notice that there is a marginal increase of £3,000 in the amount paid for fuel for necessitous families.  This, I take it, is the scheme which operates in urban areas for a limited number of winter months. Unfortunately I have not been able to put my hand on figures which I recently received from the Minister for Social Welfare in reply to a Dáil Question. I thought I had assembled a brief but like the Minister, some of it has been mislaid due to the false starts and stoppages we have had in the past few weeks.  The figures I am referring to are in relation to the free fuel scheme and they show that Limerick city in relation to the number of people it has to assist is receiving much less than Dublin or Cork.  I understand that this resulted this year in Limerick Health Authority having to bring the scheme to an end long before the scheduled date.  My information is that Limerick over the years has not received a sum to assist the people under the free fuel scheme commensurate with the numbers it is asked to help.  Doing a little arithmetic, one finds that Limerick receives something like only two-thirds or threequarters of what is paid in Dublin, Cork and perhaps other urban centres, <i>per capita.</i> It is very difficult to understand why this is so and I would urge the Minister to look into the matter and see that Limerick gets its fair share of the free fuel scheme for next year.  Certainly the £3,000 increase under this heading would not provide any hope for Limerick that in the next free fuel scheme it will receive any increase and quite clearly it badly needs one.</P>
    <P>I note also that a grant is made under this heading for blind welfare.  This leads me to appeal to the Minister to provide funds for the printing press which the Blind Association so urgently need.  It is the only printing press in this country which prints books in Braille.  Clearly this is a critical need for both educational <Col N="378" /> and recreational purposes for blind people.  The Minister has the power to make a grant and I would urge him to do so.  The existing press has collapsed from old age, and if the State does not come to the aid of the Blind Association, we will be in the sorry situation that we will not have any Braille printing press in the country.  This is one of the most important and most humane ways in which the Minister can assist the blind and I urge him to make a significant contribution now towards the cost of a new printing press.</P>
    <P>The State has, apparently, always been reluctant to take the initiative in prosecutions against employers who fail to stamp their employees' cards and when, from time to time, the Minister has been pressed at Question Time and on other occasions to take the initiative in these matters, he has always appeared very reluctant to do so.  Might I once again urge the Minister&mdash;on this occasion I hope my appeal will not fall on deaf ears&mdash; where employers fail to stamp cards, to take proceedings against them.  The main sufferers, as the Minister knows, are the people who should be insured but have not been insured, and who, during periods of illness or unemployment have to subsist on inadequate funds; but these are the very people who are then expected to institute legal proceedings against employers in respect of those employers' default.  It is true, of course, that there are members of the legal profession who, in such circumstances, are prepared to litigate on behalf of poor people without being put in funds to do so, but this kind of litigation, which the legal profession are finding increasingly unremunerative, can involve a considerable amount of time; it takes lawyers away from their obligations to other clients and these obligations, even apart from the money which may be either lost or gained, can be of critical importance.</P>
    <P>My information is that quite a number of insured people fail to follow up employers in respect of employers' default.  The Minister has the power to recover from such employers the moneys they have not paid on behalf of their employees.  We should, I think, <Col N="379" /> cease altogether to require workers&mdash; the insured, the poor and the sick&mdash;to follow their employers for this money. In many cases, even when they can do so, they are unwilling to do so because of the social consequences which may flow or because they live in the hope that they may be employed again by employers who have defaulted.  In a country which has a chronic degree of unemployment, in which there are five per cent unemployed and in which a great deal more would be unemployed, were it not for the safety valve of emigration, workers are disinclined to proceed against employers because they live in the vague hope of being re-employed.</P>
    <P>I have never understood the reluctance of the Department of Social Welfare to act in these matters.  There is, I think, a clear social and moral obligation on the Department to take the initiative and bear the cost and the burden of proceeding against employers who fail to insure their employees.  For the Minister to neglect to adopt this most reasonable reform would be something without any justification whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The other matters to which I wish to refer will be more pertinent to the Social Welfare Bill which we shall have before us next week.  Once again, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I want to express our willingness to spend all the money for which the Minister seeks approval today and our anxiety that the day is not far distant when a great deal more will be spent in looking after the needs of all our people and that, of course, includes the one-ninth who now receive too little and, in some cases, nothing at all from the society upon which they have a claim equal to that of the most wealthy members of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, support this Estimate.  It is only fair, I think, to comment that as the years go by the percentage of the national income spent on social welfare seems to be reducing.  We do not regard this as a good trend.  It is not a healthy trend.  The Government must face up to the fact that no matter what ILO <Col N="380" /> Convention they sign, so long as they continue to pay miserly amounts to those in the social welfare classes needing help, so long will they stand condemned.</P>
      <P>One matter the Minister might consider is the cost of the stamp to the insured person and his employer.  For a man it is £1 Os 1d per week and for a woman 18/1d.  Does the Minister consider that the insured person is getting a fair return for that amount of money?  Does he consider, remembering what is happening in neighbouring countries, that the same amount of value is being given to the worker here as is being given in the neighbouring island and in portion of our own island?</P>
      <P>The whole social welfare code must be re-examined.  There are still a number of anomalies in it.  Possibly it is administration which is causing the trouble and I should like on this occasion to bring to the Minister's notice again some of the things which, I think, are being dealt with in an entirely incorrect manner by his Department. Since I came into this House in 1954, I have always paid tribute on the Social Welfare Estimate to the Minister's Department and to the various Ministers who have occupied the office of Minister for Social Welfare from time to time.  I have found the officials most courteous and most anxious to help within the scope of the code.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further, I should like to say that I consider this booklet, SW4, which is brought up-to-date every year, an excellent document.  My only regret is that it does not fall into the hands of more people and I suggest to the Minister that, when someone applies for social welfare benefit and forms asking for further information are sent out, it might be a good idea to enclose a copy of the booklet and then any reasonably intelligent person will know what he or she is entitled to under the code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, there are a number of complaints which should be examined.  In a recent issue of that excellent publication, <i>Advocate</i>, by investigating officers, they took me to task for what they described as attacks on members of their organisation during debates on the Social Welfare Estimate <Col N="381" /> in this House.  I want to say to the Minister and to them that, so long as they continue to do as they have been doing, I will continue to attack them in this House and elsewhere. They make a claim about which I was not aware and, because of that, I want to bring it to the notice of the Minister. They say that, because they are shorthanded and have to do far more work than they are in a position to do&mdash;they are now doing much more investigation work for almost the same rate of wages as a far greater number were doing previously&mdash;they find it impossible to give the attention that is necessary to detail.  It is hinted, and possibly they are correct in this, that if there are incorrect reports made on an applicant's means, this is due to the fact that they are forced to do so much work that they cannot be expected to give the attention to detail which is necessary.</P>
    <P>My complaint about this class of people is that over the years my experience of any of them I have met is that, without exception, they were always prepared to lean over backwards to bring out any point they could find which would disqualify the applicant from receiving a pension or allowance.  As the Minister is aware, they also investigate the means of applicants for special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.  This is as far as I am aware still true.  I consider it regrettable that old people who apply for a non-contributory old age pension should be forced into the humiliating experience that they are third-degreed by some clever gentleman who will go in to them and, first of all, without telling them who they are, try to find out the family circumstances.  Very many of these old people will not say that their daughter is working as a domestic servant at 30s a week but will tell a stranger about the wonderful job she has at £10 a week and this is written down and used at a later stage.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that should not be encouraged by the Department. It must be Departmental policy or they would not do it; they are ordinary human beings.  I would ask for a more humane approach to the investigation <Col N="382" /> of means.  I do not want anybody to get anything he is not entitled to but I do not want to see persons who are entitled to benefit deprived of it because of the fact that he was bragging about something he had not got or became so confused by the barrage of questions put to him that he said things which had no relation to fact.  I meet many of these people and know that this has happened again and again.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister to do away with the ridiculous situation which at present exists where old age pension committees meet and recommend, according to their knowledge and according to their lights, a certain type of pension for applicants whom they almost always know and an investigation officer appeals against their decision and in every case the appeal is upheld by the Department.  Is it not ridiculous that these committees should be asked to meet and to waste their time&mdash;there is no question of expenses involved in this &mdash; investigating the means of some old person in a humane way, when on appeal by the inspector to the Department, without any case being made in public, the old person gets, first of all, a note from the pension committee secretary to say that he has been granted a pension and, a week afterwards, a second note to the effect that he is not entitled to any pension or is entitled to a much less pension?  This is a farce, as the Minister should realise.  This procedure should be brought up to date.  Either abolish pension committees completely or insist that the pension officer will come before them when hearing the case and give his reasons as to why he considers the person is not entitled to the pension applied for.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister on one or two previous occasions and will again appeal to him that in addition to the unemployment assistance which is given to persons who have no stamps &mdash;the dole as some people call it&mdash; there should be a disability allowance. It seems ridiculous that a person who has stamps on his insurance card and draws benefit for the specified period, which is now 312 weeks, if still unemployed <Col N="383" /> would draw unemployment assistance, while a person who is ill and who has less than 156 stamps, is entitled to draw disability pension for only 12 months and is left an absolute pauper at the end of the 12 months, without income of any kind.  It does not make sense.  If it can be given to the able-bodied person who is unemployed, surely it can be given to the person who is unable because of illness to resume work?  I would ask the Minister to investigate this matter and, if he cannot do it soon, make a recommendation that something be done about it in the next Budget.</P>
    <P>It takes far too long to give a decision on applications for old age pensions, particularly non-contributory pensions.  Recently I had a case.  A person came to me early this year whose father and mother had transferred a small farm to him and had applied for the old age pension.  Two months later he told me his father was dead.  I wrote to the Department asking if they were going to make a decision in this case and what was the position. Three weeks or a month later I received a reply from the Department telling me, something I knew because the person lives quite close to me, that the mother was also dead.  They did not say and have not yet said or have not replied to my letter, that since both of these people qualified for pension, from a certain date if the amount for the period in question will be paid.  I am not suggesting that the failure to grant a pension has anything to do with the death of these old people but I can assure the Minister that in many cases the disappointment of not receiving a pension to which they feel they are entitled does have a serious effect on the health of old persons who are awaiting decisions over a long period.</P>
    <P>Maternity allowances and other allowances are referred to in SW 4. Very often, a woman who has a first child and who is not well up in regard to social welfare applications does not apply in time for the maternity allowance and is subsequently given only a balance of what would have been payable. Such persons are entitled to an allowance in respect of six weeks before <Col N="384" /> and six weeks after the birth.  They are given the allowance in respect of the six weeks post-natal period if they have not applied when the child is born and, in some cases, if they apply only after the six weeks are up, they are told that their application is late and cannot be considered.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister assured me here on the debate on his Estimate last year that the Department were not anxious to deprive insured persons of benefits to which they would be entitled but for the fact that they forgot or omitted to apply in time and that, if a reasonable excuse was forthcoming, payment would be made, I cannot understand why we still have cases where the Department will not accept what would appear to me to be a perfectly reasonable excuse.  It is a question of trying to save a few shillings.  This system should not be continued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to arrears of stamps, to the fellow who does not stamp the insurance card and, as a result, his employees are left without benefit when they require it.  Surely the State should do what he suggested? Surely the onus should be on the State to attempt to recover not only the amount of the stamps involved but, also, the amount due to the insured person?  In the occupational injuries legislation it is laid down that whether or not cards are stamped the State will honour the obligation and pay the benefit.  If that is so, surely the State should do likewise in the case I have referred to and recover from the person who failed to stamp the cards the amount due?</P>
    <P>There is a growing practice in this country of certain employers collecting the insurance money from their employees and not stamping the cards. Not alone should the State have these people prosecuted, the amount lost in benefit and the amount of stamps recovered from them, but they should also be fined heavily.  The employer who fails for one reason or another&mdash; whether ignorance or anything else&mdash;to collect the amount due would be in a different category.  He just may not know.  But the fellow who collects and spends it on his fast cars or something <Col N="385" /> like that and does not pay even the employee's share of the stamp should be taught a lesson in every case.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something about this quickly because over the past 12 months I have come across a considerable number of such cases.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to unemployment benefit which the State should try to rectify.  The Minister may remember that I asked a question last year concerning a man who had 15 acres of land and 13 children.  He was working for a considerable period and travelling a distance of 26 miles per day to work.  The job he had in Bord na Móna closed down and he signed for unemployment benefit.  Because it was estimated that his income from the 15 acres would be more than 10/- a day, he was deprived of unemployment benefit.  If he had been a single man with no children, he would have been given the same allowance and the right to earn up to 10/- a day.  Surely there is something wrong with that legislation? Would the Minister try by regulation&mdash;I understand that is the way to deal with it&mdash;to remedy this situation because it does not appear to be fair?</P>
    <P>When referring to disability benefit, one must take into account the number of people who apply for benefit and after drawing it for a considerable period are disallowed, despite the fact that their own doctor is still certifying them as not fit for work.  I discovered a rather extraordinary thing recently.  I found that referees, sent out by the Department to discover if these people are fit for work or not, sometimes arrive and find as many as 30 people waiting for them.  The amount of attention given to the people going in for examination depends on the length of time available to the referee divided by the number of people present.  On one occasion it appears less than ten minutes per person was the amount allowed to decide whether or not the people being examined were entitled to benefit or were unfit for work.  One of the people concerned complained that, when he tried to point out to the referee what part of his body was sore, the referee said he would find out for himself.  The referee's temper was <Col N="386" /> pretty short, and if he had that number to deal with in a short time, I do not think we can blame him too much. But we can blame the system which allows this to happen.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this particular person declared &ldquo;not unfit for work&rdquo;, as it is termed, was subsequently X-rayed as a result of an examination by another doctor, was sent to Peamount and died less than a fortnight later.  It is just too bad if, because of the short time the doctor from the Department had to examine this poor man, he finished up very dead and in fact did not even know what was wrong with him.  He is supposed to have died of something which he had not got, which is the newest one I have heard.  The certificate of death was a a different thing altogether from the certificate he was receiving when drawing disability benefit.  I am not saying that this man would have lived if the doctor had had an hour to examine this serious case.  What I am saying is that, as a result of the referee not having a considerable time to examine him and declaring him not unfit for work, during the period between the time he was examined and his death, he received no benefit, no income came into the house and, on the word of his widow, the family were hungry as a result.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing I want to see stopped.  It should be and could be stopped.  Again, at this stage the Minister is the only man who can take the necessary steps to stop it.  We had a gentleman going around the country last year before Christmas and he paid a visit to my constituency.  He examined a number of people, particularly those who had been what they call &ldquo;on the funds&rdquo; for a relatively long period.  He decided that as of 19th December they were not unfit for work. If the Minister would care to tell me where he thinks married men with a family, who had been ill, sometimes for years and many of them for months, who had no job to go back to&mdash;or even if they had would not be able to get work between 19th December and Christmas Day&mdash;where such people could get the price of their Christmas dinner I would like to hear it.  The <Col N="387" /> activities of this gentleman resulted in a very poor Christmas for a number of very decent families.  The fact that after Christmas on a further examination most of them were declared unfit for work and went back on the funds, which apparently an effort was being made to protect, was very cold comfort to the people concerned.  This sort of thing should be discouraged.  If they want to carry out one of these &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; examinations, then they should do it well clear of Christmas.  Do not wait until, as they say in the country, we are on the door of Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to children's allowances.  I regret he was not able to make a more definite statement. The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement said the whole position of children's allowances was to be reviewed.  Let us be very honest about this.  We have the extraordinary situation here where the gentlemen I referred to earlier, the investigating officers, can go into the poorest homes in the country to find out whether the people there are entitled to the full amount of old age and widow's pensions, the enormous sum the State will be prepared to give them if they are absolutely destitute.  If they are entitled, they will get 57/6d if they have no qualified children, and most of them are in that position.  But anybody at all who has children under the age of 16 can qualify for children's allowances. They can have an income of £10,000 a year.  They are nearly ashamed to be seen going into the post office.  They make arrangements to go in when nobody else who knows them will be present.  They draw the allowance and perhaps put it away for the children.  They do not really need it.</P>
    <P>This continues to be done without a means test.  I am opposed to a means test of any kind, but if we are going to have it for the poorest of the poor, let us also have it for the other kind. It is rather ridiculous to have this situation where the wealthy person can draw almost as much for five or six children as the unfortunate old age pensioner or widow pensioner.  I had a complaint from an old man last week.  He told me his pension book <Col N="388" /> was taken away.  He could not understand what had happened.  Nobody told him anything, but when he went in to draw his pension, his book was impounded.  He was a rather old man but that was the word he used and it was the correct word.  I wrote to the Department asking them to let me know why the book was taken in.  This man was not getting the full pension and, apparently, he had a small pension from his job and was not entirely destitute.</P>
    <P>A month passed and in the third week of the month I had a letter from the man saying that he had got his book back but the 12/6 he had been getting had been reduced to 7/6 without any explanation.  A fortnight later the Department sent a note acknowledging my representation. When I telephoned and asked why this had happened, they could not say why they had sent this man's book back and had taken 5/- off him.  They passed me round from one section to another until I got browned off and hung up.</P>
    <P>This should not happen.  As I said before on many occasions, the Department has a well deserved reputation for courtesy and efficiency and it is rather a pity that a few people, through carelessness or because they feel they are upholding the Government by giving as little information as possible to Opposition Deputies, do this sort of thing.  I hope the number of these people will grow fewer or that they will learn common courtesy in dealing with the general public, since the Deputy is a member of the public.</P>
    <P>In making my next point I do not want the Minister to jump in and say it refers to the Department of Labour.  I have before me the register of unemployed for the month of June, particularly relating to 23rd June, 1967, and 14th June, 1968.  On the first date there were 48,436 registered unemployed and on 14th June, 1968, the number was 53,965, which means that there are 5,500 more people unemployed now than there were 12 months ago.  Can nothing be done to stop this situation growing worse?  Do not tell me that there were 90,000 unemployed <Col N="389" /> in 1956 because if you do, I will retort that there were 131,000 unemployed in 1934, something Fianna Fáil should not be very proud about.  Neither of these figures is relevant but can we do anything about the present figure? I am sure the Minister will agree that an average of 50,000 unemployed over 12 months is a loss to the State in insurance contributions alone of over £1 million.  The amount of money being paid out to those unemployed, small as it is, is very many millions more.  When will some Government realise that the only way to solve our economic ills and save the tremendous amount of money we pay out for social welfare benefits is by attempting to secure full employment?</P>

It is not unusual to find the husband dead and the mother perhaps 50, 60 or 65 years of age, sometimes over 70, with the son working in the county council or a local farmer with perhaps a delicate sister who has never gone out to work being looked after at home.  The son is the breadwinner and when he becomes ill, the State gives him £2 17s 6d a week because he has no dependants.  It is about time something was done about <Col N="390" /> that and that it was realised that the bread-winner who is in fact keeping dependants all his life should not be cut down to a single person's allowance when he becomes ill.</P>
      <P>If he has children, he can draw an allowance for them and can even draw a housekeeper's allowance for one of them if she is over 16 and looking after the others, but if he has a mother or sister, they are not dependants and therefore not entitled to any benefit.  I do not want the Minister to say that will cost a lot of money.  It will certainly cost money but it is something that should be looked into and there is no reason why some effort should not be made to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me for moving from one item to another as I am taking them in the order in which I have them noted.  There is also the case of the man who is sick or unemployed and has a dependent wife. He has no difficulty in proving that benefit is due for the wife and indeed the family but the woman who is employed and unfortunate enough to have a dependent husband will have the greatest difficulty in proving the husband is dependent.  Several months ago I had a case of somebody who after a considerable time because of her own mistakes &mdash; she did not deal properly with the certification; the Department were not responsible for that delay&mdash; succeeded in getting benefit paid to herself.  She had a dependent husband as everybody knew and as even the investigating officer must have been aware, but so far as I know she has not yet been paid benefit in respect of the husband.  To every inquiry I made I got the same answer: &ldquo;The matter is still under consideration.&rdquo;  What consideration has to be given to whether the man is dependent on the wife or not?  If he is working and able to work, he is not dependent; if he is not working or able to work, he is dependent, and if she does not provide for him he goes hungry.  That being so, I cannot understand this mumbo-jumbo.  She has stamped cards and according to the regulations she is entitled to this benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of domestic servants or female farm workers <Col N="391" /> who are entitled, under the regulation produced here a couple of years ago, to draw unemployment benefit in certain circumstances.  The circumstances are that they must have ten years stamps.  Would the Minister not agree that some effort should be made to change this regulation because in fact it rules out about 90 per cent of those people.  They are stamping cards but cannot draw any benefit from them. What difference is there between the girl who works in a factory or in a café and the girl who works in a private house?  The girl in the private house is usually employed for longer hours and does much harder work and usually for the whole seven days of the week.  But if she is out of a job, she cannot draw unemployment benefit unless she has ten years stamps.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that the only reason that condition has been included is to ensure that domestic servants have to look for a job very quickly or otherwise go hungry?  Is it not true that the only reason the provision was put there was to ensure at all times an adequate supply of domestic servants, cheap labour readily available?  If there is any other reason I should be grateful to hear it from the Minister when he is replying.  Down through the years various types of workers have been described as the modern slaves.  They have been gradually taken off mainly through trade union action.  The trouble with domestic servants is that it is impossible to organise them in a trade union because of the type of service they have, and the result is that they are abandoned by the State.  This is something about which the Minister might do the big thing and say that domestic servants and female farm workers are no worse than anybody else and since they are paying for their benefit, they are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things referred to in the Minister's Estimate speech and also in SW4.  I am not quite sure whether they belong to either.  The question of free footwear and the question of free fuel, which are administered by the local authorities, do not seem to fit into the social welfare code at all.  Perhaps the Minister would be <Col N="392" /> able to give me some further information about this.  Is the Minister aware that in regard to the footwear scheme, the home assistance section will get it free, but those who are not in the home assistance section will usually get a voucher entitling them to get footwear at an assisted price?  I do not know whether the Minister goes into the same type of home as I do, but I have had the experience of going into a house where a man with nine children who was earning £9 per week gross &mdash; his take-home pay would be much less than that&mdash;got footwear vouchers for six of them, three of the vouchers requiring an addition of 22/6d and the others requiring an addition of 17/-.  I should like to see how this man could, out of £9, buy the week's groceries, pay the rent and so on, and pay for footwear out of what was left.  If he were able to do that, then the Bible would have to be rewritten because the miracle of the loaves and fishes would not appear as great as it is.</P>
    <P>This whole system is based on the idea that if somebody is given a voucher for one child, that solves the problem.  However, where country families are big and where wages are small, it is absolutely impossible for these people to manage.  The Minister should include grants or make a regulation, if he can, to ensure that other sections, apart from the home assistance section, will get the full money for the purchase of shoes.  I know the big trouble is that applications for free footwear are so numerous and the amount of money made available so small that it is not easy to spread it around; and the officials who are responsible for disbursing it, instead of kicking up a row about the smallness of the amount they have been given, usually try to fit in everybody.  Therefore, instead of having a smaller number satisfied, nobody at all will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>In SW4 there is a statement which appears all right, but which, when one goes into the actual working of the social welfare code, makes a mockery of it.  Reference is made to treatment benefit on page 41 of the booklet which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Treatment benefit which is available for the time being to insured persons comprises payment of the whole or part of the cost of dental treatment and dentures, spectacles, including any necessary eye examination and contact lenses, and hearing aids.</P>
    <P>Then it gives the contribution conditions for this benefit.  I do not meet many people who get the whole of the cost of their dentures or spectacles or contact lenses paid by the Department. I understand that the regular payment now is one-third of the cost.  Let me go back to the man with the £9 per week and a wife and family to support. He requires dentures and is told the dentures will cost him £27 and the Department of Social Welfare will give him £9.  What does he do?  I am afraid he continues to have an aching mouth, because he certainly will not be able to get the necessary treatment if he has to pay for the dentures out of his own pocket.</P>
    <P>The Department should not be so niggardly in dealing with treatment benefit payments.  This is a simple matter, and if they met even two-thirds or a little more of the cost, it would probably meet the problem.  What happens in the Department is that we have, dealing with this matter, a group of people who would not be aware of the fact that people do not have £18 just when they want it and cannot write a cheque for £18 when it is required. These people are usually just slightly over the breadline &mdash; some of them indeed may be under it &mdash; and yet they are asked to pay more money than they will get after a fortnight's work for what apparently is considered by the Department a luxury, dentures or spectacles.  The amount of money being made available, as I said at the start, for social welfare benefit, may appear enormous.  My regret is that the percentage of the national income being devoted to social welfare is still dropping. The amount should be increased, and I see no reason why the State should not make an attempt to do it.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of other matters which could be referred to under this Estimate, but in view of the <Col N="394" /> fact that the Social Welfare Bill will be coming before the House next week, perhaps they would be more relevant to that Bill.  However, there is one other matter to which I wish to refer, that is, occupational injuries insurance. The Minister gave great detail about occupational injuries insurance and how it has been operating.  I have some complaints about the operation of this insurance.  First of all, I have a complaint that if somebody applies for social welfare benefit and it is assumed that it is DB he is applying for, he gets paid.  If it is found out after a couple of weeks that it should be OI, it can be a considerable period before the person receives the OI payments. There is no reason in the world why this should be so.  If he applies first for OI and if the necessary forms are sent in, there should be no delay. Occasionally somebody will send in a certificate to say he has a broken arm which he has sustained in driving a lorry for his employer.  After a couple of weeks the State will send a note to him to know if the injury is the result of an accident.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not this sort of thing is teething trouble, whether or not it is something which can be cleared up after a short period. I believe it is something that should not occur.  While the Department have a good reputation, we need only to have a few cases of disgruntled people who do not get benefits at the right time to have quite a number of complaints building up.  The place to air this is this House so that an opportunity will be given to the Department to have the matter cleared up.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to payments to people in our mental hospitals.  It has become the practice, I understand, for the mental hospital people to take the entire social welfare benefits and give back to the patient only a small amount in what are called comforts. If the patient is the breadwinner of a family, this can cause very serious disruption, because such a person is not in a position to sign a document to the effect that the payment should be made to another member of his family <Col N="395" /> while he is in hospital.  That is something which requires very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>There is the other aspect of a person who is in the county home for treatment and not for shelter.  It has become standard practice as far as I am aware in all county homes, as we call them, for the money paid out of social welfare, whether a disability benefit, an old age pension or a widow's pension, to be impounded by the authorities, and all cases are treated as if they were in fact in there because they needed shelter.  We may be told this is a question of relieving the rates and that if the amount is paid directly to the person, it will be squandered.  This is a question of dealing fairly with people who are in a bad position, and the onus should be on the Department to ensure that if a person is entitled to such a benefit, that benefit is paid directly to him and not to a third party. If these people are in for shelter, the regulations are clear.  The money must be taken, and they are given back portion of it.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister, and through him, to his officials, that I have had the greatest respect for the activities of his Department over the years, but over the past 12 months I have noticed that one or two officials have got into the habit either of evading the issue or giving a sharp answer which is not appreciated by me.  It would be a pity if the good reputation of the Department were to be spoiled by a few people.  There is one group of people in the Department who deserve great credit, the people dealing with the records.  The records section and the index section of the Department can supply information on request to a greater extent than could be expected in normal circumstances, and in all cases they are most courteous.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to some people who were not so courteous, I often felt that I should get in touch with a senior official and bring the matter to his notice.  I do not believe in bothering the Minister with complaints which can be dealt with elsewhere, but I want to make one thing clear.  If in future <Col N="396" /> someone in the Department, or in any Government Department, is discourteous when asked a straight question, I will have no hesitation in bringing the matter to the notice of the person responsible for the running of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing God's work in looking after our less fortunate brethren, people who in many cases cannot do anything for themselves.  The Minister and his officials have been doing a very good job.  They have extended the Department, and they have increased the allowances to the people we wanted to get increased allowances.  We hope that our prosperity will continue and that we will be able to do more and more for our old age pensioners, our unemployed and other social welfare beneficiaries, and all the others who draw from the Department from time to time.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Regional Health Authority of Dublin city and county and Dún Laoghaire.  I was chairman last year.  We have set up a social welfare department working in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare.  Our deep concern is simply this.  We are anxious to see that no citizen in this State is hungry. We have very dedicated men on that authority.  I have the greatest respect for them, just as I have for the Minister's officials.  There should be the fullest co-ordination possible between the Department and the department run by Dublin Health Authority.  Even within the past few months, I have found that people who were wealthy at one time now find themselves for one reason or another almost on the verge of being hungry.  They are not entitled to social welfare benefits.  Perhaps they were self-employed.  The Department should co-operate with the department run by Dublin Health Authority or other authorities to see that no citizen in this State is in want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an adult who has to pay rent for a house &mdash; whether he is single, or living with his widowed mother, or with his father who may be an old age pensioner &mdash; I should like to see that type of citizen, after all the <Col N="397" /> outgoings were paid, with a minimum of £3 a week.  In some cases they have only £2 4s and they have to pay rent for a house.  Dublin Health Authority have come to their aid as far as we could.  I am dealing only with my own authority.  We feel that there is a gap and that there is social injustice, and we should like to see that gap closed. No one on any side of the House wants to see anyone hungry, or on the verge of starvation.</P>
    <P>Great advances have been made by our Party and by the Department during the past few years.  I wish the Minister and his courteous officials well.  I am anxious that the point I raised should be looked into and that if possible we will have more co-ordination between the various health authorities, because it is our bounden duty, as public men, to see that no citizen is in want through no fault of his own.  It is part of the work of public representatives to see after such matters.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay a tribute to the voluntary organisations which have achieved so much and which have co-operated over the years.  Despite heartening developments in our social services, there is still a slight gap here and there and that is something we shall always have.  The wonderful advance in these services in the past few years is a tribute to the Ministers for Social Welfare of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on his work during the past year.  May he live long to continue the good work on behalf of our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> My first point concerns the investigation of the means of applicants for the old age pension.  When these applicants approach their local Deputy, either because they failed to get the pension or because they did not get as much as they thought they would get, they are frequently unable to remember what they told the information officer.  That is because they were frightened or agitated during the interviews.  Would it be possible for the information officer or other type of investigation officer <Col N="398" /> to give a carbon copy of the applicant's statement to the applicant?  It should be a simple matter and I see no reason why it should not be done.  It would be a great help to the public representative who would be able to tell his constituent on examination of the carbon copy, whether or not he is entitled to the pension.</P>
      <P>What is the function of old age pension committees?  Sometimes people who go before old age pension committees understand from them that they will receive a certain amount of pension only to discover, later, that that is not the amount given by the pensions officer&mdash;and immediately the pensioners have a sense of grievance.  They may go to their public representative and say that the pension committee awarded them so much but that it was later taken from them.  Probably it is withdrawn strictly in accordance with the regulations but the trouble is that, in the first instance, they were told they would receive such and such an amount.  These old age pension committees are anxious to be kind and, being local people, they want to do the charitable thing but often they do more harm than good in this respect.  On occasion, they stir up a hornet's nest.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to children's allowances.  It seems strange that this is one of the assistance payments or benefits for which there is no means test whatsoever.  It is one of the most immutable benefits &mdash; if that is the proper adjective &mdash; under the social welfare code.  It is not classified for taxation purposes.  It seems strange that there is no means test for children's allowances whereas the social welfare code, in many other respects, is administered on the basis of a strict means test and great care is taken to ensure that a person does not draw benefit at the same time under two particular sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could we not have a more uniform system in the estimating of means? There is one system for widows, another system for old age pensions and another system for unemployment assistance.  It should be possible to formulate a more uniform system which would apply to all three.  They might be at different levels but it should be possible <Col N="399" /> to devise a more uniform method of assessing means because there seem to be different methods for the different codes.  We may be at a transition stage in social welfare administration and it is possible that the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour will, in time, formulate the uniform approach that is so desirable.</P>
    <P>The present system of agencies throughout the country, like sub-postmasters, is not desirable.  The administration of social welfare at local level has become too political. The appointment of agencies and subagents, being purely Ministerial and very political, is wrong.  The appeals officer, and such, are civil service appointments and are entirely outside that criticism.  However, it is desirable that the appointment of agencies in social welfare administration be modified and brought into line with civil service appointments in general.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the Minister and the House.  I congratulate the Minister on this Estimate. I rise to ask him to confer with the Minister for Justice on the subject of signing for unemployment assistance at least along the western seaboard. Strictly speaking it is a matter for the Minister for Justice but I feel the Minister for Social Welfare should confer with him with a view to having more centres so that recipients of unemployment assistance may sign within three miles of their home.  In my constituency, there are people who are situated from ten to 12 miles from the signing centre.  Surely that is too far a distance for them to travel?  The majority of a man's day is wasted in travel when he could otherwise be doing some useful work such as saving turf.  I urge the Minister for Social Welfare to intercede with the Minister for Justice to open up more signing centres for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank those Deputies who contributed to this debate for their usual realistic approach to the Estimate.  Of course, we heard some hardy annuals of complaint. <Col N="400" /> In his opening remarks, Deputy Ryan referred to the haphazard manner in which social welfare is handled but what he said does not conform to the actual facts of our general code. If I may say so in relation to this, one of the surprises I received on investigating the systems obtaining in other countries on many occasions since I came into office was that I found how relatively favourably our system compares with those systems.  It is true that the assistance we give has been brought about year after year, a bit now and a bit again, but this all tends to close some gap or improve some rate or expand further the system already in operation and I suppose that is how social welfare developed generally in any country.  At the same time, in conjunction with this improvement in the system, as the years went on there was a re-awakening of the public conscience in regard to what amount of the national income should be distributed to the weaker sections.  Mark you, one has to bring the public conscience with him in cases of this kind in order to make it possible and easier to pay what some years ago might have been regarded as a ridiculous demand from some sections.</P>
      <P>We have moved rapidly here and in many cases more rapidly than other countries in relation to the staff we have.  Deputy Ryan admitted that this is a very big Estimate, and it certainly is.  In that respect it would not at all support the suggestion that the Department should be amalgamated with the Department of Health.  These two Departments are modern Departments which are dealing with problems which are becoming more obvious day after day and year after year, and the volume of work involved and the progress that has yet to be made and maintained would more than justify the continuance of each as a separate Ministry.  In fact, there is a much greater justification for a separate Ministry for each of these Departments now than there was when they were first established.  The position so far as the future is concerned would seem to justify more and more the separation of these Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some need for liaison between <Col N="401" /> the two Departments but one could say that that exists in respect of any two Departments, and I do not think there is any lack of proper liaison so far as the working of these two Departments is concerned.  Of course, the work of the Department of Labour often dovetails in with the Department of Social Welfare, just as the work of my Department does with the Department of Health and sometimes other Departments as well.  The general field of social welfare, I would say, will always require continuous vigilance and constant improvement in order to meet the growing needs and contingengencies which present themselves as a changing society moves on from year to year.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the points that were mentioned.  Deputy Tully was mainly concerned with deficiencies in administration.  He criticised what he called the reduction in the percentage of the national income. This figure is frequently misused and we prefer to take other more interesting figures which give a proper comparison, such as the percentage of the gross national product or the percentage of the total revenue which is devoted to social welfare.  When we take these, we find a very favourable picture in comparison with other countries.  When Deputy Ryan, Deputy Cluskey of the Labour Party and I discussed the question of social welfare on television recently, we discussed this matter of percentages and there is no need to stress the point further except to point to the significant increase that has taken place in the amount given as a percentage of gross national product or of total revenue. By any test it has been a magnificent increase over the years, a very creditable percentage increase, and it must certainly mark very definite progress and I am glad to have the support of Opposition Deputies in their approval of this.</P>
    <P>In examining our social welfare code as I am doing and as I have done to a great extent, I hope to bring about some improvements in the not too distant future and as time goes on, to bring in all the necessary changes <Col N="402" /> which would be of some urgency.  I find that our social welfare code, and others who attended the International Labour Organisation Conference will bear me out, compares rather favourably in its coverage with that of many other countries.  Indeed, to conform to the minimum standards required to sign the International Labour Conference was not at all difficult for this country and I am sure that those who carried out the examination found our standards quite acceptable in order to reach the minimum standards required.  That is not to say that any of us who have anything to do with social welfare can rest or be content until we succeed in getting the different anomalies removed and the gaps closed and the necessary coverage which will include those sections which one must admit are not sufficiently covered at present.  While doing this we must have regard also to the rates we are paying already to those on the payroll, so to speak, and in that regard every year has been marked by some significant change.  This year was no exception and the amount which I was able to get from the Minister for Finance was a reasonably good amount, sufficient to make a significant improvement in social payments generally.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, we must take account of the fact that on the social assistance side, on the non-contributory side, the Exchequer has to come to the aid of a very large number to cover payments to very needy sections who are not in any way supported by contributions. This is a complete liability on the State and on the Exchequer, and the fact that it is now over £45 million per year is something for which people who talk about an insurance scheme do not always give us credit.  I am not decrying the amount for a moment &mdash; I am only sorry it is not greater &mdash; but I mention the fact to emphasise the difficulty involved for the State where only a proportionately small section or a relatively small section of the community is in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>Most speakers referred to old age pension sub-committee decisions and the disappointment suffered by an applicant when he is notified by the committee that he has been awarded <Col N="403" /> a certain figure and later gets a notice telling him that the welfare officer is appealing against the decision.  Notwithstanding the fact that some committees tend to err on the generous side, when they know perfectly well they are not acting within the statutory regulations, at the same time we have many sub-committees which take a serious view of their responsibilities.  In all cases the fact that a local jury, so to speak, is empowered to have a look at claims acts as a buffer between the applicant and the State and tends, I would say, to have a beneficial effect on this whole question of investigation.  The investigation officer is entitled to be present at the sub-committee meeting, if he is so requested, and he will give reasons why he arrived at a certain assessment.  This is a very fair and intimate method, in my opinion, of assessing means.  It is a system I would not be too ready to condemn.  It has been suggested frequently that these committees should be abolished because they serve no useful purpose but, having served as a member of such committees, I believe they do serve the purpose of ensuring that local people with intimate knowledge have a right to probe the method adopted by the investigation officer and the very fact that the committee are enabled to do that must have some effect on his approach in his investigation. In that way I believe they serve a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to something which I have never come across.  It is the complaint that applicants are not given a carbon copy of the statements made originally.  I should not like to be rude about that, but one very good way of remembering a statement is to make a true statement.  It is easier to remember a true statement than an incorrect one.  The old adage says that liars require good memories.  The complaint that people are not given a copy of this statement is not a general one, but I would say that every assistance would be given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It should not be difficult for a person making a statement to have a copy.  I was glad to hear Deputy Tully say he would favour some selectivity in the payment of children's allowances.  This is a matter we are examining at the moment and, were it not for the fact that this examination is taking place, I am sure some increase in children's allowances would have been announced in the Budget.  I, like Deputy Tully, do not believe that the huge amount involved in paying allowances in respect of approximately 1,000,000 children should be paid out without any recourse to means or conditions.  I attended a social welfare conference recently and the main concern of that conference was family affairs.  I found that practically every country in Europe pays children's allowances on a selective basis.  This enables a greater amount to be paid to fewer people and therefore permits of a better rate of allowance.  That is exactly what I am trying to work out at the moment. It may be possible to do this without having a means test, or it may not, but I certainly favour generous increases on a selective basis rather than smaller increases on a general basis, smaller increases to people, as Deputy Tully said, who could manage without them, to put it mildly.  He said they sneaked into the post office to draw the allowances. I would not go as far as that. They used to lodge them to the children's insurance account, or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a system whereby some arrangement can be made with the bank.  I would not be definite about that.  There are usually a number of complaints about investigation methods.  As Deputy Tully admitted towards the end of his speech, the overall picture is that these matters are carried out very well; a few extreme cases come to light and they damage the image of the Department. <Col N="405" /> We do not want people to think that we are out to deprive them of any benefits to which they are entitled, but there must be some means by which we can arrive at who is and who is not entitled to what.  For that reason investigation has to be carried out and it is inevitable, I suppose, that sometimes the approach is not right.  There are also cases in which the proper degree of co-operation is not forthcoming. Complaints lie both ways.  In regard to investigation, they usually boil down to rather insignificant things.  There is the extreme case, which Deputy Tully has mentioned on a number of occasions here, of people being cut off a few days before Christmas.  No instructions are given to investigation officers in regard to that and, as far as they are concerned, their work must be done when it is due to be done.  It is, I suppose, unfortunate if someone is temporarily deprived of payments just coming up to Christmas, a time when people always like to have some bit of money to spend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They get much better rates than that.  The dentists <Col N="406" /> taking part in our scheme have recently submitted proposals to me for improvements in the scheme and have been a little impatient because they have not had any replies in relation to decisions taken.  We are merely waiting for sanction from Finance for what we propose giving at the present time and we will be able to announce some improvements in the scheme and in the treatment and in the operation of our scheme by the dentists very shortly.  By and large, they do a very good job and we have a very good relationship with them.  We feel that this scheme does merit a good deal of praise from the people concerned because it is doing a very good job in dental preservation, particularly in the case of young people under 21 years of age.</P>
      <P>I will be coming before the House next week with a Social Welfare Bill to give effect to the changes announced in the Budget and the usual consequential matters and some other things pertaining to social welfare and will have to cover a lot of this ground again and I do not want to say now a great deal in a general way about the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, I have virtually completed and have already submitted to the Government my memorandum with regard to proposed improvements in the scheme.  As I have said, I do not want to issue it in the form of a White Paper because there would be an immediate clamour for its implementation <i>in toto.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The health proposals do not lend themselves to the same treatment as my proposals.  I prefer to take from the generally accepted blueprint for future improvements the more urgent, the more acceptable and the more desirable things and have them implemented as time goes on and as rapidly as conditions and circumstances will permit.  I am not prepared to enter into an auction in the matter of social welfare because it is a subject in regard to <Col N="407" /> which all political Parties make a good deal of heavy weather.  Irrespective of how good our services may be, for one who is in Opposition it will always be the popular thing to say that the poorer sections of the community are not properly treated.  That will always be an acceptable phrase and a good off-platform statement to make.  The fact remains that this is a serious matter which must of necessity be influenced, if not entirely controlled, by the rate of national economic development. Thank God, in recent years, circumstances have permitted us to expand considerably and to go a long way.  As I have said on so many occasions, if the next few years find us making the same progress as has been made in the past few years, we will have a more comprehensive social welfare code.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the House for the expeditious and constructive way in which they have discussed this important Estimate.</P>

      <P>The kind of initiative which is referred to in the first part of the Deputy's question has already been taken by certain Governments under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to which Greece is a party.  In accordance with the procedure envisaged under this Convention a Special Commission has been set up by the European Commission of Human Rights to carry out a full investigation on the subject and, if possible, to achieve a friendly settlement.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate or helpful for Ireland at this stage to take any initiative or to make any representations on the lines indicated in the second part of the question.</P>

      <P>First aid equipment is carried at all times.  Special stretchers are carried for particular ambulance missions.  Resuscitation equipment and other specialised medical equipment are provided by the medical team, comprising doctor and nurse, who accompany all patients on helicopter ambulance missions. Oxygen, saline drips and surgical suction pumps are carried as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection and procurement of other types of medical equipment is kept under review.  This involves <Col N="420" /> thorough medical and aerodynamical investigation as some readily available items are not suitable for use in flight. Any suggestion made by the medical personnel for additional equipment will be considered.</P>

      <P>Payments of occupational injuries benefit in respect of the children of a man who dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease take the form of an addition to a pension payable to his widow, or of an orphan's pension.  Illegitimate children resident with the widow are, like legitimate children, eligible for inclusion in the widow's pension if they were normally resident with her or her husband when he died.  When there is no widow, payment of an orphan's pension may be made in respect of an illegitimate child, maintained by the deceased at the time of his death, if the mother is dead and the father is dead or unknown.  A child, legitimate or illegitimate, whose mother is living is not an orphan within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>These arrangements for payments in respect of illegitimate children are similar to those operating in relation to widows (contributory) pension and orphans (contributory) allowance under the general social insurance scheme and further provision is not contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated yearly cost of the increase in rates of social welfare payments announced in the 1968 Budget is £9,276,000.  Of this, £3,581,000 relating to social assistance services is borne in full by the Exchequer, and £5,695,000 relating to social insurance services is borne by the Exchequer, employers and employees.  It is not possible to express these figures in terms of cost per per week.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that, as compared with 38.1 per cent in 1967-68, the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund in 1968-69 will be around 34.8 per cent.  This is still in excess of the figure of 33? per cent which was envisaged as the Exchequer contribution to the Fund when the unified social insurance scheme was introduced in 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have recently indicated in the course of a Seanad debate, I am aware that many purchasers of new cars are induced to sign a form of guarantee which represents a reduction rather than an increase in the possibilities of legal redress in the event of the cars proving unsatisfactory.  I have arranged to have this matter examined as part of the consumer protection programme which I have in hand, and I shall await the outcome of this examination before deciding whether any action by me is called for.</P>

      <P>No.  The purchaser's legal rights are not taken away but some of his statutory rights are being taken away in the sense that he is signing them away, in the sense that he is signing the guarantee.  The amendment of the legislation in that regard would apply not merely to motor cars but to the sale of goods.  Therefore, it is not just that simple to amend the Sale of Goods Act like that.  There is a comprehensive programme of consumer protection under way in my Department. This forms part of it and it is receiving priority.</P>

      <P>The only consultations with the British authorities likely to arise in connection with the exploration of the Irish Sea relate to the determination of the exact position of the line dividing the continental shelf in the area between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government is to secure the most thorough and efficient exploration and development of the natural resources of the continental shelf by providing, as in the land area, attractive facilities to private enterprise concerns, having the necessary technical and financial resources.  The Continental Shelf Act, 1968, which provides the statutory framework for such operations, became law on 11th June, 1968.</P>

I doubt if we could get somebody who would provide all the technical know-how merely on a contractual basis.  Past experience in regard to mining has shown us that the operation of private enterprise in this field has been very much more effective than State enterprise. The financial risks involved are very great &mdash; with no certainty of success: indeed, the probability of failure.  In these circumstances, it seems much more advantageous to us to allow portions of the area to be surveyed by people who have the technical and financial resources to do it, whose business it is and whose capital is invested on the basis of having a strike, say, of one in 20 or one in more than 20 survey areas.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to footwear the importation of which is controlled by quota.  Certain types of footwear may be freely imported on payment of the appropriate customs duty.  In the case of footwear which is subject to quota restrictions, import licences are granted only to firms registered under the relevant quota order.  Distribution of the quota is on the basis of each registered firm's Irish purchases in a base year.  The only additions to the quota register are new firms engaged in the wholesale distribution of footwear.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.  Particulars of grants paid by An Foras Tionscal are given in the annual reports published by that body.  These reports are available in the Library. The reports do not distinguish between Irish controlled and foreign-controlled firms and records are not kept in a form which would make the required information readily available.  A fully accurate and up-to-date statement in the matter of control could be made only on the basis of an examination in the Companies Registration Office records of the current shareholding in each grant-aided firm.</P>
      <P>As particulars regarding the names of the firms that failed since 1957-58 and their classification between Irish and foreign promotion is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose with your permission, A Cheann Comhairle to have the statement circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Price Index number (base August, 1947= 100) was 135 at mid-February, 1957, and 200 at mid-May, 1968.  The index is calculated in respect of mid-February, mid-May, mid-August and <Col N="450" /> mid-November each year.  The Government have continued in force, by sixmonthly Continuance Orders, the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965, and I will continue to exercise the powers which I derive from that Order to ensure that prices are not increased unnecessarily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that they have been a failure with regard to reducing the cost of living?  Will the Minister bring his mind back to 1957 when Mr. de Valera, then Taoiseach, at Belmullet, and Deputy Lemass at Dungarvan on the same night, said that if they were elected, they would not increase the price of bread because it was such an important item in the diet of the poor?  They did not promise to stabilise the cost of living but they both promised to reduce the cost of living.  Further, is it the Government's intention to make promises and then when they get into power, forget about them and increase the cost of living by almost 50 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Any reasonable or rational approach to this requires of course that you do not have regard only to the cost of living but also to the standard and level of wages.  On that basis the level of wages has increased considerably more than the cost of living and therefore the standard of living has increased and has not been reduced.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are a considerable number of mentally handicapped persons at present in St. Brendan's Hospital.  The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap did not rule out the use of mental hospitals for the care of the mentally handicapped provided there were adequate arrangements for the segregation of the mentally handicapped and mentally ill patients.</P>
      <P>I have approved a proposal by Dublin Health Authority to centre their services for the mentally handicapped at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  This will involve the transfer to that hospital of the mentally handicapped patients now cared for in St. Brendan's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the future, the health authority propose to care for all their mentally handicapped patients, in a portion of St. Ita's which will be effectively <Col N="455" /> separated from the portion accommodating the psychiatric patients.  Dublin Health Authority's services for the mentally handicapped will be under the control of a medical director whose function will be to direct and co-ordinate their services for the mentally handicapped.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not available to me precise information about changes which may have taken place in each health authority area.  During the period referred to there may have been minor changes, of which my Department is unaware, in the children's accommodation in some hospitals.  The main changes since May, 1967 were as follows: (a) A paediatric unit containing 40 beds has been opened at St. Camillus Hospital, Limerick.  It is associated with the paediatric unit of the Limerick Regional General Hospital. (b) Twelve additional children's beds and two cots have been provided at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin.  (c) An additional five beds have been provided at Our Lady's hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>The question of children's bed requirements generally will be considered in the light of the recommendations concerning the future development of the general hospital services which I received last week from the Consultative Council on General Hospital Services.</P>

      <P>As indicated in paragraph 131 of the White Paper, the details of the proposed regions would not be put before the House until the principle of establishing them has been accepted by the enactment of forthcoming legislation.</P>
      <P>In deciding on the details of the regions, regard will be had to the recommendations on regionalisation in the recently-published Report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services.  These recommendations will have to be examined in the light of what might be best for the administration of other health services and of more general concepts of regionalisation for other purposes.  The eventual determination of the details of the regions will be subject to approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into any argument with the Minister but I just want to clear this matter. A few weeks ago I asked a supplementary <Col N="466" /> question on a question by Deputy O'Connell about this.  The Minister assured me that he then had no information whatever about the regions.  He subsequently wrote to confirm that that was so.  Last week, I asked him in the House if it was true that, in fact, details of the regions were in his possession and that he proposed to have a press conference on Friday last?  He said details were not in his possession but that he proposed to have a press conference on something else.  A press conference was held and the information given would suggest that the full information about the regions must be in the possession of the Department of Health.  Otherwise, the decision to locate hospitals in certain areas would be stupid in the extreme.  The question I want to ask is: is it the intention of the Minister for Health to set up those regions and to have everything cut and dried before a packet deal is put before this House and the representatives of the local authorities, who are vitally affected by the decision, left completely in the dark until the House gets something put before it and they are told: &ldquo;Take it or leave it&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to make it clear.  The Deputy is confusing the recommendations of the Consultative Council with the general concept of regionalisation.  Certainly, there are proposals by the Consultative Council, as the Deputy knows, in regard to regionalisation for hospital administration purposes only, but I have said in my reply that the proposals that I will put to the House in regard to regionalisation will be decided in the light of what the Members of the House think and in the light of considerations about planning generally because regionalisation covers other matters than the general hospital services. I hope that makes the situation clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It does make it slightly clearer.  May I ask this further question?  If the Minister says that the only consideration at present is the regionalisation of the hospital services, is it not correct to say that if he is regionalising the hospital services, he must be regionalising the health <Col N="467" /> areas covered by these hospitals, and is it not true that, if he does that, it can mean that County Meath, for instance, can be split in two and, as rumour has it, one-half tied to Tullamore and the other tied to Drogheda, and the local authority members who have been elected to administer that area, including the Health Committee members, of whom I am one, will not be aware of it until it comes to the floor of this House?  Is that the situation because, if it is, I think the rights of the people are being trampled on? I also think that the suggestion made by the Minister for Local Government that he did not want to break up constituencies and counties is absolute nonsense.</P>

Again, may I reiterate that the proposals in the recent report concern the administration of the general hospital services and they suggest certain regions?  There is also a proposal in the White Paper for the abolition of local health authorities altogether. I think the House will accept at this stage that the general principle of regionalisation of the health services generally, not just the administration of the hospital services, has been accepted.</P>

      <P>Information in the form requested by the Deputy is not available.  The decision as to the charge, if any, to be levied on eligible patients for hospital in-patient services is taken on the basis of the patient's circumstances at that time and not on whether he is considered to be in the lower or middle income group.  Of course, persons holding medical cards <Col N="470" /> are entitled to these services free of charge in a public ward.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to paragraph 61 of the White Paper on the Health Services and Their Further Development which quotes an estimate that no charge was made in the case of 60 per cent of the middle income group patients and that half of the remaining 40 per cent were charged 5/- a day or less.</P>

      <P>The rotating bed referred to, which is a fairly recent development, offers prospects of greatly reducing the burden of nursing care of the immobile patient.  I have already approved the purchase of a number of these beds by the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre and other hospitals.

      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind the mental health authority's proposals for replacing certain old buildings at the rear of the main block of St. Columba's Hospital, Sligo.  These proposals involve, mainly, the provision of a new central boilerhouse and laundry in other locations, thus to make way for the erection, subsequently, of a new central kitchen at <Col N="471" /> the rear of the main block.  The proposed siting of the new boilerhouse has been agreed to and I understand that the mental health authority's consulting engineer is at present carrying out some preliminary investigations regarding the type of boiler installation required before he proceeds with the design work.  It is not yet possible to say when building work on the new boilerhouse will start.</P>
      <P>As to the proposed replacement of the present laundry at St. Columba's Hospital, this must be considered in relation to the future organisation of laundry services for hospitals and other health institutions.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the owner of this holding is a married man with a young family? The work could be completed by the expenditure of £1,000 or £2,000 necessary to re-erect the protection wall which has been knocked down for some years as a result of sea erosion? If something is not done immediately, this man's farm will be washed away. Is the Minister further aware that on the next farm, which is not vested land, Land Commission employees are passing back and forth repairing breaches in the embankment and if the work I am referring to is not done this man's holding and other holdings in the area will be in danger, too.</P>

We are spending money day in and day out on the land reclamation scheme.  This is a very good holding, one of the best in County Kerry.  Surely a few thousand pounds would be money well spent to give this man an opportunity of protecting his land?  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this, in view of the fact that he is spending money year in and <Col N="477" /> year out to protect the embankments on the holding of this man's neighbour?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is need for legislation of the nature suggested by the Deputy.  The great majority of Irish farmers are now the owners of the shooting rights over their lands.  In regard to those cases where the shooting rights were reserved to the former landlords or other parties on the sale of the tenants' holdings under the Land Purchase Acts, there is already adequate provision in the Land Acts for the transfer of these reserved rights to the owners of the holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Deputy Pattison gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 36 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On yesterday's Order Paper Question No. 36 was addressed by me to the Minister for Defence. I asked why an Army private whose name I now give, Private John O'Brien, whose home address was 14 Lower Staplestown Road, Carlow, who became ill on 6th December 1966 at Renmore Barracks, Galway was treated for gastric influenza when in fact he was suffering from appendicitis; why he was transferred to Athlone for hospital treatment and from there to the Saint Bricin's Hospital, Dublin in order to undergo an operation for appendicitis with perforated appendix; if, in view of the fact that this man died on 17th December, 1966, he has caused a full investigation to be made into all aspects of this matter; and, if so, with what result.</P>
      <P>The reply I got from the Minister was not satisfactory.  That is why we are here on the Adjournment this evening.  The replies sent to the parents of this young man when they demanded a full inquiry were far from satisfactory.  The parents and all others acquainted with the circumstances of his death feel that proper and adequate medical treatment was not afforded to Private O'Brien and that he was not treated with the urgency his condition demanded and that the procedure which the medical authorities within the Defence Forces arranged contributed to, if they were not the main factor in his death.  These replies did not convince the parents of the deceased.  Nor has the time which has elapsed since the death of this young man healed their sorrow and anguish, not to mention their severe loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a number of points in the Minister's reply.  The Minister said that Private O'Brien had no symptoms of appendicitis when examined <Col N="491" /> in Galway but I should like to ask on what basis was gastric influenza diagnosed?  Was it high temperature or vomiting or pain in the stomach?  I know that Private O'Brien was suffering from pain in the stomach and was vomiting at that time.  Are these not the same as the symptoms of appendicitis? Everyone knows when we hear of somebody complaining of pain in the stomach and vomiting, the first thing you think of is appendicitis.  It is the first thing everybody thinks of if they have not had their appendix removed before that.</P>
    <P>Was there no suitable hospital in Galway where this man could be treated?  What was the reason for sending him 60 miles to Athlone for hospital treatment?  Of course when he was examined in Athlone, appendicitis was immediately diagnosed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears not to agree with me on that point but at least appendicitis was strongly suspected. Even at that I think it was a serious matter to send a man a further 80 miles to Dublin.  It is felt that he should have been attended to, if not in Galway, at least in Athlone because if appendicitis is diagnosed, immediate operation is vital and a long delay is always dangerous.  It would be reasonable to assume that Private O'Brien would be alive today if there had been a more urgent approach to his condition.</P>
      <P>Were there any surgeons at all in Athlone who could perform this relatively minor operation and if not, why have the Army not even a consultant surgeon attached to their hospital in Athlone?  The Minister must be aware that the mortality from operations for appendicitis is very low and that the operation is a very minor one.  We feel it is a shame that a young man in the prime of his life should succumb to a simple condition which is recognised by the medical profession as requiring a minor operation.  I should like to hear from the Minister what steps have been taken since to ensure that something like this will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Is the same procedure still being adopted when members of the Defence Forces become ill in Galway?  Are they still transported to Athlone, and if it is not possible to treat them there, are they still transported across the country, from one post to another, to Dublin for treatment?</P>
    <P>The parents feel that a second opinion should have been got, that the matter was taken too lightly when their son complained in Galway, and that he should not have been moved to Athlone at all.  It was admitted in the Minister's reply yesterday, and it was told to the father of this young man by the surgeon at St. Bricin's, that he was in very bad shape when he reached St. Bricin's Hospital.  If, as the Minister states, his condition in Athlone was one of suspected appendicitis, I wonder how in a matter of hours it would deteriorate to a point that, when he reached St. Bricin's Hospital in Dublin on the same evening, within minutes acute appendicitis with peritonitis was diagnosed.  It seems very strange to me, a layman, that this would have happened so quickly and with fatal results.</P>
    <P>The Minister also informed us in his reply that after the operation in St. Bricin's, the consultant surgeon was called in.  I should like to hear what the consultant surgeon had to say and what report he made.  The Minister made no reference to the fact that a second operation was performed some time after that, and I should like to know why that was deemed necessary. It is also important to know if there was a post-mortem carried out, and if not, why.</P>
    <P>The procedure adopted by the authorities in notifying the parents of this young man's illness was also very unsatisfactory. They were not notified until he was in a very dangerous condition in St. Bricin's Hospital.  Before the young man left Galway, he requested that his parents be notified, but they were not notified until&mdash;and here I should like to quote from the Minister's letter of 10th March, 1967, addressed to the father of Private O'Brien:</P>
    <P>...In accordance with normal procedure written notification of his admission to St. Bricin's Hospital <Col N="493" /> was addressed to you by the authorities at the hospital on the morning of 8th December, 1966, and after his condition was found to have deteriorated, the Garda Síochána in Carlow were requested at 5 p.m. on that date to inform you that he was seriously ill.</P>
    <P>Those parents should have been notified when he was leaving Galway.  It is another example, to my mind, of the very bad procedure which apparently is carried out when members of the Defence Forces become ill.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify all these points, because this situation leaves in everyone's mind a suspicion that privates in the Defence Forces are not, as far as medical attention is concerned, being accorded the standard of treatment they should get, that they are subject to the outmoded practice of being sent to military hospitals no matter how far away from these hospitals they are, with no one appearing to be in authority to say: &ldquo;We will send him to the nearest hospital.&rdquo;  The instruction seems to be: &ldquo;No matter what the condition, convey the soldier to St. Bricin's Hospital.&rdquo;  Of course in this case when the unfortunate man reached St. Bricin's, he was probably gone too far.  All the evidence suggests that at that point there was very little that could be done for him, and that calling in the consultant surgeon or the specialist, as the case may be, after the operation was not going to remedy the situation at that point.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister to have a full, independent, and impartial inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this case.  It is due to his parents.  It is due to all the people who know the circumstances of this man's death; indeed the whole country knows the circumstances today. It is due to other members of the Defence Forces and to everyone concerned in this case that such an inquiry, where all the evidence, including that of the parents could be heard, be arranged by the Minister as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="The Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>The Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Department nor myself has at any time tried to conceal anything in connection with the <Col N="494" /> circumstances of this young soldier's death.  The Department has, by correspondence, given pretty full information about the circumstances surrounding his death.  I think that Deputy Pattison's question is mainly or partly based on the information given by the Department.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion, veiled or otherwise, that there was negligence in the case as regards the diagnosis and that there was an unjustifiable amount of moving around of the patient by ambulance; there was also the suggestion that because he was a private he was treated with casual indifference.  I most emphatically repudiate these insinuations. The patient was handled at all stages with every consideration for his wellbeing.  Appropriate medical skills and care were directed to him throughout, and the actions proper to each stage of his illness, as diagnosed, were taken.</P>
      <P>I have already endeavoured to make it clear that the medical officer in Galway had not evidence on which to base a diagnosis of appendicitis.  By the time the patient had reached Athlone, symptoms had developed which were enough to raise a suspicion of appendicitis, yet not enough to make a definite and unequivocal diagnosis.  The difficulty of diagnosing appendicitis at this stage may have been due in part to the fact, subsequently revealed at the operation, that the patient's appendix was in an uncommon pelvic position.</P>
      <P>If the medical officer in Athlone had, in fact, sufficient evidence to support definite diagnosis of acute appendicitis, he would, in accordance with normal procedure, have sent the patient either to the private hospital in Ballinasloe or the county hospital in Mullingar for operation.  Facilities for such an operation did not exist at the time in the military hospital or, indeed, in any other hospital in Athlone. As I have said, there was no positive diagnosis of appendicitis made in Athlone, and the medical officer made the necessary arrangements to have him removed to St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patient was examined within minutes of admission to St. Bricin's by the emergency medical officer on duty, who immediately summoned the assistant <Col N="495" /> surgeon.  These two doctors diagnosed acute appendicitis, and arranged for urgent operation which was performed with all possible speed. Some days after his operation the patient's condition worsened and he had a raised temperature and diarrhoea. An exploratory operation was carried out on 15th December, 1966.  Deputy Pattison referred to this operation.  It was carried out by the surgeon consultant. This operation disclosed collections of blood-stained fluid which were evacuated and drained in the usual way.  Subsequent to this operation it was obvious to the surgeon that the worsening condition was not due to the original appendectomy but was an entro-colitis which was resistant to antibiotic treatment.  It is completely incorrect to suggest that the patient died of peritonitis.</P>
    <P>The patient was accompanied by a corporal of the Army Medical Corps in the ambulance all the way from Galway to Dublin.  At no stage during the journey was there any presentiment that the patient was in need of urgent operative treatment.  Otherwise he would have been diverted to a hospital on the way as an emergency case. There was absolutely no question at any stage of trying to avoid expenditure in an outside hospital at the risk of endangering the patient's health.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by a Deputy to the omission of any word of sympathy from a letter which was sent to the deceased soldier's father. The letter in question was dated 10th March, 1967&mdash;nearly three months after the date of death.  I should like to say that very full expressions of sympathy were made to the deceased's father by a medical officer of St. Bricin's Hospital and other officers at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>There was no post-mortem.  It was, presumably, not considered necessary as death was due to natural causes.  I answered questions yesterday when I gave a full and factual account of all the circumstances in which the man was dealt with and treated by the various doctors in the case whose duty it was to examine him and pronounce upon him.  I do not think I have anything <Col N="496" /> further to add at this stage to the information I have already given.  I have made a factual statement on every aspect of the case raised by Deputy Pattison.</P>

      <P>(a)  The number of redundancies notified to my Department in the period 1st January, 1968, to 21st June, 1968, the latest date for which these figures are available, was 2,012 involving 1,563 men and 449 women.  The number of firms involved was 425.</P>
      <P>(b)  The average lump sum redundancy payment in the same period was £124 12s 4d.</P>
      <P>(c)  The average weekly redundancy payment in the period 1st January, 1968, to 14th June, 1968, the latest date for which this information is available, amounted to £5 16s 6d.  Weekly redundancy payments are additional to any Social Welfare entitlement.</P>
      <P>(d)  A total of 309 firms each dismissed one or two persons only for reasons of redundancy in the period 1st January, 1968, to 21st June, 1968.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the maximum tax rate on undistributed corporate profits and (b) the maximum tax rate paid on distributed profits and withheld by companies and the credit allowance to individual shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Profits of corporate bodies, whether distributed or undistributed, are chargeable to corporation profits tax and income tax.  The rate of charge of corporation profits tax is 7½ per cent on the first £2,500 and 23 per cent on the balance.  Income tax is chargeable at 7/- in the £, that is, 35 per cent; but, in computing profits for income tax purposes, a deduction is allowable in respect of corporation profits tax paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> The maximum tax rate on profits over £2,500 is therefore 49,95 per cent. Where the body corporate distributes the profits by way of dividends it is entitled to deduct and retain the income tax appropriate to the dividends. Assuming the profits out of which the dividends are paid bore income tax at the 7/- rate and that tax relief such as &ldquo;exports relief&rdquo; is not involved, the body corporate would deduct and retain income tax at the rate of 7/-.</P>
    <P>The dividends would be regarded as taxed income in the hands of the shareholders and would not again be subjected to income tax.  They would, <Col N="488" /> however, be chargeable to surtax if the shareholder's total income was sufficient to bring him into the surtax range.</P>
