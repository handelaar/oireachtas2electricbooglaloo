      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is intended that Ireland should follow the example of Great Britain and other European countries by publishing quarterly national accounts in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Quarterly national accounts have not yet been developed for this country.  While a number of quarterly (and monthly) indicators of economic trends are at present available, they are not sufficient to permit the preparation of the full national accounts.  Before this could be attempted it would be necessary to develop reliable statistical series covering the principal items for which quarterly estimates are not now available such as output of agriculture, corporate profits, incomes of independent traders, fixed capital formation, changes in stocks, items (other than merchandise trade) affecting the balance of international payments, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> The Central Statistics Office is actively engaged on the improvement of existing statistical series and on the inauguration of new statistical inquiries and, in this context, the possible preparation of quarterly national accounts is being kept in mind.  However, the practical difficulties are much more severe than in the preparation of the existing annual national accounts. Apart from the fact that not all the information available for calendar years is available at more frequent intervals the reliability of quarterly estimates must, inevitably, be less than the annual estimates in relation to the size of changes which occur over short periods, and which it is the object of the estimates to measure.  Seasonal factors also create difficulties in interpreting the results.</P>
    <P>I would point out that very few European countries officially compile quarterly national accounts at the present time.</P>

I understand that the corporation, in fact, now make loans available for previously-occupied houses to persons on their approved waiting list and to tenants of corporation houses who surrender their dwelling to the corporation. A total of 32 loans amounting <Col N="8" /> to £58,230 were made for previously occupied houses in 1967-68.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not correct in stating that there are 50 vacant houses in this scheme.  In fact the scheme consists of only 32 houses built by the National Building Agency at the request of Ballingarry Collieries (Production) Ltd., and leased to that company.  I understand that 15 houses are at present tenanted by employees of the company.  The possibility of disposing of the unoccupied houses for the rehousing of those in need in the area has been raised with the Agency and is at present being explored.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has given any direction regarding the payment of gratuities to unestablished State servants, operative since the commencement of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967; and, if so, if he will state the nature, extent and effect of any such direction.</P>

      <P>Unestablished State employees are insured for benefits under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, which came into operation on 1st January, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An insured employee who entered State employment after that date will receive any benefit under the Act that may be appropriate in his case if he <Col N="18" /> is discharged because of redundancy. No other payment by way of gratuity will be made in respect of redundancy discharge in any such case.</P>
    <P>Persons who were already employed by the State on 1st January, 1968, and who are insured under the Redundancy Payments Act will receive the appropriate benefits under that Act. No compassionate gratuity will be payable in addition, unless the total redundancy payments under the Act to one of these existing officers is found to be less than the gratuity which could have been paid to him if that Act had not been passed.  In such an event a gratuity of the amount of the difference will be payable, so as to ensure that any person who was in State employment before the Redundancy Payments Act came into operation shall not receive less on discharge on redundancy than if the Act had not been passed.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the above arrangements apply only to cases of discharge because of redundancy.  In the case of an unestablished employee who retires because of age or ill-health, or who dies in service, the usual provisions for the payment of compassionate gratuities will continue as heretofore.</P>

If, as I assume, the Deputy's question arise from a case at present on appeal in which certain articles used in these industries have been held to be not commonly manufactured by building contractors, it would not in my view be desirable for me to make any statement on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why his Department have refused to renew national health payments to a person in County Leitrim (name supplied) though his personal doctor refuses to discharge him as being fit for work; if he will give the report of the medical referee who examined him; and if anything can be done to overcome the difference of opinion between the applicant's doctor and the medical referee, as this man is in a pitiful state and not fit for any kind of work.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the question was in receipt of disability benefit continuously from September, 1960 to March, 1966.  Payment of benefit was then stopped when examination by a medical referee indicated that he was not incapable of working.  His appeal against the disallowance of his claim was rejected by an appeals officer after an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He continued to submit medical certificates of incapacity and was subsequently examined by six different medical referees each of whom <Col N="26" /> expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He was examined by two different specialists in 1966 and 1967 each of whom was of the same opinion. Copies of their reports were sent to his doctor.</P>
    <P>He appealed on four further occasions, testifying personally on three of them, but on each occasion the appeals officer having considered all the available evidence decided that he was not incapable of work and disallowed the appeal.</P>

      <P>I am reasonably satisfied with the progress of physical adaptation, that is, modernisation of plant and machinery and factory buildings which has been stepped up very substantially in the last two years.  During the year ended 31st December, 1967, grants approved for payment under the Adaptation Grants Scheme amounted to £5.9 million with planned capital investment of £26.5 million.  The total number of grants approved up to the end of 1967 was 1,315 compared with 350 up to the 31st December, 1965, and the indications are that a very large number of smaller firms have decided to undertake schemes of adaptation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions we have to face in free trade call, however, for a much greater effort in the matter of nonphysical adaptation, particularly in relation to rationalisation of production <Col N="33" /> and co-operation in marketing.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding budgetary policy it is necessary to have regard not only to the domestic but also to the external scene.  Various international events have occurred recently which are of significance for our economy.  The devaluation of sterling last November was one of these.  The corresponding devaluation of the Irish pound was decided upon as the course which would favour the expansion of Irish merchandise exports and tourism, and, therefore, the growth of output and employment.  The measures taken in Britain to control the expansion of domestic demand may create some difficulty this year in the biggest market for our exports.  Measures by the Government of the United States to <Col N="40" /> restrict foreign investment and curb overseas spending could affect the pace of expansion of Irish industry and tourism.  The timing and conditions of entry to the EEC of the four applicant countries, including Ireland, remain unresolved.  The risk of international reversion to protectionist policies cannot be ignored, though there are, fortunately, signs that many important trading countries wish to preserve and, indeed, extend the liberalisation achieved since the last war.</P>
      <P>The uncertainties of the international situation are a source of some anxiety to a small country like ours whose progress depends so much on a continuing expansion of exports.  We cannot hope to remain unaffected by developments of major international moment.  But this is not to say that we must wait timidly on external events. Instead, we should order our economic affairs as to take advantage of whatever opportunities are open to us at the moment and place ourselves in a position to move forward more rapidly when external conditions improve.  The budget has been prepared on that basis, neither ignoring the difficulties of the international situation nor being intimidated by them from seeking the greatest degree of expansion that our circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="41" />
      <i>International monetary co-operation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Improvements in the external balance of the United States and Britain, supported by early adoption of the new international liquidity arrangements, would do much to create a better climate for expansion.</P>
    <P>In recent years the international monetary mechanism has been showing signs of considerable strain.  It has become increasingly doubtful whether the present main sources of supply of international liquid reserves will continue to be adequate for the requirements of expanding world trade and payments.  These sources are, of course, gold, the dollar, the pound sterling and International Monetary Fund drawing rights.  There are many indications that a shortage of international liquidity could develop with adverse repercussions on world trade, capital movements and economic growth.  In order to avert this, the International Monetary Fund has proposed that existing world reserves should be supplemented by artificially created reserve assets, called special drawing rights, to be administered by the fund.</P>
    <P>Each country wishing to participate would be entitled to special drawing rights in proportion to its present quota in the fund.  The intention is that it should accept the new rights as an integral part of its reserves and be able to exchange them for an equivalent amount of another country's currency in the event of balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>As Governor of the fund for Ireland, I have welcomed the new scheme.  For the present haphazard means of providing international liquidity it will substitute a controlled expansion of international liquid reserves based on expert assessment of world requirements. I am having legislation drafted to enable Ireland to participate in the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of</i> 1967</P>
    <P>Various documents reviewing the economy have been published in recent weeks.  These include my own Department's &ldquo;Review of 1967 and Outlook for 1968&rdquo;, the comments of the NIEC on this review and the annual survey <Col N="42" /> of the Irish economy published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  I need not, therefore, at this stage, go into any great detail on the history of the past year.</P>
    <P>In my Financial Statement last year I looked forward to conditions of reasonable stability on external account which would enable us to return to the growth rate of over 4 per cent experienced in the early years of the decade.  I am glad to say this objective was achieved.  It is provisionally estimated that the volume of national production rose by about 4¼ per cent, or rather double the rate achieved in the two preceding years. This compares favourably with estimated rates of 1 per cent in Britain and 2 per cent in the European member countries of OECD.</P>
    <P>Other features of the past year were: a significant increase in employment outside agriculture; a sharp advance in both agricultural and industrial exports which between them yielded an extra £40 million; and a balance of payments surplus of £10 million, which, with a net capital inflow of some £30 million, raised the external reserves of the banking system by over £40 million.</P>
    <P>The export figures reflect great credit on our exporters, who have kept up the impetus of expansion despite difficult conditions on foreign markets. Imports were abnormally low in 1967 and the steep rise noted in the first two months of this year was a natural swing of the pendulum; though the figure for March was lower, a big increase is to be expected in 1968 to replenish stocks and support the rising scale of output.</P>
    <P>Exports to the EEC fell from £26.7 million in 1966 to £24.2 million in 1967 mainly because of the protective effect of the Community's common agricultural policy.  Exports of cattle and beef went down by about £4 million. We have also had to contend with the adverse effects of a slower rate of economic growth in that market and with the uncertainty of our future trading relations with the Community. It would be unwise to rely on <Col N="43" /> this uncertainty being dispelled in the next year or so.  No one can yet say whether an interim arrangement will be negotiated with the applicants for membership or what significance such an arrangement may have.  It would seem that in the year ahead we must look rather to the stimulus of devaluation and the revival of expansionist policies in the Community, aided by the trade-promoting effects of the Kennedy Round tariff cuts, to restore the upward trend in our exports to the EEC.  The improvement seems likely to be confined to industrial exports in view of the virtual exclusion from the Community of our main agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for 1968</i>
    </P>
    <P>Turning to the prospects for 1968, I believe we should be able at least to maintain the 1967 growth rate without undue strain on the balance of payments. But this, as all the reports have warned us, requires that care be taken not to generate too much domestic spending and to keep cost and price increases tightly in check. There will be higher investment expenditure, public and private, in 1968. Incomes are going up.  The banks are in a position to expand credit.  The volume of consumer demand may be expected to rise more rapidly than in 1967.  The scene is set for an increase in domestic spending and it must be our special concern to see that we do not spend more than we can afford.</P>
    <P>If, at home, the danger is that demand may become too active, on the external front the risk is different.  On balance, the prospect seems less favourable than in 1967.  It is true that our exports to certain destinations will enjoy the extra competitive edge given by devaluation.  Moreover, cattle and meat exports should benefit from higher average prices in Britain.  On the other hand, the volume of cattle and meat exports cannot be expected to increase at anything like the same rate as in 1967 without the undesirable effect of a decline in cattle stocks.  The strong deflationary measures taken by the British Government to restrain domestic demand will make it difficult <Col N="44" /> to sustain last year's rate of growth of industrial exports.  Although it may not be as spectacular as in 1967, the expansion of exports in 1968 can still be quite satisfactory if the potential advantages of devaluation in the markets of the non-devaluing countries are fully exploited and there is no impairment of our competitive position in other markets.  The proposals for incomes restraint announced recently in Britain &mdash;involving a ceiling of 3½ per cent on increases&mdash;make caution all the more imperative here.  Preservation of our competitive position is not only a matter of moderation in income increases but also of raising productivity as fast as possible both through better organisation and though modernisation of plant and equipment.  Much more investment will be needed in 1968 to provide for an increase in industrial output of not less than last year's 9 per cent.  Much less is now left of the unused capacity which existed at the beginning of 1967.</P>
    <P>My assessment, in the light of these prospects, of the part budgetary policy should play in 1968 is that it should favour expansion&mdash;particularly of investment&mdash;within the limits imposed by the external situation and the reaction on our balance of payments. While we must be on guard throughout the year against too sharp a rise in domestic spending, particularly on consumer goods, we should, I believe, aim at converting into new domestic capital the whole of the expected net capital inflow.  There is no need to build up our external reserves any further.  This is the thinking which has led me to propose an increase of £25 million in the 1968/69 public capital programme.  Assuming income increases are moderate and credit is not unduly expanded, I do not expect a public capital programme of the size and composition announced for the year ahead to cause any greater deficit in the balance of payments than can be financed, in large measure if not fully, by the net capital inflow.  The expansionary effect of the Capital Budget is, however, likely to be quite sufficient without injecting any extra stimulus by incurring a deficit in the Current Budget.  So my aim will be to <Col N="45" /> maintain the balance on current account which has marked the past two financial years.</P>
    <P>The effect of the increased public investment in providing jobs, directly and indirectly, will be all the greater the less is the upward pressure on costs and prices.  I must stress that if excessive spending is generated, with unfavourable effects on the balance of payments, the Government will have no option but to neutralise some of the increase in incomes and spending by heavier taxation.  Unfortunately, however, such corrective action could solve only one of the problems, namely that of excess demand; it could not of itself do anything to reverse the undue increase in costs and the damage to our export potential.  That damage would have already been done and could not be remedied.  Adverse repercussions on output and employment would inevitably follow.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Industrial earnings have been rising continuously since the Tenth Round in mid-1966.  The index of weekly earnings in transportable goods industries increased by over 7 per cent in the period September, 1966, to December, 1967.  Service pay, longer holidays and reduced standard working hours spread through industry in 1967.</P>
    <P>There has been a movement in a number of industries and individual firms towards the conclusion of agreements for increases in rates of pay phased over a period usually up to the end of 1969.  Some of these contain special provisions&mdash;such as removal of restrictive practices&mdash;aimed at increasing productivity, though it must be recognised that many so-called productivity agreements make little more than token provision for raising productivity. The spreading of increases over a period is in line with the recommendation in Report No.  11 of the NIEC that &ldquo;money incomes should be adjusted more frequently and in smaller steps rather than infrequently and in larger steps&rdquo;.  Also, when adjustment of wages is approached on an industry or firm-by-firm basis it is possible to provide for eliminating restrictive practices and increasing <Col N="46" /> productivity in a manner which would not be feasible when adjustments are made on a national basis.</P>
    <P>Whatever the type of agreement, however, the overriding need remains of keeping increases in total incomes close to the rise in national output so that price and cost increases may stay within safe bounds.  I would emphasise that the general yardstick for this purpose must be the increase in national output.  It would be wrong to look at the likely trend in output in manufacturing industry alone since other sectors are not growing as fast as manufacturing industry.  It must not be forgotten, either, that part of the increased output expected in 1968 is already earmarked to meet earlier commitments to workers which are maturing this year.</P>
    <P>It must be said that many of the phased agreements made since mid-1967 provide for a rate of increase in pay and other benefits which goes well beyond any likely rate of growth in national output in the period they cover.  As the process of pay adjustment has spread throughout the various employments there has been some tendency for the level of demands to rise.  It is essential that there should be no further bidding-up in the pattern of pay settlements.  We may already have gone beyond the limit of safety, and pressures towards larger pay increases would before long put our growth prospects in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Unnecessary or excessive increases in profits and prices are no less objectionable. The Government have extended for a further period the operation of the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965, and will watch prices carefully to ensure that there are no unjustified increases in 1968.</P>
    <P>Following a recommendation from NIEC in the context of incomes policy, I indicated in last year's Financial Statement that I proposed to introduce legislation this year imposing a general obligation on persons carrying on a trade, profession or any profit-making activity to keep records of their business and professional transactions.  The necessary provisions will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <Col N="47" />
      <i>Industrial relations</i>
    </P>
    <P>An improvement in industrial relations is of the greatest national importance.  Recent experience in the Electricity Supply Board can leave no illusions about the dangers inherent in a strike affecting essential services. Apart from the immediate disruption which a strike can cause, the general implications of any tendency towards industrial unrest are grave.  If we are serious about achieving full employment, we must realise that industrial unrest could retard our economic development both by its immediate and its long-term effects.  Acquiring an international reputation for industrial disputes is a sure way of nullifying the efforts to attract the foreign capital and enterprise so necessary for continued expansion.</P>
    <P>As well as putting forward proposals for amending the institutional structure for collective bargaining, the Government have, in the Redundancy Payments and Industrial Training Acts, tried to give the worker greater security and certainty in facing the problems of change.  A heavy responsibility rests on both managements and unions to avoid the spread of industrial unrest.  This requires from management continuing and effective communication with the workers, quick action to prevent unimportant differences leading to strikes, a full appreciation by all of the need to subordinate sectional demands to the common good, and the patient use of all possible means of conciliation when disputes occur.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public capital programme promotes economic growth both through the capital works undertaken by the public authorities themselves and through the financial support given, directly and indirectly, to investment by the private sector.  Last year, as a stimulus to the resumption of growth, it was decided to increase capital expenditure by 10 per cent over the level of £98 million at which it had been stabilised in the three preceding years.  As the year progressed, further increases were made in the allocations for housing, secondary schools and <Col N="48" /> industrial grants so that expenditure on the programme in 1967-68 amounted, in the event, to £111 million, or 14 per cent more than in the previous year.  The programme for the present year, as I have already mentioned, shows an increase of £25 million on this figure.</P>
    <P>Domestic resources were adequate in 1967-68 to finance expenditure on the public capital programme and foreign borrowing was not necessary. The co-operation of the banking system is being sought in raising the sum of £33 million estimated to be required for the 1968-69 programme after reckoning the finance otherwise available domestically.  It is not considered that the provision by the banking system of finance on this scale for the public sector will have adverse effects on the availability of credit for the private sector for productive purposes.  The expansion of the public capital programme in 1968-69 will help to ensure that the country's resources are used for necessary social and economic development at home rather than increasing our external reserves, which are already adequate.</P>
    <P>At this time last year I announced that a comprehensive analysis had been initiated of the whole range of expenditures which make up the public capital programme.  The appraisal, which will serve as a guide to the best pattern of expenditure, will be completed as rapidly as possible.  Because of the wide range of activities to be studied, and the long time-span required to make adjustments in the programme, one should expect a gradual shifting of emphasis, in line with what the appraisal indicates, rather than any sudden or dramatic changes.</P>

    </P>
    <P>I would like to see a somewhat larger share of personal savings put directly at the disposal of the Government for capital purposes so as to reduce the demand on the banking system for Exchequer financing.  With this in mind I have recently strengthened the National Savings Committee and I would like to take this opportunity <Col N="49" /> to express my appreciation of the excellent services given by the Committee on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I propose to arrange for the issue of a new type of savings certificate carrying a rate of interest closer to current yields on Government stocks, encashable after a period of notice, and subject, as regards the interest, to income tax.  Further details will be announced in a few months' time when the necessary arrangements are completed.</P>
    <P>The trustee savings banks have asked to be allowed to augment the facilities they provide for their customers and I welcome this development. I have decided that these banks should be authorised to introduce a new type of account offering the prospect of a rate of interest higher than the present 3½ per cent per annum and that they should be permitted to give adequately secured loans to their depositors.  The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget, 1967/68&mdash;Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>In drawing up last year's current budget I estimated that the total yield of revenue would be £295.2 million. Mainly because of the acceleration of the rate of economic growth during the past twelve months and the associated rise in incomes and consumer expenditure, actual revenue receipts, at £305.4 million, were £10.2 million higher than had been expected.</P>
    <P>Each of the three main revenue heads contributed to this buoyancy. Tax revenue surpassed the expected yield of £238.5 million by almost £9.5 million, while motor vehicle duties and non-tax revenue slightly exceeded the estimated figures.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure was £6.4 million above the budget estimate of £299.2 million.  Here also, the increase was broadly spread.  Agriculture, tourism, education and local government were among the services for which supplementary provision was required.</P>
    <P>The outturn, a deficit of only £200,000, was a very close approach to balance and justified the allowance of £4 million I made for errors of estimation when framing the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" />
      <i>Current Budget, 1968/69</i>
    </P>
    <P>The white paper published a few days ago shows that the amount of current outlay already proposed for this financial year is £332 million.  This represents an increase of £26½ million, or 8½ per cent, on the actual expenditure in 1967/68.</P>
    <P>Of this increase, £10 million is attributable to the higher cost of servicing the national debt.  £257½ million, or £16 million more than last year, is to be spent on current supply services, as can be seen from the Estimates volume.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the fact, which is not sufficiently appreciated, that the principal elements of the Government's financial policy for 1968/69 are already contained in the Capital Budget booklet and in the Volume of Estimates published within the last few weeks. Today's budget is concerned mainly with how the total increase should be financed in order to maintain orderly national progress.  Today's additions to the expenditure side, while of considerable public interest, are not large by comparison with the total.  The main lines of this year's expenditure are already determined.</P>
    <P>The votes for Agriculture, Lands, Forestry and the Agricultural Grant provide over £11½ million more than the original votes for those services in 1967/68.  This substantial increase reflects the drive being made by the Government to make farming more productive and to raise the incomes of those engaged in it.  This is being done by way of subsidies for a wide range of products and general assistance in providing buildings and other facilities. Rates relief is of very real benefit to the small farmer and, at £17.3 million, constitutes a growing item of Central Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The provision for non-capital expenditure on the Education group of votes is £6½ million higher than in last year's Estimates volume.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare and Health votes each show an increase of £2¾ million.</P>
    <P>The increases in the Local Government, Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power and Labour group of votes amount to £3 million.  Additional sums are being allocated to housing <Col N="51" /> subsidies, water and sewerage schemes, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Córas Tráchtála, the National Productivity Year, tourism, rural electrification and An Chomhairle Oiliúna.</P>
    <P>The extra expenditure already included in the Estimates volume is widely spread and indicates the broad range of the Government's efforts to further social and economic development and improve the lot of every section of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>I doubt if sufficient notice is taken of the trend in recent years in social expenditure, that is, current Government outlay on social welfare, education and health.  It has more than doubled in the past decade.  The amount spent for these purposes in 1958/59 was £47 million; for this financial year £110 million has already been provided.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>In every budget during the past nine years provision has been made for increases in social welfare payments. These far exceeded the rise in the cost of living and significantly improved the real value of the benefits afforded to those who are old, widowed, blind, disabled or unemployed.</P>
    <P>The scope of the social welfare services has been extended also.  Among the more important improvements were the introduction of contributory old age pensions in 1961; the provision of allowances for children of old age pensioners in 1964; the liberalisation in 1966 of the means test to qualify small-holders in congested districts for unemployment assistance, and in 1967, the introduction of the occupational injuries benefits scheme, the abolition of the employment period orders, the lengthening of the period of eligibility for unemployment benefit and the provision of free transport and free electricity for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer's contribution to the social welfare services this year will be £48 million.  When insurance contributions are included, expenditure on these <Col N="52" /> services will be over £80 million in a full year.  The Minister for Social Welfare is currently engaged in a comprehensive study of the pattern of future developments.</P>
    <P>Much greater attention will have to be given in the future to ensuring that our social services eliminate hardship and want as accurately and effectively as possible.  Experience here and in other countries shows that much still needs to be learned before this problem can be solved.  Aid does not always get to where it is most needed.  For instance, the general scheme of children's allowances costs over £10 million a year but the Government are conscious of the fact that this large sum is not being spent to best advantage. Because all children under 16 years of age qualify for the allowances, many parents receive payments which are not really necessary in their circumstances. This is evidenced by the number of out-of-date payable orders which the Department of Social Welfare receive to be validated.  Unnecessary payments reduce the amount available for those whose needs are greater.  Moreover, the cost of even small increases in the existing rates is prohibitive because of the wide coverage of the scheme.  An examination is now being undertaken to see whether a more selective scheme could be drawn up.  The matter is far from simple because of the implications of means tests which are neither popular nor easy to administer and it is unlikely that a revised scheme can be speedily formulated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>Current expenditure on education has doubled during the past five years and trebled during the past decade. This reflects the Government's wish to give every child the highest level of education from which its natural talents will enable it to benefit.</P>
    <P>It is intended to introduce new subjects such as civics, art, and physical education in the primary schools. Scientific methods have produced graded programmes making the teaching of Irish more efficient.  An extension to St. Patrick's Training College has enabled the supply of male primary <Col N="53" /> teachers to be increased, with a consequential improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in our national schools. The policy of closing the smaller schools and the free transport arrangements will result in children attending larger and better-equipped schools where a full range of subjects can be taught.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, new curricula for all subjects of the intermediate course have been prepared and issued. An examination of the structure of the leaving certificate has just been completed by an expert committee.  With the introduction of school television, incentive payments for science teaching, special training courses for secondary teachers in language teaching and a scheme of equipment grants for science and language laboratories, significant progress is being made in the teaching of modern languages and science.  Secondary and vocational schools are cooperating on many fronts to make these subjects available generally and to maximise the use of educational resources.</P>
    <P>A new concept&mdash;the comprehensive school&mdash;offering a complete range of post-primary educational facilities has also been introduced into Irish education. Furthermore, the final stage in the planning of the nine new regional technical colleges has been reached. These will provide courses for technicians at ordinary and higher levels and also a wide range of courses in trade, commerce and industry.</P>
    <P>Last year saw the introduction of free post-primary education and free school transport.  In addition, textbooks are being supplied free where necessary. As a result of these schemes there has been a remarkable increase in enrolments at secondary and vocational schools in the present school year.</P>
    <P>The process of educational reforms is being extended by providing grants to ensure that the cost will not debar pupils of the requisite ability from proceeding to University and other higher centres of study.</P>
    <P>These important developments have given rise to urgent demands for more class-rooms, more new schools and <Col N="54" /> better equipment.  Annual capital expenditure has increased from £1½ million to an estimated £10¾ million in the past decade.  This includes £2½ million for additional accommodation in 140 secondary schools, a further £2½ million for vocational schools and regional colleges of technology, £½ million for comprehensive schools and almost £2¼ million for universities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health services</i>
    </P>
    <P>Doubling in the past five years and trebling in the past decade, Government expenditure on the health services has mirrored the trend in expenditure on education.  The Exchequer is required by statue to pay 50 per cent of current expenditure by health authorities but it is in fact contributing £2.2 million more than this in 1968-69.  In no case is the Exchequer contribution to a health authority less than 54 per cent of its outlay and in many counties, mainly in the west, it exceeds 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>The cost of the health services is rising so rapidly that it is necessary to consider alternative methods of finance in order to reduce the amounts now charged on the taxpayer and the rate-payer. A detailed examination is being undertaken of the feasibility of introducing an insurance or contributory scheme to finance at least part of the cost of the services available to the middle-income group.  It will extend to the question of eliminating the hospital charges for which middle-income patients are now liable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>For reasons already mentioned the large increase in public capital expenditure must be regarded as sufficiently expansionary in relation to the policy needs of 1968 and the primary objective of to-day's current budget is to provide for a number of socially desirable objectives, while at the same time ensuring that the higher level of expenditure is matched by revenue.</P>
    <P>These objectives are:</P>
    <P>(1)  to improve social welfare benefits so as to offset recent and foreseeable cost-of-living increases and to assure the recipients of a <Col N="55" /> share in the advance in community living standards;</P>
    <P>(2)  to give further assistance to certain sectors of agriculture;</P>
    <P>(3)  to make some adjustments in our system of direct taxation so as to afford desirable reliefs and provide increased incentives for industrial expansion;</P>
    <P>(4)  to grant a moderate increase in public service pensions; and</P>
    <P>(5)  to make additional provision for the arts.</P>
    <P>The white paper shows that the estimates of current expenditure exceed estimated revenue at present rates of taxation by £3.61 million.  I propose to increase that opening deficit to £8.6 million by adding £3.12 million for social welfare improvements, £1.2 million for aids to agriculture, £0.37 million for direct tax adjustments, £0.2 million for public service pension increases, and £100,000 for the arts.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since the increases in social welfare payments in last year's budget took effect, the cost-of-living index has risen by little more than 2 per cent.  To honour the undertaking to safeguard social welfare recipients against this rise would require an addition of about 1/- to 1s 6d a week in the basic rates. Bearing in mind, however, the general rise in earnings and the improved economic circumstances, the Government have decided on an exceptional increase this year.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to give an increase of 7s 6d a week to all recipients of social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This will take effect from the beginning of August next in the case of the non-contributory old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions, the personal rate of unemployment assistance, and the allowance for an adult dependant.  Insurance benefits generally will likewise be increased by 7s 6d a week from the beginning of January next.  The increase will apply to the old age and widows' <Col N="56" /> contributory pensions, disability and unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, orphans' allowances, and the allowance for an adult dependant.  In addition I propose to give an increase of 2s 6d a week in the allowance for every qualified child of old age, blind and widow pensioners and of recipients of unemployment assistance and of unemployment and disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The infectious diseases maintenance allowance and the disabled persons maintenance allowance administered by the Department of Health will likewise be increased by 7s 6d a week from August next, with an extra 2s 6d a week for each dependent child under 16 years of recipients of infectious diseases maintenance allowances.</P>
      <P>These proposals will cost the Exchequer £5.4 million in a full year and £3 million this year, subject to the Exchequer contribution to the cost of insurance benefits being slightly adjusted downwards.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Free television and radio licences for old age pensioners</i>
      </P>
      <P>Last year I was able to introduce a scheme granting a measure of free electricity to a certain category of old age pensioners.  This has been a success and I intend to go further along the road this year in making life a little more pleasant for these old people by giving them free television and radio licences as well.  This is estimated to cost the Exchequer £120,000 a year.  Details are being worked out and it is hoped to bring the scheme into operation within the next few months.  Last year I expressed the hope that our efforts in this direction would be supplemented by those of private individuals and organisations and I would like to express the same wish again this year in the hope that the sets themselves might also be provided for these old people.</P>

    <P>The Government have decided that some small extra token of recognition might well be given this year to that declining band of people, those who served in the War of Independence and are still with us.  Accordingly the existing limitation whereby only the <Col N="57" /> first £80 of their pension or allowance is disregarded in calculating means for old age pension purposes will be abolished so that the entire amount will in future be disregarded.  In addition arrangements will be made to make available to such persons the benefits of the free electricity and travel schemes for old age pensioners introduced last year and the new free television and radio licence scheme to be introduced this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite the upset to the livestock trade resulting from the outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease in Britain, 1967 was a good year for agriculture. Family farm income in that year is provisionally estimated at about £148 million, the highest figure so far achieved.  It was £13 million above the 1966 figure&mdash;which was, of course, affected by the decline in cattle prices in the second half of that year&mdash;and approximately £6 million higher than in 1965 or 1964.  Notwithstanding higher costs of production, there is likely to be a further appreciable increase in family farm income in 1968, particularly in view of the outlook for cattle and the prospect of another good year for milk production.</P>
    <P>The increase in farm income is in large degree due to Government measures of various kinds including price supports for all the main farm products, fertiliser subsidies, rates relief and schemes for improving the structure and productive capacity of farms.  These have involved a substantial increase over the years in the total amount of money spent in relation to agriculture.  This total went up from £38 million in 1963/64 to almost £72 million in 1968/69, which is a clear demonstration that the Government are effectively implementing their policy that farmers who work their land fully and efficiently should share equitably in the growing national prosperity and that a reasonable relationship should be maintained between farm income and other incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that additional money should be devoted this year to the development of certain sectors of agriculture which are of particular <Col N="58" /> significance to the small farmer &mdash;the production of pigs, sheep and oats.  There has been some fall in output under these headings during the past few years, although total agricultural output has been showing an upward trend.  These areas of activity can be further developed so as to make possible a worthwhile increase in the income of the small farmers, including in particular those in western areas who are unable to derive the same degree of benefit as farmers elsewhere from the guaranteed prices for wheat, sugar beet, barley or even milk.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided on the following measures:</P>
    <P>As from Monday, 29th April, there will be an increase of 12s. per cwt. deadweight in the guaranteed price for the two top grades of pigs (A Special and A) and upward adjustments also in the prices for certain other grades. There will also be an increase in the guaranteed export price of bacon.  The grants for piggeries will be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of grants will be introduced for large-scale pig fattening units on the basis of one-third of the capital costs involved.</P>
    <P>There will be a special farrowed sow grant scheme for the western counties, designed to encourage farmers in those poorer areas to keep more sows and increase their pig output.  The grant will be at the rate of £10 per sow, payable in two instalments, and the scheme will be introduced in June, 1968, when the current Farrowed Sow Scheme is due to terminate.</P>
    <P>Improved incentives will be introduced under the Accredited Pig Herd Scheme.</P>
    <P>The total cost to the Exchequer of these measures in support of the pig industry will be nearly £1 million in a full year.  They should enable farmers generally, and more particularly the smaller farmers, to make substantial additions to their income.</P>
    <P>The rate of subsidy under the Mountain Lamb Scheme will be raised from 10s. per head to £1 per head.  The extra cost will be about £180,000.</P>
    <P>Beginning with the 1968 harvest, <Col N="59" /> there will be a floor price, corresponding to the feed barley floor price, for clean oats of good feeding quality, and a grants scheme will be brought into operation to encourage the provision of drying and storage facilities in oats-growing areas, such as parts of the west, where these facilities are at present deficient.  We are providing £180,000 for these purposes in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to relax the rule which debars a farmer from claiming rate relief for workers whose land valuation is £5 or more.  In future, the employment rebate may be claimed in respect of workers whose land valuation does not exceed £15.</P>
    <P>These new measures will cost virtually £1½ million in a full year, and nearly £1.2 million in the current financial year and will supplement the Small Farm Incentive Bonus Scheme, which begins next month.  This, of course, is in addition to the increased cost in 1968/69 of maintaining existing Exchequer commitments, including £1.7 million extra for creamery milk and £1.7 million extra for relief of rates on land.</P>
    <P>In their review of the position of agriculture, the Government gave careful consideration to other products, such as wheat, barley and milk.  The Irish wheat price is in line with the Common Market price.  As regards barley, the repercussions of a further increase in price on the economics of pig production cannot be overlooked. The total cost of the price supports for milk has, in the past five years, moved up from £3.2 million to over £19 million in 1967/68 and is expected to rise by a further £1¾ million in 1968/69. The total creamery milk cheque in 1967 was over £52 million compared with £27 million five years earlier, and, given reasonable weather conditions, it should show a further rise in 1968. While the percentage of milk, and of milk suppliers, qualifying for the quality premium on creamery milk has shown a very welcome increase, there is still a fairly large number of suppliers who have not yet earned the 2d per gallon premium but who should be in a <Col N="60" /> position to do so with the help of the milk cooler grants introduced last year. The price of calves is higher than last year.  The total return to dairy farmers from milk and calves will be at least £5 million higher than in 1967.</P>
    <P>The international market for dairy produce presents a disquieting picture and it is becoming increasingly difficult to see where our growing surplus can be disposed of.  In all these circumstances the Government felt that an increase in the price of milk this year could not be justified.</P>
    <P>Farmers will also benefit from changes in the taxation code which have been decided upon and which I shall come to now.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Schedules A and B</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have received representations from many sources to raise the various personal income tax allowances.  Even a moderate general increase would cost many millions of pounds and could only be considered in relation to the sort of general review of our tax structure about which I shall be speaking later.  Pending any such change I have sought around for ways of giving relief in specially desirable directions at reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that the abolition of tax under Schedule A would give just such relief.  The tax falls mainly on the owner-occupier of a private residence and its abolition should give wide relief and be especially welcome to old persons living on pensions or fixed incomes as well as to the general body of householders.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me also that, as a logical corollary, and to give additional help to the farming community, I should abolish Schedule B as well, that is, the tax on income from the occupation of land.</P>
    <P>The removal of these two Schedules will simplify the administration of income tax.  Because of the considerable preparatory work involved, the decision to abolish them can become effective only from next year, 1969-70.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Married allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>The financial problems of young couples getting married to-day are considerable <Col N="61" /> and, in order to ease them somewhat, I am granting a special increase of £100 in the personal allowance for married men in the year of marriage.  This will apply only to the tax year in which the marriage takes place.  The increase will be allowable for both income tax and sur-tax.  The cost will be £150,000 in the current year and £190,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief from estate duty for widows</i>
    </P>
    <P>A related matter about which I have received a host of representations is the situation of widows and children in regard to estate duty&mdash;especially in cases where the estate includes the family home and the capitalised value of a pension or annuity.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act of 1965 introduced a new type of estate duty relief in the form of an abatement of the duty payable in respect of property passing to the widow and dependent children.</P>
    <P>As extended in 1966, the abatement for a widow is £350 and for a dependent child, £250.  This has the effect of entirely relieving from duty an estate of £13,750 passing to the deceased's widow where there are three dependent children.  The benefit is, however, confined to estates not exceeding £25,000.</P>
    <P>In response to representations that the present reliefs do not obviate hardship in some cases, I now propose to increase the abatement to £1,000 for the widow and £500 for each dependent child and to make it available in estates not exceeding £100,000.  This will effectively exempt an estate of £20,000 passing to a widow with three dependent children.</P>
    <P>The cost is estimated at £50,000 this year and £200,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Several increases have already been given in the pensions of retired civil servants, national teachers, gardaí members of the defence forces and other public service pensioners who retired before February, 1964.  The most recent was the rise of 12 per cent granted last year on the pensions which had been increased in August, 1965. The Committee on Post-Retirement <Col N="62" /> Adjustments in Public Service Pensions recommended that pensions should be increased only when there is a general pay increase for serving personnel in all categories.  In deference, however, to the representations I have received, I propose not to wait for this eventuality but, in general, to increase by 5 per cent from 1 August next the pensions which were increased last August. This will cost the Exchequer £200,000 this year and £300,000 in a full year, with a small addition for the Exchequer share of increases in local authority pensions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial development</i>
    </P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council has estimated that industrial output will have to increase one and a half times by 1980 if full employment is to be achieved by that year.  Experience since the Council reported suggests that this estimate may understate the effort required.  The fact that the main contribution to full employment must come from industry underlines the importance of this sector and of national policies for its development.</P>
    <P>In the seven years which have elapsed since the Committee on Industrial Organisation was established, the Government have, through every means open to them, encouraged industry to adapt itself to free trade.  The CIO saw modernisation of plant and machinery as a basic need of most Irish industry and this was given priority by the Government.  The scheme of adaptation grants has resulted in an upsurge of investment in new plant and machinery: total capital expenditure involved in cases for which grants have so far been given amounts to almost £90 million.  Adaptation grants have recently come to an end but, as already announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a new scheme will be introduced to provide continuing help for re-equipment and modernisation.</P>
    <P>The incentives for major industrial development and promotion have been under consideration for some time by the Government in the light of recommendations made by a firm of international consultants and revised facilities will shortly be announced.  The aim is to have a fully integrated system <Col N="63" /> of incentives which will encourage existing firms to go forward with major expansions of their activities and will also promote the establishment of new industrial enterprises both of home and external origin.</P>
    <P>A National Science Council has recently been established to advise the Government on science and technology with particular reference to economic development.  One of its functions will be to link general development policies with science policies and to advise on priorities in the allocation of funds for research and development. I understand that it is considering the question of State assistance towards promoting the widespread adoption by industry of technological developments and I may be anticipating the Council in some of the proposals I shall announce in a moment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, in addition to introducing free depreciation for industrial plant and machinery in the western areas, I increased from 40 per cent to 50 per cent the rate of initial allowance for new plant and machinery in the rest of the country.  I did this to encourage higher investment in manufacturing industry and to improve our competitive position in free trade conditions. I consider that the time is opportune for a further incentive to industrial investment.  I propose to increase the rate of initial allowance from 50 per cent to 60 per cent in the case of plant and machinery on which expenditure is incurred in the period from 1 April, 1968, to 31 March, 1971. This will not involve any cost to the Exchequer until 1969/70 and it is estimated to cost £550,000 in that year, rising to £1,140,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that there are too many wear-and-tear rates in use in relation to new plant and machinery.  I propose to reduce the number of these rates and rearrange them so that there will be no additional charge to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The period of operation of the existing initial allowance in respect of expenditure on industrial buildings will <Col N="64" /> be extended from 1 April, 1968, to 31 March, 1971.</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Know-how&rdquo; and scientific research</i>
    </P>
    <P>Certain other measures can be taken in the field of taxation to aid industrial efficiency and encourage expansion. The steps I propose relate to the purchase of &ldquo;Know-how&rdquo; and to scientific research.</P>
    <P>Under existing tax law it is necessary to determine on the facts of each case whether money spent on acquiring secret processes, formulae or specialised techniques is allowable to the purchaser as a deduction for taxation purposes. In order to remove doubts in the minds of intending purchasers of &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; I am proposing that all payments of this kind will be allowable for tax purposes.  The allowance will be given as and when the expenditure is incurred.</P>
    <P>I also propose to extend the relief available to firms for sums spent on scientific research by removing the condition that the research must be related to their trade.  I hope that this may encourage them to give more widespread support to activities of a general nature and in particular to those undertaken by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <P>The cost of these two measures will not be significant.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sur-tax: earned income relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a further stimulus to industrial efficiency I intend to carry a stage further the sur-tax reliefs which I introduced last year in the interest of attracting to Irish industry the best managerial and technological talent available.  Although last year's measure partially eased the tax burden on these taxpayers, they still pay more tax than their counterparts in Britain and elsewhere over a considerable range of incomes.  I have decided to raise the special sur-tax allowance for earned income from £1,250 to £2,000.  Some of the cost will be recovered by narrowing from £3,000 to £2,000 the range of income subject to the six shilling rate so that the net cost for the current year will be £120,000.  The changes will apply to sur-tax payable on 1 January, 1969.  The position will now be that in <Col N="65" /> the range of income with which we are primarily concerned in this regard tax payable here will be slightly less than in Great Britain.  I propose to make good the loss of direct tax revenue by an increase in indirect taxation on the more expensive forms of imported liquor.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation profits tax: directors' remuneration</i>
    </P>
    <P>In computing the profits of a director-controlled company for purposes of corporation profits tax, the maximum deduction which may be claimed for the remuneration of a director is £2,500.  A number of representative bodies have urged that this figure be raised and I propose that a new limit of £4,000 should apply from 1 January, 1968.</P>
    <P>The cost of this increase is estimated not to exceed £50,000 a year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The arts</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my Budget speech last year I spoke about the necessity of ensuring that an adequate variety of cultural and recreational facilities of the highest standards would be available for our people.  I promised to consider how Government aid for this purpose could be improved, particularly in relation to the live theatre.  Because of the diverse interests which had to be consulted I have not been able to proceed in this direction as rapidly as I had hoped at this time last year. However, I have recently been able to announce the new institutional arrangements decided upon, namely, the setting up of three councils instead of the present Comhairle Ealaíon&mdash;one for the visual arts, one for drama and literature, and the third for music, opera and ballet.  A sum of £60,000 has already been provided in the Book of Estimates for An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I am adding £100,000 to this sum as the amount that may be required during the coming year to meet the new expansion of activity. The legislation to establish the new bodies will be proceeded with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <i>Tax proposals</i>
    </P>
    <P>The foregoing measures will cost £4.99 million in 1968/69 and bring the deficit to £8.6 million.</P>
    <P>Having regard to last year's experience and to the rising trend of economic activity, a deduction of £4 million for errors of estimation may be conservatively made.</P>
    <P>I propose to find the additional revenue required to meet the remaining deficit by increasing the duties on tobacco, petrol, beer, wine and foreign spirits&mdash;principally brandy.  The specific proposals and the expected additional yields in 1968/69 are:</P>

    <P>In determining the precise additions to the taxes on these commodities I have made allowance for the incidence of turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The increased duties on foreign spirits and wine will more than pay for the sur-tax, death duty and corporation profits tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>Revenue receipts from Irish-made spirits in the year just ended were lower than in the previous year and I have decided that the home products could not be asked to bear additional taxation this year.  On the other hand, receipts from imported spirits generally show a significant increase.  However, since the duty on home-made spirits is not being increased, it is necessary under the Free Trade Area Agreement to exclude spirits of United Kingdom origin from the additional charge on imported spirits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> The measures I have outlined bring estimated revenue into balance with expenditure as is consistent with our financial policy for 1968-69.</P>
    <P>I must, however, refer again to the need for careful stewardship throughout the year to ensure that spending power is not allowed to rise unduly because of excessive income increases or other causes.  If that should happen, early counter-action will be taken. Some liabilities will necessarily arise for which specific provision has not been made.  The allowance I have made for errors of estimation is possibly conservative enough to provide some cover against these.  If, however, this cover is seriously deficient, I must give notice that the Government, in discharge of their general responsibility for good management of the economy, may have to introduce additional taxes or charges to prevent any sizeable deficit emerging on current account.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Miscellaneous taxation changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Among the matters that will be provided for in this year's Finance Bill are relief for Irish investment trust companies from the charge to corporation profits tax on dividends received by them which are payable out of profits which have borne British corporation tax; the abolition of corporation duty, which was originally imposed in 1885 and now yields little more than the cost of collection: a measure of double taxation relief to be given unilaterally where foreign tax is borne on certain company income; and the exemption from corporation profits tax for a further period of three years of certain public ultility companies and other concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The growing awareness of developments in the field of taxation abroad, and especially in the EEC, has created an increasing interest here in the question of what is the most suitable tax system for this country.  The fact that the EEC has prescribed a common system of added-value taxation for adoption by all the member countries <Col N="68" /> not later than 1970 has focussed attention on the TVA&mdash;as it is commonly called&mdash;and created the presumption that this is the best method of taxing expenditure.</P>
    <P>This system of taxation has been the subject of close examination by officers of my Department who have had consultations with the authorities concerned in many European countries.  It is my intention to publish, within the next month or so, a white paper giving full information about the TVA system.  I hope that this will arouse interest and stimulate discussion of the subject by industrial and trading bodies and associations and, of course, by the general public.  I shall be glad to receive views and to facilitate consultations with my Department by representative bodies.</P>
    <P>The general taxation policy of the Government is that outlined in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Reliance will continue to be placed chiefly on indirect rather than direct taxation on the ground that taxation of expenditure has less of a disincentive effect on economic activity than taxation of income.  It discourages excessive spending but not earning or saving.  The corresponding moderation in the taxation of income is a stimulus to individual and corporate effort.</P>
    <P>The constant demand for improvements and extensions in the services provided by the State will require that loss of revenue caused by reductions in direct tax rates be made good.  Despite the extension of the tax base by the turnover tax and the wholesale tax, the bulk of our revenue from indirect taxes still comes from a narrow range of commodities&mdash;tobacco, petrol, beer and spirits.  Broadly-based taxes on goods and services offer the best possibility of a substantial move from direct to indirect taxation, and the TVA system has many attractions for this purpose.  It is a system which can be made progressive by having different rates for different categories of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Following a reference in the seventh report of the Commission on Income Taxation, the Government indicated that they favoured separating company <Col N="69" /> taxation from personal taxation and were inclined towards a company tax on undistributed profits only and a separate tax or taxes on personal income including dividends.  An intensive study of the principles involved has already been carried out and, as a result, some doubts have been expressed whether a company tax confined to undistributed profits would be the best arrangement in present circumstances. I have directed that a comprehensive statistical survey be undertaken of all companies, their capital structure, profits, growth, investment policy, dividends and so on.  My main objective will be to devise a system of company and personal taxation which will favour industrial growth and encourage savings.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this study of company taxation, I propose to have further consideration given to the possibility of introducing a current year basis of assessment under Schedule D for traders and professional persons. There would seem to be advantages in aligning, as far as possible, the tax treatment of such persons with that of employees under PAYE.  In all this, I shall look forward to the continued co-operation of the accountancy and other professional bodies without whose help the tax machinery could not function effectively or efficiently.  I shall welcome their suggestions towards achieving a tax system that will ensure accurate and early settlement of tax liabilities in the interest of both the State and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decimalisation of currency</i>
    </P>
    <P>In June, 1967, I issued a booklet summarising the case for and against each of the decimal currency systems which it would be possible to adopt in this country.  This was intended to give an opportunity for the submission of considered views prior to a decision by the Government.  The reponse was quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The weight of opinion favoured the introduction of the same system as will be in operation in Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;the pound, newpenny, half newpenny system&mdash;and the Government have decided to adopt this <Col N="70" /> course as being less inconvenient and costly than introducing a different system. The change-over will commence on 15 February, 1971, the same date as in Britain and Northern Ireland. The necessary legislation is being prepared and will be introduced in the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The cost of converting machines to the decimal system will be offset, to a large extent, by tax relief.  Expenditure on adapting existing machines will be deductible as an expense in computing profits for tax purposes.  Expenditure on the purchase of new machines or on major adaptations of existing machines will be eligible for capital allowances. Outside the western areas, there will be an initial allowance of 60 per cent of the expenditure and annual wear-and-tear allowances on the usual basis.  In the west, free depreciation will be allowable under the provisions introduced last year.</P>
    <P>I shall be making an announcement shortly about the organisational arrangements for effecting the change-over to decimal currency and the coinage for the new system.  In view of the benefits to be gained from decimalisation, I am confident that all bodies directly affected will play their full part in implementing the plans for the new currency.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Banking developments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in preparing the legislation to control, through the agency of the Central Bank, the establishment of banking institutions and to keep their operations here under review.  A Bill is being drafted and I hope to introduce it in the House later this year.</P>
    <P>The past two years have seen considerable changes in Irish banking.  The majority of the Associated Banks are now organised in two groups.  These are steadily expanding the range of their services, particularly in the fields of merchant and industrial banking. One of the groups has announced that it intends to work towards a complete merger of the clearing banks in the group.  This is in line with developments in other countries.  Within the past year bank mergers have taken <Col N="71" /> place or have been announced in Britain and in continental countries, because bigger banks are necessary to meet the growing needs of the great industrial combines and to make economical use of the large-scale computer services now available.</P>
    <P>It is good to see the banks extending and improving their services.  National development requires the efficient mobilisation and use of savings and the provision of adequate credit at reasonable cost.  The banks are responding to that need.  There is, however, still room for a considerable rationalisation of banking business and the proposed legislation will contain general provisions to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my reply to the debate on the Estimate for my Department in December last, the opportunity is being taken in the Bill to express the relationship of the Irish pound to sterling and other currencies in a way consistent with our membership of the International Monetary Fund.  The traditional parity relationship between the Irish pound and the pound sterling is maintained by the par values declared to the International Monetary Fund on 18 November last.</P>
    <P>The expert examination of how a money market might be developed here, on which the Central Bank and my Department have been actively engaged, is nearing completion and I hope that it will be possible to start practical preparations during the present financial year.  This will represent a further step in providing ourselves with a range of banking and financial services suited to modern requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public services reorganisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The group which was set up to examine and report on organisation in the public services at the higher levels is continuing its investigations.  This work has proved to be even more exacting and time-consuming than expected; up to the present over six hundred people have been interviewed or have made oral submissions.  Steady progress is being made and it is hoped to have a report about the end of this financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> A special review was carried out during the year of recruitment procedures to the Civil Service.  I am glad to be able to say that, as a result, a number of significant changes will be made.  As a help to the parents of young candidates, fees for the medical examination of applicants have already been abolished and this will be followed by the abolition from 1st June next of entrance fees as well.</P>
    <P>Another idea in mind is the holding of a special open competition for positions as Executive Officer at which candidates above the present age limits could compete.  This would provide a means of entrance at that level for persons who are already in employment or who had followed a post-secondary course of studies.</P>
    <P>The efforts to maximise efficiency in the public service are continuing. Organisation and methods surveys and work study are yielding useful results. Departments are gradually extending automatic data processing and the use of computers.  An expert unit has been set up to enable the techniques of operational research to be applied in the process of decision-making.  The unit is attached to my Department but its services will be available to Departments generally.  Its strength will be increased according as suitable staff can be recruited and trained.</P>
    <P>The year has seen a further advance in the training of civil servants.  The number and variety of training courses provided within the service have been expanded and civil servants are also sent to suitable outside training courses both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recently published review of developments in the first four years of the Second Programme shows that, although performance was not fully up to expectations, the economy made considerable progress.  Gross national product grew at an annual average rate of 3.3 per cent or at three-quarters of the projected rate.  Growth in investment and in private consumption was close to what might have been expected, given the reduced rate of <Col N="73" /> growth in GNP.  The performance of exports was particularly satisfactory. Substantial increases in employment in the industrial and other domestic sectors were accompanied by a fall in the numbers engaged in agriculture. Though total employment failed to increase, the long-term downward tendency was all but checked and there was a marked improvement in the composition of the labour force in terms of better-paid and more continuous employment.  The contrast between the reduction in total employment and the substantial growth in national output underlines the fact that increases in employment are not easily won, and require a greater effort than was expected in the Second Programme or in the NIEC Report on Full Employment.</P>
    <P>There are other lessons to be drawn from the analysis of the period 1964-67. These have been set out in the review, and reinforce the warning in the Second Programme itself that the progress aimed at was conditional, depending for its achievement on the co-operation of all concerned in creating the conditions of success.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Third Programme for Economic Expansion</i>
    </P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government have decided that the Third Programme for Economic Expansion will come into effect in January, 1969, and will cover the four years to 1972, by which date the position regarding membership of the EEC should be clarified.  The new programme will be prepared within the framework of the NIEC Report on Full Employment and will, therefore, focus attention on the policy changes and action required for progress towards the achievement of this national objective.  The intention is to concentrate on a number of key areas which can make a major impact on the economy.  Examples are industrial training and management education, research and development, agricultural credit and co-operation, marketing and tourism.</P>
    <P>Economic progress is not an end in itself.  It is pursued for the better living standards which it makes possible.  The <Col N="74" /> main social services have made great advances since the First Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced. Public expenditure on housing, health, education and income maintenance has risen from £80 million to about £200 million.  When allowance is made for changes in the value of money the annual increase in real terms works out at 5 per cent as compared with an increase of under 4 per cent in real gross national product.  It will be a major objective of the Third Programme that all sectors will share in the rising standards of living arising from economic growth.  A great deal of the information needed to formulate a long-term social development programme related both to national resources and changing community needs is not available but the Government have arranged already with the Economic and Social Research Institute for a start to be made on the studies required to provide it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have now completed my statement of budgetary policy for this year.  I hope that as a result of the measures in the Budget our economy will be in even better shape 12 months from now. The budget itself will directly improve the lot of many of our people, in particular those receiving social welfare payments, small farmers and public service pensioners.  The incentives it contains should aid and encourage economic expansion.  The additional taxes I have announced are relatively light; their impact on the cost of living will be small and they will, I trust, be accepted for the good effects they make possible.</P>
    <P>The budget underlines the Government's confidence in the nation's ability to maintain a high rate of economic progress even in difficult international conditions.  At a time when many countries whose economies are much stronger and more diversified than ours have had to accept severe budgetary measures and stiff economic policies, we are placing our faith in expansion and in the capacity of our people to meet from their our resources any challenges the year may bring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget contains few surprises.  When the demise of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, of which the obituary notice was given in the review published a few days ago, became clear, it was to be expected that in this year's Budget, as so often before, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance would deal with the obvious and the things which circumstances made it necessary to deal with.</P>
      <P>In that regard the plight of social welfare recipients has been universally recognised and it is to be welcomed that this obvious and necessary step has been taken.  At the same time, one must recall that whatever measure of social justice the Minister has been able to give to social welfare recipients in this Budget, it is necessarily very much less and very much more restricted than could have been provided had not the grave errors been made in 1964 and 1965.  If we had had competence in Government and dedication to public service over the last two or three years, we would have made the desired expansion in our economy and much more could have been done by the Minister to-day.</P>
      <P>The fact, of course, is that the mistakes made in the early days of the Second Programme resulted in a lack of economic progress for two decisive years and in the year on which the Minister reports, the last financial year, we have only been able to get back to the rate of progress which had been enjoyed in 1964.</P>
      <P>We welcome what is being done for social welfare recipients, but let us not think that we are doing anything more than is absolutely necessary.  The Minister in his Budget Statement said that since the increases in social welfare payments in last year's Budget took effect, the cost of living increase has risen little more than two per cent.  I am sure the Minister is correct if the date from which he speaks is mid-August of last year.  It should not be overlooked that in the last 12 months, since February, 1967, the cost of living has advanced from 150.6 points to 157.5 points, an increase of five per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as is indicated in the <Col N="86" /> review for 1968 published by the Minister's Department, on page 22, fair warning is given that consumer prices are likely to rise more than last year due to the effect of devaluation on import prices, and to the foot and mouth disease on prices.  It is clear from that paragraph that a rise of something around 4½ points is likely to be experienced in the coming year.  Therefore, the Minister's intention to give social welfare payments of around nine per cent is something that in the year that lies ahead will just in all probability compensate those people for what they may have to experience in relation to prices that have risen and prices likely to rise.</P>
    <P>But may I say again that this Budget contains no surprises?  It was clear that the Minister would have to tackle the obvious case of real injustice but there are other things he has not done.  I know one scribe in ascribing to me prematurely my Budget speech said I was going to refer to omissions in the Budget.  In effect, there are omissions. What is being done about children's allowances?  They were last adjusted in 1963.  I think it is fair to say that children's allowances represent for families in the lower income group, where the wage earner is earning something around £10 a week, the only measure of assistance for the transfer of purchasing power given by the State.  It is true that of the 950,000 children who are covered by children's allowances, something around 800,000 are in the lower income group.  There is no increase here, no effort to deal with this problem in the Budget.  It is being long-fingered.  The Minister says there is an examination taking place with regard to this difficult problem.  I am sure there is.  It was taking place last year and the year before.  Are we to face a situation in which, just because it is difficult, this mode of transferring purchasing power to the lower income group is not going to be tackled?</P>
    <P>May I say, with regard to children's allowances, that our sense of social justice is very strange indeed?  We recognise that those who pay income tax, those who pay sur-tax, may get an <Col N="87" /> allowance of from £40 to £110 per child.  In addition, in relation to many salary structures, in particular, civil servants', there is a provision whereby an ingredient in the salary structure is related to the number of children. Again, in the case of those who send children to the universities, who will not qualify for the present university scheme, who pay for their children at the university, each parent who sends a son or daughter to the university benefits from a Government grant of around £130 per student.  So that, in relation to every category of our population except the lower income group, we recognise that the responsibility for children should, in the interests of justice, engage the State.</P>
    <P>I just want to emphasise to the Minister, who, I am sure, will be anxious to regard this Budget as a great step forward in relation to the provision of some form of social justice, that we applaud what he has done but we want to indicate that a great deal more requires to be done.</P>
    <P>Omissions: it was personally of interest to me to hear the Minister say that a detailed examination is being undertaken of the feasibility of introducing an insurance or contributory scheme to finance at least part of the cost of the health services available to the lower income group.  Maybe the penny is dropping at last.  It is fair to indicate that I, having the responsibility at that time, on behalf of this Party, put forward a detailed health contributory scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;wrote it out, dotted every&ldquo;i&rdquo;, put in every comma, and crossed every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and submitted it to Deputy Seán MacEntee as Minister for Health and to his Committee and the then Taoiseach charged into this Dáil and said this scheme cannot work, using Deputy MacEntee's scheme, because it is a poll tax on people.  The plain fact is that that unfortunate, impetuous decision taken by Deputy MacEntee and his colleagues at that time has led to the complete frustration of the responsible <Col N="88" /> growth of the health services in this country and has meant that nothing has been done.  For as long as that decision remains we will not get the expansion that is desired.  At the same time, the burden of rates on ordinary people has grown and grown and grown.  What is being done about that today?  That is one of the problems of our time&mdash;the burden of rates on families of limited means in every part of our country, particularly in the small towns and in our cities.  For them there is no relief in this Budget.  There is not even the usual reference that our whole system of rating is being examined.</P>
      <P>The sooner we realise that as a system of taxation the rating system is unjust, the better.  As soon as we realise that and do something about it, circumstances in this country will being to improve.  The impact of rates applies to and affects people irrespective of the number of their dependants, irrespective of their personal income, irrespective of the losses, troubles, anxieties or difficulties they may have had in the preceding year.  Due to Government negligence, due to an obstinate refusal to take the obvious step, merely because we in Fine Gael pointed out the step, this burden has been increased in each successive year. I have no doubt that we on these benches will have a great deal more to say about this in the weeks that lie ahead.  May I conclude on the subject of rates by saying that this was clearly a year for action and it is to be regretted that, once more, nothing is being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word about housing. The Minister referred to the Capital Budget, of the details of which the House and the country were already aware.  It is to be noted that in the Capital Budget of this year there is a very large increase in capital expenditure of £25 million but of this increase, only £2.3 million is referable to housing. It is clear from the Capital Budget statement that this sum is intended merely to maintain the number of completions achieved in the last year. In fact, the increase of £2.3 million will not, I am informed, cover the increased cost of building and construction <Col N="89" /> arising from devaluation and other causes.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is&mdash;and let there be no doubt about it, because we will say it here and outside&mdash;the housing situation at the moment is a national scandal.  We were promised under the demised Second Programme that we would have 13,000 houses a year.  At the moment we are not even achieving 12,000 and with a scanty provision of this kind, it is clear that in the coming year there will be a reduction.  If one wants to seek further proof of that, one has only to look at the Capital Budget in which the provision for sanitary and miscellaneous services for servicing of land for housing is now about half what was ear-marked in the Second Programme.  These problems being so clear and so chronic, I would have expected that there would be some indication from the Minister for Finance of the Government's intention to tackle housing as an urgent social problem, for that is what it is.</P>
    <P>Apart from the lack of provision for housing, there are other factors.  I may remind the House and the Minister that today many tenants of local authority houses are finding that the rents which they have to pay are being increased substantially.  Why is that? What has caused it?  The reason is that the Minister for Local Government, acting on behalf of the Government, has told local authorities that he will pay a housing subsidy only related to a notional value of £1,650 per new house when local authority houses are costing £2,500 and £2,700 today.  He has told local authorities to get the difference by extorting it from their own tenants.</P>
    <P>The result has been that in every local authority area throughout the country unfortunate people, in the lower income group in particular, find with rapidly increasing rents, the purchasing power available to them for their families has been reduced.  Why is something not done about that?  I feel the reason is that this Government have lost touch with the social problems affecting the people.  There is a bottleneck in housing, a bottleneck by reason of insufficient money and by reason of an insufficient supply of serviced <Col N="90" /> land&mdash;a bottleneck also because local authorities are being discouraged from embarking on needed housing schemes.</P>
    <P>Agriculture: the Minister in his Budget Statement referred to an increase in agricultural output this year. I detected a very definite air of complacency in the manner in which he dealt with agriculture.  This year there was an increase&mdash;about time&mdash;but the plain fact is that over the past ten years we have had stagnation in relation to agricultural production.  Agricultural output this year was £111.4 million.  That is higher than last year and it is lower than in 1964 and over the last decade, agricultural output has increased by only about half per cent per year.  What was promised? This has nothing to do with the Common Market.  In the years before we got into the European Community, we were promised, under the Second Programme, that agricultural output would increase by 3.8 per cent per year.  The Minister expects cries of admiration because this year we struggled into about three per cent by lowering the output achieved three or four years ago.  It is perfectly clear that what is wrong with agriculture is that we have an unsuitable Minister and wrong policies being adopted.  The sooner these things are changed the better.</P>
    <P>There is to be no increase in milk. The demands made by the NFA and the creamery milk suppliers for an increase in the price of creamery milk and an increase in the quality bonus are not being met.  I wonder why?  There is to be no calf subsidy.  The increase in the guaranteed price for pigs is about one-third of what was expected. There is to be no increase in wheat or barley and we have this slight thing done about employment.  The sooner we stop codding ourselves the better. About 11,000 people have left rural employment in the 12 months which have ended.  The flight from the land is continuing unabated.  This year all farmer organisations suggested that the employment allowance might be increased from £17 to £50.  It has been £17 since the year of the flood, but nothing has been done in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> There are many other aspects of the Budget we will deal with in more detail when the debate takes place, but I want to make one final and general observation.  This Budget comes at a stage in our economic development when we should have passed finally from Bleak House and be entering a situation of Great Expectations.  But the fact is that, some three or four years after the heady promises given to the people by the leaders of Fianna Fáil, today we have 65,000 people unemployed and today we have 33,000 people emigrating.  We have gone backwards in relation to what a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, said many times was the real test of a policy&mdash;work and the provision of work.  We have an unemployment rate now which must be causing concern to the Government and is certainly causing concern to us.  We see nothing in this Budget that indicates that Government attention is to be devoted to that problem.  We have 65,000 unemployed and continuing emigration.  That means whatever 4½ per cent growth rate we had last year, whatever amount of advance of wealth the country made, that was shared by certain sections but those who want to work and live and earn their daily bread in this country are still as numerous as ever before and the tendency is upwards.</P>
    <P>These are the problems that require attention.  I believe they will only get attention when we have in office a Government with a policy.  I believe the situation now, with the collapse of the Second Programme, with its demise and with the vague promises of a Third Programme some time in the spring&mdash; when: next year or perhaps the year after?  &mdash;is that we are going to struggle on under this Government having no policy or plan of their own.  Therefore, these problems will remain until in due course the Fine Gael Party assume office in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance read his Budget Speech many times before he presented it to the House.  I am sure if he re-reads it now, he will readily agree with me that <Col N="92" /> the claim he made in the concluding portion certainly could not be sustained. In the last page of his speech he said:</P>
      <P>The budget itself will directly improve the lot of many of our people, in particular those receiving social welfare payments, small farmers and public service pensioners. The incentive it contains should aid and encourage economic expansion.</P>
      <P>I and we gladly welcome the concessions in this Budget but have not yet recognised any great incentives proposed by the Minister which are going to cause any dramatic expansion in our economy.  To my mind&mdash;I must confess it would have to be read again&mdash;this appears to me to be a safe Budget, a cosy Budget, but one which also camouflages the inactivity of the Government.  The main proposals the Minister has announced today are not the be-all and end-all of the Irish economy.  If this is, as I say, a safe and cosy Budget, we still have our problems. It is unspectacular.  I do not see any evidence of great imagination in it.  I have been in this House for 23 or 24 years and I have heard the same speech from various Ministers for Finance since I came here.  I do not think anybody would regard it as an exciting Budget.  It follows the same old pattern.  There are not many new ideas in it.</P>
      <P>There is talk and promise of new ideas by the Minister with regard to the distribution of certain forms of social welfare and the possibility of the introduction of a new form of indirect taxation like a value added tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the usual review of last year and the usual forecast of the prospects for the present year and exhortation as to what we should do in the future.  I know that in the newspapers and on television those who talk about the Budget will be mainly concerned with what are described as reliefs and taxation. Unfortunately in this country, these two things, reliefs and taxation, seem to be the only things which occupy the minds of the majority of people.  Ministers for Finance have got away with it in their Budget speeches in the knowledge that all that people <Col N="93" /> would talk about was what was in them for social welfare, who had to pay, and how much.</P>
    <P>I do say that the reliefs are welcome. Not to disappoint some newspaper correspondents, I suppose I can say they are not enough.  I concede that what the Minister has done is no small measure, but again I think more could be done if the Minister and the Government looked for sources of revenue other than the traditional sources which have been called upon, I think, every single year in the past 20 or 30 years.  I wonder what would happen if two campaigns which are going on in this country were successful.  If the Minister for Health were successful in his campaign to induce people not to smoke, where would the Minister get this money in a number of years time?  If various other societies were successful in inducing people not to drink or to drink less, the Minister for Finance, no matter what Government he might be a member of, would be in serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, I trust that these measures, these reliefs and these forms of taxation to which I have referred, will not be the sole criterion of the success or otherwise of the Minister's efforts in this Budget.  I should prefer people to judge it as I judge it on the state of the economy and not on the performance of the Minister.  Again let me repeat&mdash; because it needs to be repeated&mdash;the request to the Minister that the recipients of these increases in social assistance will not have to wait until 1st August.  I know this has been done by various Ministers for Finance and by various Governments.  I do not think there are any legislative difficulties or any administrative difficulties.  I think it could be done within a week as it was done on one occasion back in 1932 when a stamp or a booklet to restore pensions which had been cut was sent out within a week of the Fianna Fáil Party coming into office.  Do not let anyone say that the reason for not giving these payments quicker is that there are administrative or legislative difficulties.  It could be done in a week, and if money is the problem, that should be said and let us be honest about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I believe also that in view of the fact that the Government will not have to contribute such a lot, these increases to those who are in the Social Insurance Fund should be given quicker still because the contribution of the Government is relatively small.  May I say also that I believe the Minister or perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare will have to examine the whole social welfare code and he has not given an indication that he will do so.</P>
    <P>We have said in this House for a long time that we believe the employers should be required to pay more. The systems in various European countries are such that the employer pays a far bigger contribution than the employer pays here and possibly in Great Britain.  We also believe there should be a graded rate for the insurance stamp and there should be a graded system of payment for the various social welfare recipients.  I know the Minister says this will cost £5.4 million in a full year which does not appear to be a lot of money for the number of things it is possible to do and which he has done in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I have a note here to ask the Minister&mdash;and I am glad he has done it&mdash; to provide free television and radio licences for old age pensioners.  I think the House and the country will certainly applaud him for that gesture to people whose only comfort may be a radio or television set.  The fee of £5 for a licence is a very heavy burden on them.  I do not know what date the Minister mentioned but I assume this relief will be given at the date of the next renewal.  I assume that non-contributory old age pensioners and the social assistance classes will benefit and not those in the social insurance class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as the free electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the social assistance class.  I would also ask the Minister to carry out as quickly as possible a review of children's allowances with a view towards increasing, even within the amount he has, the payment to parents of large families.  I think I am correct in saying <Col N="95" /> that in the British Budget a proposal was introduced whereby income tax would be paid at a certain level of children's allowances.  So far as I am aware, in this country there is no such tax and children's allowances are exempt.</P>
      <P>We in this Party are not enthusiastic about a means test but it always occurred to us that a lot of money was being given, to put it bluntly, to people who did not really need it.  There are many thousands of families who could benefit from that money which is going to people who do not really need it and who put it in the bank or in the post office and and leave it there for years. That was not the original intention behind the children's allowances which were introduced by a former member of the present Government to assist people in rearing large families.  We should get back to that idea and ensure that they will have an adequate amount.</P>
      <P>We are not particularly happy about the 7/6 and we believe it could be more.  We believe that if the people were approached in the proper way, taxwise, by the Minister, they would be prepared to give a far better standard to social welfare recipients.  I believe that the community would be prepared to contribute to a well thought out plan, and again let me advocate something I have advocated before and which I will continue to advocate until there is a gleam of hope that it will be accepted, a separate Budget for social welfare recipients.  I know that when we talk about social welfare and include health, social welfare as we know it, and social assistance, this represents a colossal amount so far as expenditure and contributions are concerned. If there were a separate Budget for social welfare and the people knew exactly what they were paying for there would be a greater response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will vote for the new taxes the Minister has proposed because even though there will be objections from certain people, we will be voting for them in the knowledge that a good portion of the money is going to provide these increases in August and <Col N="96" /> January next.  I have referred to graded contributions and benefits.  This also is a system which is employed in many European countries and one to which serious thought should be given by the Minister and the Government.  We also applaud the introduction of the marriage allowance for a couple in the first year of marriage.  I do not think that needs to be expanded on because everyone is aware of their difficulties in relation to setting up a house.  I am not particularly happy about, and I do not intend to vote for, the Minister's proposal to increase the special sur-tax allowances for earned income from £1,250 to £2,000.  There was a proposal last year whereby those in the sur-tax bracket got £150,000 worth of relief.  It is now intended to give another £120,000.  The Minister said this was to attract the best managerial and technological talent.  He was concerned that British counterparts, I think he said, had this sort of concession or maybe a little better.  As far as managerial and technological talent are concerned, the difficulty here is that they cannot get jobs and must go to Britain.  They are not attracted by the incentives to which the Minister referred.  There are other sections that could well do with the £270,000 which is now being given&mdash; including what was given last year&mdash; and I certainly do not propose to vote for this proposal on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The relief given to agriculture will certainly be welcomed by pig producers and also the proposal to abolish Schedule B in respect of, I think, a certain type of farmer.  I am not certain if it goes entirely.  Undoubtedly that will be of benefit.  Whilst we welcome that sort of benefit for agriculture, may I say that the whole system of aid to agriculture in this country needs to be revised?</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, 60 per cent of the farmers of this country have holdings of under 50 acres.  The proportion of State aid is £50 to £60 million or maybe over £60 million.  Sixty per cent of that sum does not go into those particular holdings.  If we are to get agriculture out of the state in which it has been for decades then I believe that, of the money available for agriculture, there must be much more <Col N="97" /> assistance for and investment in the type of farm owned by 60 per cent of the population of this country, the 50-acre farm and under.  I am not saying we should draw the line at that. The farming industry as a whole should be assisted but the concentration of effort should be on the small type of farm, say, the farm of 50 acres or less.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the complacency of the Minister with regard to the economy and the performance of this country in 1967.  This is not the Minister's form.  We are told that GNP in 1967 rose by 4¼ per cent.  The Minister compared that with the performance of other European countries which had attained only one per cent or two per cent, forgetting, of course, the sustained increase in those countries for the past ten or 15 years.  In comparison with 1966, the figure is very good and in comparison with 1965 it is extremely good.  However, there was a reason for it and, to some extent, it was artificial.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should assume or that anybody could assume from the Minister's speech that things will be just as good, or maybe better, in 1968. Our exports increased in volume and in price and, in no small measure, that was because of the epidemic of foot and mouth disease in Britain.  We are not hoping Britain will have a foot and mouth disease epidemic next year in order that we might export more and dearer cattle to them in such circumstances. It is unlikely, therefore, that 1968 will be as good, as far as the export of cattle is concerned, as 1967 because, as the Minister knows, I am sure better than I do, it would mean we should have to eat into our breeding stocks, which would be a catastrophe for this country.</P>
    <P>We are very pleased the net surplus in our balance of payments was £10 million.  However, the reason for it was peculiar to 1967 and may not obtain in 1968 although we hope it will.</P>
    <P>Import prices fell.  They will rise this year&mdash;because of devaluation&mdash;certainly from countries other than Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The growth in investment in 1967 was low and, therefore, there was a low amount of capital imports.  This <Col N="98" /> should be our first concern.  There was a low increase in personal consumption&mdash;2½ per cent compared with four per cent in other years.  It is satisfactory that the people saved more and thus made a little more money available to the Government for investment here.</P>
    <P>Speaking about this £10 million surplus, the NIEC Report said it was neither undesirable nor unsustainable. It was undesirable because we are a developing economy.  We should be prepared, for a certain number of years, to have a deficit in our balance of payments because we need to import capital goods.  I am glad to note that the Minister nods approval.  On the other hand, we had a report from his Department forecasting that our balance of payments position would more or less continue as it was last year, namely with a small surplus from year to year.  If that is merely our aim, our economy will never progress.  We need capital imports, particularly for industry.  If we keep a main eye on the balance of payments all the time, our economy will not develop.</P>
    <P>I find a conflict in this, inasmuch as there are members of the Department of Finance who prepared that review of 1967 who are also members of NIEC.  I see a conflict there: I do not know whether or not the Minister does.  However, if the GNP increase was good last year, and if our balance of payments was favourable, we have to look at the other side of the picture, to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, and to which the Minister hardly referred in his speech.  I find it peculiar in politicians such as the Minister and his predecessors in Fianna Fáil Government that they devote very little attention in their Budget speech to the problem of unemployment and to getting down to specific facts.  I looked up the Minister's speech to see in what paragraph there was a reference to employment or to unemployment but it was not there.  We are talking vaguely about progress and further development this year.  We must think of industrial improvement in terms of people.</P>
    <P>In this year, compared with 1966, <Col N="99" /> there were 3,000 fewer at work.  In 1961, the figure was 1,052,000.  There was an increase in the total numbers at work between 1961 and 1964 but, in 1965, 1966 and 1967, there was a steady decline.  When he is replying next week or the week after, perhaps the Minister will explain this.  Was it as a result of the restrictive and panic measures the Government took in 1965?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into all the details which, I am sure, will be referred to <i>ad nauseam</i> in the debate. In manufacturing industry&mdash;where all our hopes lie&mdash;we fell flat on our faces. In the two years from 1965 to 1967, we got an extra 4,000 jobs in manufacturing industry.  Where are we going, when we remember that, in 1967, 11,000 people left the land and that thousands left it in the years before that and that thousands will continue to leave it, if we are to believe the Minister for Transport and Power, for very many years to come?</P>
    <P>It is long past the time when the Second Programme for Economic Expansion should be reviewed when we remember that it was forecast or anticipated that, in each of those years, there would be an extra 7,800 new jobs. We have not attained anything like that number.  As a matter of fact, since 1964, I think a year or two or three years after the introduction of that Programme, we have had the smallest number at work in the past three or four years.  Unemployment is at the highest figure since 1961 with an average of 57,000 during the year.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can draw from those figures, related to the Minister's speech, is that the balance of payments seems to be the first priority of the Government with unemployment a poor second.  The NIEC gave pretty sound advice on that when they said we should be prepared to have a deficit for many years to come, that is, if it is resulting from the importation of capital goods for the building up of industry.  I think that the slow-down in the importation of capital goods also needs an answer.  Last year&mdash;and the Minister was very bouncy then&mdash;the Minister said that the major objective <Col N="100" /> was to step up investment.  He said investment had been stepped up in 1967 but if that is so, there have been no good results as regards employment. I do not know where Deputy O'Higgins got his figure of 33,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I take my statistics from over here.  I do not think investment has been stepped up and if it has been, money-wise, we have not got real results from it because there has been very little progress in 1967.  We must ask ourselves whose fault that is.  Do we blame Irish industry, private enterprise or the Government?  I do not believe the Government do enough.  I have said on many occasions that it is not sufficient to give incentives; initiative must be shown and there must be push from the Government and, if necessary, action and intervention by the Government.  I do not believe that Irish industry has exploited the potential of the home market.  All the evidence is there for the Irish housewife to see.  As a result of the Ango-Irish Free Trade Agreement and as a result of the lowering of barriers retained up to a few years ago under the Lemass plan, there are many more foreign articles on display in the shops here now.  We are going into the era of free trade, private enterprise, and we must meet this competition but it appears to me that as far as the home market is concerned Irish industry and management have been lagging behind and that for their own sake and particularly for the sake of their employees they will have to do something to ensure that they will be able to do more than compete with British and European manufacturers if they are to keep their market at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have the Government done? They have provided adaptation grants and other incentives but&mdash;and this is typical of many facets of Irish industry &mdash;it appears that the money offered by the Government was not taken up and on two or three occasions the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to come into this House to say that they were extending the time limit.  Irish industry has not availed of the help <Col N="101" /> offered by the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to re-offer it.  We cannot go along in that position for ever.  Something more positive must be done at least to see that those who fall down on the job in Irish industry and management will do the right thing as far as the nation and the community is concerned because they have a responsibility to both.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong in this but the Minister has talked at length about our external reserves and I feel the question should be asked : what is the safe level for our external reserves? Is there some magic formula?  I know the external reserves held by the Central Bank and by the commercial banks cannot all be related to money reserves.  I do not know what the formula is but I know that in 1967 these had reached an all-time record level. I ask, as any ordinary person who does not know much about economics might ask, what is the level.  Also, why have all that money in Britain?  I know it is necessary to have reserves but I remember the present Taoiseach went to America and I think also to Bonn looking for money, a miserable £7 million or £15 million.  Aer Lingus have had occasion to go abroad to borrow money; likewise the Irish Sugar Company, and here we have a record amount of money in Great Britain.  I do not say we should have none of it but could not the Central Bank and the commercial banks take back money needed for the development of Aer Lingus or Bord na Móna or some other State institution?  These questions will, I think, have to be answered by the Minister for Finance at the end of this debate.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked how we could invest this money if we had it.  There has been a very successful venture in this country in recent years which I think is called the Northgate Mining Company.  They have been exploiting the mineral wealth we have in Galway and I now believe they are embarking on what is expected to be a very successful operation.  We have been very lazy in this country for the past 30 or 40 years and it was only in the past seven or eight years that some returned <Col N="102" /> Irishman from Canada came here and discovered that there was something of value in the ground in Galway.  Now he discovers there is something of value in Athlone.  I have heard questions asked in this House for the past 20 years about geological surveys to discover if there was any wealth in the country.</P>
    <P>We were all told since we went to school that we had no natural resources except green grass and good cattle, and that was the end of it.  Yet, this man discovers we have real wealth.  Is it not possible that in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency there might be other mineral wealth or even in the Minister's farms or in my own constituency, but nobody is bothering?  We have to wait for private enterprise which is getting a pretty good profit out of it.  Why cannot some State institution make some effort to see whether there is a similar type of wealth elsewhere in the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to think deeply about this and to try to discover whether we may have some other natural resources besides the rain and the grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion last year, I had the pleasure of hearing and seeing the Minister on television and he said that indirect taxation hits poor people hard. I do not know how he can reconcile that with his statement today.  There is this principle that there should be greater emphasis on indirect taxation. I am not against certain forms of indirect taxation but I and my Party are against this blanket spread that we always seem to have, the spread like that of the wholesale tax and the turnover tax and the added value tax.  All these will hit everybody.  I think the Minister must come down to what may be described as the lowest denominator so far as wealth is concerned and realise the old age pensioner, the man who will now get £3 5s 0d a week, is being taxed in the same proportion as the wealthy man who decides to buy an expensive yacht.  We have always regarded indirect taxation as taxation <Col N="103" /> on everybody and believed that there could not be any exception, but I think that if the Minister wants to pursue the policy of indirect taxation, he should think in terms of luxury and leisure goods for some indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say at this stage on the Budget.  It is not a Budget that is going to solve our problems.  It is a cosy and safe Budget for which, no doubt, the Minister will be applauded by many people but there is a vast number of people who get nothing out of this Budget but who will have to pay the piper as usual.  They will have to pay in indirect taxation.  Nobody could regard the goods concerned as essential commodities but this Budget follows the same old pattern.  If the campaign to stop drinking and smoking were successful, I do not know what the Minister would do to balance his Budget.</P>

      <P>Again may I explain that this is a very far out possibility.  It has no immediate significance.  It just means that if as a result of the rationalisation of wear and tear allowances somebody in the future has to pay a little bit extra in taxation &mdash; though again that is a remote possibility&mdash;this resolution will cover such an eventuality.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that this is bound to increase costs.  There are certain excepted cases, but it will in general increase costs and increase them substantially.  I notice <Col N="110" /> that the Minister said he was giving tax reliefs in other cases, but he made no reference whatsoever to a category which has been referred to in this House by myself and a number of other Deputies over a long period, that is, the man who uses a motor vehicle to go to work and if he does not use that vehicle he is on the labour exchange. This man will have to pay 2d extra the same as everybody else, and the Minister made no effort at all to give him any relief, say, by way of earned income allowance.  I think that is wrong and something should have been done.  I do not wish to transgress the rules of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but the Minister should have done something to improve the position of that type of person who is caught now.  Instead of having his position improved he is now stuck for an extra  a gallon.  Some of the old jalopies which such people have will not do more than 15 or 20 miles per gallon.</P>

      <P>The yield which the Minister expects is £1.2 million, which is a lot of money.  Our view on this is clear.  We are sensitive in relation to anything that is likely to affect living costs, particularly at this moment.  There is a grave danger if we, by any taxation, increase the cost of living and so affect our economic prospects for the year ahead. <Col N="111" /> We feel this is bound to have its effect.  Twopence a gallon on petrol is bound to affect distributive costs, bound to affect people in a variety of ways, as Deputy Tully mentioned.  I hope what the Minister mentioned may transpire but there is no guarantee that it will.  Even if it did transpire, presumably the residue of the tax would affect distributive costs.  We are <Col N="112" /> against this.  There are many other sources of taxation from which the Minister could have got his £1.2 million. There are luxury items which I am not going to mention&mdash;it is a matter entirely for the Minister&mdash;and he could have got £1 million from these other sources without affecting sensitive commodities such as petrol.</P>

      <P>(2)  That the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution&mdash;</P>

      <P>(3)  That&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  this paragraph applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 159) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1966 (S.I.

    <P>(5)  That, subject to the provisions of paragraph (6) of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 23rd day of April, 1968, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(6)  That the duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 23rd day of April, 1968, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>

    <P>

    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(7)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 30th day of April, 1968, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 23rd day of April, 1968, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (7) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b)  render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 23rd day of April, 1968.</P>

    <P>(10)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(11)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (5) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>

      <P>I am amazed that Labour Deputies are questioning the <Col N="131" /> price of brandy because I always associated brandy with that aristocratic team over there, and I never associated it with the Labour Party.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy Corry's information, the Labour Party are anxious to know the position so far as tax assessment is concerned on every commodity.  Under Financial Resolution No. 6, the duty on brandy has been increased by 6d per glass and the people who will be contributing that tax are entitled, as members of the general public, to know exactly what tax they are paying to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Sweetman's question is that we have differentiated in regard to foreign spirits.  Because of the Free Trade Agreement, it is necessary to exclude imports from the UK from the additional charge on spirits since the duty on home-made spirits is not being increased.  The way it has to be done is this: a blanket increase is put on all imported spirits and then in Part II, we fix special rates for the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. What I do not understand is the 4s difference in Part I between preferential rates and the full rates.  There is only 4s involved between £24 15s 9d and £24 19s 9d.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Bill, 1967: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>It is required in order that full effect can be given to arrangements made with the British vehicle manufacturers and assemblers and with assemblers of non-British vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately after the conclusion of <Col N="142" /> the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, discussions were taken with British motor manufacturers and their Irish assemblers, with the co-operation of the British authorities.  The basis of the arrangements now agreed upon is simple.  The manufacturers and assemblers of British vehicles have given me satisfactory assurances of their intention to support the continued assembly of their motor vehicles in Ireland on a long-term basis, and, in return, the Government agreed to extend immediately to these manufacturers the duty reductions on fully built-up vehicles which would not otherwise fully mature until 1975.  This means that these vehicles will be admitted free of protective duty.</P>
    <P>These assurances provide for maintenance of assembly at the general level achieved immediately prior to the conclusion of the Free Trade Area Agreement, when assembly operations were at a high level generally, and there is also an expression of intent to expand such assembly operations, in so far as this may be consistent with the economics of the operations and the development of the market.  In connection with these assurances regard must, of course, be had to fluctuations in market demand which might affect the industry as a whole or the position of particular firms within the industry.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the public announcement, in regard to the arrangements, at the end of November, I have offered comparable concessions to assemblers of non-British vehicles subject to satisfactory assurances given by the manufacturers and assemblers of these vehicles.  I am happy to say that satisfactory assurances have been received from the firms concerned and I have been able to extend the benefits of the arrangements to these firms also.</P>
    <P>The main provision of the Bill is one for the channelling of imports of fully built-up motor vehicles through registered firms&mdash;principally the existing assemblers who have given me the assurances to which I have referred. This provision for improved channels of trade is necessary to ensure that, as the duties on British vehicles are reduced under the Free Trade Agreement, <Col N="143" /> the arrangements will not be undermined by the importation of vehicles by persons who are not parties to the agreed arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to the principal classes of motor vehicles other than agricultural tractors, large buses and some other vehicles which were not subject to the former quota arrangements. It does not apply to such vehicles as scooters and motor cycles. It covers second-hand vehicles because, otherwise, evasion of the scheme would be possible.  Provision is made to enable the definition of motor vehicle to be amended by Ministerial regulations so as to take account of future technical developments and also to permit adjustment of the definition in the light of any difficulties or anomalies that may become evident in the practical application of the measure.</P>
    <P>As I have said, all assembly firms which comply with the arrangements will be eligible for registration as importers of fully built-up motor vehicles of the makes and marques which they now handle.  A firm may be removed from the register only where it is in breach of an assurance or undertaking given in connection with the arrangements or, by agreement, where a firm merges with another or goes out of business.  In the case of assemblers of British vehicles, the only requirement for registration is the assurances they have given to maintain the level of their assembly operations, and all firms concerned have already furnished me with the kind of information which I consider necessary to enable me, if the need arises, to judge whether a firm is complying with its assurance in this regard.</P>
    <P>Assemblers of non-British vehicles, who give assurances to maintain, at least, their basic level of assembly, will also be registered.  Subject only to a Free Trade Area duty preference for British-built private cars, they will be allowed to do as well in all respects, in the aggregate, as assemblers of British vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not affect the importation of c.k.d. aggregates and there will be nothing to prevent anyone from <Col N="144" /> starting up in the motor assembly business.  There is provision to enable such new entrants to qualify for registration as importers of fully built-up vehicles, subject to their achieving a satisfactory volume of assembly.</P>
    <P>Although the main purpose of the Bill is to channel imports through the assembly firms, there is provision in the Bill to cover, in certain circumstances, the importation of fully built-up vehicles by firms which are not in the assembly business.  One example is British cars of over £1,300 in value c.i.f. which, in the past, were not subject to quota and are imported by certain firms who are not engaged in assembly.  These imports will be permitted to continue.  After the quota arrangements had been abolished and up to the time the new scheme was announced, a few firms, which are not in the assembly business, imported small numbers of non-British vehicles in fully built-up condition.  They will be enabled to continue on that scale. The duty concessions will not, of course, apply since they are available only to registered importers who assemble.  Fully built-up imports, mainly by private individuals, will also be allowed on change of residence, tourist or other temporary importation and in other similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record my personal appreciation, and also the appreciation of my colleagues in the Government, of the willing co-operation which the manufacturers and assemblers displayed at all stages of the negotiations and which will, I am sure, continue in the future.  We are also appreciative of the assistance and co-operation afforded by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements have been welcomed by the industry and I am confident that all concerned will actively co-operate in seeing that they work out satisfactorily.  In conducting the negotiations and in making the duty adjustments, the Government have done everything in their power to secure the survival of the Irish motor assembly industry, at its present level at least, for a long period ahead.  How successful these efforts may prove in <Col N="145" /> the future will depend to an increasing extent on the attitudes, not only of the management in the assembly industry, but also of the workers.  Everybody concerned in the industry must endeavour to secure the highest possible level of efficient and economic operation in the assembly of motor vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, before I proceed with my contribution on the Bill, I should like to ask the Minister what is the position as we move towards the Common Market and reduce our tariffs?  In our present international situation, we can agree with what is in this Bill, but if we enter the Common Market, are the extensions of licences for importing and the restricting of the import of certain categories of vehicles to certain firms possible under Common Market arrangements, because it would appear to me that they would not be?  This is a salient point which, I am sure without any desire on his part, is omitted from the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that on a strict interpretation of the regulations of the EEC, this scheme would not be possible.  It is also true that on a strict interpretation of the Free Trade Area Agreement, it would not be possible. But we did succeed in negotiating it with the parties concerned, including, of course, the British Government. Naturally, I cannot say at this stage what the effect would be on our negotiation with the EEC but I would say that having the scheme in operation before we commence negotiations puts us in a stronger position than we would be in trying to get them to agree to it if it were not in operation, if the Deputy understands what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to ask that question. It was in this House that Deputy Lemass, when Taoiseach, was asked what would be the position of the motor assembly industry here in the event of free trade.  It was Deputy Dillon who asked the question.  The reply at the time was not very encouraging <Col N="146" /> to those engaged in the business. It was a factual question and a factual answer from two men who were not used to gilding lilies.  An arrangement was necessary and it was absolutely essential for the Minister now in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce to consider this matter seriously and to try to make whatever arrangement was possible.</P>
      <P>Motor cars are not manufactured at every crossroads.  If one takes a few of the assembly firms in Britain and a few of the main Continental firms one gets an idea of the total impact on the employment and production that we in this country enjoy.  There was a very small club with which we could negotiate.  That the Minister has succeeded in negotiating is a very good thing.  It is a very good thing that we are now in the position that those people who have the power to say so have given expression of intent &mdash; I quote from the Minister's speech&mdash;to expand their work here and, at least, keep it at the present level of production.</P>
      <P>When I asked the question, I knew, but wanted to be clear because the Minister had not adverted to it, that this sort of agreement would be directly contrary to the precepts of the Treaty of Rome.  The Minister is quite right when he says in reply to me that it is also contrary to the precepts and spirit of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  At the same time, the fact that we have hope now where hope did not exist before&mdash;if we are to believe the answer given across the floor of the House to Deputy Dillon by Deputy Seán Lemass when he was Taoiseach&mdash;is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are things about it that must be adverted to, one of which is that the sale of motor vehicles here now is restricted, again, to this small club and we know that when there was a purchase tax in Britain on motor vehicles, at times amounting to as much as 17½ per cent and there was no purchase tax, turnover tax or special wholesale tax in operation here, the cost of a car here was as high as the cost of a similar car in Britain.  Taking into account the cost of the transport <Col N="147" /> of the completely knocked down vehicle and the fact that the assembly lines in Britain, where there is greater population and greater demand, would be more efficient than the assembly lines here, it did seem strange to ordinary purchasers of cars that over so many years the cost here was as high as the cost in Britain.</P>
    <P>While expressing every hope and desire that the workers should continue to be employed and the industry should continue to prosper, I must say that we are now in the position that a very small club will have complete control of the importation of vehicles to this country and that it will not be possible for the outsider, even by paying a tariff, to import.  This is made quite clear by the Minister, who refers to this as the main part of the Bill. This means that these people will be all-powerful.</P>
    <P>While adverting to that, I want to say that it is a good step forward but, from the answer to the question which I asked in opening my speech, as to whether this could be continued in Common Market conditions, it is obvious that it is not a permanent situation, that the industry is not something that can be regarded as a blossoming industry that will continue for the next 25 years.  It is a stop-gap situation.  That does not mean that the Minister should not stop gaps or that I am being critical of him.  When I say it is stop-gap, I am not critical. Anyone in the same position as he is in would stop the gap too and I would even go so far as to say that the Minister made a good job of stopping the gap.  At the same time, this is not a permanent arrangement for the industry.  It appears to me that in regard to the exportation of motor vehicles the only permanency that there could have been and which might have blossomed from the arrangement made by the Minister is the rationalisation of the motor assembly business.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of cars assembled in Britain for large combines and exported to contacts overseas. There is no reason why, if an assembly line in Dublin is as efficient as an assembly line in Birmingham or anywhere <Col N="148" /> else, the same model car could not be assembled here and exported. There are many countries which have as yet no motor assembly business. Many thousands of cars are exported from Britain.  If we could have got the all-powerful British combines to arrange that a portion of their export orders could be met from here then we would have been in the position that we could look forward to permanency for the industry whereas all we have succeeded in doing is producing a stop-gap solution which means that men will continue to work.  This is of the utmost importance and I want to emphasise again I am not criticising the Minister for going to the fair and getting a price which may not look so good when one comes home.  I am merely saying that it would be far better if we could get our assembly industry linked with the British assembly industry so that there would be permanence.</P>
    <P>One of the flaws I see in the Bill and in the arrangements made by the Minister is that there does not seem to be any attention given to the question of whether or not too much will be charged for a vehicle here.  I have already referred to the fact that prices were charged here for cars equal to the prices in Britain where there was a tax of 17½ per cent while there was no such tax in operation here.  That has been the object of suspicion on the part of the consumers in this country over many decades, certainly over the past two decades.  Here we have handed the consumer over to the assembler.  We must keep the men employed. This is the right line to take. At the same time, I would have liked to have seen in this Bill some arrangement whereby the Minister would have access to the cost of vehicles assembled here and the price that would be charged for them and, also, some arrangement whereby the vehicles that might be imported here by assembling firms ready to be driven from the docks, would not carry exorbitant profits and fair control over an industry that is surely now living in an artificial climate.  The only thing I feel is wrong about the situation is that the climate should be so artificial, that <Col N="149" /> there is no arrangement for meeting the free trade challenge in the future and that it could be merely a temporary solution.  I do not criticise the Minister for it but I hope that what is now being produced to us as a temporary solution could become over the next few years a permanent solution by a rationalisation and a blending into the British export assembly industry and that the Minister will make every effort to see that over the decades rather than the years the men employed would remain so employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is interested in the assurances the Minister has been able to obtain that in cases where permission for the importation of fully assembled cars has been given the British assembly firms engaged will maintain the level of assembly that previously existed.  I do not know to what extent these assurances are completely valid.  The demand for motor cars is increasing substantially but, if there is a recession, there follows automatically a recession in the demand for motor cars.  In such circumstances the type of assurance given to the Minister may well be qualified by the trade conditions at a particular time.  While in the process of obtaining a further commitment from the bodies concerned, damage may already have been done to the assembly industry by loss of employment.  The Minister is aware that as a result of a so-called process of rationalisation in the last year or so&mdash;whether it is properly called that or not I do not know&mdash; many workers employed for many years in a particular concern found that overnight their employment was no longer available and they were taken over by another larger concern and the difficulties of such a change on employment conditions and so on were thrust upon those workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a matter of comment and may be a direct reflection on the firms engaging in the assembly industry here, that cars assembled in Dublin and Cork are costlier to purchase than cars assembled and sent in here even after the payment of duty. There is no doubt whatever that the <Col N="150" /> skill of the workers in the assembly industry here is equal to that of the workers in the assembly industry in Britain.  There may well be either a lack of ability on the part of those who control the assembly firms or a desire by them to earn profits out of proportion to their industrial operations.  It is hard to understand the excess prices being demanded for Irish assembled cars.  When the Minister has had these consultations he might investigate whether management efficiency in these firms is all that is desired and whether management are endeavouring to obtain this proportionate profit from a relatively smaller production.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister says the new arrangement has been welcomed by the industry and that he is confident that all concerned will actively co-operate in seeing that it works satisfactorily. The Minister indicated his concern for the workers.  Could he indicate when replying whether his Department had any consultations with the representatives of the workers in this industry? It may well be that he had but it is not clear from his speech whether the workers' representatives were actually consulted and their opinions obtained.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which could well have more detailed examination by the Minister.  The British assembly industry is a very large industry, but a high percentage of the components that make up a motor car are not directly manufactured by firms engaged in motor car assembly.  I suppose if one were to sit down and start to make a list of the multifarious parts going to make up a motor-car it would be a very imposing list indeed of the parts supplied by component manufacturing firms.  Has there been any attempt to encourage the development in this country of component manufacturing firms?  I could well understand in regard to body pressings, the manufacture of the main chassis and engine parts, that the tooling up process is a very large undertaking, indeed, requiring major capital investment, large-scale plant and possibly very large manpower. But once you depart from the main component there are many components <Col N="151" /> made in Britain by relatively small specialist firms employing relatively small numbers of workers.  Has the Department made any investigation into the establishment of such specialist firms in this country?  Not only could they supply the components for motor-car assembly in Ireland but possibly they might be able to engage in the export of components.  Consequently they would serve the dual purpose of helping to maintain assembly here and at the same time providing work for skilled operatives engaged in the manufacture of components not normally made by assembly firms.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Donegan, I feel what is before us may prove in the long term to be only a stop-gap, unless further efforts are made to think in terms of manufacture apart from pure assembly and in terms of the manufacture of as many components of motor cars as possible.</P>
    <P>The body shells of motor cars are becoming increasingly almost a repetition of one another.  If the name were taken off the body shells in many cases, it would be found difficult to distinguish one from another.  Again in the engine blocks, there is very little dissimilarity.  Many of the component parts which go to make up modern motor cars are interchangeable.  That can be seeen in the British Motor Car Corporation and the American-supported companies like Opel and Vauxhall.  They have about 15 or 20 different types of cars using interchangeable clutches or something else. With the exercise of some study and some investment of capital in engineering technical know-how, it should be possible to have development in this field.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the remarks I wanted to make.  I appreciate the Minister's expression of concern for the maintenance of a level of employment for the workers in this industry. I should like to query whether in fact the assurance both from the British firms and the other continental firms who do not assemble in this country are not assurances that could easily be avoided at particular times.  I should <Col N="152" /> like him to indicate to the House whether he and his Department had consultations with representatives, and the nature and extent of such consultations. He has indicated his concern about workers in the assembly industry. We on these benches are interested in the effect on the consumers, those who wish to buy motor cars, and whether they are being required to pay too much because of a profit-making concern getting a larger slice than they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are deeply concerned with the question of the maintenance of employment of workers in Dublin, Cork or any part of the country, and the maintenance of their employment in this industry not just for a period of six or 12 months or two years but for a much longer term.  If we do not demonstrate that we care sufficiently about the maintenance of the employment of the workers in any industry, the best of the workers will find somewhere to go and their talents, skill and ability and their contribution to our economy will be lost to the country for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the apprehension expressed by the two previous speakers in regard to this Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Larkin and I have a common interest in the future of the motor assembly industry because it is very significant that in our constituency there is employed a good percentage of those who work in the assembly trade and they are earning very good money at present.  As Deputy Larkin says, there were certain upheavals in the industry in the past year and all involved are very concerned about the future of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could have been far more informative in regard to the nature of the assurances he has obtained from the motor assemblers.  Personally I am sceptical.  I seem to recall, speaking purely from recollection, that the CIO had some fairly harsh criticisms to make of the motor assemblers in this country.  A very significant fact which we have to face up to is that the motor assemblers who have certain contractural arrangements with their British principals and are tied up <Col N="153" /> with the parent companies are likely to make far more profit out of importing cars to this country and distributing them here than through the process of manufacture in this country.  That fact was brought out by the CIO who went on to say that the assmblers were far from forthcoming in producing plans for the diversification of the industry.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Minister to tell us far more than he has done about the nature of the assurances for safeguarding the employment of my constituents and his.  I personally apprehend that while they are tooled up for their present models they will continue to produce them because a retooling up process is very expensive and involves a substantial capital investment.  I would feel much happier about this measure if the Minister would inform us far more fully than he has done of the nature of these assurances and as to their future intentions with regard to the safeguarding of the employment of the skilled workers in the trade.  Unfortunately not all of these tradesmen, in the old fashioned sense of the term, are in a position to obtain employment in other industries.  I am worried about their future and I should like to hear from the Minister about the assurances he has obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the first point I should make is that it is misleading to suggest that this is a stop-gap scheme or that it is designed to last for nine months, which I think was mentioned, or a few years.  In actual fact, the term contemplated and made clear in the negotiations was 25 years and the only qualification was the matter raised by Deputy Donegan, that is, our possible entry into the EEC.  As I have said, it is not possible for me at this stage to say what the outcome of our negotiations in regard to entry into the EEC will be in so far as this concerns the motor assembly industry. Obviously I cannot give any concrete assurance in that regard, but nevertheless it would be unrealistic not to recognise the fact, as I pointed out, that this scheme, on a strict interpretation of the Free Trade Area Agreement, is contrary to it.  Nevertheless, <Col N="154" /> the scheme has evolved and been agreed to as a result of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as far as the Commission of EEC is concerned, it has demonstrated on a number of occasions in its operations that, while it is anxious to secure equal application of the rules of the Community within the Community, it has regard to special difficulties arising in the economy of any particular member and is prepared to make special arrangements where specific difficulties arise.  While I cannot enter into any commitment in advance of such negotiations, I think I can say it would be unduly pessimistic to visualise that this arrangement could not carry on when we are within EEC.  There might possibly be some modifications of the scheme.  I would hope and believe they would be minor and that the substance of the scheme would be carried into the Community.</P>
      <P>The term contemplated in this regard is 25 years.  I want to lay some considerable stress on that lest any of the speeches here today should unintentionally&mdash;I have no doubt it would be unintentional&mdash;create undue disquiet among the workers concerned in this industry.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons there has been difficulty in this industry in recent years is this very lack of certainty and the knowledge of the facts of the situation as set out in the CIO Report.  In the light of this agreement, I believe all concerned in this industry can now go ahead in the confident assurance that this scheme will operate for a very long time provided everybody concerned is prepared to implement it. We have no reason to believe that everybody concerned is not prepared to implement it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred to something that I think is a fact, certainly in relation to some of the assemblers, namely, that it would be more profitable for some of them to stop assembly and simply to import fully built-up vehicles.  The fact that, despite that, they have agreed to this scheme is I think evidence that they are concerned with more than their rate of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Furthermore, in regard to some things said by Deputy Larkin, I think I ought to reiterate that the whole point of these negotiations&mdash;they were lengthy and at times tedious&mdash;the whole point of making this arrangement and of bringing this Bill before the House, is to secure the employment of the workers in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point raised by Deputy Larkin.  I do not want any misunderstanding about this.  I do not know if Deputy Larkin meant to imply this in what he said but it could be taken from what he said that there was some doubt as to Government concern about the employment of workers in this industry.  I do not think any reasonable person could have any doubt about this fact because, if the Government had not been so concerned, these negotiations would not have taken place and this Bill would not be before this House today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin asked whether or not there were negotiations or consultations with the workers' representatives, the trade unions.  The answer, which I gave in the House some time ago, in answer to a question, is &ldquo;No&rdquo;: there were not.  The trade union representatives were informed of the scheme but they were not consulted for the simple reason that they could not, no matter how much goodwill they had towards the objective&mdash;obviously they would be concerned with the objective to retain the employment of the workers &mdash;ensure the carrying-out or the entering into of this arrangement.  The people who could make or break this arrangement were the British manufacturers, the assemblers here, our Government and the British Government. Without them, this agreement could not be made.</P>
      <P>The trade union representatives were informed of the arrangements before they were made public, which was as far as we could go.  I think there were some interim talks with them but no consultations in the sense, I think, Deputy Larkin meant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the sense I think the Deputy meant it.  I have referred to the question of some assemblers, at least, being in the position where they could make greater profits by dropping assembly.  That brings me to the feeling of many people that the price of cars assembled here in the past should have been lower having regard to the fact that similar cars were selling in Britain at lower prices even when subject to purchase tax.  I have not the figures at the moment but there are two factors which should be borne in mind in all fairness to our assemblers, both management and workers.</P>
      <P>Criticisms I have heard in this regard have not been directed solely at the management on the ground of making too much profit, I have also heard allgations that the workers concerned were not doing their job.  I do not think either of these allegations was justified.  There are two points which must be borne in mind.  The first point is that CKD aggregates, completely knocked-down parts, brought in for assembly were subject to a fiscal duty of 20 per cent.  Since November last, that has been reduced to 17½ per cent.  This was a cost built-in that neither the management nor the workers could do anything about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it may seem, on the face of it, that if you get all the parts of a car, unassembled, and assemble them, the difference between what you pay for the parts unassembled and the cost of the completed car should be the cost of the wages and skill put into the work.  That is not so.  The cost of CKD aggregates, relatively, is very much higher.  I am told that manufacturers of motor cars on a large scale have a very complicated assembly line, bringing all the components together from different areas.  They work along an assembly line.  It is cheaper for them, in some cases, to complete a car and take it asunder than to take portions out to put into a CKD pack.  This may be an extreme case.  I do not guarantee it happens in all cases.  However, in most countries where the industry is an assembly <Col N="157" /> industry, as distinct from a manufacturing industry, this has been a big bone of contention&mdash;the amount charged by the manufacturers for the CKD parts and the reason given by the manufacturers is that it costs them a great deal of money to stop the production line and take out certain parts where you have different operations in different countries, some countries assembling at one level and some at another.  These are two major factors in the costs which should be borne in mind before one enters into criticism of the assemblers, management and workers, as to the cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeatedly from Government benches&mdash;and this includes the Taoiseach&mdash;there has been criticism of faulty workmanship and of many other things in manufacture and these criticisms have been properly laid where they belong, on the people in charge of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might recall what I said, that there had been criticism&mdash;I did not say that I am making criticism&mdash;both of the employers and the workers in this industry and I was pointing out that these two major factors should be taken into account in any assessment of the performance of this industry in the past.  The point was made by Deputy Larkin&mdash;or at least he inquired&mdash;as to whether efforts had been made to develop a components industry, an industry for the manufacture of components as distinct from assembling.  Some efforts have been made but, perhaps, I should add that at the moment springs, tyres, batteries, sparking plugs, glass, unholstery and paints are all produced here for cars assembled in this country.  Some of the industries providing these components at present may face difficulties because they are operating here on a relatively small market, that is unless they can secure orders from manufacturers outside <Col N="158" /> the country.  The difficulties for them in doing this are, first, that unless they are producing something in which some kind of specialist skill is brought to bear, it is unlikely that they can produce very much cheaper than a competitor firm in another country.  Then, the fact that they are producing here means that the goods would have to be shipped to a manufacturer in another country and that adds to the costs. This means they are working under considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I recently had the privilege of opening a new factory at Naas, a factory making mirrors for motor cars.  It is a subsidiary of an American company but they are geared for the export market.  They have been supplying cars assembled here from abroad, but they are now going to supply for the export market largely because they have a specialist quality in producing these mirrors which may seem fairly simple but are not.  Apparently, there have been technological developments in regard to mirrors for cars in making them meet safety regulations which mean that this firm which was opened recently should, I think, do very well on the export market.  Unless a firm has this particular kind of expertise its chances of doing much business outside the country in the manufacture of components for motor cars are not very good.</P>
      <P>I do not say we should leave the matter there.  Manufacturers of components will, of course, be enabled to continue to supply the cars which are being assembled here and which would not be assembled if we did not have this scheme, but these cars will be forming a smaller proportion of a growing home market than in the past. This means that some of these manufacturers may have an opportunity with the home market still in existence, which they would not otherwise have, of developing on the basis of the home market into foreign markets but to do so they would need to have some specialist quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Larkin raised the question of what was the value of the assurance we have received.  I think Deputy Byrne also raised it.  Deputy <Col N="159" /> Larkin said that he wondered what all these assurances would be worth in a time of recession.  I can only say that, as of now, most, if not all, firms in the assembling industry are working virtually to full capacity, many of them certainly at full capacity including the maximum overtime they can work.  As our market grows&mdash;and it will grow&mdash; there will be more fully built-up vehicles brought in even though they are working to full capacity here.  In the event of recession, the first thing to be hit will be the import of fully built-up vehicles because a firm which continues importing them and cuts down on assembly will run the risk of having its right to import fully built-up vehicles withdrawn, in other words, their registration under this scheme.  Any firm which is foolish enough to take that chance will deserve to have that happen to it but I do not think any firm would be so foolish.  The assurances we have in writing from all parties concerned, manufacturers and assemblers, are, I believe, as strong as they can be having regard to all the possible variables in the circumstances.  What they amount to is that they undertake in return for the concessions which the Government are making to maintain their assembly operations on at least the level at which they operated in 1965.  I do not know what further assurances I can get or what more binding ones.  I believe the assurances we have got are as good as anybody could reasonably expect.  There are, of course, built-in sanctions in this scheme.</P>
    <P>But there is more to it than that.  I am also satisfied that the people involved in this industry, all the parties to the agreement, have operated on the basis of making this arrangement work and that this has been the objective of everybody concerned.  I do not believe that we shall find that people will want to cut down below the 1965 level.  If they want to do so, we have the built-in sanctions but I do not think that is going to arise because everybody concerned wants this scheme to work.  I believe it can work and that it will work and that the effect of this working will be that all workers in the <Col N="160" /> assembly industry whose jobs were in jeopardy are not now in jeopardy; that they can have a reasonable assurance of long-term security in this industry. I want to make it clear that there is no qualification on that other than the one I mentioned about the EEC and I regard that as being a relatively minor qualification.  Subject to that, workers in the assembly industry may now take it that their future is secure for the rest of their lives at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Committee on Wool Improvements, whose Report was presented to this House in July, 1966. The Terms of Reference of the Committee were:</P>
      <P>To consider and recommend desirable improvements in the quality, handling and marketing of Irish wool, including the question of grading.</P>
      <P>The Committee consisted of twelve members representing producers, traders, manufacturers, the Agricultural Institute and my Department.  It was, therefore, fully representative of the interests concerned.  I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the very thorough job which the Committee performed in examining all aspects of this complicated subject and in making recommendations of a very practical kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our sheep industry is geared basically to the production of high-quality meat, for which we have an assured export market at good prices, the production of wool is also of considerable importance.  About 16½ million lb. of shorn wool is produced here annually, of which 80 per cent is exported, and the value of exports of wool in 1967 was almost £3½ million.  In recent years, the world market for wool has been affected by competition from man-made fibres, the variety and quality of which have improved as a result of technical progress in this field.  Wool prices, <Col N="162" /> therefore, declined.  Nevertheless, there is a future for our wool, but only provided it is of good quality and is graded, presented and marketed efficiently. There is no doubt that, in the past, the manner in which our wool was presented and marketed left much to be desired and that this was reflected in the prices obtained for it.  The purpose of the Bill is to remedy these defects.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the Committee, as incorporated in the Bill, fall broadly under four main headings:</P>
    <P>(1)  wool to be bought from producers on a graded basis;</P>
    <P>(2)  buyers of wool to be registered with my Department;</P>
    <P>(3)  exporters of wool to be licensed by my Department;</P>
    <P>(4)  a council&mdash;called An Chomhairle Olla in the Bill&mdash;to be established, on which producers and traders will be represented and which will have functions relating to the grading of wool, the standards for registration, the standards to be observed by wool exporters, as well as the promotion of wool exports and the securing of the maximum use of home-produced wool by Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>To bring about an improvement in the presentation of Irish wool on both the home and export markets, the grading of wool is clearly vital.  As the Committee on Wool Improvements say:</P>
    <P>There is no escape from the conclusion that the proper method of purchasing wool right back to the producer is on a graded basis.  The Committee accepts this as a prerequisite for a rational system of wool marketing.  It is of course equally essential that pricing arrangements should be appropriately and effectively related to the grading system.  The grading system for purchases from producers should be as simple as possible so as to be understood without too much difficulty and to command producers' confidence.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, provides in section 11 for the making of regulations for <Col N="163" /> the purchase of wool on a graded basis, and, where such regulations apply, purchases in contravention of them will be an offence.  I endorse the Committee's view that the grading system should be simple and easily understood. It is intended that the regulations will provide for price premiums where wool is of good quality, and for deductions where it has defects, but the basic price of wool will not be fixed.  It will also be obligatory for buyers to give producers statements giving prescribed details of purchases.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the registration of wool buyers, which is dealt with in sections 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11.  These provisions are very important because, unless buyers have got suitable premises and competent staff (and these are the broad requirements for registration), any regulations that might be made for the purchase of wool on a graded basis could be stultified.  The advice of An Chomhairle Olla will be obtained on the standards for registration, and, in the light of this advice, regulations will be made dealing with premises and the associated plant and machinery.  Existing buyers of wool will be entitled to registration if their premises and associated plant and machinery comply with the provisions of the relevant regulations. Their continued registration will be subject to their compliance with the Act and any Regulations made there-under.</P>
    <P>The licensing of wool exporters under section 7 will not involve any detailed control on wool exports. Existing exporters will be entitled to receive licences initially, but the continuance of their licences and the issue of new licences will depend on the suitability of the licensee as an exporter.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill sets out what is to be done if it is proposed to cancel registration or revoke a licence. Briefly, a month's notice of intention must be given to the person concerned, who has the right to request an inquiry into the matter.  Where that happens, a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing will be appointed to carry out the inquiry.  Wherever the <Col N="164" /> final decision is to cancel or revoke, as the case may be, a statement of the reasons involved will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn, now, to the provisions dealing with An Chomhairle Olla, which are contained in sections 12 to 18 and in the Schedule.  This body will play a vital role in the successful implementation of a rational system of wool marketing.  An Chomhairle Olla will include representatives of producers and of the trade, and it will be relied on for advice about grading and standards of registration.  It will also fix a code of practice to be observed by exporters.  Furthermore, it will be empowered to undertake promotion measures, such as mounting publicity campaigns abroad to stimulate exports, and will consider ways of increasing the use of home-produced wool by Irish manufacturers.  It will, therefore, become the focal point of all wool improvement efforts.  In the course of time, it may become clear that other functions should appropriately be assigned to it.  For that reason, provision is made in section 14 of the Bill for the making of orders, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, assigning further functions to An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on Wool Improvements, An Chomhairle Olla will not, itself, engage in the purchase and sale of wool.  The reasons for this are set out in paragraphs 128 to 134 of the Committee's Report, which points out that, in our circumstances, a marketing board</P>
    <P>Would have to relate its purchase prices for wool to the realised price on world markets.  The only solution to this problem appeared to the Committee to be a two-part price system comprising a basic payment to producers at the time of purchase of their wool and an appropriate extra payment later related to the board's resale receipts.</P>
    <P>The financing of a wool marketing board would involve heavy capital to meet wool purchase and operational costs.  Also it has been represented <Col N="165" /> that the operational costs of a board could be expected to be high especially in view of the relatively small size of individual producers' clips in this country and the necessity to operate a two-part price system.</P>
    <P>The Committee while believing that ultimately the establishment of a wool board might become feasible and generally accepted, considers that at this stage it would be preferable to introduce such control measures as are necessary in the short term within the framework of the existing trade.</P>
    <P>The Committee also states that &ldquo;should the measures it has recommended prove inadequate in the course of time and experience, a more thorough organisation of marketing under a wool board should be adopted&rdquo;.  Two members of the Committee, however, signed the Report with the reservation that they would not favour the organisation of marketing under a wool board, while, on the other hand, one member thought that &ldquo;the only ultimate solution is a complete marketing board&rdquo;, and signed the Report &ldquo;as a stepping stone to such a board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept the general consensus of views expressed by the Committee.  I believe that the first essentials are grading, registration and export promotion under central authority, and that these objectives can be fully realised without the major, and possibly hazardous, step of taking over the job of buying and selling.  In other words, I believe in a combination of private and public enterprise in this particular sector of our agriculture, but my views are not fixed and rigid, and I am prepared to re-examine the position, if necessary, in the light of a few years' experience of the functioning of this Bill.  My expectation, however, is that the fundamental objective of securing the best possible return for our wool by raising the standard of presentation and marketing can be secured under this Bill which, as I have said, gives effect to the recommendations of persons who have a detailed <Col N="166" /> knowledge and long experience of all aspects of the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill underlines the stop-gap approach of the Government to the various problems of agriculture.  It underlines once again the non-existence of an overall, long-term, comprehensive policy for agriculture.  There is no advance planning, no anticipation and nothing is ever done until the crisis point has arrived.  In the case of wool marketing, the crisis has not only arrived but has been well passed.  It is well known to all of us that in the past couple of years the income of sheep farmers from wool has been halved.  This is due in no small measure to the fact that we have had no organised system of marketing.  It is well known that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture have been under pressure for a considerable time to take action in this important matter.</P>
      <P>As a result of this pressure, the Minister tells us this evening something that we know, that this Committee on Wool Improvements was set up as far back as January, 1963 and the Committee reported in July, 1966.  Apparently that Report, in spite of the conditions prevailing, has remained untouched in the Minister's Department ever since.  We now have a Bill which bears all the hallmarks of the type of legislation we have become accustomed to expect from the Minister. The sheep farmers are expected to pay the piper but certainly the Minister is ensuring that they will not call the tune.  In my view, it is very like the Livestock Marts Act.  The Minister is the Fuehrer, all power is imposed in him; he has the discretion either to grant or wihhold licences for exporters; it is he who will decide whether or not a woolbuyer is to be registered and at his discretion, he can exempt anyone he thinks fit from the entire provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not democratic government; this is government by ministerial degree because there is no provision in the Bill for an appeal to any independent authority. The Minister's decision is final in all cases.  He demonstrates his generosity by saying that represenations <Col N="167" /> may be made to him and he will consider those representations, but he does not bind himself in any way to change his mind or to be influenced by those representations.  Representations may be made.  That is as far as anybody can go.  It is the Minister who will finally decide at his own discretion and that decision cannot be questioned or subjected to scrutiny by any independent authority.  That is not democratic government.</P>
    <P>This is an undesirable provision and the sooner the people wake up the better it will be, because, as things are going, the time will come when farmers will wake up one morning to find themselves being told by the Minister for Agriculture that they may not have rashers and eggs for breakfast, even though they produce pigs and rear fowl.  This approach is quite wrong and, for the life of me, I cannot understand why the Minister persists in this attitude towards our primary producers.  Surely the better way would be to bring the producers with you, give them confidence and receive in return their co-operation?  There is nothing in this Bill to inspire that confidence and co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to set up a wool marketing council of 11 members; it is proposed to give the producers three members on this council.  The Minister will select those who will serve on the council.  He will handpick them.  He will even handpick the three.  It is difficult to see the sense in all this.  It is difficult to understand why the man who spends 12 months producing the fleece will have only the same say as to what is to happen to that fleece as the man who takes it from him and puts it on the market. This is a disgraceful way to treat the producers.  It will be resented by them. This Bill will be quite unacceptable to sheep farmers, unless there is considerable amendment of it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have examined the Bill and nowhere in it can I see any provision for the setting up of co-operatives to grade and market wool.  It is a confused piece of legislation, the most confused I have ever seen.  It is vague.  Everything is left <Col N="168" /> to the discretion of the Minister and everything the Minister decides will be right, despite an Chomhairle Olla.  This council will have no power to decide anything.  All they may do is give advice.  I should have thought that a representative of Córas Tráchtála would be invaluable on this council from the point of view of market research and ensuring guaranteed prices to the producer.</P>
    <P>Where wool marketing is concerned, the first essential is to ensure that the customer is satisfied.  The customer must be assured that he is getting a continuing and reliable supply of wool of standard type and in accordance with the proper description.  If wool is ordered by an American or a continental firm according to a certain specification and description and the exporter does not adhere to that specification and description, then he should lose his licence.  There is no reference to any such penalty in this Bill.  There is no provision for fines.  If a man in the circumstances I have mentioned does not lose his licence, he should at least be subjected to very heavy fines.  The great drawback in a good deal of legislation here is that there is no provision for fines and, when offences are committed, the responsible Minister and his Government are very slow to put a firm out of business.  The inclination is to let the firm get away with it.</P>
    <P>The farmers should be assisted by the Minister to do their job, whether it be producing, processing or marketing. It is wrong to exclude them to the extent to which they are being excluded here.  I do not know how the Minister ever hopes to get co-operation while he adopts this attitude.  If we are to get the best prices for our wool, there must be proper grading. That is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the findings and the recommendations in the report. The producers' representatives were not prepared to accept the report because of their minority representation. I cannot see that anywhere.  In fact, I can see the direct opposite.  I can see an insistence by the representatives of the producers that they would be in the majority, or have at least 50 per <Col N="169" /> cent representation.  The Minister proposes to give them three.</P>
    <P>In the Schedule, it is provided that most decisions will be by vote.  When it comes to fixing prices, or any other decision, the farmers will be at a definite disadvantage because those who simply take the wool from them and sell it will be in a stronger position numerically.  That is quite wrong. In paragraph 15, it is provided:</P>
    <P>Every question at a meeting of An Chomhairle shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question and, in the case of an equal division of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote.</P>
    <P>If we are to be successful in this, we shall have to change the whole situation. The producers must be entitled to the maximum price for their wool on a long-term basis.  There are certain difficulties in this.  Wool will be bought according to grade.  We shall have to go a bit further.  There will have to be an annual review of prices and the price will have to be decided early in the year in order to protect the consumer. The manufacturer will have to be protected.  The manufacturer makes his contract early in the year.  If the manufacturer contracts to buy wool at £x in the early part of the year and then finds in September or October that he must pay £x plus £y, his whole budget will be thrown out of gear. What will happen then will be that he will turn over to synthetic fibres and the market will be lost.</P>
    <P>The only way we can build up a reliable trade for Irish wool is if we are able to guarantee standards and if we are able to decide and fix prices early in the spring and say: &ldquo;This is the price for this year.&rdquo;  This is extremely important because traditionally the farmers of this country, in their efforts to decide what is the best time to sell wool, have done an immense amount of crystal gazing.  What will happen if this sort of price fixing and annual review does not take place is that one farmer will sell wool early in the year and another man, through this crystal gazing, will sell in October, say, and it is quite possible that if the price of <Col N="170" /> wool improves between June and October, the man selling in October could get as good or, perhaps, a better price for low grade and badly produced wool than the other man got early in the spring for best quality wool. This is what leads to confusion and thus people are able to say: &ldquo;I got as good a price though I did nothing at all.  I threw in the daggings.  I did not wash the sheep or do anything that was necessary.  I had a whole lot of branding fluid on them, but still I succeeded in getting a better price than the clever fellow up the road who went to all this trouble.&rdquo;  This is where you have discouragement for the producer of well graded and well produced wool.</P>
    <P>There is an immense amount to be done in the breeding of sheep for the type of wool that is in demand and there should be a good deal of encouragement in any legislation for the production of wool that is more in demand than the type of wool that is less in demand.  That is fairly well covered in this Bill through the price differentials it is proposed to operate but it is not clear how this will work if we are to operate on a free market throughout the year with certain differentials for grades.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are going far enough in this or that it is likely to succeed fully.  Certainly, it will represent an improvement to have all wool graded.  This Bill could be a good one but it is not as it stands.  Therefore, I hope that on the Committee Stage the Minister will be prepared to accept considerable amendment to various parts of the Bill to make it more acceptable to the producers and to make it more likely to be successful.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see one thing in the Bill, that all wool must be sold through particular channels, because one of the things that has bedevilled marketing systems for far too long is that as long as the price is satisfactory and going well farmers will sell through a particular channel but as soon as there is a fast buck to be made outside it they will forget about the organisation that has been set up and the reliable system that had been instituted, and they will go and make the fast buck.  There is provision in the Bill to alter that practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The introduction of a Bill of this kind provided a great opportunity to bring about immense improvements and substantial increases in incomes, particularly of mountain farmers who are so dependent on wool, where they are very often not in a position to flesh the lambs or the sheep as are the lowland producers.  It is extremely important to do everything possible here to make this a success.  All organised farming groups who are interested in this type of thing should be represented on this proposed wool council and this council should be given power and responsibility.  Only in that way shall we ever gain the confidence of our farmers, our producers.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the course of the Committee Stage the Minister will be prepared to accept considerable amendment.  It is wrong that he should exclude the co-operative societies as they appear to be excluded&mdash;they are not mentioned in the Bill.  I suppose it could also be said that they are not necessarily excluded and that they could be registered as buyers and could at a later stage be encouraged and brought into the Bill but they are certainly not in the Bill as it stands. There does not seem to be any encouragement for co-operatives in this whole business of selling or marketing wool.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report of the Committee on Wool Improvements, as far as I can read it, came down completely on the side of a wool marketing board&mdash;a board that would buy up all the wool and have a guaranteed price, that price to be fixed early in the year as happens at present in England.  This wool marketing arrangement in England seems to be working very satisfactorily and obviously the only fault that has been found with it is the cost of setting up the organisation. At some stage in that report I remember seeing a figure of £5 million as the likely cost of setting up such a board.  Personally, I do not like the idea of excluding private enterprise totally nor do I like to see arrangements being made to put people out of <Col N="172" /> business who have been in business during the years, particularly if they have given service but I know that many of the people buying wool here were exploiting the producers in no uncertain way.  I am aware that in certain parts of the country wool has been purchased from farmers in the present year with dud cheques.  I came across this only last week in Limerick.</P>
    <P>If the Minister goes down round the Galtees they will have serious things to say to him about the present situation in relation to wool marketing. Some of them have got dud cheques for their wool and others have the wool still in the barns.  There is nothing in this Bill to provide grants or encouragement for the building of sheds in which to store wool or for shearing sheds.  Neither is there anything in the Bill to provide advice to producers as to how to produce the best possible wool and how to get it on the market in the best possible condition.  Perhaps, that sort of operation could be included in the functions of An Chomhairle Olla but there is no specific mention of it.</P>
    <P>Grants are needed badly for the provision of adequate shearing sheds, particularly in the mountain areas, so that sheep can be shorn dry, an important precaution in relation to the quality of the wool eventually.  Suitable storage spaces for the storage of wool should also be provided.  It has been suggested to me that if there were an all-out effort made to operate this on a co-operative basis, there are many buildings in the country which are becoming obsolete, like small closed-down national schools, which could be secured and used for this type of wool storage.  There is an opportunity here which may be lost if we do not interest ourselves sufficiently, leaving it entirely to the free play of private enterprise.  It is quite possible that the Minister may find when he starts out on his campaign to register wool buyers that he will have to eliminate many of the gombeen buyers who are there at the moment and that this may leave a vacuum in certain parts of the country.  This is a vacuum that could and should be filled by co-operative <Col N="173" /> buying, grading and marketing and it is something that should be organised and encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Bill is disappointing because it is vague and gives very little information as to what the future holds in relation to the whole development of the industry.  I hope that before we finish with this Bill, we will get something more specific about it and I hope we will get the Minister to shed a lot of the power he proposes in this Bill to hold and that we will get it opened up to the various people who are interested in the production side.  There are a number of associations such as the Combined Mountain Sheep Farmers Association that are obviously very interested in this type of legislation and have been pressing for a considerable time for improvements in wool marketing.  They must be brought in and must be brought in in a fair percentage of the entire number on this Comhairle Olla and that Comhairle Olla must be given power and must be given the necessary assistance to do its job.  I hope that the Minister will see the good sense of this and if he does not bring in amendments, that he will accept the amendments we hope to bring in.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to me to be in this Bill any provision for market research and promotion.  This is where Córas Tráchtála should be brought in because in this way you could have guaranteed markets at competitive world prices and they are the best people, I think, to assess the situation and the possibilities.</P>
    <P>There is not much more at this stage that I want to say on this Bill. I intend to table a number of amendments which I hope the Minister will accept.  The Bill itself is vague and non-constructive and producers are clearly not getting a fair crack of the whip.  The Bill is undemocratic and totalitarian, but if the Minister is agreeable to change his attitude to the producers, and if he is agreeable to accept the amendments we will bring in later on it could be a very different measure and a very worthwhile measure. It could lead to a considerable increase in the income of farmers who <Col N="174" /> have lost heavily due to falling wool prices and, as the Minister said, due to the competition of synthetic fibres in recent years.  I feel that we could build up this trade again and could make wool attractive to use, provided it is produced and exported according to exact descriptions and provided we are able to give a constant supply and an early indication of what the price will be over a period ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, it is proposed by the Minister to set up a wool marketing board, An Chomhairle Olla.  I speak on behalf of the people of Galway, who, I am sure, will have a very great interest in this board. I welcome the setting up of the board because it is time some effort was made to do something effective in relation to the marketing of wool for those people who earn a living by it.  Approximately ten years ago one would get 5/- or 6/- a pound for washed wool. Today you will not get the same price. The fact that the people I represent are good producers of wool meant a lot to their incomes.  I am not blaming the Department of Agriculture or the Minister for Agriculture in any way, but due to circumstances beyond their control, the price of wool in recent years has fallen to 3/- a lb, 2/6 a lb in some cases and even lower, and at times people have failed to get sale for it.  I hope the setting up of this board will result in an increase in the price of wool for those people who produce it.</P>
      <P>The setting up of this board reminds me of another board recently set up by the Minister for Agriculture, that is, the National Agricultural Council.  When the Minister set up that Council, he appointed himself boss of it and it was he who appointed each and every member.  It is stated in this Bill that this board shall consist of ten members and a chairman.  I am sure the Minister pictures himself in the chair, and I wonder who are the ten members he will pick.  He has stated that three places on the board will belong to producers, handpicked of course by himself, and the remainder I am sure will be ex-Fianna Fáil TDs, ex-Fianna Fáil Senators, ex-Fianna Fáil county councillors and other men of that description.</P>

The farmers' organisations, who are the main people we hope will benefit from the setting up of this Comhairle Olla, should be given representation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken to himself the sole right to grant a prospective exporter or a prospective wool buyer a licence.  Surely that is shades of the Planning Bill again and of the dictatorial attitude of this Government to ensure that any independent body representing any independent group such as the farmers have to bend to the whim of a Minister?

      <P>When I am finished, if Deputy Cunningham wants to speak, he can do so.  When I am trying to say a few words, I would appreciate it if he would cease interrupting. I know you people over there are pastmasters in that art.  Would the Minister take into consideration their <Col N="176" /> political affiliations?  I am quite sure, and it would only be human nature, all things being equal and some things being more equal than others, that he would do so.</P>
      <P>These are some of the things which strike me as I read through this Bill and the brief statement made by the Minister.  I do not think that in the setting up of a Wool Marketing Board any individual should have the same power over it as the Minister now proposes to take unto himself. In all fairness, the producers, who are told at this stage that they will have three places should at least, as producers, have not less than half the places, and they should try to work out some policy for themselves that would be beneficial to each and every one of them and would in turn be beneficial to the economy of our country</P>
      <P>From time to time there is fluctuation in the price of wool.  I would suggest fixed prices for wool when this Wool Marketing Board is set up. Prices should be fixed for one year. I would suggest that a price of 5/-per lb. should be fixed for greasy wool and that the washed wool get 5/6 or 5/7, as it is entitled to that few pence extra.  I would urge the Minister not to take the power unto himself which he proposes to take in this matter.  If he does, he will find out, as he did, in relation to the National Agricultural Council which he set up, that it will backfire on him and he will exclude from it, due to their political affiliations, certain sections of our farming community who do not altogether share his views.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to say on this except again to urge on the Minister to ensure that all branches of agriculture are represented, and that this dictatorial attitude, which is so prevalent in the Fianna Fáil Party, is forgotten about as far as this Comhairle Olla is concerned and to see to it that it is something which will be beneficial to the farmers and the people rearing sheep in this country, and also the economy, particularly of County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we <Col N="177" /> have just heard is quite typical of Fine Gael and the line running through all their speeches on subjects such as this, the Marts Bill and other measures which the Minister and previous Ministers for Agriculture have introduced. The suggestion is that the Minister should divest himself of all responsibility for agriculture.  Let any other organisation, it does not matter who they are, run agriculture in this country. The Minister is the last person, according to them, who should have any say in what should be done, how licences are to be issued and who should issue licences.  Is there anybody outside the Minister and his Department who should be responsible for issuing licences of one kind or another?</P>
      <P>It does not matter whether they are mart licences or the licences proposed here.  It is suggested that if they are issued through the Minister, as is the usual practice, there is something tainted about them.  Most of the mart licences, for instance, have been issued since we heard in this House of all the ills that would flow from the issuing by the Minister of mart licences. People could not sell their cattle on their own land; they could not have auctions; they could not have this or that; there was to be a strangling of all sales of cattle in any way except through licences issued by the Minister. Since then, since the furore here at that time, we have not had one complaint about the method of issuing licences, nor did we have one complaint that farm auctions or auctions of cattle were stopped in any way. We did not have one complaint since then.</P>
      <P>Now we are on the hobbyhorse once again just because in this Bill it is proposed that licences should be issued by the Minister.  Of course, the tune across the way is in the same key as before.  The Minister should not have power to issue licences.  If he has power to issue licences, he should not issue licences to Fianna Fáil supporters.  He should give them to everybody else but not to Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>

      <P>It is amusing to listen to the same pattern developing on this as that which developed on the occasion I have mentioned.  The Minister is wise in doing the job this House put him there to do, that is, to run his Department in the best possible way. You can see that in the Budget today and you can see it in some other things he has done.  The Minister cannot run his Department by divesting himself of all the powers that have been suggested in the past and I am sure will be suggested again by the people opposite.  It would be foolish for him to run away like that from his responsibilities.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the economy of the country with regard to small farmers, particularly in the West and in the hilly districts in parts of the constituency I represent, is very largely dependant <Col N="179" /> on sheep farming and as such, we should ensure that those people will have stable selling conditions.  This Bill is entitled a Wool Marketing Bill. I think I could describe it best, as Shakespeare would, of being much ado about nothing because in looking through the Bill, the only thing I can see emanating from it is that it is desirable and a good thing that it should be so, so as to produce a better standard of wool, and cleaner wool, but there it begins and there it ends.</P>
      <P>The small or hill farmers' difficulty is the disposal of their wool which is a necessary adjunct to their economy. It is the same every year.  There has been no stable price relative to wool in any year that I can recollect.  When they take their wool to sell it they have not the least idea what they will get. They have to take what they are offered from the local buyer.  The committee which it is proposed to set up under this Bill is supposed to assist in the marketing of wool.  I cannot see anything in the Minister's speech that will ensure price stability for the wool producer.  I am only concerned with the producer.  I am not interested in the wool dealer.  He is able to look after himself and he usually has a very substantial organisation at his back.</P>
      <P>The people with whom we are concerned are those who produce the wool and I want to ensure that they get a decent price for their product on the market.  There is nothing in the Bill to stabilise the price of wool.  It is a well known fact that the marketing of wool, not nationally but internationally, as a whole, has been one of the biggest rackets that has existed over the years. If it were not so there would be a stable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to establish a wool marketing board let him stabilise and fix the price of wool.  He is giving himself the power to do what he wishes to do. He is giving himself absolute control over the production and sale of wool and in producing a Bill like this, beyond the fact that it will help people to grade and put better wool on the market which would put them in a better position than heretofore to export <Col N="180" /> wool, the Minister gets nowhere at all.</P>
    <P>For that reason, when the Minister replies, he should give us some information. If you have a Wool Marketing Bill there should be some indication in it as to the benefit it will confer on those who have wool to sell. In case the Minister thinks I am striking hard ground with regard to wool, I hasten to assure him that I have no wool to sell.  I do not go in for sheep but my neighbours do and up on the hilly country they depend entirely on it.</P>
    <P>There is the question of setting up this board.  &ldquo;An Chomhairle Olla&rdquo; is the correct term for it.  The idea has to be conveyed to the public and to Dáil Éireann which is expected to pass this Bill that this board is set up to give fair play to the proposal.  One of the problems with which the farming community has to contend with&mdash;it is all over the world and enters into every agricultural discussion whether it be in Africa or in Europe&mdash;is that the middleman has been able to exploit the farming community.  The man who does the work, who produces the sheep, or whatever it may be, is entitled to full profit but he is always faced with the problem that the middleman can step in and take the greater part of the profit.</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity for the Minister in introducing a Bill such as this to protect the farmers against the middlemen and I should like him if he has been listening to anything anybody has said here&mdash;I do not think he has; he seems to be in constant communication with his Galway colleague behind him; he was doing the same while Deputy Clinton was making a forceful and constructive speech; he was not listening to him&mdash;when he gets up to reply to give some information other than which he gave in his opening speech.  Let him explain what this Bill means, whether it will confer any benefits on the people whom he is supposed to protect and defend, and they are the farmers of Ireland, against the middleman and the people who have been exploiting them over the years.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that this <Col N="181" /> exploitation in regard to wool marketing is perhaps greater than that in any other sector of our economy.  I ask the Minister, when replying, to give some indication as to whether this Wool Marketing Board will have power to buy wool or to ensure that there is a fixed stabilised price for it. If he does that, his Bill will be acceptable to us and he will be conferring on the agricultural community some benefit and that is why he represents the Government in this Dáil as Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee set up reported to the Minister in July, 1966, I think, and after a period of two years this Bill has ultimately come before the House.  I think that any Bill that makes an effort to improve either the marketing system for our wool or gets a better price for our producers is desirable.  We all know that the price of wool has dropped by more than one-half over the past few years. If it continues at its present price it is very doubtful that producers will take an interest in producing wool that will be fit for marketing.</P>
      <P>The motive behind the Bill, which I am quite satisfied is the motive in the Minister's mind, is to ensure that the producer gets a better price and that we have a better marketing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham says that the Minister should not be asked to relieve himself of the responsibility of dealing with the situation but under this Bill the Minister is actually doing that.  I do not know whether it is the right or the wrong thing.  It is a matter of personal judgment whether it is better to deal with it without a committee or set up a committee but the grumble from this side of the House concerns the type of personnel on this committee. I can recall a committee set up by his predecessor, the present Minister for Finance, to advise him in the west of Ireland.  He appointed two members from each county and I think most of them were members of the agricultural community.  The two appointed from the county I know best were from a Fianna Fáil cumann.  One did not own a sod of land and would <Col N="182" /> not know a heifer from a bullock.  If this is the type of committee the Minister intends to set up, he will not get the results he expects to get.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is setting up a committee he should appoint people who have some experience of wool production and not appoint people solely because they are members of the same political party to which he belongs.  I honestly believe that this board should consist for the most part of producers. If the wool trade is entitled to three representatives, the producers are entitled to at least five representatives.  The Minister would be well advised to move an amendment on Committee Stage providing for an increase in the representation of producers to five.  If he does that, he will get the results he probably desires.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with Deputy Clinton that there should a fixed price. I would suggest that there should be a pool.  The price could be fixed in the month of January or February for the following year.  In that way people who had wool either early or late in the season would know approximately the price they would get for it.  People who clip early and sell the wool early could find while supply was controlling price, that the price could fluctuate in the later part of the season.  In this context one should consider the turkey trade where very often the price in early December is much higher than in mid-December, or <i>vice versa.</i> It might involve a rather heavy task but I suggest that there should be a guaranteed price of so much per pound and there could be a pool so that everyone would get the same price.  If that suggestion were adopted I have no doubt that the Minister would get the results he desires.</P>

      <P>It is time a wool Bill was introduced.  Up to now there has been a rather loose situation in the wool business.  I do not know if this Bill will accomplish all that we would like but we concede that, at least, it is a step.  If the Minister is big enough to accept certain amendments that will be put down, he may find that the Bill will benefit the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Stabilisation of price is the main problem of the wool business in the West.  Farmers find themselves in a dilemma.  They do not know whether to burn the wool or what to do with it when it comes to the time to sell. This has been the position over the years.  There is great need for a cleaning up, not only of wool, but in the marketing of wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have certain reservations in regard to this Bill.  We know the composition, for instance, of the National Agricultural Council and what it has caused throughout the country.  It is not representative of farmers; it is representative of a political Party.  A lot of the blame can be attributed to the Minister for that.  Are we to have a similar situation in regard to the setting up of the board proposed in this Bill? The Minister should be big enough <Col N="184" /> to forget political hacks and should appoint people who produce wool and who can express the views of producers and not Party views.  I hope the Minister will be big enough to accept amendments that will be put down from this side of the House.  Let us not have the wool being pulled over the people's eyes.  Do not think that we are all lambs.  The people will not be fooled by the set-up that we have. I hope my colleague will come in at this late hour even though he has to be sent for to come in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill in view of the fact that I come from an area which is largely a sheep-producing area.  I have no doubt that the Minister intends this Bill to be of benefit to the producer and hopes it will help in the production of a better type of wool.  Our experience is that boards have been set up comprised of people who knew very little of the problems they were intended to solve.  Not very long ago persons were selected by the Department of Agriculture to administer the lamb subsidy scheme.  It is well known that these people went into markets and tried to dictate to persons who had been dealing in sheep all their lives.  They did not know what they were talking about.  The danger is that the Minister might appoint such persons again.</P>
      <P>I represent farmers from the West, many of whom live solely on the profits of their sheep.  The areas are mountainous and suitable for sheep rearing.  I am glad the Minister is taking a keen interest in wool prices. The price of wool is of vital importance to the sheep farmer.  If the price is good, he can be satisfied with a reasonable price for his lambs.  If the price is good, the man on the mountain farm will get £1 per head for his small fleece and the larger fleece will fetch £1 10s.  If any farmer can calculate on £1 per head for his flock, he goes out to two or three fairs and has a return for his lambs.  Last year was very disappointing.  The price flopped all of a sudden and many farmers were left with their barns full of wool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The price flopped last year.  I should like to say a word about the people who have been registered wool buyers.  I know some of them in my area and they have been reared to this business.  For the last 12 or 18 months they have been worried about what their future as wool buyers will be.  It is all very well talking about having premises, plant and staff.  Those honest-to-God wool buyers had to provide premises as best they could.  They ran this as a sideline for portion of the year apart from their grocery or some other business. Their customers knew well that they will get the top price.  There was no bargaining.  These fellows bought only good wool.  They gave top prices, and that settled that.  If we lose some of these people we will be doing a grave disservice to the wool industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister should appoint some agricultural instructors throughout the various counties who have special training to give lectures to farmers in the sheep-rearing areas.  Only recently I was at a meeting where it was suggested that an instructor should be specially trained for that area to lecture the people on how best to handle their flocks of sheep.  If that type of lecture were given frequently during winter it would be of great help to farmers in assisting them to produce their wool in better condition in May or June.  Those buyers should be left as they are, except buyers who have not given satisfaction or who, as Deputy Clinton mentioned, have issued cheques that are not genuine.  In these days it is not easy for a man to provide premises and plant as mentioned here.  The Minister should seriously consider those who have given long and faithful service.  I know some of them and I certainly would not like to see them deprived of their agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that wool has become big business in many parts of the country, it would be only right to ask the Minister to give more representation on this board to the producers.  It is only natural that they should seek stronger <Col N="186" /> representation to make their case when it comes to deciding what should be done.  We have reference here to a vote being taken and the Minister acting as chairman.  It is only right that the producers should have stronger representation.  I hope that this scheme works out well, but, again, I should like to say that the agents who have given good service should be very seriously considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Wool production is practiced on only a small scale in my constituency but in the Galtee Mountain area the production of wool forms an important part of the economy of the small farmers there.  The establishment of An Chomhairle Olla is a step in the right direction.  I sincerely hope that the council, when established, will be successful in implementing the recommendations of the Committee on Wool Improvement to examine the whole question of wool production and wool marketing and reported to this House in July, 1966.</P>
      <P>While, as the Minister says, the sheep industry is geared basically for the production of high quality meat, the production of wool is also of considerable importance.  As my colleagues from the west have pointed out, the price of wool&mdash;which, unfortunately, fluctuates from year to year being dependent on factors outside our control &mdash;in any particular year can mean a very big difference to the income of the small farmer of the western seaboard and other intensive sheep-producing areas.  One of the functions of An Chomhairle Olla will be to compile a register of wool buyers.  This is a very desirable step and one long overdue. I had an experience in my constituency some years ago where a certain fly-by-night gentleman purchased the entire wool crop of a considerable number of small farmers at the foot of the Galtees and they were never paid for it.  I do not want this experience to be taken as a reflection on all wool buyers.  I am well aware, as my western colleagues have pointed out, that those who engage in the buying of wool are men of experience and integrity.  But I feel the compilation of this register is a necessary step towards nationalising the entire marketing of wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> It is also true to say that the wool business has been facing increased competition from man-made fibres. With the considerable amount of technical research going on in the development and marketing of new and better types of fibres the competition for man-made fibres will increase.  However, I agree with the Minister that there is a good potential for wool.  I am pleased to note that one of the functions of the Comhairle will be to try to promote the utilisation of Irish wool by Irish manufacturers.  In this context, I am pleased to note the considerable progress which the Irish clothing industry has been making on the export market in recent years and in the export market for woollen garments. There is intense competition for man-made fibres but nevertheless there are grounds for hoping that there will be a reasonably good continuing market for Irish wool.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin made a point which I hope the Minister and the Department have not missed.  He said that it is vitally essential, in order to ensure that the standard and quality of the wool are improved, that there should be an adequate and specialised advisory service available to farmers. We have seen recently the reasonably successful quality milk bonus scheme. I would express the hope that An Chomhairle Olla will be able to learn from the experience gained by An Bord Bainne in the encouragement of the production of high quality milk and that An Chomhairle Olla will be able to devise some scheme of incentives. I have said time and time again that I am a firm believer that our farmers have the capacity and the ability to produce the highest quality farm produce, whether it be high quality milk, meat or wool, but they must be given the necessary assistance by way of technical advice and information and they must also be given the necessary incentive.  In other words, it must be made worth their while.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is accepting the general recommendation of the Committee which examined the question of improving our wool.  It is not <Col N="188" /> envisaged that An Chomhairle Olla should engage in the actual buying of wool but I think that in the not too distant future it may be necessary for An Chomhairle to be reconstituted. One member of the Committee said the only ultimate solution is a complete marketing board and An Chomhairle Olla is a step towards this.  I sincerely hope that the newly-constituted Wool Marketing Council will achieve the objectives which the Minister hopes it will achieve.</P>
    <P>In general, this Bill can be welcomed as a step in the right direction, a step which must result in the production of better quality wool and consequently a better return for our farmers.</P>

      <P>Of course, the tone was set by Deputy Clinton who apparently knows nothing about what is in the Bill, never mind knowing anything about what should be in it.  He does not appear to have read the report, and as a result, he has attributed things to me which in fact are a direct result of the report. One criticism which was made and made generally from the Opposition benches was a criticism of the Committee which reported.  Members of the Opposition should take into consideration that the people who sat on this Committee gave their time and their thought and their experience for the benefit of the Government and the people as a whole and at least they should get some appreciation, rather than all-round criticism.</P>

Deputy Clinton says we have no policy.  When he was exposing himself to the viewers of this country on television, he was asked had he got a policy, and I have not heard him since making any effort to produce one.  It is easy to talk about a lack of policy.  That is a nice easy thing for an Opposition to do, but the people get tired of it, and the people have shown they are tired of it on more than one occasion.  They expect a little more, and the Fine Gael Party should try to give them a little more. They should stop this destructive criticism, this carping and cribbing criticism, this talk of lack of policy, while, at the same time, they have not one notion what their policy would be in these circumstances or any other.</P>

Apart from that altogether, we have been charged here that the three representatives who will be from the producers are not enough, that the number is totally inadequate, that there should be six or seven.  The Bill says that not less than three should be people representative of the producers&mdash;not less than three should be representative of the people in the trade.

They criticise Fianna Fáil for what is in the Bill without adverting to the fact that it is, generally, the result of a recommendation of a body representative of the Department, of An Foras Talúntais, of the breeders, of the producers, of the exporters, of the buyers, and so on &mdash;of the lot.  They gave us a report from which we produced this Bill.  The criticism is that we did not produce it sooner and, now that we have produced it, Fine Gael allege it is not the right sort of Bill and we are being blamed, in fact, for what is not in the Bill.  We have this suggestion by Fine Gael that only three people may be appointed to represent the producers when, in fact, such is not the case.</P>

      <P>As far as it goes, the Deputy may take it as the Bill says it and not as Deputy Clinton, or some of his colleagues, says.  As the Bill says it, it will be done.  We had Deputy <Col N="195" /> Donnellan from the west, a right sort of sheep country possibly both east and west of it.  He talked about getting a price and said he wanted a guaranteed fixed price.  He mentioned 5/-for greasy wool and 5/6d for washed wool.  He was a little less difficult than Deputy L'Estrange.  Possibly he does know a little about the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague was more modest in his demands but the fact remains that it will not be possible to guarantee a price.  Eighty per cent of our wool goes on the export market.  In addition, we ourselves are open to import wool from various parts of the world.  Therefore, the price that is being, has been and will be paid on the home market to our producers is largely the world price, and how any of the Opposition Deputies could bring about a position wherein before the wool is sold, there should be a price fixed for it, I do not know, unless of course they are asking that the Government impose more taxes&mdash; which they would vote against&mdash;in order to set up a pool of a few million pounds so that there could be a guaranteed price to the producers before their clips would be sold.  Unless this is what they mean, there is not much sense in what has been suggested. Before Committee stage is reached, I suggest that they should think about it and possibly have some discussion about it.  This would help to keep them from contradicting themselves about the price they should get, should there be a fixed price.</P>
      <P>The next matter they raised is that the Minister, as in other instances, wishes to dictate to the farming community. Here again we see that the sole purpose of the Front Bench Fine Gael Deputies is to try, by every means at their disposal, to create as much cleavage, difficulty and disunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde described the Bill as very disappointing and said it had more to do with presentation, cleaning and grading of wool than it had to do with the marketing of wool.  The purpose of this Bill is not and should not be disappointing to the Deputy because it is a fact that unless we are prepared to grade and present cleaner wool than in the past, the marketing difficulties we have already will be encountered in the future in greater degree because the competition is there from man-made fibre.  Whatever chance we had of selling wool in the rag-tag manner in which we did it in the past, we would get worse prices than ever for it in the future.  It is for this reason that I say that Deputy Esmonde is misleading himself when he says that he is disappointed in this Bill because of its emphasis on clean wool and presentation and grading of wool and because there is not enough reference to marketing.  The whole basis of the marketing of wool must, according to this report and according to my own convictions, rely on grading, better presentation and cleaner wool.  If we are not prepared for that, there is not much place for us in the world wool market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also made a plea &mdash;for which I am sure he had good reason but he had no facts to support it&mdash;that we should use this Bill to protect the producer from the middleman. He did not back up that statement and what he has in mind I do not know.  I do not know who he thinks is the middleman battening on the producers, but if that is what he wants, this Bill can contribute by means of the control of registration and the licensing of wool buyers and exporters.  The measure certainly gets down to controlling any malpractices that may have arisen by way of <Col N="198" /> middlemen or otherwise in the sale and marketing of wool.  I ask the Deputy to reread the Bill and not to be disappointed about its contents because it can, and it is intended to cope with any malpractices that may exist at present in the handling and marketing of wool.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds, and possibly Deputy McLaughlin to some extent, were the only Opposition Deputies who made any effort to be reasonable in their approach to this measure.  Perhaps it is because Deputy Reynolds comes from Leitrim that he realises the useful purpose this Bill can serve, and despite the embarrassing situation in which he might have found himself in following his leader in this debate, he could not find it in himself to deal with the Bill as his colleagues did, because he knows from his experience of the wool trade in his own country that this Bill will do a good job.  Certainly Fine Gael are not helping the measure to do any job by their criticisms and by implanting doubts about it, by attributing all sorts of motives to the Minister in regard to the actual appointing of the Comhairle itself and in the granting of licences to those who will operate as buyers and exporters in future.  This is the stock-in-trade of Fine Gael.  They try to destroy all the time and never give anything a chance. To them, it is always too late and too little, and in this case they say it is not quite up to their standards.  We do not know what these standards are because they say nothing about what measures they would substitute, except Deputy Coogan's proposal that I should agree blindly to accept whatever the Fine Gael Party may produce as amendments to this Bill when they get down to reading the Bill and understanding what is in it.</P>

      <P>Deputy McLaughlin had a few things to say which would appear to indicate that he had some reasonable thoughts in his mind and knew something about the wool business; again this is quite likely from the constituency he represents.  However, he did go a little bit over the edge, which, I suppose, is expected of him by his Front Bench colleagues, that having been reasonable part of the way, he should be unreasonable before he finished; otherwise, he would be rapped on the knuckles after going out for not having a go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that Deputy McLaughlin criticised the Department's officers, and this is something I will not let him away with.  He criticised them for their handling of the lamb subsidy scheme and of going into the markets of this country and knowing nothing of what they were doing.  First, let me, to begin with, say that this is untrue.  They know a great deal about what they are doing; otherwise they would not be <Col N="200" /> there.  Secondly, let me say for the information of Deputies and for the information of the sheep producers in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim of whom there are many, that the subsidy scheme was changed a year ago to such a degree that our officers do not go into the market now.  They have nothing to do with the subsidy scheme now operating, and there is no such thing happening in the past 12 months at all, as was suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the subsidy was paid this year to our farmers for their mountain sheep and the Cheviot breeds down in Wicklow and the mountains around the country.  They were paid 10/- a head and no questions asked, and no condition that they had to be sold.  That worked so well that we have increased it by 100 per cent, from 10/- to £1.</P>

      <P>There should have been a few throats cut other than calves' throats and it would have saved us a lot of bother since.  By talking about 2/6 for calves and £1 for lambs Deputy L'Estrange in his own destructive way is trying to tear the heart out of anybody who has any of these things to produce or to sell.  He is trying to take away any confidence they may have got from the good prices and the firm market they have experienced over the past nine months.  However, the people are getting to know Fine Gael and they are learning at last that their prophecies and their promises do not mean anything.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together. The following statement gives for each county for 1st April, 1968, (a) the basic weekly time rates of wages paid to forestry workers and the hourly equivalent based on 43 working hours per week; (b) the minimum weekly rates payable to adult male agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1968 and the hourly equivalent based on 50 working hours per week; and (c) the weekly rates of wages paid by County Councils to road labourers, the weekly working hours and the hourly equivalent derived therefrom.  In the case of forestry workers an incentive bonus is payable in addition to the basic weekly time rate.  Road labourers are employed at a fixed weekly rate while weekly working hours follow a seasonal pattern which varies somewhat from county to county.  Hence derived hourly rates for a particular week show a greater variation than corresponding rates based on annual averages.</P>
