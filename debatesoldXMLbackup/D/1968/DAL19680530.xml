      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 7, 8, 3 and 9.  If not already reached, it is proposed to interrupt business at 12.30 p.m. to take Nos. 3 and 9.  Questions will be taken at 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I should like to inquire from the Taoiseach whether it is proposed to proceed with the Amendment of the Constitution Bills to their conclusion in this session and if it is intended to have the referendum this summer.  The Taoiseach will appreciate that irrespective of the views Deputies on my side of the House may take on it, it is not in the national interest to have a matter of this sort dragged out during a protracted period at intermittent intervals during the course of the Dáil session. For that reason, the House and the country are entitled to know the timetable envisaged.  In so far as the Opposition are concerned, we are prepared to facilitate the arrangement of business to have this matter brought to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, as to whether it is intended to finish all Stages of the Bills this session, it is.  Deputy Cosgrave's question may have been prompted by newspaper comment today.  I should like to emphasise that items put on the Order Paper are there because they are urgent.  The Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill and the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill must be taken promptly.  In the case of the Industrial Grants Bill, the money is <Col N="334" /> needed and in the case of the Higher Education Bill, it is necessary to allow county councils to formulate programmes as to scholarships, et cetera. If there is any feeling about putting the Constitution Amendment Bills at the end of today's business, I do not mind, but I wish to indicate to the House that it is our intention to have these Bills on the Order Paper for next Wednesday during the whole day, with a tea break, and the following day as well.</P>
      <P>As far as the holding of the referendum is concerned, that of course will depend on the passage of the remaining Stages of the two Bills and their passage in the Seanad.  The House will also remember that the Constitution requires that if and when the Bills are passed, 30 days must elapse after the order signed by the Minister for Local Government bringing the Bills into operation.  That could hold the Bills up until the end of July or early August which might not be an appropriate time for the holding of an important referendum.  Though I cannot say with certainty when the referendum is likely to take place, if the timetable brings us into August, it would seem desirable that we should have the referendum not then but later, perhaps in early autumn.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1: In subsection (1), page 3, line 5, &ldquo;in whole or in part&rdquo; inserted before &ldquo;and&rdquo; where it secondly occurs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the word &ldquo;produced&rdquo; may mean merely one process or stage in the manufacture of goods as well as the whole process of production.  It is linked with amendment No. 13 in section 21 (2) which enables the country of origin to be defined in orders imposing duties on the basis of any value added or any process carried out in that country in the manufacture of the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, the following subsection added to the section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) References in this Act to the country from which goods are exported are, in the case of goods exported to the State, references to the country from which they were consigned to the State and goods which in course of consignment from any country to the State pass through or are transhipped in any third country shall not on that account be regarded for the purposes of this Act as having been exported from that third country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove an ambiguity about the meaning of the reference to the country from which the goods are exported, in section 23 (1).  Goods might pass through a country other than the country of consignment by transhipment from that country.  The country of consignment, however, is the country of export and not the country of transhipment.</P>

      <P>Section 2: in subsection (1), line 19, &ldquo;excluding&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;subject to a deduction for&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>This is largely a question of drafting and making the thing clearer.  The substitution of the phrase &ldquo;subject to a deduction for&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;excluding&rdquo; is thought to make the meaning clearer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Section 7: in subsection (1), lines 14 to 24 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;dumped, and</P>
      <P>(ii) the Commission considers it probable that the goods to which the request relates have been or are being dumped and that the dumping was or is injurious dumping,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(b)  the Minister considers it probable that any goods have been or are being dumped, that the dumping was or is injurious dumping and that there are exceptional circumstances which warrant a request by him to the Commission to investigate whether those goods have been or are being dumped, and the Minister so requests,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with two separate points.  First, it meets a point raised in the Seanad by substituting the words &ldquo;considers it probable&rdquo; for &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.  The objection to the wording &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; was that it appeared from this that the Commission had already prejudged the case against the importer.  While neither the Minister nor the Commission will prejudge a case, they must, under the GATT code, consider it likely that an investigation <Col N="337" /> would show that there is injurious dumping.  This amendment makes it clear that the Minister or Commission has not prejudged the case but is acting on the probability that there was injurious dumping.  It was argued that the original wording in fact covered this but I think this makes the position clearer and removes any doubt as to the procedure that is involved here.</P>
    <P>The second effect of the amendment will be that the Commission must carry out an investigation at the request of the Minister once he considers it probable that injurious dumping is involved. Under the original wording, if the Minister came to the conclusion that there appeared to be injurious dumping, he would refer the matter to the Commission who would then again go through the same procedure and might conceivably come to a different conclusion.  This seemed to be an undesirable situation and this amendment is designed to change it in the way I have indicated.  In fact, another effect of the amendment should be to speed up the procedure in cases initiated by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Section 9: in line 50, &ldquo;and publishes in accordance with the procedure in section 8 the fact that such an authorisation has been given&rdquo; added at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was moved in the Seanad and I decided to accept it for what seemed to me to be fairly good reasons of public policy.  It relates to a member of the Commission who has an interest in a particular matter that is being investigated informing <Col N="338" /> the Minister of that interest and the Minister deciding, despite that, that it should not preclude his acting on the Commission in that particular case. This amendment provides that in such cases there would be publication of that decision.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Section 13: in subsection (1), lines 1 to 4, &ldquo;If, during an investigation by the Commission under this Act in relation to goods of any kind, the Commission is of opinion that injurious dumping of goods of that kind may occur, the Commission may&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;The Commission may, during an investigation by it under this Act in relation to goods of any kind,&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>There was objection to the phrase &ldquo;may occur&rdquo; on the grounds that it would prevent the Commission from recommending the imposition of a provisional duty if they are not of opinion that there would be further injurious dumping of the kind under investigation before the investigation is completed.  This would prevent the imposition of a retroactive levy on a single large consignment of imports and would thus reduce the deterrent value of the retroactive levy.  Such a levy can be imposed under section 20 only if a provisional duty has been imposed.  In the circumstances, I think this amendment should enable the retroactive provision to be utilised, or at least the existence of it and the possibility of its being completed even in the case of a single large consignment being imported of dumped goods should act as a very great deterrent to make the operation of the retroactive provision more effective.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment proposed in the Seanad and accepted by me.  It is largely a drafting amendment to clarify the wording of the section and merely alters the placing in the centre of the words &ldquo;estimated by it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  whenever the Minister is satisfied that goods of any kind have been dumped and that there is danger that they will continue to be dumped and that the&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="340" /> Again, this is a drafting amendment but it has perhaps more importance than an ordinary drafting amendment.

    <Title>Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1968: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now ready a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a further interim amendment of the existing legislation on industrial grants pending the introduction shortly of more comprehensive legislation concerning incentives for industrial development.  In the meantime, it is necessary to raise the ceiling of £30 million for grant expenditure which the existing legislation provides, so that grants can continue to be paid in accordance with approvals given by An Foras Tionscal under the present Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount which can be issued to An Foras Tionscal under the <Col N="341" /> Industrial Grants Acts and the Undeveloped Areas Acts is £30 million.  At 31st March, 1968 payment of grants amounted to £27,319,179 and expenditure on the provision of the industrial estates at Waterford and Galway came to £1,133,812.  This makes a total of £28,452,991 expended at 31st March, 1968.</P>
    <P>The raising of the ceiling of £30 million has, therefore, become a matter of urgency, and it is proposed in the present Bill to increase it to £40 million.  This global provision of money for industrial grant purposes will, of course, come up for review when the general legislation on industrial incentives is brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions this proposed maximum of £40 million twice.  In the first subsection, the maximum figure applies to the total of grants that may actually be paid by An Foras Tionscal or the Industrial Development Authority which at one stage was a grant-giving body.</P>
    <P>In the second subsection the maximum of £40 million relates to the total amount which may be issued by the Minister to An Foras Tionscal to enable this body to fulfil its grant-giving functions and the building of industrial estates.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have every intention of supporting this Bill because, of course, it was this Party and the Labour Party as members of the inter-Party Government who in 1956 introduced the first Industrial Grants Act and at the same time, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  The structure of the giving of grants remains largely unchanged since.  Our Party have been extremely critical of this situation in that surely from the expenditure of £30 million experience would have been gained which would have led to improvements. Nobody would expect the whole case resolved in one day, but one would have expected that there would have been something to encourage industry, but it is now quite clear that there is not.  The fact that the stolidity <Col N="342" /> was caused by the Government themselves has meant a lost opportunity, loss of employment in industry.</P>
      <P>No doubt the growth centre policy which has been in a tiny way implemented in Waterford and Galway is of paramount necessity for various areas of the country.  These growth centres would probably mean a loss of votes, and the people who are so concerned with vote material have not established more growth centres for the reason that they fear that if they gave a growth centre to Sligo, they would lose votes in Leitrim.  We in the Fine Gael Party have made it clear that we have the guts, for want of a more explanatory word, to see that growth centres are created where it is felt they are needed in the country.  The Minister has told us that over the past two years he has had a firm of consultants looking at this.  It is quite clear that in various areas of the country the reports of consultants will retain specific places for growth centres, places where large populations have been built up, and will say that the growth centres should be in those places.</P>
      <P>This type of delay is delaying the work of local authorities as well. Surely if we are to have heavy industry, we need all our communications stepped up: we need better roads, power and all the necessaries for building up industry.  It is a pecular thing that if we go into the EEC, we will not be allowed to operate the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, or the changed-over name which Fianna Fáil gave it. It strikes me that we will not be in a position to give freedom from income tax for our new exports, but at the same time, we would be in a position so long as we indicate growth centres, to provide grants for industry. We have been stolid and unchanging in our operation of these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been spectacular failures, but when they are mentioned, the Government take either of two lines: they say we are opposing the creation of new jobs in new industry or they say that the number of failures is extremely small in relation to the successes <Col N="343" /> and that in fact compared with other countries, we have done extremely well.  I do not accept that at all.  I think the percentage of failures has been extremely high.  I do not believe there would have been such spectacular failures if there had been prior investigation on the part of the Government.  When the grant becomes high enough, it becomes vital, and it must be accepted that the attention to detail and the safety of the money given were not entirely what they should have been.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the story of these industries.  I could instance one which is still operating and for that reason I am not giving its name.  There was a subscribed capital of £40,000 and this resulted in an investment one way or the other of Government funds of almost £600,000.  Profit has not yet been made.  My responsibility is not to mention it.  My responsibility is in no way to affect the 150 people employed there, but at the same time, one must, as an Opposition speaker on a particular facet of our growth, advert to these spectacular failures.  The fact is that one hears of a Government speaker who told every other public representative in a constituency to go away but the factory was not opened.  The Frenchman who provided this machinery still has it in a packing case on the factory floor and was informed that he might get 5/- in the £. Those things, if they were small enough in volume, would be regarded as a natural risk, but we must realise the lack of attention to change by the Government since 1956 in the giving of these moneys.</P>
    <P>There is a sequence of events in relation to industrial grants which should be again adverted to, that is, the fact that in Clerys Restaurant in 1956 Deputy Lemass, who was then out of office, addressed a representative meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party and he circulated then a statement&mdash;I have it at home on my files&mdash;to the <i>Irish Press</i> indicating the principle whereby in industry, from public and private sources, there would be spent in the succeeding seven years some £100 million, <Col N="344" /> with the creation of 100,000 new jobs.  I had perhaps political mischief in mind when I went to my files the other day and found that the present Taoiseach has indicated that since the start of the industrial grants system, which incidentally was rejected by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1956 when they spoke so viciously against it, there has been an expenditure in industry here of £97 million, of which grants from State funds were something less than £30 million.  During that time the Taoiseach claimed 35,000 new jobs but what he did not say was that there were 170,000 fewer people employed and that our effort has been a failure.  The fact that we are now awaiting the report of a firm of international consultants means that we are probably about eight years too late.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two departures which I thought might have been referred to by the Minister in his opening speech.  One is the change from adaptation grants, if I am using the right term, to re-equipment grants, which appears to be a development arising at long last from prodding from this side of the House over a long period of time.  The scope of the adaptation grants has been enlarged, and is now approaching somewhat nearer the Northern Ireland and English situation, where, if you buy a piece of machinery for your industry, all you have to do is to send the receipted account to the relevant Department of State and you get the grant almost automatically.  Apparently we have stepped a little nearer them as a result of prodding from this side of the House and the fact that we have lost quite a few industries to Northern Ireland&mdash;which is a somewhat happier situation than losing them to England. Anybody who has been trying to promote industry and getting people to come to one's constituency knows that what I say is true.  I welcome this change but I criticise it, and point to the difference between Fine Gael policy and Fianna Fáil policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>The position is that the maximum re-equipment grant for an existing industry which the Minister is prepared to give, even on his changed system, is <Col N="345" /> 25 per cent of the cost, whereas this Party announced as their policy two years ago&mdash; which they enunciated at every possible opportunity&mdash;the giving to every existing industry&mdash;and I emphasise it&mdash;the same grants as are given to new industries.  The people employed, Irishmen working here in good conditions over the years, dealing with trade unions as they always have, not like other people who come in, are entitled to this if the money is spent on adaptation and re-equipment.  In the battle we have to face, we have to defend the jobs we have and they should get as high a level of grants as new industries.  Experience has shown that the new industry always gets a higher grant even though the phraseology &ldquo;up to the maximum limit&rdquo; was included in the regulations in relation to these grants.</P>
    <P>Sometimes industries coming in are industries which employ largely female labour and our production of new industrial jobs has shown this as a feature of many of the new jobs produced and boasted about in this House, very often <i>ad nauseam</i>, from the Government benches.  In fact, the new jobs were for girls.  In a town in my constituency, I had the experience, before the present Minister became Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a chamber of commerce dinner, of hearing great praise of an industry that had arrived which was employing a large number of girls and which was doing the same sort of work as an industry in which a neighbour of mine was involved.  When this was going on, my neighbour, who was not a great supporter of our Party, nearly swallowed his glass when he heard that over £100,000 was being spent on employing girls when he could not get anything.</P>
    <P>This is a feature that must be looked at.  There is more to be said in favour of a situation in which a man leaves his work on Friday, goes down the street and has a few drinks, goes back to his wife and gives her two-thirds of his pay than there is to be said for girls leaving work, dropping down to the drapers to buy a pair of nylons and giving their mothers enough for their <Col N="346" /> keep for that week and then proceeding to the pictures with the boy-friend. We have not succeeded in creating male jobs.  We have not been fluid enough in our approach.  A change to suit changing conditions has not been looked at and there have been spectacular failures in a great number of cases.</P>
    <P>I hope that this firm of international consultants who will soon produce their report will give the Minister a lead towards considering the question of other incentives.  Is the Minister aware that if you buy capital goods in England at present, you get two to five years payment on them from moneys from the British Government as long as the goods are for export?  This is something which might be considered wasteful of capital here which we need for housing and other things but it is something that could be looked at. Whether it will be a valid incentive within the EEC I do not know, but it seems to me that to leave the measure as it has been since 1956 is a mistake. It appears to me that we should have changed and that we have too many spectacular failures.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the small industries grants, and if I might criticise the Minister on this, the reported change to adaptation grants was not according to the publicity he should have sought and got.  He made a hash of it of course by announcing one change at a Fianna Fáil meeting and we had to wait three weeks or a month before we got the draft circular from the Industrial Development Authority. In relation to small industrial grants, most people who are in areas where they are operating still do not know about them.  I had experience of a small industrialist in Donegal who wanted to expand and I happened to come in contact with him.  We had a chat about it and I put stuff on paper and sent it in, only to find that while Donegal had not been mentioned, there was, in fact, a development team working in Lifford County Council offices.  I found it out by accident from a man in Donegal who had not thought of expanding but who when his son decided to stay at home with him, decided to expand.  Where small industries <Col N="347" /> are available and are not expanding, the Minister should avail of every opportunity to discuss outside this House, and particularly inside it, the re-equipment of such industries.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might reiterate the policy of Fine Gael in this matter.  First of all, there has not been enough change. Changes have been too slow from the time we instituted these grants in 1956. We are not saying that we should go around as if it were a headstone over a grave.  We say it should be looked at and we should take every opportunity we have to re-employ our people.  There are 127,000 fewer employed now than there were in 1957.  Therefore, this system has not succeeded in doing what we wanted it to do, that is, to keep employment up.</P>
    <P>The Lemass plan of 1956 is now proved by the Taoiseach not to have succeeded.  They are within £3 million of an expenditure of £100 million and there is a figure of 100,000 jobs less than Lemass decided he was going to produce in seven years.  The policy of Fine Gael on industry is to give, within the EEC, to old jobs of the same type as much as is given to the institution of new ones.  There is political advantage in the creation of a new job and a new factory and expounding it at the crossroads. We are all aware of that.</P>
    <P>A possibility is, first of all, to expand the jobs in industry that are there and then establish new industries alongside those.  It is Fine Gael policy to back existing industry, to give as good a grant and opportunity of Government assistance as is given to new industry and, at the same time, to bring in new industries.  The approach to change should have been an approach of advance and we should get this thing moving instead of sitting down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill in the belief that it is the function of any Government to do all in their power to stimulate and co-ordinate the efforts of Irish industrialists for the development of our industrial potential with a view to the creation of new jobs.  It is on the basis of the creation of new industries that new jobs will be found for the very extensive army of unemployed in this <Col N="348" /> country.  We appreciate that a substantial amount of money is provided here for the acceleration of the creation of industrial estates, particularly at Waterford and Galway.  An industrial estate must be of tremendous advantage to an area such as Waterford, part of which is in my constituency.  I have witnessed in Waterford the great work being carried out in the development of sites, the building of factories and of houses for the workers.  This has been a great boon to the people in Waterford and in the vast hinterland around the city.  We hope that much-needed employment will be provided for a big number of people in this area.</P>
      <P>While lauding the creation of industrial estates, I should like to urge the Minister not to forget the very many towns and villages which need industrial development.  We know that in the long term these areas will be called upon to supply labour for the industrial estates being created, but in the mind of many industrial development associations in towns remote from these industrial estates there is a growing fear that it will be difficult in future to attract industry to these towns, that all the attraction will lie in the industrial estates.  The small town or village does not have the same attraction for an industrialist as it may have had in the past.  This is understandable, having regard to the amount of money being poured into these estates for the provision of grandiose factories, housing schemes, and so on.  Industrialists are bound to be attracted to these estates and it will be more difficult for small towns to secure industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has some pilot schemes in mind, if not already in operation.  He must take steps to ensure that small towns are not forgotten, that they will get the same State aid and the same stimulants as are available for industrial development in other areas.  Rural villages and small towns are fast disappearing. They are becoming denuded of population. We do not want the situation created that there will be a vast concentration of people in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Cork. We want the rural population and the population of villages and <Col N="349" /> towns maintained.  Many small towns are fast becoming ghost towns because of the inability of local development associations, despite their best endeavours, to attract industry.  There is little comfort to be secured by the representatives of local industrial associations when they come to Dublin to plead with An Foras Tionscal or the Industrial Development Authority for aid in the establishment of industries. I have been on such deputations on many occasions and have found it to be a most frustrating and futile exercise.  All we got was a pep talk as to what the Minister's Department and the agencies under his control require and an indication that we would have to have a blue print in our hands and evidence that the proposed industry would be a viable proposition, likely to be permanent, that the labour content was reasonable and, most desirably, that it would have export potential. One got that information and was sent home.</P>
    <P>There is a marked absence of tangible, positive support and help from An Foras Tionscal or the Industrial Development Authority for local development associations.  There is an inference of prejudice against the mere Irishman or group of Irishmen who put forward a proposition for the establishment of an industry to the Minister's Department or An Foras Tionscal or the Industrial Development Authority.  The feeling is growing that preferential treatment is given to the foreigner and that the mere Irish will get short shrift.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party contend that native sponsors of industry are entitled to at least the courtesy, help and cooperation as are available to outsiders. It would have been well for the Minister's Department to have relied on Irish sponsors in the past rather than on so many foreigners with whom they became enamoured.  We know that many people on whom so much reliance was placed defaulted. Grandiose schemes for industrialisation and for the employment of large numbers of workers did not materialise. Many of these foreigners were, in fact, fly-by-night speculators who, having availed of the lavish State aid afforded <Col N="350" /> them here, quickly closed their factories and left the workers in idle bewilderment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister should consider the desirability of getting some officials in the various bodies under his control, especially An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority, to get out of their easy chairs, to go down the country and to make it their business and their duty to consult with the chambers of commerce, the trades councils and local development associations in small towns, to get down to work with them and to show positive proof that they are sincere in their desire to help these development associations to win for themselves and their communities much-needed industries.</P>
    <P>We naturally support this Bill in its intention to create new industry.  We would also like to see to it that generous State aid is provided for the extension of our present industries so that they may proceed with their plans for development and for the absorption of a greater number of people.  I want to put to the Minister very seriously and sincerely that he owes a debt of gratitude&mdash;we all do&mdash;to our well-established industries.  Whenever they come to him for assistance, he ought to respond generously and quickly. Many of us know of well-established industries who have got into difficulties, trading and financial.  We know that many of these industries found it extremely difficult to keep going and there was real possibility of closure.  We have seen evidence of a wonderful local civic response from our chambers of commerce in coming to the rescue of these old-established industries, in rehabilitating them, putting them back on their feet and injecting much-needed capital into them.  We also know to our sorrow that where this situation was brought to the notice of the Minister and his Department and to the notice of An Foras Tionscal and the IDA, where the strongest possible representations were made to the Minister that he should come speedily to the rescue of these companies which were fast going to the wall and where all that was needed was an injection of capital, there was a marked reluctance <Col N="351" /> on the part of the Minister to come to the rescue.  This marked absence of support for these old-established industries is to be greatly deplored.  Even where new companies are formed for the continuation of these old industries to which I refer, we again have this dilatory and hesitant approach of the Minister and his Department and agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know the one to which the Deputy is referring.  That is why I asked him to be more specific. There is no justification whatever for what he is saying, but if he is not specific, it is difficult for me to refute it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the industry concerned, I am aware that representations have been made to the Minister and his Department and agencies for some months to come to the aid of this firm.  Up to this moment I am not aware of any positive steps which they have taken to aid this firm in its difficulty.  If the Minister wants to comment on that, he is welcome to. This is why I am appealing for fair treatment for these old-established industries.  Many of them are the mainstays of their local communities.  If they should go to the wall, naturally large numbers of people will be unemployed and the economy of these small towns seriously disrupted.  Since the Minister has intervened, I would be very grateful to him if he would say precisely what assistance is available from his various agencies towards the rehabilitation of firms of the kind to which I have referred.  If the Minister wants me to be more specific in this matter, which I am loath to be at present, I will have no hesitation in putting down a question in respect of the industry with which I am particularly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Donegan when he infers that the Republic is losing ground to the Stormont Government in respect of our ability to attract new <Col N="352" /> industry.  I believe the Northern Government are more generous in respect of their grants and aids to potential industrialists.  The Minister would want to take cognisance of that fact.  There is already evidence in respect of particular industries that we are losing them in the South and they are being established in the North. Anyone who makes a comparison of the help available in the North <i>vis-à-vis</i> the South must come to the conclusion that the North would seem to have the edge on us in this regard.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that and see to it that we do not lose ground in this regard.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the amount of money being spent on the creation of new industries by the State, it is fair to point out that the endeavours of the State in aiding private enterprise in establishing new industries have not been successful.  Despite all the generous assistance which our various Departments and agencies have made available, we have not made the progress one would desire in respect of the establishment of new industries.  We have not been able to put to work this very large army of unemployed.  It is tragic to realise that we have a standing army of some 16,000 people, basically well-trained and educated, certainly adaptable people, who could be put to productive work if the State intervened more directly in the creation of new industries.  I would be failing in my duty as a Labour representative if I did not emphasise again the fundamental difference between our policy and our philosophy and that of the Minister, in that he is relying, and his Government have relied for far too long, on the initiative of private enterprise to establish industries and put Irish men and women to work.  It has been a failure and this is evidenced by the sort of history we have had of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Minister to consider the desirability of intervening directly in the creation of industrial enterprises. In that regard we are not unmindful of, or ungrateful for, the very many State and semi-State boards and bodies which have been established.  We are proud of their achievements.  We <Col N="353" /> believe that more such bodies should be established.  We also feel that where large amounts of public money are expended in new industries for the manipulation of private enterprise, the Government have a bounden duty to see to it that that industrial enterprise works properly, that the promises made in respect of production targets, export potentials and employment content are fulfilled, that it has the badge of permanency and that it does not capitulate or fold up quickly and show a complete disregard for the promises made earlier.</P>
    <P>Where sizable amounts of State money are expended, we believe the Government should appoint a Government representative, a representative of the people, to see to it that the affairs of these new companies are properly carried out and that the investment which the Irish people make is adequately cared for.  In the absence of a State representative of that kind, we will continue to have industrial casualties of the type we have had to contend with over the years.  It may well be that this would have a dissuading influence on some potential industries and if they are not prepared to have a watchdog for the people on their boards where lavish State aid is provided, we must suspect their motives in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>These are some of the sentiments I wanted to express on this measure.  We hope the good work of expanding our industries will continue and that the Minister will have results to show for the ideas which I know he has in mind and is formulating in respect of the creation of industries for small communities. I am fearful that the small towns and villages may be forgotten and may be put at a very decided disadvantage by over-emphasis on the creation of industrial estates.  While I do not wish to denigrate in any way the wonderful idea of the centralisation of industries of this kind, I think it fair also to point out the needs of our smaller towns so that we may retain our population in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Department on their work so far as these <Col N="354" /> industries are concerned.  When we hear comments made here in connection with the North getting the upper hand on us, we must remember that the North was looked on as the industrial arm of the country for a long number of years.  I am very much afraid that the bad name we are getting in regard to unofficial strikes is having a bad effect on industrialists who would come in here in the ordinary course.</P>

      <P>It is time to straighten up.  You are either in charge of the trade unions or else get out.  You cannot shout and keep dumb at the same time.  You cannot be crying out for more industrialists and more employment for our people, and at the same time, be responsible for acts of sabotage of which we had an exhibition in regard to the Verolme Dockyard. Either you want the people to have employment or you do not.  If you want them to have employment, let the Government who are looking after those industries go ahead and let the industries go ahead.  Do not carry out acts of sabotage or, what is worse, exhibitions such as we had in regard to the Verolme Dockyard.  At present that dockyard is giving employment to between 800 and 1,000 men every day at decent wages.  Those are 1,000 men our friends cannot say are unemployed.</P>
      <P>I know the difficulties the Government have&mdash;no one knows them better &mdash;in regard to those industries.  I saw the Irish Steel Industry started, and I saw it go bankrupt twice.  On each occasion I saw the State put up the cash to set it going again, with the result that 600 men are now working there, getting constant employment and decent wages.  At times it is hard to get industries off the ground, to get them going.  There are a number of wildcat schemes that come along.  I have gone on a dozen trips trying to get money but when you arrive there, you find that they have not got a shilling and that they think they can come here and get whatever money they want to start an industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have a responsibility because it is the Irish people's money they are lending.  I have seen things that worked out in my own constituency.  I remember when General Costello came down first.  He had this new idea about the vegetables. When he had travelled over portion of my constituency, he said we had a kitchen garden for that kind of business. He said: &ldquo;You collect the money and we will get going.&rdquo;  I went around amongst the farmers and I got £30,000. The Sugar Company put up another £30,000 and on that we started.</P>
      <P>We started the first year with 280 acres of vegetables.  We were assisted generously on each occasion we went to the Minister's Department in regard to grants for that industry.  We went on to 12,050 acres last year.  We have 3,000 acres under vegetables this year. Please God, we shall be on the 5,000-acre mark next year&mdash;all practically for the export trade and giving permanent employment.  On the 5,000-acre mark, we shall be giving permanent employment to 700 boys and girls in that industry.  That is what is required in this country.  It is the only thing that is required in this country as far as getting employment for our own people here is concerned.  I only hope, now, that the Minister will consider areas that have not got those benefits and endeavour to get smaller industries if necessary in there&mdash;and I am alluding principally to the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are opportunities in the West. In my opinion, there is room there and there are plenty of workers there to start further industries and to give employment to those people.  It is rather a shame when you go down to those areas and travel around there to see four, five and six men in one home and to know that hardly one of them will remain there&mdash;only the door closed.  I think that anything that could be done in regard to getting industries into those areas would be a godsend, a great help.  After all, that is why we looked for our freedom.  We looked for our freedom so that we would no longer be hewers of wood and drawers <Col N="356" /> of water for John Bull.  We looked for our freedom so that we should not have to send our boys and girls out into the wilds&mdash;just rearing them for the emigrant ship&mdash;but could keep them here.  Deputy Seán Lemass showed us the road and the way to keep them here.  Let nothing stop us from doing that.</P>
    <P>If, as Deputy Treacy says, Northern Ireland is getting into a more favoured position in regard to the attraction of industries, let us put our finger on the reason and stop it.  I suggest to the Minister, on that, that the sooner we come to the point of seeing things in their proper perspective and calling them by their right names, the better. A Labour Court with no power to enforce its decisions or which comes to decisions and cannot enforce them is not worth a hang to anyone.  I have said that before.  I do not care if you put five trade union men there as judges&mdash;I do not care who is put there &mdash;but, in God's name, let it be a court that will sit, that will come to a decision and that will be able to enforce that decision.</P>
    <P>There is too much of this tally-ho strike business going on.  I suggest that that is very largely the cause of any falling-off here in the attraction of industries. You will start a very small industry now with a quarter of a million pounds.  If a fellow has a quarter of a million pounds, he sees that, the moment an industry is started here, after 12 months there is a strike and then there is another strike and that condition of affairs carries on.  I had bitter experience of it in my younger days when I saw, inside in the Verolme Dockyard that is there now, men going on strike for wages and because they would not do this, that or the other thing.  The ship that was there under repair had to leave and go over to England to get the repairs carried out.  I saw those very men travel over to England in that ship and work for lower wages over there.  I saw those.  I do not want to see that again.  I want to see this country built up.  I want to see achieved what our people suffered for, namely, our country built up and able to give employment here to our own people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> Any man I see who can get a dozen boys and girls and put them to work has my blessing and will get any help I can give him.  However, for heaven's sake, let me repeat, particularly to the Labour men here, that they should look at this and see if there cannot be some way of settling disputes besides calling men out on strike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Look; I have seen a couple of them.  I had to father one, two or three years ago, with the Sugar Company.  I do not want to see it again.  If I am forced to do so, I shall do it again.  However, I shall endeavour, in any way I can, to reach a peaceful solution.  Nobody should be allowed to go on strike until the lapse of a maximum of a two months period after the matter has been given to the Labour Court for a decision on the demand&mdash; but I should have the Labour Court in such a position that their decision could be enforced.  That would avoid all this waste of time, waste of energy and waste of money that is going on.</P>
      <P>It is no pleasure to me to see the men going down to Verolme Dockyard to work in the morning and to see the dockyard having to close for the afternoon and the men having to go home because the ESB are on strike&mdash;and the same in Irish Steel and the same in Fords.  That is no pleasure, assistance, lead or inducement to any industrialist who wants to come into this country with his money to give employment to our people.  That kind of thing is no use.  Some means must be found to deal with the problem.  Surely there are steady enough heads and sensible enough people in the trade union movement and among the Government representatives, who can come together with employers and settle these things peacefully without having those disasters and tragedies forced on us every day?  They are no pleasure to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to see industries going ahead.  We want to see new industries started.  We want to see them built <Col N="358" /> up and employment being given in them.  The surest way of doing that is the way I have suggested here to Deputy Tully, in particular, and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. They are two good, tough, sensible men.  Let them put their heads together and find a way out of the problem. There is nothing you cannot find a way out of.  Find a way out of those things without the tragedies of the strikes and the harm and the injury done to thousands of homes by these strikes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear I must consider this Bill somewhat disappointing. Everybody will accept that our drive for industrial expansion, although it has increased considerably, has not met the demands of the country.  The proof of that is that we still carry a large number of unemployed and still have a good deal of emigration.  As I know the position, the control of the setting up of industries largely rests with An Foras Tionscal in that they can site industries and decide whether a particular industry shall be permitted to start in an area or not.  I have had considerable experience of this in my own constituency in dealing with local industrial development associations that are endeavouring to get facilities and set up industries.  They have always found interminable delays and a tendency on the part of this body, possibly as a result of Government instructions, to site industries as far as possible in undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>I want to make two suggestions.  One is that, in regard to these grants that are being ladled out pretty freely to foreigners coming here to set up industries&mdash;very often they only come to fulfil a contract in their own country and clear out afterwards&mdash;where an industry is set up based on Irish raw materials, the grants should be more generous.  If we had based our industrial drive from the foundation of the State on Irish raw materials, we would not now find ourselves with so many of our industries in the parlous condition in which they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other suggestion&mdash;and I think this plea was already made and cited as part of the Fine Gael policy&mdash;is that <Col N="359" /> existing industries should be in a position to secure support.  As I know the position, an existing industry can get in the way of State grants or assistance only a certain amount of money for research.  I forget the actual term of the grant.  They cannot get a big grant to build up an industry or extend or modernise premises.  All over the world, and particularly in countries far stronger industrially and far wealthier than we are, there is a combining of big industries, placing them on a productive capacity scale far in excess of what you find in small industries in countries such as this.  I can speak of my own area where we have had an agricultural machinery industry for a great many years.  It was well established and well conducted in the past and we find it is now in competition with other industries that are bigger and have units in other countries.  They are able to produce more economically. It is entirely wrong that existing established industries should not have freely available to them grants to enable them to expand, modernise and generally to increase production.</P>
    <P>I cite the case of Nítrigin Éireann which is a State-owned company.  It has available for the purpose of expansion the full support of State funds.  That may be all right and I am very glad to see Nítrigin Éireann flourish because it gives a certain amount of employment in my area, but as against that, why should State industry have available to it for the purpose of expansion and modernisation all the State can command while private enterprise industry which has perhaps existed for years and proved itself worthy of development and capable of exporting has no such facilities?  I am disappointed in the Bill, although I welcome the fact that for global expansion of industry, the increase is from £30 million to £40 million.  I see no change in the overall policy of the industrial drive and I submit that unless the Government are prepared to take that decisive step, we shall stay in our present quandary, having the highest percentage of unemployment practically in the free world and a situation <Col N="360" /> where our young people have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take the initiative in co-ordinating industrial development associations which are gradually coming into existence throughout the country.  They get no particular benefits.  They represent an attempt on the part of private enterprise and local business people to invest local capital in Irish industry.  It is one of the tragedies of today that while we are a comparatively poor State, we have considerable sums of money at our disposal.  We have large sums on deposit in the banks and we are told that our financial situation is so happy because those deposits are all the time rising.  These deposits should be invested at local level where we want to site industries if we are to save the country and the population.  I would even go further and say, as I have already said, that if the Minister is prepared to give particular subsidisation for the use of Irish raw materials, we would have established small industries not only in the towns, which is absolutely essential, but also in the smaller towns, which in other countries would probably be known as small villages.  I am thinking of a community of about 500 people.  They have emigration and unemployment problems of their own and the only thing that will save them is industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from the idea of starting enormous industries involving a tremendous amount of capital, inviting European industrialists to come here and set up such industries.  We know that in many cases where such industrialists have been taken to the West by An Foras Tionscal, they only fulfil a contract for which they did not have the manpower in their own country. When their contracts are fulfilled, there is nothing to prevent them turning the key in the door and going away again.  The Industrial Development Authority, which I think has overall responsibility for handing out funds, takes over the building concerned.  But what is it worth?  I know of one place in the west of Ireland where two industries were started and eventually the keys were turned in the doors by the <Col N="361" /> European industrialists who came there and they cleared out.  The only thing the State can recover in such cases is the price of the building.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in the Bill and disappointed in the Minister that he has not changed the situation that he found existing because it is this procedure and the existing legislation we have that has placed us in the unhappy situation in which we are today.  I therefore ask the Minister to take another look at the position and perhaps to accept or initiate an amendment on Committee Stage that will attempt to encourage the basing of Irish industries on Irish raw materials. That is the key to success in the future. In addition, it will help agricultural expansion in that we can process agricultural raw materials.  We can expand our pulping factories and give up importing things from Canada and other places that we can produce ourselves. We are able to grow the raw material faster than Scandinavia and other countries.  Let the Minister take another look at this and perhaps the employment situation will be happier than it is today.</P>

      <P>First of all, I am sick and tired of listening to people who know nothing about the situation lecturing the trade union and labour movement on how to remedy the position which appears to have arisen in this country.  Let me repeat something I said last week: as far as the trade union and labour movement is concerned, we who are trade union officials spend a lot more time stopping strikes than we spend doing anything else.  We do not start strikes; they are started at the demand of the workers concerned.  We try our best to delay them as long as we can, because as long as there is a hope of the situation being improved and the dispute being settled while the men and women are working, then it is in the interests of everybody concerned that this should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strikes happen for two reasons: first, because we have still a great number of unreasonable employers, and that includes some semi-State bodies; and <Col N="362" /> secondly, because we have unreasonable workers, many of whom have very little interest in the jobs they are in and whose only aim is to have a bit of fun or, alternatively, to cause trouble.  They believe in some peculiar way that by causing a strike, they are striking a blow, as I pointed out here on one occasion, for the Fianna Fáil Party. They think they are doing a good turn if they can dissipate union funds, that they should get some of these medals that are handed out for exceptional service. This is the sort of nonsense which is carried on.</P>
    <P>However, some strikes have to take place.  If workers find that employers are unreasonable and cannot be dealt with in any other way, then the strike is the only answer to it.  Deputy Corry, who was prepared to condemn roundly the trade union movement for having strikes, finished up by saying he had started a strike of beet growers and that he proposed to start another one if the occasion arose.  He is perfectly entitled to do it, but he cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>We do not want strikes if there is any other way of settling a dispute, but let me make this clear: we believe that the day the strike weapon is taken out of the hands of the workers, they are slaves, because there is no other way they can enforce their demands.  We have unreasonable disputes from time to time and we have people who are selfish enough to hold the whole community to ransom.  We have this thing which I described last week as an abomination, the unofficial strike, the strikers who believe and know they can get something for their own small group by having a strike, by pulling a fast one and getting away with it.  We are as much opposed to them as Deputy Corry or the Government&mdash;in fact we are more opposed to them&mdash; and we are doing everything we can to stop them.  This must be the concern of everybody.  There must be a certain amount of consideration given to this sort of thing by everybody.  We cannot settle it overnight.  From time to time a strike which has been started supposedly for the purpose of improving the lot of employees turns out to have been started for a very different reason.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> There is no use in people saying there should be compulsory arbitration, as Deputy Corry suggested, that the Labour Court should have the right to say that men or women must accept something and go back to work.  You cannot make workers work if they do not want to, and the sooner we realise that the better.  We had a recent example of this in the ESB dispute. Despite the ESB Bill which was introduced in this House, the Government found they could do nothing about the situation.  Therefore, the people who were in gaol because they contravened the law passed by this House had to be taken out and sent home in taxis in the middle of the night.  That should be answer enough to anyone who says you can make workers work.</P>
    <P>We have the joint industrial councils which to a certain extent have the authority to make mandatory rates, and this arrangement has been honoured because the employers and employees, the union and employer representatives, are able to discuss the matter and reach a settlement.  That is how these things can be settled, but to appoint three or five people and say they are the people who will decide on these matters and that there will be no appeal against the decision, will never work in this country.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal of talk of all the strikes and of all the industrialists who have been kept out of this country because of this threat of strikes. That is a lot of nonsense, because the number of man-days lost due to strikes compared with the number in the countries from which some of these gentlemen come is relatively small.  I cannot point this out often enough, that the number of man-days lost through unemployment is much greater than the man-days lost through strikes, and we do not seem to be worried about that end of it at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that if he is really serious about trying to do something effective with this short Bill&mdash;there are only two sections in it and four subsections and it covers a sum of £10 million&mdash;he must set out <Col N="364" /> to do other things.  He must, to start off, ensure that the discrimination which we have between counties is eased, if not removed altogether.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree with me that it is rather ridiculous that somebody coming into County Meath, where very little industry has been started, cannot get the same amount of grant as he would get if he went across the border a couple of miles into Cavan or Monaghan.  There is very little difference between North Meath and Cavan or Monaghan.  Still, there is a very big difference in the amount of money which goes to the industrialist who starts an industry in either of these counties instead of in County Meath.</P>
    <P>I believe County Meath is an ideal industrial centre for these reasons: it is near a seaport and it is near Dublin Airport, and the roads in Meath are very good.  This is one of the counties where the population has been growing, and would grow very much faster but for the fact that emigration from it is pretty heavy.  There are still people there who cannot find a job, and the result is that in the village in which I live, 20 or 30 people go on a bus at 6 o'clock in the morning to Dublin to their employment and come back at 7.30 in the evening.  We talk about working conditions and social conditions, and that is the situation there. Another 100 or 150 will, between that hour and 9 o'clock, take a bus out of the district.  That happens right across the county, workers travelling over 30 miles to Dublin and elsewhere because they cannot find employment in their own area.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that more encouragement should be given to site factories where it would suit the manufacturer to site them and where it would suit the workers to work in them rather than spend half their working life travelling.  If, as has been the fact up to now, private enterprise has not been able to provide full employment, the State has got to face up to it that it is their job to ensure that employment is provided.  This morning we heard a reference to Deputy Lemass's £100 million and his 100,000 new jobs.  I did not think the <Col N="365" /> same comment was made by him on the same occasion but perhaps Deputy Donegan's files are clearer than mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am clear on one thing, that is, that the 100,000 new jobs have not materialised and in fact the 100,000 jobs which were there at that time seem to be disappearing rapidly. If the State could get to the position wherein they would have suitable industries started here, they would be doing a good job and it would prevent the situation of industrialists coming here and telling the Department that their employment potential is 500.  If we ask a question in the House, we are told that the potential is 500 or 600, but two years later we find that 25 people are working in the industry and the potential is never realised and, in my opinion, it never was intended to be realised.</P>
      <P>The State only is in a position to find out what employment an industry will give and could then make the necessary provision.  If the State did that they would save money because every man who is unemployed, who is receiving unemployment benefit is, as we know, a severe loss to the State. Apart from the loss of what he would be creating if he were working, apart from the injection into the economy and his district when he spends his money, the State is paying some £9 to £10 a week for every man receiving unemployment benefit.  In addition, there is the loss from income tax in many cases and the loss of social welfare insurance stamps in every case.  If the State went to the trouble of checking that figure for 100 men in an area, it would find out what it was costing to keep them unemployed and would realise that it would pay better to have an investment here by having industries which would give employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy that we have reached the stage where if the State is to have a big investment in industry, they must put in a director in each industry to see that the money is properly spent.  We cannot afford another Potez.  Of course the Minister <Col N="366" /> will probably tell me that Potez have expanded and that now they have increased from ten last year to 25.  If we live long enough, we will see the entire 650 employed.</P>

      <P>We must be thankful for small mercies.  If the State had somebody on the inside, they would know what was going on.  I am not blaming anybody for making a mistake.  It has been said that the person who never made a mistake never made anything.  Since mistakes can be avoided and since we could prevent a recurrence of these things by making sure that those who are getting large State grants or loans would know that there was a watchdog there to see that the money was spent in the way in which it was intended to spend it, we should do this.  Deputy Esmonde referred to industries which were started just to fill an order.  While this is something that it is said does not happen, it has happened and it has been known for foreign industries to come here in order to fill an order which might take five or ten years to fill and then they slide out, having made substantial sums of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very much in favour of this Bill but we feel that the money could be spent in a better way.  The responsibility must eventually lie with the Government to ensure that employment is provided and as it seems to be fairly definite, now that private enterprise is not providing the employment, that the Government have to see that the State does it.  We hear people from the Government side talking about good labour relations, talking about stays of <Col N="367" /> two months before strike action is taken, but would such people remember that the worst employer is the State itself?  Not in two months but in two years we still have not got a decision on the ordinary labourer's wages and conditions from various Government Departments who employ these people. If they want to lecture anybody, they should lecture the senior officials.  Let the Ministers face up to the fact that they are letting themselves and the Government down through their actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is in the nature of most people to aim at the spectacular, and this applies to all of us here and I suppose to people in State Departments as well.  A good deal of this has taken place in the past when efforts were directed to attracting larger industries to the country, or fostering them within the country, and mistakes have been made.  It is worth while making mistakes and learning lessons from them.  One lesson we should have learned by now is that we should have another look at industrial development.  While it is not in the nature of modern trends to deal with smaller concerns, we have in various towns throughout the country small private industries capable of development but which have not got the money to develop.  Any money given to existing industries which would cause an increase in their production would be money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to our new educational system, we have increased numbers of our boys and girls attending schools and there will be an increase in the number of skilled young people leaving the technical schools every year.  These are scattered throughout the country and the Minister would be very wise to direct a good part of the money which will be available for grants to towns which have privately-owned small industries which could be economically expanded.  Not sufficient emphasis has been placed on this in the past.  This applies in my own county, and to the Border counties generally, where there are small industries which in a small way are exporting to Northern Ireland and Britain but which do not appear to <Col N="368" /> attract the attention of the grant givers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is because of this spectacular element to which I referred and that it is felt necessary to convince people that something worth while is being done with the grants which are given.  If we got away from this for a while and did the unspectacular thing of adding 25 per cent to the employment in a small industry and, by adding that 25 per cent, perhaps increase the production by 50 per cent, that would be really worth while and the amount of money required to do it would not be much, especially in the case of the small industries I have mentioned&mdash;some of them not that small&mdash; which are exporting to Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know some of them have applied for grants but they find it difficult to convince the powers-that-be that grants should be given.  I have this feeling, rightly or wrongly, that these small industries are not getting the consideration they should and that they deserve.  I would urge that further consideration and larger grants should be given to these. The situation is very difficult for a small industrialist.  First of all, he has to employ an accountant and someone who will make application.  It is a very lengthy procedure for a man running a one-man show to get down to the business of making a case for a grant and producing accounts for a number of years back.  This is an aspect that seems to me to be neglected and I would urge the Minister to give that situation consideration under this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Esmonde, I too must confess I am disappointed with this Bill.  Over the past 12 months, the Minister has on numerous occasions here indicated that the Government were reviewing the whole approach to industrial incentives.  We expected that this review would have been completed <Col N="369" /> by now and it was reasonable to expect the Minister to have availed himself of this opportunity presented by this Bill to give us some indication as to when the Government propose to implement the new incentives and new ideas in regard to industrial development.</P>
      <P>We, in the Fine Gael Party, support any move towards the generation of greater industrial development.  I fear I must take a parochial attitude to this Bill because, while it is proposed to raise the ceiling of £30 million to £40 million, I remember that I represent a constituency which, since 1965, has not secured even one new industry.  In fact, the constituency has fared very badly from the point of view of securing its fair share of new industries.  There are various reasons for this.  The situation is pretty well known or, if it was not known up to a month ago, certainly every Deputy is well aware of it now.</P>
      <P>The industrial grants have worked out most unfairly where my constituency is concerned.  We have not been able to secure any new industries.  We have been unfortunate also in that a number of old-established industries in Limerick have been forced to close down.  One or two speakers suggested that the Government might perhaps do more for old-established industries family industries, or small industries. The most notable closures in Limerick were Messrs. Mattersons bacon factory, which was forced to close last year, and a city tannery.  Very little effort seemed to be made to keep these two particular concerns in production.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a grave disappointment to me.  It will be a bigger disappointment still to the people I represent. Hopes were held out in recent months that a new deal was on the way in the matter of industrial grants and incentives, a new deal which would be of benefit to the Limerick area.  As I said, we have not got our fair share of new industries.  We have not got our fair share of industrial grants.  The reason is pretty obvious.  We, in Limerick, have to compete with new industries in other more favoured areas.  The Shannon Industrial Estate is quite near us.  Now we have an industrial estate at Galway and another at Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed&mdash;I have reason <Col N="370" /> to believe the information is true&mdash;that industrialists coming in here, who make inquiries from the Industrial Development Authority about suitable locations, are told about the industrial estate at Shannon, the industrial estate at Waterford and the proposed industrial estate in Galway.  In most cases they never hear about Limerick or other areas.  That is most unfair because, when one considers the matter carefully, one realises that Limerick, the third city in the State, has outstanding natural advantages for industrial development. It has, indeed, all the facilities necessary. It has a port and an airport adjacent to it at Shannon.  It has a large pool of labour.  There are technical training facilities.  The transport and communications network is excellent. Despite all these natural advantages, we have not been able to secure any new industries and it is my belief that industrialists have been encouraged to go to areas other than Limerick, directly encouraged by the Industrial Development Authority, or someone else.  The fact is they would naturally tend to go to more favoured areas because the grants and incentives are greater in such areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give some indication as to when this review will be completed and when he expects to be in a position to introduce legislation. In the meantime, we will just have to go on living in hope in Limerick while our unemployment situation gets more serious, with no hope of any immediate solution of the problem.  One Deputy referred to more generous incentives being given to industrialists who use native raw materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Money Resolution provision is being made for the purposes of the Bill and one of the ways in which the sum requisite to finance the provisions of the Bill is estimated is by determining that the local educational authorities should contribute the same sum as they were contributing to scholarship schemes in 1967-68.  Is that not right?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that that is not an equitable provision, not an equitable measuring of the contributions to be made by the local authorities, for the reason that local authorities which went out of their way to appropriate the maximum sums the ratepayers in their districts could afford in the past now find themselves, in this proposed frozen state, at a material disadvantage as compared with counties which appropriated the minimum.  In the future, all will be on a basis of equality.  It seems rather hard that Monaghan, which is not a rich county&mdash;I can give particulars of a case to illustrate my point to the Minister&mdash;which gave not only university scholarships but technological scholarships too, is by this method of calculation the sixth highest contributor of all counties in the country and there are 19 other counties, many of which are very much more prosperous areas than Monaghan, who under this frozen device will be making lower contributions to the total expense of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I ask the Minister whether it would not be more equitable to levy an average rate in the pound for all counties, whether it was 1d, 2d or 3d, and to freeze the rate for all counties on a basis of average poundage so that a county which has led the way in the past in expanding higher educational facilities at great cost to itself will not be put in the position of having to <Col N="372" /> carry in perpetuity a heavier share of what I call this frozen contribution to the total cost than counties which held back and did not offer the same educational facilities in the past to the children in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from County Monaghan in this respect and, without wishing to labour the matter unduly, the present proposal involves a contribution of £1,600 from Monaghan.  Yet we find Carlow with a contribution of £760, Louth with £740 and Longford with £480.  That is the way it works out.  If everyone were asked to pay, say, 2d in the pound, at least everybody would feel, no matter where he lived, that he was bearing an equal burden of the frozen part of the cost of this scheme, but it does not seem reasonable to me to propose that our people in Monaghan should be asked to pay three times the amount they will pay in Longford, twice the amount they will pay in Sligo, twice the amount they will pay in Clare and nearly twice the amount they will pay in Wicklow, Donegal and Cavan.  I suggest that the Minister should look into this again and consider whether something cannot be done to remove this apparent inequity to which I draw his attention.</P>

If the Minister were to announce now that he proposed to drop this plan by substituting a flat rate, freeze a flat rate, I think the objection to this proposal would disappear. It is the differential on an inequitable basis as between one county and another which gives rise to our problem.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the discussion would probably be more relevant to section 3.  However, that is another day's work.  I do not want here to go into the whole question of the rating and valuation system.  We know well that there are inequalities as between county and county and to levy a flat rate all over the country would merely preserve those inequalities.  I do not propose to go into a full discussion on the inequities of the rating system.  The House is well aware of anomalies in this regard.  If you levy a flat rate system over the whole country, you merely incorporate into this measure a perpetuation of the inequalities that exist.</P>
      <P>I think the most practical thing is to accept what reasonable men on local authorities regarded their counties' contributions should be last year and to accept what these reasonable men in the various local authorities have decided their counties' contributions should be towards helping the boys and girls in their areas towards higher education, and having accepted that to freeze it at that level and to have a State contribution from now on.  I think that is the most practical way of going about it.  We want to get this scheme in this year, to make sure that the boys and girls within the income categories, who achieve the educational qualification of four honours, will get in this year to higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most practical way of doing it, I feel, is the way we have incorporated in section 3, freeze the contribution from the local authorities at the level that reasonable men on the local authorities thought last year should be their particular counties' contribution towards higher education and have the State add to that so as to enlarge the number of people getting into higher <Col N="375" /> education from the figure of 300 odd to what we hope will be 1,000 odd. That is our thinking in the matter and I think, on balance, we have adopted the right approach.  If the House considers it in the light of the fact that we did not want to incorporate the anomalies of our rating system, they will agree that this is the best approach, what reasonable men thought should be their contribution, and we will pay over and above whatever is required to finance the education of boys and girls achieving four honours and coming within the income categories.  The State will do the rest for this year and every year on.  I want to get away from the whole county conception, by the way.</P>

      <P>I would put a bet on that it will be from the very counties which were, and rightly so, so conscious of educational needs as to make more provision last year for their boys and girls in the form of excellent educational establishments, that the greatest intake will come of boys and girls to our new scheme.  I would guarantee that Monaghan, which has a very good record in regard to educational progress, excellent educational establishments, always one of the top counties in this respect, will have twice as many boys and girls next year as heretofore participating in our scheme and that counties like Monaghan will benefit enormously, and that it will be from any county that has been a frontliner or a pace-setter in regard to higher education that the greatest number of boys and girls will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> Deputy Dillon is well aware&mdash;better than I am&mdash;of the small farming population you have in Monaghan: 90 per cent of them will qualify for the maximum grant.  It is to counties like Monaghan, Leitrim, Donegal, the poorer counties of Ireland, that the greatest benefit will accrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not arguing about the method of financing this scheme.  We are prepared to accept that the outlay of local authorities may be called in to aid the Exchequer to finance this scheme.  I think the Minister rightly says that what they did in past years is really irrelevant because the aim is now to make secondary education available to all eligible children, wherever they live.  Can you imagine the exasperation of responsible public representatives on the vocational education committee and on the county council in Monaghan, who have stuck their necks out to get the rates to provide the educational facilities they thought were within their ability to finance, learning now that the children in Monaghan will enjoy exactly the same facilities as the children in Leitrim?</P>
      <P>The average county councillor comes to me and says: &ldquo;Put it the other way round: the children in Leitrim are going to enjoy the same facilities as the children in Monaghan.  We have been bearing the heat and burden of the day for several years and the Minister admits it, trying to push him forward into providing the kinds of standards of education we thought the children ought to have.  We are actually spending nearly three times a year what they are spending in Longford and the reward for that is that we are told now that although that is all irrelevant, in perpetuity we are to be placed on the same level as the cute operators in Longford, Leitrim, Louth, Carlow, Sligo, Clare, Wicklow, Donegal, Cavan, Waterford, Offaly, Kildare, Westmeath, Roscommon, Wexford, Tipperary (North Riding), Mayo, Laois, and Kilkenny who in the past bore a much smaller burden for education.&rdquo;  What will I say to them?</P>

      <P>It lays down the categorical principle, but if we are passing the Money Resolution for the money to be provided, surely we ought to know what quantity of money is to be provided?  The money to be provided is the difference between what this frozen sum yields and the Exchequer contribution.  I do not mind if anybody wants to discuss it on section 3.  I have made my case, and, I think, an unanswerable case.  The Minister is simply saying that it is administratively convenient to adhere to the present direction.  He nods his head in assent.  I think that is awfully bad politics in the highest sense of the word.  It is our function here, Ministers and Deputies, to see that administrative convenience does not override what we consider to be social justice.</P>

      <P>The head of the British Civil Service recently was interviewed on the BBC television and was asked did he not find it a great trial because of his Civil Service career to be dealing with amateur politics.  He said that was the greatest tripe he ever listened to, that he never met an amateur politician, that he served under a number of Ministers and none of them was ever an amateur politician.  It is right for the civil servants to say to the Minister: &ldquo;Administratively, this is the <Col N="378" /> way to do it.&rdquo;  I am putting it to the Minister that he ought to say: &ldquo;Perhaps you are right but socially this is the way I want it done.  I want to carry everybody with me.&rdquo;  I am warning the Minister, and I am trying to help him to carry everybody with him, to bring them in in good faith and to make them feel that they are getting a fair deal.  I warn the Minister that if he persists in an administrative system which places on a congested area like Monaghan the heaviest burden in perpetuity, exceeded only by Dublin, Kildare, Limerick, Tipperary South Riding and Meath, this will cause a lot of dissatisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give you that answer off the cuff.  We are concerned with the psychology of this matter.  We are going to have a perennial grievance whereas if there is a level poundage on every county, be it 1d, 1½d, 2d or whatever it is, there will be no grievance.  I believe that is the way to carry the people into this scheme whereby they will feel they want to co-operate and also feel they are getting a fair deal.  You can only have such if every ratepayer is asked to pay 1d, 2d, 3d or whatever it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the method of calculation suggested by the Minister may be administratively right but I do not think it is politics in the highest sense of that word, or psychologically right.  It is the function of the Minister to say to his administrators: &ldquo;Maybe you are right; maybe administratively this is right. But I am the political head of the Department and it is my function to bring the people with me in this matter.  I believe this is the right way to go about it and accordingly I would prefer to do it this way&rdquo;.  I believe it is right to level off the contribution from every county, to make it the same and not to have different contributions from every county.  As far as the local authorities are concerned, they know they are making a contribution to the national scheme.  If you are going to levy three times as much on Monaghan <Col N="379" /> as you levy on Longford, there will be an annual approach to the Minister for Education about it, whereas if everybody is paying 1d or 2d as the local authorities contribution towards the national cost of expanding the educational system, this will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that levying this 1d in the pound will be equitable at all because we all know that the places where the 1d in the pound produces very little are the places where most people will qualify for scholarships.  Counties like Meath and those mentioned by Deputy Dillon are counties where the 1d in the pound produces a much more substantial sum and those are the places where fewer children have in the past availed of scholarships.  We have had experience in some counties where all the money provided for scholarships was not taken up by actual scholarships.  Indeed, the Department by way of special grant came to the rescue of counties where the 1d in the pound produced very little by way of special grants over and above those available in the country at large.  The system now being suggested by Deputy Dillon of levelling off the contribution on the basis of a 1d in the pound would not be a valid one at all.  It would cut across what has been done in the past and would, I think, provide moneys in certain quarters that would not be fully taken up in scholarships.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The criterion we have to follow is the question of apprenticeship.  If the courses being pursued are whole-time courses, we will bring them in under it but if there is an apprenticeship element involved, obviously this is not a university degree or equivalent to a university degree.  A person apprenticed in an accountant's office, being paid and doing an accountancy course at the same time and not at a university, could not come under it.  It is a part-time course.</P>

It may not be necessary, in order to follow an advanced course in a technological college either here or in Northern Ireland, to have four university subjects and it may not <Col N="391" /> be practicable to get them.  I should like to see provision for this rather than have it tied to four university subjects.  I wonder if the Minister would consider this in order to help people who will not have four university subjects to follow higher technological education either in the Republic or in Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not applied his mind to the problems that will arise?  Take the question of chartered accountancy.  There are two categories of qualified accountants here and in Great Britain and there are reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain which are very valuable.  One is the ACA and the other is a certified accountant.  There are two methods of approaching that qualification.  You can either go to the university and get a BA, B.Comm or any other degree and then you do three years apprenticeship in the course of which you do two examinations prescribed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which is a common body to these two islands without reference to Partition or anything else.  Or you can approach the qualification of ACA by doing a five-year course of apprenticeship to an Associate of the Chartered Accountants plus a prescribed course of lectures in Rathmines Technical School, or UCD or UCC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an articled clerk, as they are called, is in a position to get articled to a relatively wealthy office, he may receive during the period he is articled an incremental scale which may rise from something like £100 to £400 or £500 a year.  But the number of such offices in a position to pay such scales is very limited and the relatively poor man's son finds himself usually articled to a small office or to an individual who may not be able to pay any scale at all.  If the criteria outlined by the Minister are to apply, it means hereafter that nobody can become a chartered accountant who does not either get into a fashionable office or has not a rich father.  I recognise that these are anomalies and problems presenting themselves which want careful investigation. I am perfectly certain there are <Col N="392" /> many people in the Department of Education who are familiar with them if their minds were directed to them, but I have the horrible, uncomfortable feeling that we are barging into this business without any real appreciation of the anomalies and difficulties that are going to arise.</P>
    <P>Our whole object is to provide everybody, without reference to their parents' income, with an equal opportunity of access to higher education and the professional qualifications flowing therefrom.  If the Minister's criteria apply, it is going to have the reverse effect.  Anyone who goes in for a BA, whether it is in psychology or sociology, is as safe as houses.  We have at present the Sorbonne and Nanterre packed to the roofs with students of psychology and sociology until de Gaulle says: &ldquo;What in the name of God are we going to do with 2,000 psychologists a year and 3,000 sociologists a year?  Where will we put them?  How will be employ them?&rdquo;</P>

The astonishing thing is that we are going to make provision for the traditional degree commonly known in bureaucratic circles in India, where an application is made, signed &ldquo;Abram Singh, failed BA&rdquo;.  He also is provided for.  He can proceed free of charge to the dignified position of &ldquo;failed BA&rdquo;.

      <P>There are more ways than one of acquiring a higher technological education.  It does not necessarily mean that apprenticeship must be excluded from the programme of a higher technological institution.  I suggest to the Minister that he should examine this whole question very closely again, and approach with an open mind this question of whether <Col N="395" /> young men and young women with technological qualifications for a profession should be forced to have a university degree.  I think he will find there is a wide divergence of views amongst those best qualified to judge as to which is the best method of approach. It is not by any means a unanimous view that it is necessary to have an academic degree plus an abbreviated technical course.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a specific question in regard to the habitual practice in the county which I represent which arises under section 1.  I want to know whether section 1, paragraph (b), &ldquo;any other institution in so far as it provides courses leading to qualifications which are, in the opinion of the Minister, equivalent to university degrees&rdquo;, will cover the Magee College, in Derry, and Queen's College in Belfast.</P>

      <P>I most sincerely and earnestly press upon the Minister that he should not allow himself to be persuaded without further and better inquiry into the belief that for any qualification such as ACA or architecture, it is essential to have a university degree.  People are being educated in architecture in Bolton Street, which is a very highly thought of institute.</P>

      <P>ACA is a qualification which I think it is very important to <Col N="396" /> encourage in this country because it will be very badly needed in the years that lie ahead.  It has the inestimable advantage that it is a qualification which is internationally recognised, and it gives young men a chance to travel the world and get some experience and bring it back home if they do not elect to live permanently abroad.  If it transpires that the Institute sets a standard of stipend for articled clerks, and if it is not found possible to get that stipend in some smaller offices in which the sons of certain poor men may be, will provision be made to ensure that such persons are not left to carry the burden of which it is our purpose to relieve them, simply because we have excluded the whole ACA course on the ground that the Institute of Chartered Accountants have recommended a scale of stipend which ought to be sufficient to facilitate the parents in meeting the cost of this education?</P>

      <P>I want to clarify the position about teacher training.  The Minister probably has in mind the integration of teacher training with university courses in the very near future, but I am concerned about the disadvantageous position in which teacher training will be this year <i>vis-à-vis</i> the facilities available for pupils under the scheme.  The best a student teacher can hope for is a loan to enable him to pay the expenses of his training.  He has to guarantee that he will teach within the State for a period of five years.  There are no such ties on students if they opt for a university course under the scheme.  This is the position this year and perhaps next year.  Until such time as the whole position of teacher training within the university complex is clarified, teacher training will suffer a <Col N="397" /> great disadvantage.  Up to now we have had the cream of our people in the teaching profession.  All Parties agree that there is a need to provide better education facilities for our boys and girls.  We must start at the base.  If teacher training is defective, the whole edifice is in danger.  I would ask the Minister to make special provision for this and to equate it with the other courses which the Bill covers.</P>

This is bureaucracy gone mad.  This House is being asked to give absolute discretion, without any brake, to the Minister to make any place he wishes an approved institution.  We could reach the day when a Minister might suddenly decide that because his cousin wanted to go to a certain place, it should become an approved institution.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished on this business of people ordinarily resident in the functional area.  In his discussion on the last section, the Minister said these grants would apply to persons going, for instance, to Magee College and would be granted to persons who were ordinarily resident within the area of the State.  I understand there was a situation in Donegal&mdash;Deputy Cunningham may be of more assistance than I am in this matter&mdash;in the administration of scholarship schemes in the past whereby, while they awarded normally their scholarships on the results of the <Col N="403" /> leaving certificate, they held a special examination for Donegal students attending schools in Northern Ireland. If a person from any part of Donegal or, say Monaghan, Cavan or Louth, any Border county, for some good reason attends a school within the functional area of the Six Counties&mdash; Queen's is open and Magee is open and ultimately Coleraine&mdash;when will he get a chance to do the leaving certificate, supposing the GCE or other qualifying examinations are held at the same time?</P>
      <P>I think there is a real difficulty here which must be resolved.  If people are to have available grants for Queen's, Magee, Coleraine or Dublin and are going to school in Northern Ireland&mdash; Deputy Cunningham will probably be able to elaborate on this; I have only been giving the bones of the situation &mdash;it seems to provide real difficulty in the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 7 was designed to provide that regulations under the Act shall be laid before each House and I think that is standard.  What I want is an opportunity for the House to discuss the regulation if it so wishes rather than be bound by simple regulations sent out by the Department over which we would have no control and which we would probably have to make the subject matter of Parliamentary Questions with the usual unsatisfactory results.</P>
      <P>As regards means, while again my amendments have been ruled out of order, I am not satisfied that this means test will operate fairly.  If one looks at the chart, say, for a person who is not normally resident in or adjacent to a university town, as far as I can see here, on an income of between £2,000 and £2,100, he must have five children before he gets £50.  I am not quite clear, and I am genuinely seeking information, as to whether that £50 would be applicable only, say, to the fifth child&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> It is not as bad as it looks.  In the unlikely event, then, of a man with just £2,000 a year living away from a university and having five children at the university at the same time, he would get £250?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <P>The persons are within the appropriate age limit prescribed from time to time by the Minister, and, The persons comply with such other requirements as may from time to time be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not told us anything about age limits but I understand that the Department, in an effort to be helpful, have sent a kind of specimen around to local authorities on which they may base proposed schemes.  I understand the age of 18 is suggested in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  This raises another question I think the Minister should look at before he comes back to us with this Bill.  It is this: I have here a copy of this specimen scheme which the Department sent out.  In it there is a reference to attendance and to the fact that a candidate must comply with the entrance requirements laid down by the university or other institution of higher education which the candidate wishes to attend.  It says that the candidate must have passed the leaving certificate examination for 1968 and secured honours in at least four matriculation subjects in that examination. I think that is a bit severe.  I have had a lot of letters and I am sure the Minister has had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have had other correspondence dealing with different cases.  Much of it deals with students who are already in the universities.  That was why I put down this amendment which has been ruled out of order to enable this scheme to date back to the academic year 1964.  I appreciate that this could impose a potential charge on the Exchequer but I do not think it is any harm to throw these things out.  All these students point out the distinction that is made in relation to university grants starting this year and the way in which the post-primary education position was handled by giving education free to all then in attendance as well as those coming in last year.  There seems to be a different principle operating for those attending secondary schools from that which it is now proposed to apply. I suppose it is money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the people would object&mdash;I certainly would not&mdash;to getting money by taxation to provide assistance for students who are already in the university and qualify for it.  I do not think the people would object to it.  It would not amount to very much and it would be a decreasing charge, because those people who are already there would be moving along; payment in respect of them would be getting smaller and would eventually diminish entirely.</P>
      <P>That is all I want to say, but I am keen on the insertion of the words &ldquo;by regulation&rdquo; so that we would have an opportunity of discussing it if we so desire.  If it seems necessary to any Member of the House to discuss it, we have it there in the regulation to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise a question earlier on some of the points which Deputy Lindsay has just made. <Col N="407" /> The first point is a very good one, that secondary education covers all the existing pupils while it is proposed to confine the free university education to those who will be doing the examination this year.  I should like the Minister to explain how he ties this up with the proposal to have the money already paid for university education included in the amount of money being expended, because some of that money pays for the students who are already at the university.  Would the Minister say how he proposes to take this into account on one side and not take into account the fact that these students are attending.  It means that those who got four honours and did not get a university scholarship are being left out.  If existing students are to be covered, and I think they should be, we have got to face up to any additional taxation that may be necessary.  It is not a big problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not do it in respect of those who have got four honours?  I know of two cases in my own constituency, who have gone to the university with four honours but who did not get a university scholarship and who this year must terminate their studies because their parents&mdash;in one case a widowed mother and in the other, a small farmer&mdash;are unable to continue the payments necessary.</P>

      <P>It is said that university students should be allowed to study during the summer holidays, but I do not think it does one bit of harm to a boy or girl to learn what it is to have to earn a living.  It may come in useful afterwards when they are in charge of people like that.  There are cases where students must terminate their studies, even though they are brilliant, because they have not got the <Col N="408" /> necessary money.  It would be unfair to ask the Minister for a snap decision, but I think he should consider it before he goes any further.  There is another point about which there was a lot of head shaking when I asked a question earlier today, the question of students who got four honours last year but who did not get Irish.  If that student does the examination and gets Irish, will he qualify?</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the closing date for applications which a number of local authorities have announced.  The Minister has indicated that he intends to consider the tenability of scholarships in the rest of the country as well as in the Republic, on which I congratulate him.  However, as regards those in secondary schools who are normally resident in the Republic but attend schools in Northern Ireland, it has not been clear from the Bill that they will be eligible to sit for the leaving certificate and qualify for a scholarship.  I think the Minister has indicated to me and to others that they will be eligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay raised another problem.  As the Minister will be aware, his Department sanctioned a special examination; in other words we had the problem of Donegal people attending schools in Northern Ireland, and I am sure the same applied in Monaghan, Cavan and Louth, the other border counties where secondary education was received in schools, colleges and convents in Northern Ireland.  We had the special examination for them because in many cases the date of the GCE clashed with the date of the leaving certificate.  This will happen again, and there is no good in the Minister saying they are eligible to get these university scholarships but they must do the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can picture somebody who has spent five or six years at school in Northern Ireland as a day boy or girl or boarder.  He does not want to forgo the examination for which he has been studying, the GCE, and he cannot possibly do the leaving certificate.  This is going to create a problem but this problem was created before and was dealt with by the Department sanctioning an examination that would be acceptable to them, an examination which was, in the case of Donegal, arranged by the local authority.  The concession is of no use unless this is done.  The only thing I can suggest at <Col N="410" /> the moment is that he accepts the standards of whatever examination they do, whether it be the GCE, or O Levels or indeed if he is not satisfied with O Levels, then A Levels, the advanced levels, and doing as has been done before, having a special examination based on the leaving certificate standard.</P>
    <P>I should also like to support those speakers who advocated that scholarships should be available to those in the university and especially to those who did the leaving certificate last year. The amount of money which would be required to allow people in the university to complete either one, two or three years&mdash;three would possibly be a fair average, although there might be those who would have to complete four or five years&mdash;would not be very great but it would satisfy all of us who have been asking for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Lindsay regarding subjects, you have to have four honours in leaving certificate subjects. It is not fair to penalise students who were studying subjects which were not recognised as matriculation subjects. That was due to the lack of liaison between the university and the Department.  It is unfair to lay the blame for this on the students.  There is a college in my own county where general science is a subject recognised by the Department as of great importance but it is not recognised as a university or matriculation subject.  The students in this college have studied that subject for their leaving certificate and many of them are depending on it as a fourth subject.  It is too late in the day now for them to change over to some science subject like botany or physics.  They have done a general course embracing all those subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least for this year, the Minister should recognise that subject as one of the four subjects necessary for qualification in the university grant scheme. As we know, this scheme came in lately, and possibly the Department did not advert to the fact that in particular colleges, subjects were taken perhaps two or three years ago and students <Col N="411" /> who have pursued studies in a subject like general science will find themselves at a disadvantage in that general science cannot be presented as a subject for the leaving certificate with a view to securing a scholarship.  Perhaps the Minister might accept it for this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will go on to deal with another matter raised by Deputy Tully and Deputy Lindsay. They appealed to the Minister to accept people who failed to qualify last year because, in one case, they did not succeed in passing Latin, and in another case, Irish.  I take it that if those pupils had passed those subjects they would now be in the university. Representations have been made to me to include people in the 1967 leaving certificate examination, their grounds for not being in the university being that they could not afford to go there but they have the necessary four honours.  There is a better case for including those people than the people mentioned by Deputy Tully and Deputy Lindsay.  I see difficulties right away, in that this could include a very big group.  I suppose that this would largely involve a question of money, but if it could possibly be done, it might be found that there were not so many as a number of them would in the meantime have accepted jobs and settled into them.  I would ask the Minister to consider this and see if he can include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case has been made for students in the university at present and it was suggested that they should be helped. We would all agree with that and I suppose the Minister would also agree with it.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a point about the subjects recognised by the universities and this is a matter which should be tidied up by the <Col N="412" /> Department and the universities.  My view is that whatever subjects the Department asks the pupils to be examined in should be accepted by the university.  If this matter is not settled, it will become an annual problem for debate here.  If the situation continues, there will be the odd pupil with an aptitude in one or two particular subjects who will find himself or herself going for the leaving certificate and having got four honours, being told that one subject is not accepted by the university.  We should clear away now all these little anomalies which might arise in the future.  Because of the new approach to education, the new orientation between the Department and the university, all these little points should be tidied up now. At the moment art is not accepted as a matriculation subject.  I know one or two pupils who have a particular aptitude for art and they are at a disadvantage and I would appeal to the Minister to clear up this problem for the future.</P>

      <P>I am on the regulations. The point made by the Minister is a very good point.  We are going through a transitional period and it would be better to have as much flexibility as possible.  Regulations are very essential for the guidance of society, but we are breaking new ground here and, judging by the points made by Deputy Lindsay, Deputy Tully and Deputy Cunningham, the Minister has a good case.  He has implied that he will consider these things.  I have the same types of cases as those mentioned. We would not be slow in asking the Minister to go further back, but he would need more money and he is completely tied by finance in all this.  I know, too, that no matter how far back he may try to go, he will displease someone.  In the case made by Deputy Lindsay, where a person has not gone to university but is still studying a particular subject, that is exactly where the Minister can be flexible, provided <Col N="414" /> he is not tied too much by regulations. We would all like to give all students at university the same status in the same way as we have given the same status to secondary school pupils.  The Minister has assured us that he has gone as far as he can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be retrograde at all.

I do not like this matter of turning out different forms&mdash;1, 2, 3 and 1a and 1b.  They pile up and multiply to the disadvantage of everybody concerned, whereas, if we had regulations, with a saving clause in respect of anything in relation to which the Minister wants to have a saving clause, then the Minister can have that.  But I should like to think that Parliament in voting moneys for this purpose should be free to question the regulations made for the purpose of spending those moneys.

I have been ruled so much out of order in other amendments that I feel very strongly that this is so much in order and so much in line with what social justice requires that we should have this regulation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary try to explain why a letterbox, two miles from the nearest post office and doing no harm to anybody, which was in fact used by a lot of people in the area&mdash;in particular, two families had posted one letter a day in it&mdash;had to be taken away?  I <Col N="420" /> do not think it involved a detour of a mile on the part of the postman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having facilities is one thing and using them is another.  Some of what the Deputy has said is correct. On examination of the position there, the indications are that there were seven items posted in the letterbox per week&mdash;one per day.  Therefore, one of the persons who claimed he used it once a day was probably right.  I do not think it is justifiable to reroute a van a distance of one mile, six furlongs for the sake of collecting this one letter per day, the average posting.  The Deputy asked why the box was removed and my explanation was that it was not used sufficiently.  I do not think he can seriously suggest that the rerouting of a van a distance of one mile six furlongs for the sake of one letter would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that seven letters a week were posted there.  Two people may have posted one on the same day. There is the fact that this box had been there for a long time and it involved simply that a post office van took a round of roughly an Irish mile. I understood that all the people of the country are entitled to posting facilities from the Post Office.  They are paying stamps.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he will agree to allow the box to be re-used for a period of, say, three months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that even though this box went out of commission some time ago, at the time it was taken out of commission, another box was erected in another area served by this van, an area where the need was greater.  There would have to be a complete changeover of time schedules and all that kind of thing in order to change this.  I think the Deputy is being a little unreasonable in suggesting that there is justification for restoring this box for the immediate use that was being made of it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what steps he proposes to take to deal with the present serious position regarding skim milk in the creamery areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Within the past year, the prices for skim milk powder on export markets have declined from the high levels obtaining for some years previously, with consequential repercussions on the prices which creameries and powder manufacturers can pay for skim milk. However, in a number of areas where there has been some reorganisation of the creamery industry and diversification of production has advanced, it has so far been possible to maintain skim milk prices at levels which are not far below those ruling twelve months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Production of skim milk powder during the period 1st April to 14th May this year has in fact shown an increase of 7½ per cent over the corresponding period in 1967 and, notwithstanding the current difficulties on export markets, total sales of skim milk powder from factories over the <Col N="424" /> same period were nearly twice as high in 1968 as in 1967.</P>
    <P>With the expansion in milk production, the quantity of skim milk becoming available has, of course, increased. However, skim milk powder manufacture accounts for only about one-fourth of the total skim milk supply. Most of the skim milk is used as it has traditionally been used, for the feeding of livestock.  There can be no doubt that in present circumstances it is more profitable for farmers to use skim milk for feeding calves and pigs rather than to sell it for powder manufacture. Indeed, present difficulties in regard to the disposal of skim milk seem to apply mainly in areas where pigs are not kept in substantial numbers and where many calves are disposed of shortly after birth.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the best way of relieving such problems as exist in relation to the disposal of skim milk is to have the maximum quantities used for livestock feeding, especially for pigs.  In line with recommendations made by the National Agricultural Council at its meeting earlier this week I am asking creameries, in collaboration with the advisory services, to take steps to organise, where necessary, the distribution of skim for this purpose. Intensive publicity measures are also being undertaken to bring home to farmers the value of the product for livestock feed.  Other matters which I have under consideration include the possibility of arrangements for low-cost bulk distribution of skim milk for livestock feeding and also greater utilisation of skim powder for that purpose on the home market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why the full capacity of the milk drying plants is not being used at the moment and why this skim is not being taken up for that purpose and stored in the circumstances of the present time to enable it to be fed to livestock in dry form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one little snag about that, the cost of conversion. The actual cost of converting skim into powder is as high as £40 a ton and this obviously should be avoided, if at all possible, in the interests of the <Col N="425" /> economy of our farmers.  It costs £40 right away to convert a ton, not to mention storage, transport and so forth.  It is a very big figure and I am having it investigated to see whether there is any way in which this could be reduced, whether the time factor would have anything to do with it, so that we could reduce the actual conversion costs substantially from roughly £40 a ton.  If this were on, it might give us an opening for making and distributing the powder.  But to make the powder at that cost, I think, can be clearly seen to be not a very attractive proposition.</P>
      <P>In so far as the plant utilisation is concerned, I am not aware of what plants are not utilising their plant to the degree that they might or with what consequences, if this is so, in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the full capacity of the drying plants is not being used at all.  In the circumstances of the present time, would the Minister not consider, even though it does cost £40 a ton to dry, that for the sake of the future of the milk industry it might be worth considering doing this?</P>
      <P>I should like also to ask the Minister what is being done to push sales of cream in England.  Is there any possibility of that because we seem to be slipping rather than improving in sales of cream?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Getting back to the skim milk, the fact is, and this may be a surprise to many, that whatever may be said about utilisation of the existing plants to the full, this season we have been utilising 7½ per cent more skim than we did in the same period last year and our sales of skim are, in fact, for the same period, from the beginning of April up to date, twice what they were in the same period last year.</P>

The position is that skim milk is being sent home to farmers who have not pigs or calves to feed it to and this is the reason why it is a problem.</P>

      <P>I am quite well aware of the difficulties of farmers in this matter but it should not be put out from here that this is a matter which has followed on what happened perhaps 12 months ago.  It should also be fully and clearly understood that the manufacture of powder and so forth is a matter that has developed over the years by way of processing as a byproduct of this skim milk and that we have at no stage discouraged the keeping of pigs or calves.  Possibly over the past 12 months I can say I have encouraged people to keep such animals. They have been given a further encouragement, particularly in regard to pigs, in the recent Budget in that we have provided a substantial sum, an additional £1 million.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there have been a substantial number of accidents on this road.  An Foras Forbartha is at present engaged on an analysis of accidents on all major routes, including this section of road.  However, it is clear that the volume of traffic, being high in relation to the capacity of the road, is the major factor.</P>
      <P>As to remedial measures apart from major road works, these are mainly a matter for the local authorities.  Thus public lighting is the responsibility entirely of the local authorities.  The provision of traffic lights and pedestrian crossings is a matter for the local authority concerned, acting at the request or with the consent of the Garda Commissioner.  I understand that the need for pedestrian crossings at Collinstown Cross and Turnapin Lane has been examined and that it has been decided that in present circumstances the provision of crossings at these sites would not be warranted. I understand that the county council have certain proposals for traffic lights under consideration.</P>
      <P>As regards speed limits, the present speed limits in Dublin city and county were reviewed only last year.  They will be reviewed in the near future, and their application to this road, as well as to other routes, will be considered.</P>

In the light of the fact that Dublin Corporation have submitted a series of new letting regulations designed to bring housing allocation more into conformity with the demands of the present day, would the Minister look at this case, having in mind the new regulations which merely await sanction from his Department, and with a view to having human treatment accorded to those two very unfortunate people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the protection of Their Majesties, within the precincts of Trinity College as well as elsewhere, rested with the Garda Síochána and the invitation extended to Their Majesties to visit the College involved the acceptance by the College authorities of the presence of the gardaí there.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to go into the general question of the powers of the Garda Síochána to enter private property.</P>
      <P>The precise arrangements for Garda protection were discussed beforehand with the College authorities and, although there was positive reason to fear that some attempt was going to be made to stage some kind of incident, the Garda decided that the main group of members on duty could remain outside the grounds unless they were needed.  As it happens, members of the escort party did, in fact, send for reinforcements from outside the grounds, but order had been restored before the reinforcements arrived and they were in no way whatsoever involved in what occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise this, partly to correct some reports to the contrary but mainly because it puts what occurred in perspective.  The total number of gardaí on escort duty was ten, namely, one inspector, one sergeant and eight other members, so that, at the very most, only ten gardaí can have been involved.  Moreover, batons were not drawn.  It is clear, therefore, if only from the small numbers taking part, <Col N="440" /> that the cry of police brutality against the demonstrators is just the usual catchcry raised whenever the police are forced to intervene against certain types of demonstrators.</P>
    <P>What I think has to be taken more seriously is the attitude of some critics who, while admitting that the allegations of police brutality are unjustified, make the case that the gardaí were wrong in interfering with what has been described as a &ldquo;peaceful demonstration&rdquo; and that it was this allegedly unjustified Garda intervention that caused the trouble.</P>
    <P>There are two points to be made in reply to that particular allegation.  The first is that, even if it were true that the demonstrators did nothing more than hoist a banner of a grossly insulting nature in the face of a foreign Head of State who had come here on a State visit&mdash;and it is freely admitted that they did that much&mdash;their action would of its very nature, stand condemned as an action calculated to lead to a breach of the peace and, on that basis alone, the Garda would have been fully justified in intervening.  In fact, however, there was very much more to it than that.  Before the incident took place, a crowd of students had already drawn up near the College Library, awaiting the arrival of the Royal Party.  These students were orderly.  Then, suddenly, a small group, numbering perhaps ten students, were noticed by the gardaí rushing forward from another part of the grounds, shouting, booing and using offensive language.  It was quite clear that they intended to break through the lines of students already assembled and to intercept the Royal Party at the Library steps.  In fact their intention to do so was being loudly announced by at least one of their members in very plain, even if obscene, terms.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the gardaí who saw these people rushing forward, who heard their language and had some knowledge beforehand of their outlook &mdash;which they certainly made no secret of&mdash;there was an immediate and serious danger that the Royal Party would not only be grossly insulted but physically molested either by a direct assault or by the throwing of something at them. <Col N="441" /> It was the clear duty of the escort to restrain these people physically and this is what they did.  It may very well be that most of those already in the vicinity of the Library were unaware of what had been happening and were under the impression that it was a question of the gardaí attempting to remove the banner.  As I have already said, I would defend the right of the gardaí to remove a grossly offensive banner had they decided to do so, but, as a fact, they were far less concerned about the banner than about the protection of the Royal couple from the danger of molestation and any struggle involving the banner was quite incidental.</P>
    <P>Those who have criticised the Garda would do well to ask themselves what the people of this country would have thought and said about the Garda if they had permitted these distinguished State guests to be physically molested. Even more to the point, the critics might ask themselves what action the people of this country might demand, in their indignation, in order to vindicate the good name of this country, had such a gross outrage been actually perpetrated by this small clique.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see the police distributed <Col N="442" /> properly in relation to their primary duty of preventing and detecting crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing his mind to that question, will the Minister, with the experience of rural life he has, bear closely in mind that the primary duty of the Garda Síochána is the prevention of crime and that their presence in a peaceful area has often been the reason for the protracted peaceful atmosphere there obtaining, and will he resolve, further, that he will not be induced to close Garda stations simply because the area has acquired the reputation of being a peaceful area when, in fact, those of us with local knowledge know that that reputation arose very largely from the fact that there has always been a Garda station, however small, in the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of gardaí allocated to beat and patrol duty in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, including suburban areas, is varied as required by circumstances and I am satisfied that the Garda authorities are making the most effective use of the manpower and police equipment at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three patrol cars additional to the <Col N="443" /> existing 73 are being allocated to the suburbs in the near future.  The issue of personal radio sets is being extended to gardaí operating in most suburban areas and this will add considerably to the effectiveness of Garda patrols.</P>
    <P>On the subject of vandalism, I wish to repeat what was said in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 20th March, that is, that minor incidents of malicious damage are particularly difficult to detect except where members of the public are willing to come forward with information.  Even a substantial increase in Garda strength at enormous cost would be unlikely to make much difference in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will bear in mind that the request in the question was for the provision of gardaí on motor cycle patrols or on foot and not for the provision of additional cars? Is the Minister aware that in the public mind there is considerable uneasiness that housebreaking and vandalism are on the increase and that this is associated with the withdrawal of gardaí from the beat?  As in the case of rural Ireland, where the presence of Garda stations may help to maintain peace, in urban areas the presence of more gardaí on walking patrol would probably have the effect of discouraging vandalism and housebreaking, even the cases of minor vandalism the Minister has referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite accept that view.  In a modern police force, the more mobile they are, with new communications, the more effective they are.  I was rather disappointed to find out in relation to vandalism that there is not as much public cooperation as I would like to see by people who know those involved.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he proposes to withdraw quota protection from any industry in addition to the footwear industry; and, if so, what other industries will be affected and when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the fact, made known following the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, that quantitative import restrictions on hose of silk or artificial silk, brushes, laminated springs and sparking plugs are to be eliminated on 1st July, 1975, and on electric filament lamps on 1st July, 1971.  Quantitative import restrictions on motor tyres of British manufacture which were terminated on 1st July, 1966, were reimposed with the agreement of the British Authorities for a period of 18 months ending on 31st December, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an assurance that the industries to which he has referred will not be subjected to the same kind of treatment now facing the footwear industry&mdash;in other words that they will not be brought ahead of the date mentioned in the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misinformed in regard to the footwear industry.  What has happened is that an extra two-year period has been put on the time until they will have to do without the quota.  It is not a question of taking away the quota earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many people feel that he is going too far too fast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that in any industry there would be some people who would feel that about the removal of any protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>45.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the danger which threatens the Irish footwear industry from the dumping of footwear from Britain and other countries, if the present method of protection is withdrawn; and what <Col N="454" /> steps he proposes to take to deal effectively with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in the situation envisaged in the question and despite the customs duty which would then operate, imports of &ldquo;dumped&rdquo; footwear should occur which would cause or threaten to cause material injury to the Irish footwear industry such imports could be dealt with either under existing legislation or under the provisions of the anti-dumping Bill, at present before the Oireachtas, which I hope will be enacted shortly.</P>
      <P>I would, however, refer the Deputy to my reply yesterday to a number of questions regarding the footwear quota. In that reply I indicated, <i>inter alia,</i> that I have decided to initiate further consultations with the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is the position that a foreign importer can import into this country an unlimited amount of footwear provided he pays the import duty, without regard to the volume of goods, and without regard to the harm those goods may be doing to the home trade?  Is the Minister satisfied that the anti-dumping regulations will be effective in such circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The anti-dumping legislation applies where there is dumping and irrespective of the volume.  It is subject to two tests which I will mention in a moment.  One is that the goods are being sold here at a price lower than the price on the home market of the goods, and secondly that the sale of those goods on our market is causing or is likely to cause material injury to the industry here.  Consequently the volume of goods comes into the latter part: where it is likely to cause material injury.  Subject to that there is no question of the volume of goods being a deciding factor in dumping. The major factor is the question of the price at which the goods are sold, or if they are causing or threatening to cause material injury to the industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the position is that the actual dumping <Col N="455" /> takes place and the Minister will be unable to invoke the anti-dumping regulation until this dumping is actually brought to his attention by the appropriate commission or some interested party or parties in the trade concerned?  In those circumstances will the Minister not agree that quite an amount of harm, and perhaps irreparable harm, could be done to the industry or to a large segment of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  The Deputy will be aware of the fact that the anti-dumping legislation also contains a provision for the imposition in certain circumstances of retroactive levies.  The existence of this provision is, of course, a very valuable form of insurance so far as we are concerned, and any importer contemplating importing dumped goods runs the risk that this levy might be imposed after he has brought in the goods and paid for them in circumstances in which he would have to pay a substantial sum of money which he could not recover. Therefore, the risk of this would make any importer or potential importer of dumped goods look at the situation very carefully before he embarked on such a project.</P>
