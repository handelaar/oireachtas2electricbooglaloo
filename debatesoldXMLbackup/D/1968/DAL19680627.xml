      <P>Last night I was going into detail to explain that the reason for the Fourth Amendment was that from studies carried out by all political Parties, it was clear that Fianna Fáil would not have an overall majority after the next election.  I cited the fact, and perhaps it was not entirely politic to do so, that two members of our Party, men of considerable standing, experience and qualification, Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator Dooge, had carried out studies into this matter which were not alone related to constituencies and counties but in extreme detail down to electoral areas.  The result was that they decided that if everybody voted Party-wise as they did in the local elections, the result would be 65 seats for Fianna Fáil, 55 seats for Fine Gael and 25 for Labour, that is, taking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor am I suggesting a Coalition; I am suggesting something else on which I will dwell in detail during the next half hour or so.  The position then will be that Deputy Cosgrave will be proposed as Taoiseach, and unless there is some more of the hurly-burly which went on last time, the present Taoiseach will be proposed from the other side and no doubt Deputy Corish will also be proposed. When the referendum has been defeated, there will be 144 people voting here and it is upon them will lie the responsibility of deciding who shall be Taoiseach.  If they are conscientious and honest politically, as I know most of them are, it shall follow entirely on the question of policy: policy will decide.</P>
      <P>I was rather horrified by the Leader of the Labour Party using the word &ldquo;Coalition&rdquo; because Fianna Fáil's effort over a number of years has been to paint the two inter-Party Governments as Coalition Governments, as people who had subjugated their aims, ideals and policies in order to be in power.  That was not so.  I was not here for the first one but I was here for the second inter-Party Government and I was proud to go into the Division Lobbies and support them. Neither the Labour Party nor the Fine Gael Party subjugated one iota of their ideals, aims or policies at that time in order to remain in power.  In fact, the record of the Fianna Fáil Party has been that they were quick to run out of office when they felt they had not got the support of the country behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the next election, the people will inevitably be faced with the sight <Col N="1821" /> of politicians within the Parties deciding what policies they shall support. I hold that it is quite possible for any two Parties with a majority to come together and agree on a policy for five years which will include the maximum amount of their own policies that they can have included by negotiation.  If they can find it within their hearts to do this on that basis, there can be another inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for Local Government has gone to great pains many times during the debate on the Third Amendment and in this debate to cast slurs on what he calls the Coalition Governments, which were not Coalition Governments, it is perhaps wise that I should indicate what the reasons were for the downfall of the inter-Party Government on two occasions. One reason was that there were Independents kicking around the place at that time, and Parties which were decreasing in numbers and had no hope of forming a Government themselves in the future.  They were not, as the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party were, of old standing and of known policies, and the support within the Dáil was something that was at times questionable.  I suggest that in 1968 a similar position does not exist.  There are now three main Parties, with the Independents virtually wiped out, and the position is that it is absolutely open, on an agreed policy conforming to the policies of the two different Parties who might go into an inter-Party Government, and not a Coalition, to form an inter-Party Government after the next election.</P>
    <P>The reason we are having a referendum now is that Fianna Fáil see that the studies which have been carried out are correct and that the figures will be 65, 55 and 25.  I see Deputy G. Collins smiling over at me, but I will give him two figures which will set him back on his heels.  In 1954 I went as a young Deputy of Fine Gael to fight an election in one of the most difficult Fianna Fáil constituencies. The candidate at that time was an excellent candidate, Deputy Jones, the present Leas-Cheann Comhairle. At that time Fine Gael got 9,300 votes out of West Limerick.  As director of <Col N="1822" /> elections for Fine Gael, I fought against Deputy Gerry Collins in as friendly and vigorous a manner as I could and I took 3,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And what was Fianna Fáil's increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was nil.  I can give the figures.  The Deputy may be thinking of the increase on the previous general election.  Fianna Fáil had considerably more votes in 1955 than they had in 1967 and Fine Gael took 1,000 more votes out of it in 1967 as compared with 1955.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the pattern developing all over the country.  Let us face the fact.  Let us be honest and sincere about it.  The Labour Party did extremely well in both Cork and Limerick.  We did not do as well as we would have liked in Limerick city. Fianna Fáil had less than they like&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but let us look at the figures which have, so far, not been refuted.  If every Party had done as well in 1955 as they did last year, the situation would be 65, 55, 25.  There is the average.  Yesterday, on the debate on the vote for Industry and Commerce, I tried to give certain facets of Fine Gael policy which might be different from certain facets in the policies of other Parties. At the same time, I tried to show how we, a progressive Party, would have certain policies closely approximating to the policies of other Parties.  Where is the Fianna Fáil policy, whatever it is, allied to the policy of any other Party in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no Fianna Fáil majority at the next election; that is quite clear.  Let us remember, too, that on the occasion of the last referendum to abolish proportional representation, it was decided to run simultaneously the most noted politician in the country, if not the best loved politician, for the <Col N="1823" /> office of President.  He is President at the moment and far be it from me to denigrate him.  On the occasion to which I refer he was put forward for the office of President in the hope that the dual decision which had to be taken would result in the abolition of proportional representation because the people would be confused.  That failed.  On this occasion another dodge is being tried.  The Third and Fourth Amendments will be decided on together. The Third Amendment, if passed, will provide for the straight vote with 33? per cent tolerance.  I know the Third Amendment is not now under discussion and I merely refer to it <i>en passant.</i>  Mr. Justice Budd did not mention any five per cent but the Fianna Fáil Government, in order to get down to the butchery of constituencies, limited this tolerance to five per cent.  That is one end of the scale.  If you limit yourself at one end, you can carry out the subsequent butchery regardless and now they want absolutely limitless tolerance at the other end to enable them to carve up constituencies any way they like and create a situation whereby three Fine Gael or Labour votes could in any particular instance be mathematically proved to equal three Fianna Fáil votes.  That is not democracy.  That is putting Party first.  There was a leader of Fianna Fáil who said that Party came before Church and that he would go against the Church, if necessary, to keep his Party right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good.  My purpose this morning is simply to indicate the result after the next general election unless there is a landslide one way or the other, and Ireland is not noted for landslides.  I like to tell the story about what happened in Louth when the first couple of results happened to be against Fianna Fáil and a very astute Fianna Fáil county councillor and I were discussing the situation. I asked him how he thought things would go and he told me I need not worry.  He said: &ldquo;The way it is in Ireland, all we have to do is to wait until the good, ignorant republican constituents start to come in.&rdquo;  That is the philosophy.  It is known that the people will not swing and the purpose now is to establish a system of voting and a method of carving constituencies whereby Fianna Fáil will keep itself <Col N="1825" /> in office with as little as 43 per cent of the electorate.  Personally, I would not give a thrawneen about the system of election if the other issue were not stuck on to it.  But, because Ireland is not a place of swings, Fianna Fáil, irrespective of policies, irrespective of whether they do well or badly in Government, will be elected again.</P>

      <P>If we defeat this proposal in the referendum&mdash;and we shall&mdash;the position is quite simple: the Independents are gone and there are within this Dáil three Parties and then there will be the decision upon which the people here will vote to elect the Taoiseach and on that you will have a Government.  I pray and hope that the Taoiseach will not be a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and that the Government will not be a Fianna Fáil Government because the country would be well rid of the whole lot of them.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that Deputy Donegan is rather peeved having come up last night from County Louth expecting a vote which did not take place, thanks to the filibustering of his own Party and their allies in this contest.</P>
      <P>From listening to the speakers here in this debate one would imagine that there was something sinister about Fianna Fáil and the Government asking the people&mdash;mind you, the people &mdash;not Fine Gael or Labour, but the people&mdash;to decide what system of voting would best suit their country and, secondly, to do this for the second time in a period of a decade. Since this question was first voted on at a referendum some eight or nine years ago, many new voters have come on the register.  Is it the negation of democracy, as Deputy Donegan stated last night and this morning and as Deputy Larkin stated, to give these people an opportunity of deciding on the system we now have, whether it is the best system for the country, whether it is the best system to give this country a Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always regarded a general election as an exercise to find a Government for the country, but listening to the speakers from the Opposition benches, one would imagine that the purpose of an election is to return Deputies.  The people do not take that view.  The people regard a general election as an exercise for the purpose of forming a Government and giving that Government the power to rule and to govern and to initiate laws.  I <Col N="1827" /> was rather disillusioned to hear that that is not the purpose of a general election in the minds of the Opposition speakers.  What they would want is to break up, divide and make an election a divisive process whereby every minority, whether left or right, would have an opportunity of saying what they had to say instead of forming a Government.</P>
    <P>Here last night Deputy Gibbons stated that the proper way in which proportional representation should be operated was to make the whole country one electoral area and to have every opinion reflected in Deputies as they were returned to the Dáil, whether they were for this or that&mdash; anti-drink, pro-drink, tenants' associations, the Georgian Society&mdash;every one of them to be in here&mdash;and then you would get proportional representation and then you would get the kind of Government you want or that, apparently, the Opposition want.</P>
    <P>When the people go to vote at a general election, the primary purpose is to elect a Government and the secondary effect of an election is to select the best men to form that Government, some to be actual members of the Government, some to support.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, the present Government, have decided to give the people an opportunity of making up their minds on the electoral system for the second time in ten years and there is nothing wrong in that.  I heard it described last night as forcing it on the people, ramming it down their necks and all the rest of it.  It is the negation of democracy, we were told, to give the people an opportunity of deciding for themselves.  If the people do not vote the way we hope they will, well and good.  We are not trying to perpetuate ourselves in government, as we were told.  We did very well under the system now prevailing.  We have been in government for 30 years out of 36. We are told this new system will perpetuate us and I heard Deputy Donegan say this morning, regenerate us, that we are on our way down, on our way out.  We only won six out of seven recent by-elections but, apparently, the <Col N="1828" /> great victory that has been achieved in this country over the past few years is the election of a Fine Gael county council in Louth, of which Deputy Donegan has assured me he is the chairman.  I come from a county that has elected a Fianna Fáil county council and a Fianna Fáil chairman for 35 years and we do no bragging about it but when Fine Gael get it in Louth, through the aid of farming organisations and every mal-content in the country, that is supposed to be a great feat in Louth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did we introduce this proposed amendment of the Constitution at this juncture?  As the Constitution stands, it is incumbent on the Government to revise constituencies every 12 years in the light of the latest census returns.  The latest census returns show that there have been population movements.  So it is incumbent on the Minister for Local Government who is charged with the responsibility, to prepare, now or soon, a revision of constituencies and if there are any further changes in the population and if the constitutional position is not changed as we hope it will be, it will be necessary for another revision of constituencies to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> The time was opportune in the light of the constitutional obligation on the Minister to revise constituencies.  The time is opportune again, within a period of ten years since the last referendum, to give the people a chance to say: &ldquo;When is this thing going to stop?  Will there be changes in constituencies, new constituencies, after every census return and in the period of every 12 years?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that there should be some continuity in constituencies, that a person would not represent, say, South County Dublin at one election and South-East Dublin in another election, and so on&mdash;Dublin North-East, Dublin North-West&mdash;the lot of them&mdash;according as population movement takes place.  We think, first, that constituencies should be single member and, secondly, that there should be some continuity about constituencies. We also think that this system of the transferable vote in multi-member constituencies, if continued, will lead us into trouble time and again.  We have only to look at continental countries to see how they fare under PR.  Look at them now.  For five and a half months, there has been no Government in Italy, where they have PR.  Intrigue, bargaining and all the rest have been the order of the day.  Look at what has happened in France&mdash;the ganging up of smaller Parties not to rule but to put out a Government, not to give the people stability but to create disorder and divide.</P>

If you people over there see something wrong in it, believe it is not right or proper to consult the people on an important matter like this, I do not see anything wrong in it.  The people will decide. They will decide it is right and proper to have an electoral system that will give stability of government and enable Deputies representing single-seat constituencies, representing perhaps an area adjacent to where they live, to look after the people of that area to the best of their ability.  I speak as the Deputy for a constituency which must be one of the biggest geographically in the country, East Galway.  It is about 90 miles from north to south and 45 miles from east to west.  If the people of that constituency think their interests can be served better by having a Deputy nearer to them, whether it be a Fine Gael or a Fianna Fáil Deputy, rather than having them scattered all over the constituency and hard of access, they will decide for <Col N="1831" /> themselves what system suits them better, what system will give them better service and will give the Deputies themselves a better chance of looking after the interests of their constituents.</P>

      <P>The proposals in this Bill are the most important to come before this House for a long number of years.  I regard them definitely as a retrograde step.  No matter how Deputy Carty may whistle passing the graveyard, when this Bill comes before the people in a democratic way, they will reject it.  It is a blatant attempt to prevent Parliament being representative of the views of the people, because it will interfere with the legitimate rights of minorities. I am not alone in thinking that this Bill will be defeated when it comes before the people.  We know that the Fianna Fáil Cabinet were almost equally divided on it.  The Minister had to come in here week after week and speak at length to hold up the passage of the Bill in order to give the Fianna Fáil Cabinet time to come to a decision.</P>

Some of your Ministers had to thump the table and say they would not allow a vote at a meeting, although we were assured by Fianna Fáil that morning that there would be no meeting.  Despite the fact that the Cabinet were divided and that some Members advised the Government they would be defeated on this, the strong men in the Cabinet had their way and a statement was issued that it was a unanimous decision.  You would want to get the Oxford Dictionary to define the word &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo; because now, according to Fianna Fáil, when they are almost equally divided, they are unanimous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the proper title would be the the Fianna Fáil Ascendancy Bill.  The word &ldquo;ascendancy&rdquo; has perhaps a bad taste and smell in this country but there is not the slightest doubt among the majority of our people that the aim of Fianna Fáil is not to give Fine Gael or any other Party a chance of becoming a Government but to rivet Fianna Fáil in power for as long as possible.  They know now, with the results of recent by-elections and general elections, that their vote is dropping and they are trying to get 65 per cent of the seats here with 38 to 40 per cent of the votes.  They know they cannot win the game under the present rules and <Col N="1834" /> therefore they want to change the rules in order to win.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a Party who know all the rules of the game, a wily Party steeped in deceit and corruption and no matter what any member of Fianna Fáil says, I have no doubt they will try to gerrymander the constituencies as they have so often done in the past.  Even in 1947 they tried to defeat the aim of PR by making 21 three-seat constituencies.  Things did not turn out to their liking and when they found in many of those constituencies instead of getting, as they expected, two Fianna Fáil and one other Deputy, they got two Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil or one Labour, one Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil, they moved away from that position as quickly as possible and introduced many four-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>We have been told that PR is a British system and that the new system, according to Fianna Fáil, is the straight vote system.  I do not want to go back on what President de Valera said about the system that we had and knew, but I think it fair to say that the present President spoke in favour of PR in 1919 and again in 1927 and if it is true, as Fianna Fáil now tell us, that PR is a British system, why did the President speak in favour of it on those occasions?  Why did he copper-fasten it into the Constitution in 1937?  That is what he did and he is a man respected by the majority of Fianna Fáil.  Does the Minister now want to say that it is a British system, inspired by the British Government and the English people, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil enshrined it in our Constitution of 1937?</P>
      <P>We gained our freedom in 1922 and in an Irish Parliament composed of men like Arthur Griffith, General Mulcahy, Seán MacEoin, the late W.T. Cosgrave, Kevin O'Higgins, Paddy Hogan and others, we had this declaration at that time:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people and in the confidence that the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored hereby proclaims <Col N="1835" /> the establishment of the Irish Free State and in the exercise of undoubted right decrees and enacts....</P>
    <P>Article 16 of that Constitution provided that Dáil Éireann shall be composed of Members elected to represent constituencies determined by law and that the system of election be in accordance with the principles of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>That was one of the first acts of an Irish Government elected in 1922, to proclaim to the world its existence, to declare the manner in which it would control its own affairs and the manner in which people would be elected to Parliament.  I sincerely hope that nobody on the opposite benches will tell me that men like Griffith, Mulcahy, MacEoin, Cosgrave, Hogan, O'Higgins and the others I have mentioned, who took over the country from the British in 1921, who fought to put the British out of this country, were willing to adopt any system at the dictates of the British Government and enshrine it in our Constitution.  There was no fear of them doing any such thing.  They were Irishmen, inspired men doing their best for all sections of the people irrespective of class or creed.  They wanted to give fairplay to all and especially to the Protestant minority here.</P>
    <P>The founders of the State adopted PR and we had an election in 1932 under that system, and the Fianna Fáil Party came in as the largest Party and took over the Government.  If the Cosgrave Governments between 1922 and 1932 had done away with PR, they might have kept the Fianna Fáil Party out of power, but recognising the rights of Fianna Fáil or of any other legitimate Party who were prepared to govern within the provisions of the Constitution, they did not try in any way to prevent those Parties entering this Parliament.  History will give them credit for that, but they have got very little thanks from certain people.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to accept that Fianna Fáil would have any liking for minorities.  When Fianna Fáil were in <Col N="1836" /> a minority away back in the 1920s, they had very little respect for the majority point of view.  Now that they are themselves in the majority, I suppose it would be hard to expect them to have any respect for minorities.  We on this side of the House believe, as indeed did those who have gone before us and led this country in the earlier days through hard and harsh times in order to build up this country, in the legitimate rights of all minorities, whether it be labour, farmers or any other section of our people.</P>
    <P>We are an agricultural community, and I claim that the farmers should be represented in Parliament by a farmers' Party if they wish to be represented here.  The farmers are a minority group.  I see nothing wrong in the principle of producers, farmers, coming together and putting forward their candidates in an election and having them elected to Parliament to fight for their rights and to fight for justice and fairplay. Under proportional representations, farmers would have a reasonable chance of having their candidates returned, but if the Minister for Local Government and the Fianna Fáil Party get their way, they will not have a chance in the world, under the British system of election, of having representatives returned to this Parliament.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement is perhaps the biggest organised body of men in this country.  If this Bill is passed and we adopt the British system, we shall have the situation here in which the doors of Leinster House will be closed to a James Larkin or a James Connolly.  We could have a situation in this Parliament where the doors of Leinster House would be closed to the representatives of 800,000 organised workers.</P>

      <P>800,000 workers are a minority; it is different if you include their wives.  In any case, I claim that labour and the farmers are entitled to representation in an Irish Parliament.  Nobody can deny that both of those sections, labour and the farmers, make the largest contribution to our national economy.  If they are denied representation, which could happen under the system now envisaged by the little dictators in the Fianna Fáil Party, they will still be subject to all the penalties, shall we say, of citizenship while being denied their fundamental rights as citizens of this State.  It will be a case of paying taxes, rent, rates and everything else, but being without the proper opportunity of getting representation in this Parliament.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed, we all know that, according to figures that have been produced by independent experts on Radio Telefís Éireann and other independent experts in this country, Fianna Fáil could get anything from 94 to 110 Deputies, while the Labour Party could be reduced to six, eight or nine Deputies.

      <P>Not a majority of them but many of them are sick and tired of the carry on of Fianna Fáil, and because many of them believe in freedom and democracy, they might not now be toeing the Party line as the Minister's Party would like them to toe it.  I also believe that another minority, Sinn Féin, are entitled to representation.  If the Sinn Féin Party are prepared to put up candidates for an election, to recognise the duly elected Government of the country and accept the authority of Parliament, I believe they should be in a position to command representation.  Indeed, it might be no harm to say in passing that we had people at another stage of our history who were not prepared to accept the authority of Parliament, but they had a safety valve at that time. They had PR and that gave them a chance of procuring seats in an Irish Parliament.  They ultimately availed of that chance and they entered this House, away back in 1927, I think.</P>
      <P>The safety valve should still be left there.  If Sinn Féin or any other body want to put forward candidates who have a reasonable chance of being elected, they should be in a position to do so.  That can be done only under the PR system of voting.  It certainly cannot be done under the British system of voting which Mr. Boland and the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to introduce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which the Minister for Local Government and the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to introduce into this country.  I believe a man should have the right to stand for any Party because, when we consider the matter properly, it is the individual candidate who counts&mdash;or it should be in any case&mdash;and not so much the Party.  If good men are nominated on behalf of any small Party, they should at least&mdash;and I say <Col N="1839" /> at least&mdash;have a reasonable chance of election.  They now have a reasonable chance under PR, but they certainly will not have a reasonable chance under the British system envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We know what happens in Northern Ireland.  We need not go any further for a glaring example of the injustice of this system.  I also claim that if this Bill is passed, the British system envisaged in this Bill will lead to unrepresentative Parliament and to arrogant Governments.  Indeed, many of the young Ministers in the Government are arrogant enough with 74 or 75 out of 144 seats.  What would they be if they had 104 or 110 out of 144? The ordinary people of the country, whether clerics, laymen or anything else, would have a very poor chance under the so-called Minister.  If this Bill goes through and we have the British system instead of proportional representation according to Party strength, we will have disproportional representation.  No other system is as fair as PR.</P>
      <P>It could be said, and it has been said, that the British system of voting is one of the biggest gambles on earth. We need go no further than across the water to our neighbouring country for an example.  In 1945, the Labour Party in England polled 48 per cent of the vote and got a two to one majority of the seats in the House of Commons.  In 1951, Labour polled 48½ per cent of the vote, half per cent more than they got in 1945, and they lost the election to the Conservatives who polled between 44 and 45 per cent of the vote.  In 1953, in South Africa, the Nationalist Party with 590,000 votes secured 92 seats and the United Party with 608,000 votes, 18,000 more, got only 43 seats.  They did not even get half the number. That is the system which the Fianna Fáil Government wish to adopt here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this system would lead to arrogant and dictatorial government. Indeed, so far as I know, it could be a plan to have permanent dictatorship here for years to come by keeping one Party in power.  We all know that power leads to corruption.  We want a <Col N="1840" /> Government under which everyone will get a fair crack of the whip.  We know it is the aim of Fianna Fáil to rivet themselves in power, to get 104 or 110 seats.  They know as well as I know, that if a Party have no representation in a constituency for a certain number of years, it is very hard for any young candidate to make up ground there, fight his way, and get to the top.  It is the idea of Fianna Fáil to get this Bill passed and get into power, and with their 100 seats, to gerrymander the areas.  I want to say this can be done and I have no doubt that they would try to do it again as successfully as they did it in the past.  I also claim that the abolition of the PR system which we have, the system we know, the system that has served us so well, reading from the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At any rate the President said that at one time.  We know that if the British system is introduced here, it will make it much more difficult to end Partition.  We were told very often in the past&mdash;at least at every election&mdash;that the ending of Partition was one of our top priorities, that it was our outstanding problem.  As I said earlier to the Minister, Fianna Fáil seem to be content and happy to forget about it and when they are in the saddle, they hardly mention it until the next election.  We were told in the past that it was the problem nearest and dearest to the hearts of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Where their hearts are now I do not know.  They are far away from Partition.  We were told that the Government had plans to end it in the past, but nothing has been done.  If Fianna Fáil were serious about ending Partition, the last move in the world they would make would be to give even the appearance of seeking one-Party domination here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representatives of the Northern Ireland Government know how the British system of election works.  They know they have been able to stay in power for about 40 years.  They know what they have been able to do with majorities.  Indeed, the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, who know so much about the British system of election, <Col N="1841" /> who know exactly how that system works, who know exactly how it has ground down minorities and kept a particular Party in power, will not come in here as a minority under this system, because they themselves know what one-Party domination can do under this system.</P>
    <P>According to some Fianna Fáil speakers, if proportional representation is abolished, we shall get a better type of Deputy and we shall have less deadwood in the Parties.  That certainly is not true.  If this British system of election is adopted here, we shall get the Deputy the Party bosses want us to get and no other, and this is the greatest disadvantage of the proposed system.  Let there be no denying that it will lead to the growth of the power of the Party.  The choice of candidate will rest with the Party machine and not with the people.  He will be foisted on them.  If they are supporters of the Party they will have no choice but to vote for that candidate.</P>

Burke, under that system, might well receive 10,000 votes more than his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland.  The people have done it in the past.  However, if constituencies are divided up, then, whether or not the people like, for example, the Minister for Local Government, if they are supporters of the Party, they will have no choice but to vote for him. Under the present system of proportional representation, with, say, five Fianna Fáil candidates in an area, the people supporting the Party can exercise their preferences in relation to the candidates.  They can vote No. 1, P.J. Burke, No. 2, a footballer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is giving the people of Ireland the opportunity to use their brains to the best of their ability in selecting the people they think most suitable to represent them in an Irish Parliament.  If the British system is introduced, then, in a particular part of county Dublin, whether the voters be clerics or any other section of the community, if they intend to support Fianna Fáil, they will have to give their vote to the <Col N="1844" /> present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, whether or not they like it.

If Fianna Fáil had not been in power for the last number of years, there would be no real necessity for discussing this Bill because it is through their mismanagement of national affairs, because the dead hand of Fianna Fáil descended on the people and 1,300,000 people drifted from rural Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the less said about it the better.  Fianna Fáil are now adopting the role of the oppressors as well as trying to foist on us the system of the oppressors.  It should be the concern of all to get and to retain good government.  As I said, other countries have strong government but it is no substitute for good government, and many of those countries would prefer good government and wise government and not strong government. Power is not necessarily beneficial, and power corrupts.  In the past there was strong government in Germany and we know that there was a strong government in Italy, but is that the type of government the young, mohaired dictators in Fianna Fáil want to see here if this British system of election is introduced?  Russia has strong government today but it is a one-Party government and only one candidate's name is allowed to appear on the ticket. Is that what we are heading for?  We should be careful because if the young dictators in Fianna Fáil got their way they would, backed by the moneyed classes about which the Minister has been speaking, and Taca, give us that sort of strong government.  There is a strong government in Poland and in Hungary.  We know what happened the ordinary people there in 1956 when <Col N="1848" /> they tried to rise up and fight for their rights.  The Russian tanks went in and the people were mown down in their thousands.  Do we want to introduce that type of strong government here? There is strong one-Party government in Yugoslavia and in Czechoslovakia. There is strong government in Red China.  Do we want that type of government?  Is that the direction in which we are heading.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal about stability.  Arguments have been advanced that we have not now, and have not had in the past, stability under proportional representation.  These arguments are fallacious.  We have had stability, no matter what members of Fianna Fáil may say.  Since the foundation of this State, over 45 years ago, we have had only four Taoiseachs. There is no other country in the world which can claim that record. From 1922 to 1932 we had a Government of young men, a Government which had a hard task, a Government which took over from the British, a Government which had to build up this State, a Government which founded both the Garda Síochána and the Irish Army, of which we are so proud.</P>

I am, I think, entitled to make the case that had we then had the system now proposed, that would not have been the evolution of events at that time.  The Government at the time had to be a strong Government because of the opposition with which they had to contend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a change of Government in 1932 and Fianna Fáil came into office.  No one can claim that that Government were not a strong Government and a stable Government. They were elected under the system that has served us so well for so long.</P>
      <P>Do we want the type of stability and strong government the people have in Northern Ireland?  Under the system of election proposed here, the British system, elections are a mere farce.  Half the constituencies are not even contested and the results in the majority are known beforehand.  I doubt if strength is the only quality required in a government.  The bitter lesson of history is that governments can be stronger than they are wise.  What we want here, what we have under the present system, is government representative of the people.  That is something which cannot be procured under the proposed system.</P>
      <P>The President, as quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 20th January, 1948&mdash;he was then Taoiseach&mdash;had this to say:</P>
      <P>A government is strong only if it has a majority in parliament because in our system, the government depends on the majority it has in parliament.  It is a weak government if it has not a strong majority. It is not strong merely because it has a parliamentary majority.  If it can be suggested that the government is not supported by the people then the government, by that very fact, is a weak government.</P>
      <P>Under the system which Fianna Fáil are trying to foist on us today Fianna Fáil could get 65 per cent of the seats here with only 38 to 40 per cent of the votes of the people.  The President said:</P>
      <P>If it can be suggested that the government is not supported by the people then the government, by that very fact, is a weak government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> Do we want weak government here?</P>
    <P>We have been told that this system, the British system, is the best system for this country.  Arguments have been advanced that proportional representation leads to a multiplicity of Parties. That is not in accordance with the facts.  All the evidence is to the contrary. In 1923 we had four Parties&mdash; Sinn Féin, Cumann na nGaedheal, the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party. Three of these Parties were represented here.  The remaining Party were sulking outside the gate.  They came in later.</P>
    <P>In 1959, under proportional representation, we had only three Parties. More Parties were born and died under proportional representation than came to maturity and, in the intervening years, we had the People's Party, the National League, the Farmers' Party and the Centre Party. We have had only three large Parties over the past 36 years.  At the moment we have only three major Parties and the two major Parties have something like 121 out of the 144 seats available. If my memory serves me correctly, the three major Parties have 139 or 140 of the 144 seats in this Parliament. That is the result under proportional representation.  The argument of the Minister that proportional representation leads to a multiplicity of Parties does not, therefore, hold water.  The Minister's argument was that, if we introduced the British system, we would have only two Parties.  It is not the function of any Government to dictate to the people and say they should have only two Parties.  That is a decision for the people themselves.</P>
    <P>I object to this system being foisted on us.  It is the British system and I believe that when the people are given the opportunity they will clearly show that they are not in favour of it.  If we take away the safety valve, there is the danger that we might drive people who, under our present system, can get representation in this House, underground. If they can get representation, and they can get it under proportional representation, they will seek it through the normal channels in keeping with the Constitution but if they are denied that chance of getting representation in this <Col N="1851" /> House&mdash;and the Bill introduced by the Minister for Local Government is an effort to deny them that God-given right&mdash;those people can be driven underground.</P>

      <P>Who was stopping Fianna Fáil one time in the past from adopting the very same tactics they are adopting today, perhaps, by sulking and staying outside?  The danger is that if they are not given the chance of getting representation here, they may seek other means of making their presence felt and the danger, indeed, of such a development is quite obvious. It has happened before in this country and, indeed, it can happen again.  Suppose that the right of representation in the Dáil or in the Seanad were to be taken from, say, the Labour Party, they are strongly organised at the present time and if they wanted to at any time in the future, they could cripple the country.  No one can deny that the strength of the trade unions totals over 800,000.</P>

      <P>I did not bother getting the year.  It is hard to get everything. I have given the volume and the column&mdash;Volume 40, column 56, of the Dáil Debates.  I suppose I have stated enough but it is only right to <Col N="1854" /> say, as Mr. de Valera said, that there is this danger inherent in the British system of voting.  If Fianna Fáil now get their way with the abolition of proportional representation and the introduction of the straight vote, that could result in a minority getting the majority of the seats.  That is what Fianna Fáil want now.  They know their percentage of votes has dropped in the last ten or 12 years from 55 or 56 per cent down to 43 or 44 per cent in the recent by-elections and county council elections.  They know it is still dropping because the Irish people have found them out and they want to secure, under this new system, 70 to 75 per cent of the seats here with 38 to 40 per cent of the votes.  They are not going to get away with it.</P>
      <P>Let me say, it is a revolutionary proposal which could have very serious repercussions on the political system and on the people as a whole. It could have repercussions that none of us can foresee.  We are taking a leap in the dark.  I believe that we should retain the system that we have, the system which, as our President has said, has worked so well, which Deputy Lemass told us in the past has worked well and which even Deputy MacEntee told us in 1953 had worked well.</P>

The only solace that the Minister for Local Government and the Government can offer to our suffering people today is to tell them to forget their troubles, to forget about emigration and the high cost-of-living, that they are all right and that Fianna Fáil will give them the reforms that are contained in this Bill instead of living up to the promises that they made in the past.  The present Government even under the present system provide a shield for the strong and a mockery for the weak.  While they give lip service to the Proclamation of 1916, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, with Taca money, they have very little regard for the weak.</P>

If they get this Bill through and succeed in obtaining 100 or 110 seats out of 144, there will be very little chance with Taca money of their doing anything for the ordinary people. We know that Fianna Fáil are crafty and will be prepared to stoop to anything to get this passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that this Bill is before us and has been discussed for so long because it is opening up quarrels about the past and the present; and we may find that in all this argument we may lose the future.  We were forgetting the evils of the Civil War and the things that kept us divided in the past.  There was a chance that the people of all Parties would come more closely together and work in the interests of the country.  But this effort to take from the people their democratic rights shows that Fianna Fáil again want to open old wounds and <Col N="1856" /> perpetuate the divisions of the past. We would all like to forget the past, forget this futile wrangling and look to the future.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are like leopards crouching to spring at the throats of the people.  But the Minister for Local Government will not get the chance to carve the joint this time.  In 1959 the Irish people rejected Fianna Fáil and they will certainly do the same again.  They will be helped by the division in Fianna Fáil, by the fact that half the Fianna Fáil Party are not in favour of this measure.  While the Minister may strut around here like a peacock, when the referendum is held, the people will cut him down to size.  When Fianna Fáil speak about democracy and tell us this Bill is in the interests of democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In trying to take from the people their just rights, Fianna Fáil have forged a bond of common interest between those who love fairplay.  They have built for us a bridge across the gulf of the differences that divided us in the past and kept us from uniting and defeating Fianna Fáil.  But we will unite and defeat Fianna Fáil on this. Even if we had to fight it alone, we would fight and we would neither flag nor falter.  We have been in the vanguard in the past.  We are not fighting this fight alone at present.

      <P>The first thing we have to make clear is that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party cannot abolish PR.  In the referendum the people are being given the choice of what type of system they want. They are being given this choice because that is what is contained in the Constitution.  I wish Opposition speakers would stop trying to confuse the issue by alleging that the Fianna Fáil dictators are trying to deprive them of their fundamental rights.  In the Constitution, which was created by the Fianna Fáil Government, the people's rights are safeguarded.  I believe we will get this over to the people and that they will act accordingly and give us the system which is in practice in most modern democratic States.</P>
      <P>We heard this morning the most disgusting speeches in the debate so far.  Deputy Donegan came in here in very bad humour, I am told.  He took an attitude which has caused much strife by trying to embroil the Church in this debate.  It may sound strange to Deputies who did not hear him but I was here and I would remind him that in some countries in the thirties there were politicians who tried the same thing and it resulted in a sad time for the Church and for the people.  It is despicable that a Deputy, in trying to make a case, should embroil the Church here.  I do not know what he hopes to gain but whatever he gained, he certainly gained no personal kudos here.</P>
      <P>We had an attempt by Deputy L'Estrange to give PR a biblical origin. Whatever I have read in the Bible I have never seen any reference to PR there but Deputy L'Estrange began to quote from some Bible&mdash;I do not know from which one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a very serious issue, but listening to Deputy L'Estrange all I can say is that he is good for a laugh. His contribution must be one of the poorest ever.  He spoke about the Labour Party and the trade unions.  I have no right to speak for the Labour Party or the unions.  He threatened that if the Labour Party did not succeed under this new system, they would sabotage the country.  I am pointing this out to the House to show the depths to which the Deputy would go to have the referendum defeated.  I regard the people as having a much higher degree of intelligence than Deputy L'Estrange believes and I believe they will reject these futile arguments in favour of PR.</P>
      <P>It may be mentioned that some of the newspapers are coming out with vicious articles in favour of PR.  One paper in particular I shall mention is the <i>Irish Times</i> which has published vicious leading articles advocating the retention of that archaic system.  It is not really strange to find the <i>Irish Times</i> taking up this attitude because throughout its existence it has always tried to preserve the <i>status quo.</i>  We had a very small minority known as the Ascendancy and the <i>Irish Times</i> always championed their cause.  Perhaps these people fear the future under the new system and may have decided that they must hold on to the unjust system.  We are told that it is one man, one vote, but we know very well, because of vested interests, by various means they can influence public opinion not in the cause of the country but in the interests of maintaining the <i>status quo.</i>  That is why they publish these vicious articles calling for the retention of PR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that every voter is equal and entitled to a vote which would have the same weight as the vote of a wealthy landowner or capitalist.  The <i>Irish Times</i> are backing the Labour Party to a great extent on this issue and have come out against the mass <Col N="1859" /> of the people trying to deprive them of the right to have a different system of election.  We hear about minorities being injured if the PR system goes but the only minority that will be hit are the people of the Ascendancy type who want to go on governing this country, not from Government benches or Leinster House, but from various old seats of power.  The people will see through this, I believe, and will give us the system that operates in England where I do not think anybody could say the Government are undemocratic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan spoke about the position in the six occupied counties. It is ridiculous to suggest that if PR operated there, you would have a Nationalist majority.  Deputies know there is more involved than that.  Last week, at a Nationalist convention, one of the speakers said that we were losing touch down here.  We certainly are if a Deputy here gets up and contrasts the position in the Six Counties with the Twenty-Six Counties as regards voting systems.  He should know that many factors operate against the Nationalists having a majority in the North.  I am not defending the gerrymandering activities of the Northern Government but even if the PR system were introduced there, while it might bring some change, you would not find a Nationalist majority there for a very long time. Therefore, it is a very unfair argument to use here for the retention of PR.</P>
    <P>The attitude of Deputy Donegan and Deputy L'Estrange was hypocritical. They took on themselves the defence of the Church and other institutions, something they had no right to do.  On another occasion Deputy Donegan offered a pact to the Labour Party to join in an inter-Party or coalition Government and then he turned to these benches and made a further offer.  His attitude was, I think, that &ldquo;we do not care with whom we shall coalesce so long as we get into power&rdquo;.  His projection for the next general election was not very impressive. I think he gave the Labour Party 25 seats.  I doubt if Deputy Corish would be satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>I should like to conclude by reiterating the statement I made at the outset, that it is the duty, the task and the privilege of the people to decide this question in the autumn. Neither Fianna Fáil nor anyone else can foist anything on them, and if the Fine Gael Party are so sure of winning, I am wondering why the great filibuster is going on.  I believe the people will on this occasion vote in favour of reforming the electoral system because the proposed system is a good one, a system which operates in Britain and which would operate in France, in West Germany and in Belgium if the Governments were strong enough there to put this option to the people.</P>

      <P>Listening to the last speaker, one would imagine that there was a tremendous national demand for this change in the electoral system.  I am unaware of anybody asking for this change except the Fianna Fáil Party, and it is the Fianna Fáil Party who must take responsibility for a prolonged debate on something that nobody wanted except themselves, and indeed in the minds of a great many people considerable doubt has grown in the last month or so as to whether the majority of Deputies in Fianna Fáil want this change or not. The Minister may as well know the sad truth that they have no more chance of winning this referendum than the man in the moon.  They forced this issue on Dáil Éireann simply because they were in a position to force it with their overall majority.  It is a repetition of what was rejected by the electorate in a secret ballot nine years ago.  I have sat through this debate, and I have spoken very little.  In fact I have not spoken since the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I have sat here and listened to the Minister speaking in isolation in his own benches when his own Party would not even give him the distinction of <Col N="1862" /> sitting behind him and listening to what he was saying, for the simple reasons that he was repeating himself from beginning to end.  One of the major arguments put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party was that they wanted stability.  In the world very recently we have seen the revolt against constituted authority, and this revolt has come in most countries from minorities.  What the political pundits assess as the reason for that is that there is not enough contact between political representatives and the smaller minorities.  Therefore to safeguard and maintain democracy as it is one of the most essential things is&mdash;and this is evident from happenings in recent weeks&mdash;that minorities should have an opportunity of being represented in Parliament.  If they are represented in Parliament they are then in a position to voice their opinion, and this creates political stability, even among extreme sections of the community.</P>
      <P>We have listened <i>ad nauseam</i> to talk about the French system.  Will the members of Fianna Fáil get it into their heads once and for all that the French system is not the straight vote system?  There is an election in France at the moment, and they have what they call the first choice.  They had an election last Sunday.</P>

      <P>The straight vote is the Canadian vote, the direct vote.  It is the vote of the United States, and it is the vote of Britain. These are practically the only countries in the world that have it.  The vote in France is different: if you are first past the post, in other words, if <Col N="1863" /> you get an overall majority you are in on the first count.  That is the principle we are trying to defend on this side.  We want a system whereby a person who is elected is elected by a majority.  What Fianna Fáil want is to get control of the country through a minority of the votes.  There is no other explanation for it.  There is no use in Deputies getting up and making futile speeches.  As regards the last Deputy who spoke, I have no idea whether he is for or against proportional representation.  I could not understand what he was talking about: I do not think he even knew himself.</P>
      <P>All we have had from Fianna Fáil are interruptions and a long monologue from the Minister saying the same thing repeatedly, that he wants to see a strong Opposition and a strong Government.  Was there not a strong Government in France?  Is there not a strong Government in Germany, and was there not a strong Government in Italy up to quite recently?  In order to have stability in a modern democracy, the entire electorate must be represented. If not, the trouble that has come to the other countries will eventually come here.  In Germany they have a huge majority today and still they have got stability.  In a free democratic Parliament, with the continuing encroachment of bureaucracy, due largely to weak Ministers, we must ensure that all sections of the community are properly represented.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House knows I am not what one would call a left-wing thinker by any means.  My views would appertain more to conservatism and I am not ashamed of that.  Many people over there are conservative and would be ashamed to admit it.  However, I recognise the fact that the Labour Party, who appear to be moving in the direction of being largely representative of the trade union movement, are entitled to representation here, and are entitled to that representation in the proportion in which they get the votes.  That is the meaning of PR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Party are introducing a Bill for which there was no demand from any public authority in the country; even the smallest urban <Col N="1864" /> council or town commissioners never passed a resolution asking for it.  There were very few letters in the papers about it, and any there are are obviously written by some Fianna Fáil hack to try to cover the political opposition that is growing towards this Bill.</P>
    <P>They can go ahead with this Bill if they want to, but I suspect myself that there are other motives behind it as well.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party want to eliminate, to put it politely, some of the driftwood in their ranks.  They want to nominate people who suit them in particular constituencies.  This could happen very easily in a constituency where there is a majority for the Opposition. We do not know what the constituencies will be because they will be arranged by Fianna Fáil.  It could happen in a constituency where there is a majority against the Government, where there is an overall majority of 300 or 400 in favour of Fine Gael or the Labour Party or even an Independent as against Fianna Fáil.  They can introduce what is known as stooge candidates.  These people can be forced on a constituency and that constituency would have representation in Parliament which had no interest in it whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Under the system which the Minister is so keen on, the British system, at the moment there is in Britain a vacancy in what is known as a safe seat.  The Conservatives have a majority of 12,000 there.  There were 83 applications for the seat and the final choice rested between two. Neither of those two lived in the constituency or had anything to do with it. They were being foisted on the local organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall have to appeal for the protection of the Chair if this continues.  Deputy Molloy has shown that he is alive to the situation by interrupting practically continuously no matter who is speaking. It may be that we will not have him representing Galway unless he suits the pundits of the Party.  Someone else will be foisted on the area.  I know very little about Galway but I am sure Deputy Molloy is <i>au fait</i> with the situation in his constituency, and unless he conforms fully with the policy of the Party, whatever that may be for the time being, it looks as if he and his friend from Donegal may be eliminated from their constituencies and someone from Dublin with heavy funds at his disposal, a considerable contributor to the Fianna Fáil Party fund&mdash;I will not mention the organisation because it engenders such heat and I hate to see people getting angry &mdash;will be foisted on the constituencies and the local personal element which is so paramount in Irish public life, and which has been such a strong defender of the democratic system, will be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this proposal will go through.  I do not think Fianna Fáil would lose any face by withdrawing it.  It must be absolutely crystal clear at the moment that it is recognised in the country that the Government are wasting valuable time.  There are many other things we could be discussing to the betterment of the country, instead of having this futile, senseless debate and listening to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and I do not say this in any personal way&mdash;droning on defending a lost cause.  This will be bad for the prestige of the Fianna Fáil Party. The figures produced this morning by Deputy Donegan seem to have annoyed Fianna Fáil.  Looking at it from the Fianna Fáil angle, I have the unhappy feeling that if they are routed at the referendum, they will be routed at the subsequent general election, and <Col N="1866" /> everyone will say to the Minister: &ldquo;Why did you ever introduce this Bill and leave us in the cart as you have done?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length at this stage of the Bill, but I should like to make a few points, not so much on the merits of the proposal in this measure as on the mechanics of the referendum and the debate in this House.  I do not know what the Fianna Fáil discussion on this matter was like. I cannot say whether this Deputy or that Deputy was for or against the proposal, or whether there was a Cabinet split.  It seems to me that no matter what the personal feelings or views of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were, they are now unanimous in their view that they will back this proposal and it will go to the country.  This is what we want to see as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The discussion which has ensued over the past three or four months to a pretty large extent has been a futile exercise.  It was obvious from the start that the issues were clear cut, that no substantial amendment would be proposed from the Government benches, and that no substantial amendment would be accepted from any of the Opposition Parties.  The views of the three Parties were made known very clearly on the Second Reading of the Bill.  In other matters which come up for discussion here our decision is final. We can approve or disapprove of legislation.  We can pass or reject Estimates. That is the final decision and that decision must be implemented. What we are doing in this case is deciding whether the Government's proposals will go to the country.  It must be obvious to everyone that because Fianna Fáil have an overall majority, these proposals are going to the country some time, and why we should have this long debate I cannot imagine.  I see the Minister looking at me as if he were blameless on this point.</P>

It appears to me that a fortnight ago when he made his speech on Deputy Norton's amendment, the Minister decided to stop what was obviously a filibuster because he was reading out senseless information to the House.  Everyone knows my views on this proposal, and Deputy Molloy's and Deputy Esmonde's, but for weeks we have had this criss-crossing of information and futile discussion.  I do not want to curtail discussion but, as Deputy Esmonde said, there are many other things we should be discussing in the House on which we could make a final decision.  We have not done this. We have wasted the time of Parliament, while there are other things to which we should have devoted our attention, this year on this measure and last year on another proposal by the Government when they introduced the Marts Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not giving any new information to the people on this subject.  The press cannot devote all their pages to this debate so they cannot convey an absolutely proper and true picture of this debate.  I therefore believe that what we should do now, and what the Government in particular should do, is to initiate debate in the country particularly by way of television, radio and, of course, the press are able to look after that job themselves.  The people must be allowed to participate in this decision in a greater way than in 1959 <Col N="1868" /> and in a greater way than I believe it is intended they will be allowed to participate before this referendum comes along in the autumn.  The people should know the absolute facts.  This can be done by public speeches by the various Deputies and particularly by way of radio, television and the press.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the people should be led by any political Party purely in a political fashion.  This decision should be made with an awareness of the proposals and of the counter-proposals.</P>
    <P>We are quite amused at the concern about the Labour Party.  We can look after ourselves, as we have done since we were established and particularly as we have done in the last two elections. I do not know what the results will be of the next election: naturally, I do not accept Deputy Donegan's figures.  We have made gains progressively in the last two elections&mdash;in the by-elections and the local elections.  We hope to continue that trend.  Let nobody be over-concerned about our future or our activity.  The trade union movement, apart from their affiliations, some of them to the Labour Party, also know their own business as they have demonstrated.  They will always get representation in this House, no matter what the system.</P>
    <P>We are for proportional representation. In this discussion, we have not dealt with the matter with an eye on the next election or on the election after that.  The usual procedure is to determine how Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party will do under the straight vote.  We should not engage in that sort of exercise because, in so doing, we make obvious that our concern is for our Party's future.  It is a matter of importance but it should not be related, as such, to the proposals in this measure.</P>
    <P>We are for proportional representation because we believe it is the fairest system of election for the reasons we have given, particularly on Second Reading.  Whether or not it is of any use to anybody, we are unanimous in this view.  We are not concerned about the individual opinions of those in Fianna Fáil or in Fine Gael.  I respect Party decisions.</P>

I rise because of certain remarks that Fianna Fáil have delayed the passage of this Bill.  This suggestion must be refuted because it is absolutely untrue.  It must be obvious to anybody who has followed the debate that it has been carried, on our behalf, mainly by our Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland.  It has been our wish to place before the people, through him, the facts of the issues and to leave it to the people to decide.  Any delays in the passage of this Bill have come from the Opposition Parties, especially Fine Gael.  It is rather strange for Deputy Corish to make the type of appeal he has just made.

      <P>As a young person in politics, I find it most disgusting and discouraging. Indeed, any young people interested in devoting their time and their lives to the service of the Irish people through politics could not but be deterred, by reason of this type of tactic by any Party in the Irish Parliament, from following that worth-while pursuit of devoting one's time to the service of the people.  I should like to see the standard of debate and the workings of the Dáil raised to as high a level as possible.  I should like to get away from that type of petty interruption and the slinging of remarks which are known not to be true but which are made in the hope that at least some of the mud that is slung will stick and that to some extent we will be tarred. There is only one reason behind this Bill&mdash;and it is the unanimous decision of the Fianna Fáil Party, no matter&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would say that every Deputy in his heart and soul could not but wish for single-seat constituencies. Most of the Opposition Deputies do not have the type of experience which the Government Party have had when there are two Deputies of the same Party in the one constituency.  But the position is no different for them where you had three, four or five different area.  The whole system seems to me to be highly inefficient because we had Deputies running around each trying to convince the constituents that he was a better man than the others.  We know, too, that a lot of surplus work was being thrown on to the civil servants because of multiplicity of representations. It would be much better if a man were elected for a smaller area, if the man who got the most votes, no matter how many were contesting the election, were elected and he would stand or fall in the area on his performance and the next election would decide whether or not he had been satisfactory to the electors.  There would be no question of a candidate getting in on the coat tails of somebody else or by the transfer of votes from another candidate.</P>
      <P>Opposition speakers say that this proposal is undemocratic but that does not hold water.  The PR system is a dishonest system of voting.  How could one say that it was honest to transfer a vote of the same value to a No. 2 if that vote had been given as a No. 1? It could not be deemed to be an honest or truthful expression of the wishes of the voter.  If a voter votes No. 1 for Fine Gael and votes No. 2 Fianna Fáil, he has voted for two different Parties and two different types of policies; yet in the counting of the votes that man can end up voting for Fianna Fáil. That is the system that exists here and this present system exists nowhere else in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the North of Ireland has been instanced as resembling the type of situation we would have here under the proposed system but that again is dishonest because everybody <Col N="1873" /> knows that political circumstances in the North of Ireland are completely different from those which exist here. The main factors there are religious and that is how the voting is determined, not so much on policies as on religion.  This is unfortunate but it is true.  As well as that we know there has been plenty of experience of gerrymandering. That has been going on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  There will be a Commission on which all Parties will be represented and how can you have gerrymandering under an independent judge?  Why not face up to the issues and not try to fool the people?</P>
      <P>Another point which was made was that it was Fianna Fáil's ambition to perpetuate themselves in office, but this is absolutely untrue.  I have no ambition to belong to a Party which is going to be the Government <i>ad infinitum,</i> whether the people want it or not.  I do not think that any other Deputy in my Party either wants to see that type of situation arise.  This is the impression that Opposition Parties are trying to create, that this is what we want and what we mean by stable government.  By stable government, we mean that whoever is elected will be able to form a government and that we will not have the situation which exists today in so many European countries. Because of the proliferation of small Parties in Belgium, they have been unable to form a Government for many months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing after an election is that a government should be elected as soon as possible and we want that Government, whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government or not, to be in a position to operate as a Government so that we will not have the type of situation we had when we had coalition Governments in which deals were being made every day and in which there were all sorts of trickery and promises which were not in the interests of the people.  We do not mind who is elected as long as <Col N="1874" /> it is a Government the people want and as long as it can operate during its period of office until the next election.</P>
    <P>If we are not elected, we want to be in the position that we can go into opposition and fight hard to get back into government again.  That is the type of political situation we are looking for, the type of society we want to see. It is not fair to say that there is no demand for this change.  There has been a demand down through the years for the single-seat constituency and for stable government, and not for what the Fine Gael Party say we mean by stable government.  We want a Government that can operate freely, a unified Government and not a collection of individuals or small groups, of which we have had too much experience here and throughout Europe.  Even at present our newspapers are carrying stories about different countries in which Parties are not able to get a majority in elections and not able to form Governments and as a result deals have to be made.  This has been to the detriment of the countries' economies because investment from within the country and from outside is slowed and deterred by that type of situation. In the long run, it is the people who lose when you have not got stable government because you will not have investment in the country.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is untrue to say that our wish is to stay in office.  Under the present system, we will remain the biggest Party; Fine Gael will be the second biggest; and the Labour Party will remain the third biggest.  There will not be any substantial change in the political situation for 15 or 20 years because no matter what percentage change there is in the electorate at times of general elections, there cannot be any great difference in the number of seats won by any Party because of the transfer of votes under PR.  Under the system we are proposing, a small swing in the number of votes can make a tremendous difference in the number of Deputies elected for a particular Party and a small swing can put in a Government or put it out.  This makes for big Parties or small Parties at the wish of <Col N="1875" /> the electorate and the wishes of the electorate are conveyed much more clearly and much more specifically through the straight vote than they are under proportional representation, which is purely and simply designed to maintain the <i>status quo,</i> a stagnant political situation.  We do not mind if we are not the Government, but, whoever is, they should be able to operate as an efficient and successful government, as a government having the confidence of the people; and, if the people elect them with a majority, then that is the wish of the people and the people must have confidence in supporting them.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Opposition have done so much shouting about our anxiousness to stay in Government.  A small swing on the straight vote could put us out overnight. We are the very Party who stand to lose most under the straight vote. After all, we have been in Government for 30 out of the last 36 years under proportional representation.  Why then should we bring forward this proposal when we are the people who have benefited most from proportional representation?  Because our reasons for making the change are genuine and sincere; because we have the responsibility of the government of the country at the moment; because we have a sincere feeling of responsibility for the future of the country in the next 15 or 20 years.  If we do not change the system, then in the next general election, or the one after that, if we, the biggest Party, do not get a majority to form a Government, who will be the Government?  That question has gone unanswered all through this debate.</P>
    <P>If the Labour and Fine Gael Parties can tell the people that the alternative to this Government is a joint government between Labour and Fine Gael, then let them say so now.  I know Fine Gael have made certain approaches because the people in Fine Gael realise that is the only way there can be an alternative under the present system, but the Labour Party are obstinate and insist that they will never again go into any type of government with Fine Gael.  They have had <Col N="1876" /> their experience of working with Fine Gael and maybe we cannot now blame them for their decision.  I was not here but I know I suffered under the Coalition Government because of the widespread unemployment in the country and the general unsatisfactory state of the economy.  Remembering that, the people will not again be so easily codded by the arguments of Opposition Deputies; their speeches lack sincerity.</P>
    <P>I know my seat will be in danger under the straight vote.  So is the seat of every Deputy.  No one can forecast how he will fare under the proposed new system.  Under the present system, there are many who can be quite confident of being re-elected, but there are few, if any, who can be 100 per cent sure that they will be re-elected under the proposed new system. Yet, we have the most Deputies and all of them unanimously agreed to support this proposal in the interests of the country.</P>

      <P>Our support for the proposal is common knowledge.  But Opposition Deputies are not prepared to sacrifice their seats, or themselves, for the sake of the country.  I am. Under the straight vote, I may be out of here at the next general election.  I am prepared to fight.  If the people want me, fair enough.  If they want someone else, well and good.  It will be the people's choice.  Why be afraid to go before the people under the most democratic system that exists anywhere in the world?  Why are Deputies on the opposite benches afraid of the will of the people?  Why have they stalled this debate and made all these statements designed to create the wrong impression? Why have they made false statements about our reasons for bringing forward these proposals?  We have nothing to fear.  We will accept the decision of the people.  We know that what we are doing is in the best interests of the people and of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the most important thing is that there should be a government <Col N="1877" /> here and that that government should have at all times, as this Government have at the moment, the confidence of the people.  There should be no deals behind closed doors for the purpose of forming a government never voted into office by the people.  Parties should go before the people, state their policy and be elected, or not elected, as the case may be, on the policy put before the people prior to the election. There should be no second-rate type of government elected.  That is the only reason why this proposal is brought forward here.  The purpose is to safeguard the future.  We are the Party in greatest danger when this change is made.  We know where we stand under proportional representation.  We cannot be knocked down from our position as the premier Party.  The single seat and the straight vote will be a completely new situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Fine Gael and some of the Labour Party Deputies are not prepared to make the same sacrifice as we are.  I cannot understand why they shrink from putting their seats here in jeopardy by going forward in a new situation.  Is it that they fear they will lose their seats?  We stand for the betterment of the country and this proposal is brought forward for the betterment of the country and that is why every Deputy in Fianna Fáil supports this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the sentiments of Deputy Molloy I find myself in sympathy.  It is essential that there should be a government of this country.  No one could contemplate with equanimity a situation in which that was not possible and, if political leaders and political Parties do not realise how necessary government is, then the people will certainly teach them.  The interests of the country demand that pseudo-political differences will disappear not alone in relation to the necessity of providing government but, above all, government which is an alternative to the Government now in office, as Deputy Molloy said, for 30 out of the past 36 years. And, fair do's to them, the mark is on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> Were I a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, a fate from which the Lord has at least preserved me, and were I to look at my country, bearing the mark of 30 years of Fianna Fáil Government, contemplating our endemic emigration, our persistent unemployment, the low standard of living of our people, the many problems still un-tackled, the many things still undone, while, over that 30 years, the main purpose of the Government was to change one Constitution after another, bedevil and confuse the people with constitutional gimmicks of one kind or another, I should feel very badly indeed, realising that all the time the real work was left unattended and we had not used the freedom which those who went before us won for the country in order to provide a better way of life for the Irish people.  I certainly would be ashamed of being a member of such a Party and I feel that those in the Fianna Fáil Party today who are concerned with the national interest must feel themselves equally ashamed.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Molloy that the urgent task facing this country and anyone interested in its future is to provide as quickly as possible a new Government, an alternative Government, and a new sense of dedication to the tasks required to be done in this country.  It is for that reason that I and the entire Fine Gael Party are in favour of the retention of proportional representation and propose to advise our supporters throughout the country to act in defence of this system of election.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation is the Irish system of election.  Let no one say otherwise.  It was Irish in its inception in the days of Sinn Féin.  It was Irish when it became part of Arthur Griffith's dream of the future free Ireland that he hoped to live to see. It was Irish when it went into our first Constitution.  It was Irish when it was put by President de Valera into the Constitution of 1936.  It was Irish in spirit, in sentiment, in design, and it was intended to operate fairly and reasonably in a free Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are the Tory toadies of Fianna Fáil who now, in this day and age, <Col N="1879" /> some 46 years after we got our freedom, are looking back, trying to turn back the hands of the clock, to get this country to do what the British were doing many years ago and are still doing, who want to introduce the British system of election into our society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy says: &ldquo;Let us have a referendum.  We are going to have it.&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;Let the will of the people take its course&rdquo;.  Be it mar atá. Aontaím leis sin, as we have always done from these benches.  We have always been prepared to let the people of this country decide the issues in controversy between us as politicians. We have never attempted to look into our own hearts and decide what is right for the people to do.  We have always been prepared to state the case fairly in a democratic way before the bar of public opinion and then, as democrats concerned with the maintenance of a decent society, to observe and preserve the will of the people.</P>
    <P>There was a referendum nine years ago on this very issue and the people gave their decision.  I concede that only one out of every two voted.  I have no doubt that those who went to vote were subjected to the pressure of a very strong political machine to go out and vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to one issue in the referendum and to vote in another way on another issue being decided on the same day but the plain fact is that the people who voted in the referendum nine years ago came to a selective decision on the issues before them and, in relation to proportional representation, had no hesitation in deciding in its favour.  That was the will of the people but apparently that just was not good enough because the people are now going to be told by those who talk about how important the people's will should be, that they were a bunch of jackasses, that they had no business deciding in the way they did and would they please now reconsider their decision.</P>
    <P>I say now what we propose to say to the people of this country.  What new fact has emerged in the last nine years which would suggest that the free decision of the Irish people in 1959 was <Col N="1880" /> erroneous or based on the wrong facts? Surely, this debate that we have had here, this discussion that is going to take place throughout the country, this controversy, will end without anything new being said?  I have said everything that I am now saying many times before and will say it many times again. Every Fianna Fáil Deputy has urged the same point of view throughout the debate as was urged nine years ago. The people have heard it all before. Is anyone to suggest that an issue that has been explored and canvassed from so many angles is an issue that was decided by the people without their being in possession of all the facts.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is said that this referendum is necessary now because there are so many people who are now on the register who were not on the register nine years ago.  Thanks be to God that that is so.  But is that any reason why the ordinary people should be diverted and deflected from the pressing social problems which beset our society now merely to decide an issue that was decided within the past decade?  Is it to be suggested that the entry of new voters on the register justifies a Government poised and impatient to get their own way in everything going back to the people time and time again just because they got the answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; the first time when they wanted the answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;? It appears to me the kind of politics that one might expect in certain hospitals devoted to the care of people with particular kinds of maladies.</P>
    <P>The only justification put forward for posing to the people the same question as they decided nine years ago is that today there are people who could not vote nine years ago.  No doubt, if this issue is submitted to the people, as it will be, and when is declared, as it will be, and when there is an emphatic &ldquo;No,&rdquo; as there will be, if things work out in the way in which I hope they will not, we might find in another few years another Fianna Fáil Government proposing precisely the same thing because meanwhile another 100,000 new voters had gone on to the register.</P>
    <P>There surely must be a finality in <Col N="1881" /> political controversy and political debating in this country.  I was hoping that at least after some 45 years this penchant in Fianna Fáil for constitutional changes and gimmicks might have disappeared and that the stage at least had been reached when a Fianna Fáil Government would put their mind down to the problem of trying to solve the real problems which are affecting our people.  If ever a country in 36 years has had the misfortune of having the problems of ordinary people neglected, we are such a country.  Since 1932&mdash;and I say that deliberately&mdash;the major portion of governmental activity has been devoted to matters of constitutional significance to the disadvantage of the lot of the ordinary people.  In the 36 years Deputy Molloy has been talking about our community, which is the responsibility of the Governments elected by this Dáil, has gone backwards and our people have left our land.  The young people in particular have been forced to seek employment elsewhere because of Bills of this kind.  It is because of the continuance of that kind of policy and I object to the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes what is called a relative majority.  It is called the straight vote system.  I call it the British system.  The people know it to be such. People throughout this country will remember that there are things which can be digested by suitable stomachs and things that a stomach may reject. In this part of Ireland, in the 26 counties for which we have a responsibility, the people have digested and accepted proportional representation&mdash; all political Parties.  Despite a Civil War, despite a situation in which brothers fought against brothers and blood was shed on both sides, every political side, with the carnage of battle behind them, subscribed and supported Griffith's principle of proportional representation. Proportional representation is part of the tradition of the community in this part of Ireland.  We have digested it because it suited our temperament and suited our historical environment.  Let it not be forgotten that in one part of Ireland it was not digested and not accepted and was rejected in 1926&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was at that time in the North of Ireland a determination by the majority Party to ensure a situation in which they would continue in office.  That was in 1929, almost 40 years ago.  We can look at the political development of the North of Ireland with the same political Party entrenched in office, with many constituencies never having the right to go to the ballot to decide on what candidate should represent them, because political elections in many constituencies just disappeared as a possibility.</P>
      <P>We need not search through the atlas of the world.  We need not look at contemporary political history to find the true answer to the discussion with regard to the merits and demerits of proportional representation.  We have it all here in our own island.  On our own doorstep we can see clearly the dangers of a system of election which results in the permanence in office of a political oligarchy of the kind we have in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy says Fianna Fáil are sincere.  Deputy Molloy may believe sincerely the sentiments he has given expression to here.  I do not doubt his sincerity, but I do not accept for one moment that those who control the Fianna Fáil Party today, and who have controlled it traditionally down through the years, have any other view in political activity or any other aim or philosophy of life except <Col N="1883" /> one, that is, to remain in office for as long as human effort and human ingenuity can contrive that result.</P>
    <P>In this Dáil today there are three political Parties&mdash;Fianna Fáil, the major Party, the Labour Party and ourselves.  I want to say deliberately that of those three political Parties, at least two have endeavoured to develop a political philosophy, a view in relation to the problems of our society, a way in which endemic problems should be approached.  As far as Fine Gael are concerned, our policy and our philosophical approach to problems has been thought out and worked out.  I detect in relation to the Government Party no evidence of a philosophy of life, no evidence of a philosophical approach to the social problems affecting our people.  Their concern is merely this: to remain in office.  While Deputy Molloy can say that this is a proposal brought forward with sincerity by Fianna Fáil, of whom he complains they have been too long there, I would recommend Deputy Molloy to discard a bit of his individual idealism, have a look at the log book and he will find what he is saying just does not bear examination in relation to the facts.</P>
    <P>This proposal is a political decision by a political Party designed to maintain themselves in office for as long as they can contrive that situation to continue. They know well that in any part of Ireland today, with perhaps one or two significant and well-known exceptions, the plain fact is that the majority of the people want them out.  They know well that at the moment, by reason of political decisions taken by politicians who may be a little bit behind the tide of public opinion, there is the unfortunate situation that that dominant opposition vote to Fianna Fáil is divided into sections. They fear the day when these sections will disappear.  They know well that as long as the people use proportional representation as Griffith wished them to use it, as it has been used fairly consistently in this country, by using the ballot, exercising the choice between different candidates whose policies one primarily supports and then using it intelligently in relation to <Col N="1884" /> what one would regard as the second best, that their days are numbered.  It is for that reason that this proposal comes along.</P>

      <P>In my view, you have a majority who are opposed to the continuance of present policies but frustrated in their expression because of a situation that, at the moment, cannot be controlled but which, I believe, will be controlled. With that majority so divided, those who sponsored this proposal realise that here is their chance and opportunity&mdash;a relative majority.  So long as they get a candidate who has the support of about 35 per cent of the people, the other 65 per cent who wish Fianna Fáil to be out of office will be subjected to a situation in which a Fianna Fáil member will be elected to represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is called democracy; this is called &ldquo;straight&rdquo;; this is called the &ldquo;relative majority&rdquo;.  Relative to what? Everything must be related to something. A majority is either a majority or it is not.  I know dictionaries have been used in this House before to prove particular points of view but I should be interested to know in what circumstances one can adjective &ldquo;majority&rdquo; in the sense that it is relative, a relative majority, a system under which a candidate with the support of 35 people out of 100 is sent to Dáil Éireann claiming to represent a majority of the people in his constituency.  That is called &ldquo;a <Col N="1885" /> relative majority&rdquo;.  There must have been great searching at the prodding of Fianna Fáil Ministers in the draftsman's office in the Department to find some term to describe this British system of election.  Then they come up with their &ldquo;relative majority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This system is undemocratic.  It is known to be such in England.  It is known by our history to be such in this country.  The fact that it is undemocratic is demonstrable in the change that occurred in 1929 in the North of Ireland.  It would result&mdash;and this is where I am inclined to doubt the sincerity of Deputy Molloy unless he is very naïve&mdash;in present circumstances at an election with a divided Opposition vote, in the election of over 100 Fianna Fáil Deputies.  When we have to listen to young Deputies in Fianna Fáil and older ones also trying to suggest to us that their only concern is to secure the fortunes of Fine Gael, as I said before: &ldquo;Timeo Graecos&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am a hard man when dealing with Fianna Fáil. But I do not accept that from the deliberations that have taken place in Fianna Fáil councils, from the lights that were burning and the midnight oil consumed by these anxious patriots, that these sincere democrats were worried because they had been so long in office, that the country might suffer unless they got a period in Opposition to recharge their engines.  Although I am ordinarily a sympathetic person, even to the bizarre stories and theories I come across in my profession, I cannot quite see the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance sitting around a table presided over by the Taoiseach, biting the stubs of their pencils, doodling and thinking and saying: &ldquo;What can we now do to help Fine Gael?&rdquo; I cannot imagine a situation in which the hard boys from the <Col N="1886" /> grass roots, the men from Donegal and different parts of the country, are all brought together into anxious conference to devise something to help Fine Gael to boot them out of office.</P>
      <P>I do not think this happens.  I doubt very much whether the people will accept that that is the current stratagem of Fianna Fáil.  They need not worry about it.  If they are anxious in that regard, if they are concerned about the seats of their trousers becoming greasy and shiny from sitting over there too often, let them not trouble about it or about the electoral system because they are going out of office inevitably.  When the next election comes, they will be out.</P>
      <P>They say: &ldquo;Well, that may be so. It is a terrible thing.  If we are not there, who will provide for the government of the country?&rdquo;  I have no doubt that the temper of the Irish people and their concern will be to see that a Government will be elected to office in opposition to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I hope that government will have a social philosophy, a national aim and some objective for which to use our freedom and right of action, something that is not merely designed to provide <i>ad hoc</i> remedies to bubbling problems as they come up, without any clear picture of what we are trying to do for our society and our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other things could be urged against this proposal.  We are now poised on a proposal that this Bill pass in a situation in which this measure is going to the people.  The arguments that will be urged will be better urged from this on at the chapel gates and wherever Irishmen happen to meet, wherever people who are concerned with the maintenance of decent, democratic freedom in this country happen to come together.  It is better that at such gatherings other arguments and those arguments would be put.  I am certain the Irish people will never take kindly to a situation in which one political oligarchy could control the livelihoods of ordinary people, that they will never accept a situation that in 144 areas throughout the country there will be a member selected by the boys, put up as the <Col N="1887" /> people's representative, controlling their way of life in a particular constituency.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have grown accustomed to the kind of freedom of expression and action, individual thought, which proportional representation has made possible in this country since 1922, and they are not going to forgo that on spurious arguments, repeating the same kind of suggestion that was made over 50 years ago when the Sinn Féin movement decided in favour of proportional representation.  At that time the British politicians were saying these were the theories of the madmen of the continent.  Today the Minister for Local Government says it.  Today we have members of our Republican Government saying so much that has been said so often before by British politicians anxious to defend a system that maintains their political posterity. It will not wash in Ireland, and I have little doubt that when this referendum takes place, it will be merely recording a decision already made.</P>
    <P>I regret the passing of this Bill.  I regret the necessity for this debate here today.  The necessity is a decision ill-motivated, ill-designed and badly considered, to divert public attention from issues much more vital, much more important.  However, if it has to be, let it be, and I hope that when this Bill passes, there will not be any shuffling of the feet, that there will not be any hesitation while the toe is put into the water to see how cold it may be.  This Bill puts bathing trunks on the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are going to take a dive into the cold water.  Let them do it and do it quickly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin):</i> I do not intend to delay the House very long.  I wish to join with the other Members of my Party in expressing my support for these proposals.  The questions we must ask in this House are: why should we have this referendum, and, when we succeed in winning it, what will it do for our country? The people today are entitled to have the same opportunity in this regard as the people had nine years ago.  Many <Col N="1888" /> other people have come on the register since then, and I believe they should get an opportunity of saying what they think of our electoral system.</P>
      <P>The point which I believe will weigh with the people in deciding how to vote on this referendum is the instability of Europe.  I would place the stability of the country first and foremost.  How it affects Deputies, who will be beaten or who will return here, is immaterial. What is really important is that, when the next general election is over, whatever Party in this House form the Government will have a majority.  We may never again have an opportunity of putting a Bill like this to the House. We realise we need a majority here in Dáil Éireann before we can put a referendum to the country.  To get a majority under our present system is very difficult.  It would be very bad for the country if, due to political instability, we experienced what other European countries are going through today.  We have had two recent examples in Belgium and Greece where, due to the fragmentation of political Parties within Parliament, they are unable to implement any decisive policy.  The same situation occurred in France before de Gaulle assumed power.  If we maintain our present electoral system it can lead to one thing only, as it has led in other countries in Europe, to instability and even to dictatorship.  The Irish people are entitled to be told the realities of the situation.  They are intelligent enough to understand what the outcome may be if the present electoral system is allowed to persist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by the Opposition Parties that we are bringing this Bill forward for one reason only, that is, to fortify ourselves in government.  The Opposition members do not really believe this.  They know as well as I do that we shall remain the largest political Party in this Dáil under the present political system.  If we continue with PR, the most we can lose in any general election is four to six seats. What would be the consequences?  We know that Fine Gael would like to form a government with the help of some other Party, but we know also that the Labour Party are determined to go it <Col N="1889" /> alone.  It has been our policy down through the years to remain an individual Party.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin):</i> Yes, to go it alone.  What would be the position in years to come under PR? We would have minority Governments that would be unable to implement policy for the benefit of the people at large.  We would have Parties on this side of the House that would have to look over their shoulder to see if they were pleasing a minority group, to see if they were pleasing a few Independents on whom they might happen to depend.  This is a deplorable type of government.  I am not referring back to anything; I am talking about the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government, in bringing these proposals forward, has no vested interest, good, bad or indifferent.  He is concerned about the country's welfare.  He is concerned not so much about what will happen today but what generations 20 or 30 years from now will think of us.  Opposition Members, of Fine Gael especially, are saying that this will wipe out the Labour Party.  I think that is completely Iudicrous.  When I look around the constituencies in Dublin, I cannot see one Labour Deputy losing his seat.  I have no hesitation in saying that Deputy Dunne, Deputy Cluskey and Deputy O'Leary will hold their seats in single-seaters because they are reasonably good workers.  I feel they will retain their seats.  So this attitude that the Labour Party will be wiped out is, in my opinion, a gimmick by Fine Gael to encourage the Labour Party to oppose this measure.  This will not happen.  We will ensure better political stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was argued yesterday by some Opposition Members that the Commission to be set up to draw up the single-seaters would not be fair.  I think Deputy Stephen Barrett even questioned the integrity of the High Court judge who will preside over the Commission. We all realise that it will be constituted from both sides of the House, three members from these benches and three from the Opposition benches, <Col N="1890" /> presided over by a High Court judge. Some Opposition Deputies implied that we cannot trust in the integrity of the High Court judge.  That is a reflection on the integrity of those men.  I have no doubt that the Commission will be fair.</P>
    <P>I entirely endorse this Bill, and I hope that the other Parties, having put their opposition to the Bill here, will not continue it in the country.  I would hope that even the Fine Gael and Labour voters would see the benefits which will accrue to this country when this is implemented.  Once and for all, we will have established a good strong democratic electoral system.  Without this the system in other countries in Europe has crumbled and democracy has vanished.  I have no doubt that it will be more difficult to uphold democracy.  If we do not get this proposal through, 20 or 30 years from now people will look back and decry us, and say we refused to give to future generations a purified form of democracy that would stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>If we continue with this complicated system of PR, we will have fragmentation of Parties in this House who are interested only in their own vested interests, and we will get nowhere with implementing good constructive policies. I am concerned about my children and about the people coming after me. When democracy crumbles, we get dictatorships. This has been proved in Germany and Italy.  We have seen it in Belgium and Greece.</P>
    <P>The people by and large will study this proposal in depth.  They will study the question posed to them.  Parish pump politics which we have had in this House over the past months should be cast aside when we are trying to explain this to the electorate.  We should say exactly what the issues are without clouding them in any way.  We should explain what our system may be in the future.  We should also point out the consequences of a bad electoral system in other countries, the fragmentation of Parties and other things it leads to.  That is what I intend to tell the voters of Dublin anyway.</P>
    <P>We should explain the issues to the people without clouding them and without any political gimmickry. <Col N="1891" /> intend to tell them exactly what is at stake.  I know the integrity of the Irish people.  I know how they will cast their votes.  I believe we will win, and when we have done so, this will be welcomed by the Opposition Members.  There is nothing wrong with this.  It is like looking at a shadow in the distance where there seems to be something bad but when you come near it, you see it has many virtues.  This will be welcomed by Fine Gael and Labour, and 20 years from now if some of us are still here, they will stand up and say they are glad the referendum was passed.</P>

      <P>Maybe you would, but you are afraid to face it.  The majority &mdash;not all, but the majority&mdash;of the two Opposition Parties are afraid of this system because they are afraid for their own individual seats.  They had not sufficient confidence in themselves to believe there is any possibility in any section of their present constituencies that they could convince a majority of the people, or more of the people than our candidate could, that they are the most suitable individuals to represent the constituency and that their policy is the most suitable policy for the country.</P>
      <P>As I say, not even Deputy O'Higgins's effort to prolong this debate by an attempt to provoke a reply from the Labour Party could succeed in maintaining the filibuster any longer.  I think the last few speakers from the Coalition benches have fairly well indicated the whole attitude to this proposal.  Deputy Esmonde was typical of the unreality and the insincerity of the Fine Gael approach.  As far as I could see, he devoted the most part of his contribution to the theme that nobody wants this proposed electoral reform.  He knows quite well that the Leader of his own political Party wants it.  It is quite obvious, indeed, from all the Fine Gael speeches, that it is only the spineless section of the Fine Gael Party who, by a small majority&mdash;a majority of one, I believe&mdash;defeated their own Leader.</P>

Of course, Fine Gael made several spasmodic efforts to obstruct the Bill and to compel as many Deputies as possible to come in here and to carry out that procedure.  On the Second Stage, it seemed quite obvious that they must have got practically everyone in the Party who is in favour of opposing this Bill to speak. They got no fewer than 21 to speak.

      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, an employer who is dismissing, on account of redundancy, a worker with four years service or more must give him at least two weeks notice in writing.  When that Act was before the House, I undertook to consider legislation to provide for reasonable minimum periods of notice generally, where employment is terminated. I have since initiated discussions on the matter with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers and these discussions are proceeding.</P>

      <P>Warnings are issued to the owners of cars which are found to be incorrectly parked at Dublin Castle.  Without the employment of a number of full-time attendants which in present circumstances would not be justified it is not possible to exercise effective control over the parking.</P>
      <P>For some time past the parking space has had to be restricted because of building operations but the basic difficulty springs from the fact that the number of car owners wishing to avail themselves regularly of the parking facilities is now much too high in relation to the available space.  The time has, therefore, come when serious consideration must be given to the question of a reduction in the number of permits for parking at the Castle.</P>

      <P>The decision to close Corvoy school and bring the children into the schools in Ballybay is in accordance with the general policy in relation to the amalgamation of small schools into larger and more efficient units and is the first step in the rationalisation of primary school accommodation in the parish of Ballybay.  It is the intention that the amalgamation will take place after the summer holidays and that the necessary additional accommodation will be provided in Ballybay in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I might add for the Deputy's information that a much broadened curriculum for national schools is at present being worked out.  Such a curriculum could not possibly be adopted in one-or two-teacher schools.</P>

Is it not true that the school term comes to an end, in fact, next Friday and nobody is expected to send children to school on Monday?  Is it not also a fact that the Minister for Education has informed me, I am sure Deputy Mooney, and the Minister for Transport and Power that he will send inspectors of his Department down to Ballybay to meet the parents and discuss their problem with them and will, in the meantime, keep an open mind until these discussions have been completed?

      <P>I understand that the pilot survey in Drogheda conducted by the Department of Social Science, UCD, in 1966, indicated that the greatest increases in demand were envisaged in precisely those categories in which there was the greatest scarcity in 1966, that is, skilled craftsmen and female semi-skilled workers and trainees.</P>
      <P>The provision of vocational education in Drogheda, however, is a matter in the first instance for the local vocational education committee who are at present providing trade, technician and business courses.

An adjusting payment of 6s 9d has been made.</P>

The Security Council Resolution was not a mandatory one.</P>

      <P>The only direct imports from Rhodesia since then have been some goods admitted under transfer of residence and an insignificant number of small personal gifts.  A total of seven licences was issued in respect of these items, but no value figure is available.</P>

If, as was done in Donegal an approach were made to alleviate the difficulty of this bottleneck of children in early adolescence by sending them to centres that would cater for them in a protective way in sheltered workshops and so on, would this not go a long way to solving the problem?</P>

      <P>We are talking about waiting lists for the admission of children.  The problem of dealing with 16-year-olds is another matter and, as I said in my reply, I regard it as a matter of some priority that severely and moderately mentally handicapped children should have sufficient places provided for them throughout the country.  When I said I hoped to be able to have a place for everybody in three years, the House will, I know, appreciate that it is not merely a question of providing physical accommodation but also a matter of providing the necessary staff.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether a survey was carried out recently in County Kerry on the admission rate of geriatrics to hospitals in the county; if so, whether the survey showed that such admission rate tends to increase; whether he will give special consideration to a proposal to initiate a pilot scheme in the county by the provision of intensive home nursing care of geriatrics; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that the health authority have had a study carried out of in-patient records covering a period of years in each of their hospitals and the report has been completed very recently.  The study of the results by the officers of the health authority will take some further time and I am, therefore, unable to supply the information regarding geriatric patients which the Deputy requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of providing adequate services for the care of the aged is <Col N="1932" /> country wide.  So far as general hospital services are concerned the report of the Consultative Council which will be published later this week includes a number of important recommendations on the geriatric services.  In addition I hope to have within a few months a report of an inter-departmental committee dealing comprehensively with the problems of the care of the aged. These reports will, I am sure, enable me to plan the development of more effective services for the care of the aged.</P>

    <P>NOTES: 1.  It is not possible at present to indicate when the individual estates mentioned will be allotted but there will be no avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>2.  During the last three complete financial years the aggregate area allotted in County Meath was approximately 6,800 acres.</P>
    <P>3.  In the case of those estates which are on hands of the Land Commission over two years, disposal has to await selection of allottees, completion of negotiations on exchanges and execution of essential improvement works, including erection of dwelling houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The selection of allottees is a matter that is exclusively reserved to the Land Commissioners.  I have ascertained from the Land Commission that applications from the persons referred to in the questions were fully considered in competition with other applications received but that, having regard to the limited acreage available for disposal &mdash;49 acres&mdash;on the Dwyer and Clancy estates, it was not found possible to provide them with allotments.  The lands were divided on 5th of this month amongst five local smallholders who were adjudged the most worthy and suitable.  Due to the small amount of land available none of the allottees could be brought up to the current family farm standard and 12 other smallholder-applicants could not be provided with any allotments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that those people have been waiting for six or seven years for the division of this land?  Is he aware also <Col N="1940" /> that there are, in the immediate vicinity, three farmers, married, with three in family in two cases and eight in family in another case, who have been refused any portion of this land? Is he further aware that it has been given to two farmers one of whom has no family and who is in very comfortable circumstances?  The inspectors made seven visits to a man with five acres and assured him he had nothing to worry about, and when the land was being divided his two cows that were grazing on this land were turned out on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, the selection of allottees is a matter which is exclusively for the Land Commissioners.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the amount of land available in this case was very small, only 49 acres, that there were a very large number of applicants, and that 12 of these applicants, smallholders, did not receive any allotment. In a case such as that, no matter how the land is divided, there will always be a considerable number of people who are dissatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree that the amount of land available was small, but will the Minister not admit that one farmer in quite comfortable circumstances was given an allocation of land as against the married man with three children having 11 statute acres only 200 yards away from this land?  Would the Minister also agree that a farmer with three children, having 13 acres and only two cows, with only a fence between him and this land, was denied portion of the land, after seven visits from an inspector? Again another local farmer with five in family, having five acres of land and paying £60 per year for grazing, and living only a quarter of a mile from each of these two farms that were divided, got none of this land, while portion of it was given to a married farmer with no children and in comfortable circumstances.  It is very hard to explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if the inspector visited this man so often he was giving very fair consideration to <Col N="1941" /> his case.  As I explained to the Deputy, these five applicants who got land were not brought up to anything like the standard of an economic holding.  The Commissioners are in a rather difficult position in relation to cases such as this.  Where there is so little land available and so many applicants, they have to decide on the people they think are for various reasons most deserving.  In this instance they have decided on five people as being the most suitable and most deserving applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the enactment of the Land Act, 1965 a reorganisation of the Land Commission was effected under which the administrative and inspectorate personnel were expanded and strengthened.  On the administrative side an additional post of assistant secretary was provided with other extra posts including one principal officer and one assistant principal officer.  On the inspectorate side, a new senior post of deputy chief inspector was created located in the West with the special responsibility of speeding up the solution of land problems in western areas.  At the same time 25 new subordinate inspectorate posts including two posts of Inspector Grade I were also provided.</P>
      <P>To deal with the new work arising from the Pilot Areas a further reorganisation of the Land Commission is now under way.  The inspectorate is being redeployed and strengthened with the creation of additional outdoor posts including one post of senior inspector and four posts of Inspector Grade I.  A reorganisation and strengthening of the administrative staffing is also under consideration.  In addition to these organisational and staffing proposals a Management Services Unit has just now been established in the Land Commission to consider and develop modern management techniques aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that when the proposals I have outlined have been brought to finality the organisation and staffing of the Land Commission will <Col N="1943" /> be adequate to deal satisfactorily with the full work programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the regulations governing the sale and purchase of land, especially in relation to people with capital buying up land in places where there are uneconomic holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The general position in relation to the sale and purchase of land is that once a holding is vested in a tenant/purchaser he is free to sell it without reference to the Land Commission provided (a) that no subdivision within the meaning of Section 12 of the Land Act, 1965, is involved; (b) that no conditions as to consolidation are being infringed; (c) that no acquisition proceedings are in progress or that the Land Commission have not served notice of intention to inspect the lands and (d) that the holding, being non-urban land, is not being sold to a person who is not a qualified person within the meaning of section 45 of the Land Act, 1965.  Under the Land Acts, the sale of land in no way impairs the Land Commission's powers to acquire that land for the relief of congestion, should such a course prove necessary.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind some particular instance where there is evidence of an undesirable agglomeration of holdings by some individuals to the detriment of local smallholders, perhaps he would communicate direct with the Land Commission, giving details of the lands concerned, and the matter will be investigated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the policy of the Land Commission in allocating lands acquired; and if it is the policy of the Commission to give additions to large holdings rather than small holdings, whose owners qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of land settlement policy is the structural reform of uneconomic holdings throughout the State with special <Col N="1944" /> emphasis on the relief of the acute congestion which prevails in Western Counties.  Under current policy, holdings and enlargements are planned to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality.  Where, however, the acreage available for distribution is insufficient to bring all the qualified and genuinely deserving smallholders within the prescribed distance up to the optimum level of 40 to 45 acres, the land is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner amongst as many of such qualified smallholders as is practicable.</P>
      <P>The selection of allottees and the determination of the size of allotments are matters that are exclusively reserved to the Land Commissioners. In deciding these matters the Commissioners have to take a variety of factors into account such as farming competence, marital status, family circumstances, etc.  I am only too well aware that, in the nature of land settlement, it is virtually impossible to formulate a scheme of division for any particular estate which will win all-round acceptance. However, every effort is made by the Commissioners to ensure that acquired lands are allocated in as equitable a manner as prevailing conditions permit.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned about a particular estate and furnishes details thereof, I shall have the matter examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This latest attempt at a filibuster by the Opposition Parties has merely served to show once again the indecisiveness and inconsistency of the attitude of the Opposition.  It provides a clear indication of the unsound and ill-considered basis of their opposition to this proposed electoral reform.  It is quite clear that their attitude is based not on conviction but on the traditional attitude of blind opposition to anything proposed by Fianna Fáil.  In fact, it is beyond doubt that the vast majority of the Opposition Deputies, if not all, appreciate that the system we propose, and in particular the system of single-seat constituencies, is best for the country from many points of view, but because of this almost inbred attitude of theirs that they must oppose anything proposed by Fianna Fáil, a small <Col N="1948" /> majority decided that this attitude should be adopted.</P>
      <P>This, of course, stems from the unreasoning fear of Fianna Fáil that has been bred all through their long history of failure in their efforts to damage Fianna Fáil and generally oust Fianna Fáil as the major party in this country. I suppose that is understandable, but it is rather a pity that this near majority of the Fine Gael Party which has some confidence in the future of the Party did not succeed in resolving the fears of individual Deputies for their own seats.</P>
      <P>The passage of this Bill through the House has been by means of fits and starts.  We have had periods of deliberate delaying tactics by both the Opposition Parties followed by periods of inaction which obviously were periods during which it was not possible for the Whips to rouse the Members to carry out the tactics that were decided on of opposing the Bill line by line.  They started off almost in the same way as in 1959 with an obvious attempt to force every Opposition Deputy into this House to speak on the Bill.  This succeeded only partially. We had 15 out of the 19 Labour Deputies making practically the same speech and 21 of the Fine Gael Deputies which, of course, is practically the maximum number of Fine Gael Deputies who are in fact in favour of the course they have adopted.  During the Committee Stage, the effort was fairly well spent.  We had merely desultory efforts to prolong the debate and, at the same time, an attempt was made to cloak up the fact that the effort to prolong the Bill was unsuccessful by adopting the pretence of being in a hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea apparently now is that the way debates should be conducted here is that as many as possible Opposition Deputies should throw as much mud as possible here and then complain when the allegations they make are replied to and insinuate that the reply to these allegations constitutes delaying tactics.  The rather spurious debate on Deputy Norton's amendment again indicated the inconsistency and indecisiveness of the Opposition Parties. They argued for the amendment and, <Col N="1949" /> at the same time, tried to argue against it.  I do not know what side they finally came down on but they certainly did not make their attitude clear because, of course, they are not clear in their own minds; their attitude to this proposal is based purely and simply on opposition to anything proposed by Fianna Fáil.  We had the same thing on the Report Stage&mdash;an indication of the lack of interest by the Fine Gael Party.  We had, for instance, amendments proposed here and then we had Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan saying: &ldquo;We shall leave that for the Seanad&rdquo;&mdash;a clear indication of where the real leadership of the Fine Gael Party resides.  Then we had this latest, obviously whipped up, filibuster on the Fifth Stage.  This was obviously the best effort of the joint coalition Whips and one Deputy after another was sent in to say practically the same thing, to repeat their Second Reading speeches.  In fact, I think that anybody who reads through the contributions made on the Fifth Stage will see quite clearly that the Opposition Deputies who spoke did not even seem to know at this stage that our proposal for electoral reform has been separated into two separate Bills and that, on the Second Stage, we were discussing the two of these Bills together whereas for the subsequent Stages, they were separated again.  Obviously, Opposition Deputies were not able to separate them in their own minds.</P>
    <P>The whole progress of the proposals through the House has indicated that, having succeeded in getting this proposal separated into separate proposals, the Opposition appear to want them put back again.  As I said, eventually this filibuster has fizzled out despite the best efforts of the Fine Gael and Labour Whips to get their Deputies to come in and to speak.</P>
    <P>However, although I appreciate that what has been happening here was merely an effort to delay the passage of the Bill, the fact that many allegations have been made imposes on me the duty to reply at least to some of these allegations.  I may say I do not intend to follow the example <Col N="1950" /> of the Opposition Deputies in making a Second Reading speech, but I intend to deal with some of the points as they were made.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is hardly surprising&mdash; certainly it is not surprising to me&mdash; that the Fine Gael Party, in particular, are displaying such confusion on this Bill.  It is rather natural that they should be confused because, when the Party was set up it had, as one of its points of policy, Opposition to the system of proportional representation. The Fine Gael Party was set up in 1933 out of the remnants of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Point 7 of the declaration of policy published at that time read:</P>
    <P>The abolition of the present proportional representation system so as to secure the more effective democratic control of national policy and to establish closer personal relationship between parliamentary representatives and their constituents.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very good summary of the case against the present system. This, as I say, having been the policy of the Fine Gael Party when it was set up&mdash;in view of that&mdash;it is only natural, I suppose, that they should now be confused.</P>
    <P>The question naturally arises: When did this cease to be Fine Gael Policy; when did the change come about?  I do not think anybody could say.  Certainly it had not come about by 1937 because, in 1937, prominent members of the Fine Gael Party were arguing strenuously against proportional representation. As reported at column 1070 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann of 25th May, 1937, volume 67, the then Deputy Patrick McGilligan is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>It was always held that, with regard to proportional representation, which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello, who subsequently became Taoiseach, is reported later on in the same volume on 1st June, 1937, column 1345, as saying:</P>
    <P>We always understood that the real defect under any system of proportional <Col N="1951" /> representation and particularly the system of the single transferable vote was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small parties being returned, making for instability in government.  That is inherent in the system of proportional representation and the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>So that whenever Fine Gael changed their attitude, it certainly was not in 1937.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. This was on the debate of the Draft Constitution, 1937.  I intend to deal with just why this system was retained in that Constitution.  As I say, Fine Gael adopted as one of the planks of their Party programme in 1933 opposition to proportional representation in principle and in particular to this system.  They had not changed their minds in 1937 nor in 1947 because in 1947 no less a person than Deputy James Dillon speaking on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1947, at column 1714, volume 108, said:</P>
      <P>Personally, I think proportional representation is a fraud and a cod, and that it should be abolished....</P>
      <P>Proportional representation is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation.  So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog.  I doubt if any other sane democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament...  It was foisted upon us by a collection of halflunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle....</P>
      <P>He ended by advising the House to vote for the Bill so that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.... we may provide our people with an opportunity of getting sick of this fantastic system and hasten the day by which we will return <Col N="1952" /> to a normal system devised to ascertain the will of the people ....</P>
    <P>So that Fine Gael had not changed their attitude to this by 1947 and nobody discovered that their attitude had changed until 1959 when there was a proposal to do this and it changed for one reason and one reason only and that was that they looked upon themselves as an Opposition with a duty to oppose anything suggested by Fianna Fáil.  As we know not all their Party has changed yet, only a majority of one on this occasion is in favour of the proposal by the spineless members of Fine Gael who oppose this electoral reform.  We know that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party still stands where his father stood in 1933 and where the Fine Gael Party stood in 1933, 1937 and in 1947 and where presumably they all believed themselves still to stand until the proposal to make this electoral reform was first&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This blind unreasoning fear of Fine Gael of anything proposed by Fianna Fáil, this inherent suspicion is bred in them, that anything proposed by Fianna Fáil must have some sinister motive, must have as its motive the destruction of Fine Gael.  We do not have to destroy Fine Gael, they will destroy themselves.  I also want to make it clear that nobody on this side of the House said that we are making this proposal for the benefit of Fine Gael.  We have no interest whatever in Fine Gael.  I do not believe that anybody can help Fine Gael and certainly I have no desire to <Col N="1953" /> do it.

We do not think they will; we are quite confident that just as we have retained the confidence and support of the people since we were founded we will continue to do so.  If we do not it will be our own fault.  If the people want to get rid of us they are quite entitled to do so and this will give them a better opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, we have no desire to help Fine Gael but those in Fine Gael who have some desire to put some backbone into the Party can see that under these conditions there will be some opportunity of doing that.  I would say that that is the reason the Leader of the Fine Gael Party wants this proposal carried.  Despite the Party that he leads he apparently has not despaired yet of some day doing something about them.  He can see that under these circumstances there will be some hope. It is a pity that these people who have some hope in the future of Fine Gael are in a minority but that is their problem and not ours.  Everybody here knows that the system we propose is the best one and that it is only being opposed by those without confidence in the future.  It is quite clear that those in the Opposition benches who are afraid of this system, afraid to stand on their own feet in single seat constituencies, who can see no future for themselves under those conditions and who cannot visualise any fraction of their present constituency in which they would be able successfully to oppose a Fianna Fáil candidate, are beginning to realise that their Leader and those who take the same view as he does will have their say despite the efforts of the small majority of the Fine Gael Party.  It is for that reason that today and yesterday we had this last minute despairing and frantic effort by the spineless majority of the Fine Gael Party to put forward their case and bolster up their courage. It is clear that they failed miserably to make any convincing case for the retention of this system.  Their contributions consisted of a combination <Col N="1954" /> of personal abuse of Fianna Fáil and individual Deputies and the imputation of base ulterior motives to Fianna Fáil, a combination of this type of tactic combined with a pathetic plea for a continuance of the system of election which is conducive to producing a situation making it feasible for Coalition Governments to be formed after the election and a pathetic plea to the Labour Party to &ldquo;walk into their parlour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, it is quite clear from the Fine Gael attitude in particular that Fine Gael opinion is coming over to the side of Deputy Cosgrave and that those who have been opposing him and are opposing him were making their last stand here to day.  I want now to deal with some of the points which were made.  First of all we had this argument about the proposed constituency commission.  Here again we had evidence of the inconsistent attitude of both of the Opposition Parties.  It was not just a question of one Deputy taking a contrary attitude to another but we had cases of the same Deputy contradicting himself in the same speech. Here again we had more evidence of the inherent fear of Fianna Fáil that animates the two Opposition Parties. They are unable to see that the job which the constituency commission would have to perform is an objective one that would have to be done in a sensible way and that any group of individuals sitting down to devise a system of single-seat constituencies would have to take practical things into consideration and that they would be quite likely to reach agreement and bring forward an agreed solution.  The Opposition insist upon looking on this commission as a question of two teams, the Opposition versus Fianna Fáil, whereas they should know, if they were capable for just one moment of getting over their fear of Fianna Fáil, that any group of individuals who will sit down and examine the situation will decide on the general lines on which to devise the single-seat constituencies.  The Opposition see this as two teams&mdash;the Opposition versus Fianna Fáil&mdash;and they immediately concede defeat; they believe, apparently, that in those circumstances, <Col N="1955" /> they cannot possibly win.</P>
    <P>First of all, they insinuated that we would in some way interfere with the selection of the Coalition team and, as soon as that fear was taken from them by writing into the Constitution what they already knew was going to be written into the law, they then turned round and started to abuse the referee, in advance of the contest, as they see it, taking place at all.  Even though the referee has not yet been selected they already have implied that he will not play fair and that imputation is based on the assumption that Fianna Fáil, as always, must win.</P>
    <P>This is a practicable job the Commission will have to do.  It is not a contest.  We have had a contradictory attitude.  Deputy Murphy, Deputy L'Estrange and some other Fine Gael Deputies argued that this Commission means nothing because the referee will be on the Fianna Fáil side and it is on that basis decisions will be made. At the same time, Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is, I presume, the chief spokesman for the Opposition on this matter, wants not one Commission but two Commissions to do the same job. Deputy Fitzpatrick has gone on record with regard to this question of the Chairman as saying at column 1328 of the Official Report of 19th June:</P>
    <P>... the Minister has offered a Commission and he says that the Chairman of the Commission is to be a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court and with that I entirely agree.</P>
    <P>His colleagues assume, apparently, that anybody appointed in that way is bound to act in a partial manner.  We had then the contention that there was something wrong in having a decision with regard to the Commission's recommendations decided by a simple majority; a majority of one could reject the recommendations.  This, again, shows how difficult it is to interpret the Fine Gael mind because, when the question of a Constituency Commission was being discussed in 1959, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins at column 946 of volume 172 of the Official Report had this to say: &ldquo;Forget about your Constituency Commission&rdquo;.  He did not <Col N="1956" /> want a Commission at all.  He said: &ldquo;Forget about your Constituency Commission.  Let the law revising constituencies be passed here through the Dáil.&rdquo;  But Deputy Fitzpatrick wants two Constituency Commissions, not just one.</P>

Of course, he would have to get the House to agree&mdash;&rdquo; and Deputy O'Higgins interjected, and said: &ldquo;Two-thirds.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach replied: &ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo;  Deputy O'Higgins asked: &ldquo;Why not a simple majority?&rdquo; Now that we have conceded a simple majority to the Opposition and require only a simple majority they are not satisfied with that either.  It is impossible to interpret the minds of the Opposition because they act in accordance with only one principle and that is that, whatever Fianna Fáil propose must have a sinister, ulterior motive, and they must, therefore, oppose it. Deputy Corish spoke in regard to this matter on 21st January, 1959, at colmn 982.</P>

    <P>The reason I favour the amendment is not so much because it retains what is embodied in the Constitution at present, but because I believe it will work and there is a certain amount of elasticity about it. At least, it gives the power to the Oireachtas to determine what the constituencies will be, what form they will take and what populations will be represented in each.  I do not <Col N="1958" /> think the system it is proposed now to enshrine in the Constitution will work.  It is crude.  As Deputy Declan Costello described it, it is putting the veneer of respectability on these other two proposals.  For that reason, I think the House should reject this part of the Schedule and adopt the amendment proposed by the two Fine Gael Deputies, or something reasonably near it.</P>

      <P>We have had it suggested and the allegation made that we had got no mandate to bring in this Bill.  Of course, this proposal is not something that the Government can implement themselves.

This was not a relevant matter at the general election because it can <Col N="1960" /> be decided only by means of a referendum. In any case, this suggestion which is apparently being made now that the Parties contesting elections should put before the people at the election the full legislative programme that they propose to carry out in the next Dáil is completely new.</P>

That type of thing has to be carried out by the Government in the period during which they are in office and the people can decide at the next general election whether or not the Government acted wisely.  This proposal certainly was not relevant at all at the general election because it is something that has to be put as a separate issue to the people. The Opposition know that what they are suggesting is completely impractical.</P>
      <P>Of course, what is worrying the Opposition is that now this will come to be decided by the people as one single clear issue and they realise that, despite their best efforts, it will be possible for us to put the facts clearly before the people this time and they, just the same as we, have no doubt but that the people's decision will be to adopt this electoral reform which we are asking them to adopt.</P>
      <P>We have the allegation that because this was put to the people nine years ago there is something undemocratic in putting it before them again.  I cannot understand that attitude.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon when speaking here yesterday said that what was right in <Col N="1961" /> 1938 might not be right in 1948 and what was right in 1948 might not be right in 1958.  He stopped there.  He did not go on to say that what was right in 1958 might not be right in 1968 but it is quite logical to continue. It is possible that what was rejected by a tiny majority in the less than clear conditions that existed in 1959 might be considered differently by a changed electorate in 1968.  For example, Deputy Dillon himself has changed his mind on a number of different things, on a number of different occasions, throughout his political career.  I have quoted what his opinion of proportional representation was in 1947.  Apparently, it was changed in 1959.  How are we to know that even Deputy Dillon himself might not have changed again by 1968? Apparently, he has not.  Apparently it is in 12 year cycles that Deputy Dillon works.</P>

      <P>We are asked what is the reason for doing this, since it was decided nine years ago.  Obviously, there is plenty of reason.  The people have had more experience of it.  They have had the disedifying example of the two long recounts at the last general election. They have seen the absurdity of the system.  They have seen the uncertainty of it, that you might as well toss a coin in a close situation as who is elected depends on what bundle of papers happens to come to the returning officer's hand or to the hand of some member of his staff, and that every time the votes were counted you could get a different result.  That is because of the inconsistency of the system, because the people whom Deputy Dillon described as cranks and crackpots who invented this system started off to try to devise a system in which votes would be distributed proportionately and had to give up the attempt because it just was not possible to do it.</P>

While I do not say that there was any demand for this change, because the people have not got any way of making such a demand, I do say that ever since the experience in Long-ford-Westmeath and Dublin North-East there has been speculation as to the likelihood of there being a proposal to get rid of this ridiculous and fraudulent system that we have.  There has <Col N="1963" /> been continuous speculation amounting almost to an assumption, that something would be done about it.  Our people have seen the results of similar systems, but systems that are not quite as bad, in continental countries.  They have the example that it has been found impossible over a period of almost six months to form a Government at all in one European country and for almost half as long a period in another. It is admitted on all sides that the system of election we have is designed to bring about that situation.  It has not done it yet.  If it had, it would not be possible to ask the people to change it.  It is admitted it is designed to foster the existence of small, sectional Parties.  It is inevitable it will have the same effect as similar systems&mdash;but systems, as the spokesmen for Fine Gael said, not as bad as ours&mdash;have had in other countries.  If the system persists here it is only a matter of time until we find ourselves in the same position that so many continental countries have found themselves in.</P>
      <P>We believe that the people do not want that type of situation.  I know there are some sections of the community that would like that type of situation, that would like a situation of chaos in which it would be impossible to form a Government.  But we do not believe that the people in general want that type of situation.  We believe that, having seen what this gives rise to in other countries, the people will now take the opportunity of warding off that danger and they will provide themselves with the more rational system of election and representation we propose, at the same time gaining substantial other benefits for themselves in being better represented and in having Deputies who will be able to devote a reasonable amount of their time to their functions as members of the Legislative Assembly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition&mdash;I think this also was a relevant factor in our decision to give the people this opportunity&mdash;there is the fact that we hold an annual Árd Fheis, composed of delegates from all the different branches of our organisation. That Árd Fheis passed a resolution, <Col N="1964" /> put forward by a number of different cumainn, calling for a system of single-seat constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are 100 per cent unanimous on this matter.  The proposal we are making now not only is designed to ward off the dangers inherent in the present system and to obtain the advantages of the more rational system of representation of the single-seat constituency for the people, but it will also establish in this country for the first time the fundamental democratic principle of one man, one vote.  It will ensure that every person's vote is treated in exactly the same way, that everybody's opinion will carry the same weight.  That is the object of the straight vote part of this proposal&mdash;to get rid of the discrimination inherent in the present system.  We have every reason to believe that the people will do what we ask them to do and that they will, in fact, succeed in averting the danger <Col N="1966" /> that threatens them and which is so apparent from some parts of the Continent of Europe.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have told us that this system has served us well.  Their arguments to this effect were typical of the contradictory nature of their whole approach.  They point to the fact that under the present system we have got at present a small number of Parties represented in the Dáil as one of its advantages.  The fact we only have three Parties, they say, proves there is nothing wrong with the system.  Then they go on to argue in favour of the present system that it ensures representation for small Parties.  If it does, it obviously encourages the formation of small Parties.  It has had the effect of producing a number of small Parties here before and inevitably it will have this effect again.</P>
      <P>At present it is quite true that we have not got a large number of small Parties represented in the Dáil.  Maybe Deputy Costello gave us an indication as to how that is so.  He said that in circumstances where there are no major economic issues the system is bound to give rise to a large number of small Parties in the Dáil.  Of course, there are still major economic issues in this country.  Although it is 11 years ago since there was a Coalition Government here, the people have not yet forgotten that.  It is still a major issue to make sure that a Coalition Government, comprised of people watching their opportunity to spring the trap on their colleagues, will never again get control of the country's economic affairs.</P>

Eventually, with the passage of time, this will not loom so large in the public mind and we shall drift back again to the small Parties. <Col N="1967" /> The system is admittedly designed to accommodate and foster them.  The Opposition are pointing to the nonexistence of small Parties at present as an advantage and also to the fact that the system is designed to produce small Parties as an advantage.  We have been fortunate here in that we have had this system and that it has not yet had its inevitable effect.  That is because we have always had major issues.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told this is a democratic system.  The opposite is, in fact, the case.  The whole theory of the system we propose to replace is fundamentally opposed to the theory <Col N="1969" /> of democracy which is surely that the will of the majority should prevail. This is a system which arranges or tries to arrange so far as possible that in any close situation the decision will be made not by the majority but by the smallest minority.  It is a system which allocates multiple votes to the smallest minority and only one to those who have reasonable political views, that is, if you can measure reasonableness by the number of their fellow citizens agreeing with those views.</P>
      <P>I showed here already that this system operates on the exact opposite principle and that people in the smallest minority, those who can find only a minimum number in the constituency to agree with them, get as many votes as they like, the number being controlled only by the number of candidates, whereas those who find a reasonable number of their fellow voters to agree with them get one vote only.  This is a system which gives special differential treatment to some members of the community selected in an arbitrary way and gives only one vote to others who have not done anything to disqualify themselves from getting the same consideration of their views as anybody else in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins gave what he himself admitted was an extreme example of 3,002 votes for one candidate, 3,001 for another, 2,999 for a third and 2,998 for a fourth.  His own description of it as an extreme example is nearly sufficient.  Outside of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, I doubt if it would be possible to imagine such a situation actually arising.  Even if it did, that is what the people would have decided and it is not possible to establish that there is an absolute majority in favour of any particular candidate unless the people themselves say so.  There is no other way of discovering it.  Even in the extreme example of Deputy O'Higgins there is no way of deciding that there is an absolute majority in favour of one of the four candidates if the people have said that there is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also posed the possibility of a constituency of three candidates, one getting 4,000 votes, another 3,500 and <Col N="1970" /> the third 3,000 and he said that if the candidate who gets the greatest number of votes is declared elected it means that there are 4,000 in favour of him and 6,500 against him.  But if you declare one of the other candidates elected&mdash;the second candidate, say&mdash; there are 3,500 in favour of him and 7,000 against him.  If you declare the third candidate elected there are 3,000 in favour of him and 7,500 against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can say that there is a majority in favour of one candidate except the people and if they do not say it, it is completely unjustifiable to invent a mathematical way of allocating the votes cast for one particular candidate to other candidates. Certainly, the basis on which it is done in this system is the most undemocratic conceivable.  It is not necessary to take what Deputy O'Higgins described as an extreme example to demonstrate this.  It is only necessary to look at the result of any by-election that was not decided on the first count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At another stage in this debate, I directed the attention of the Opposition to the one swallow that makes their summer, the one by-election out of seven in which their candidate was &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected&mdash;because he certainly was not elected.  He was &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected in accordance with this system.  Deputy Timmins was declared elected with 8,035 votes out of a total poll of 26,293 which is slightly over 30 per cent.  In other words, under this system we have had elected a man who was opposed by almost 70 per cent of the voters, and he was declared elected only by discriminating against a number of the voters, because there were 8,035 people who voted for him; there was a total poll of 26,293, and that means that there were 18,258 who voted for candidates other than the candidate who was &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected.  Of these, as I pointed out, 8,470 were given at least one other vote; some of them were given two, three, four and others as many as five different votes&mdash;8,470 selected in an arbitrary and undemocratic <Col N="1971" /> way out of the total of 18,258 who voted for candidates who were not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected in accordance with the weird and wonderful operations of this system of PR which we operate in this part of the country due to no fault of our own.</P>
    <P>I invited Deputies opposite to explain just why it is that the 9,788 who did not get the same attention paid to their votes should be treated as second-class citizens; what they had done to disqualify themselves from getting similar treatment.  I pointed out that from the results of the fourth count, as it is called, it was quite obvious that if everybody in that election was treated in the same way, and if these people whose candidate was not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected got the same treatment as the others, we would have established that there was an overall majority in that constituency in favour of two candidates at least, and, of course, there cannot be a majority in favour of two.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the reason you get that absurd result is that the basic assumption on which the whole system is based is a ridiculous one, and the basic assumption is that a preference vote to any degree, in this case as much as a fifth preference, is entitled to the same value as the first preference of other voters.  When you adopt a ridiculous assumption like that, you are bound to arrive at a ridiculous result.</P>
    <P>I also gave a simple numerical example of three candidates contesting a single seat either in a by-election or at the concluding stages of a count in a general election, with the votes being distributed in accordance with this principle.  I showed from the example, which is nothing like as extreme as Deputy O'Higgins's, that it was quite conceivable you could find a majority in favour of each of the three of them, all because of this basically absurd assumption that preference votes should be accorded the same value as actual votes.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid the fraudulence of the whole system being exposed this treatment is given to some voters only and they are selected in a completely <Col N="1972" /> loaded against people who have displayed reasonably responsible views in the election by voting for candidates who were able to get a reasonable amount of support in the constituency.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the same thing applied in the East Limerick by-election, that there was a total poll of 38,037, that 16,638 voted for Deputy O'Malley and that there were 21,399 who voted for other candidates, but that of those 21,399, 11,248 got a second vote and some got a third vote, but the other 10,151 got one vote only.  I say there is no reason or justification for that discrimination.  It is a fundamental principle of democracy that everybody's vote should be treated in the same way.  It is completely wrong and completely undemocratic arbitrarily to classify some people in a constituency as being second-class citizens and not entitled to the same voting rights as the remainder. This is something that happens at every election.</P>
    <P>There was talk here about the wasted vote phenomenon, whatever that means.  If people decide to vote for candidates who will get a negligible vote, or even if they decide to vote for a candidate who does not happen to get sufficient support to be elected, they are quite entitled to do that; but what is wrong and what is undemocratic is to take those votes after they have been cast in the election and give them to people for whom they were not cast.  In any system of election some people are bound to pick the winner and some the loser, and this ridiculous and discriminatory rule is not justified.</P>
    <P>The pretence that this system of dealing with the votes after the election avoids votes being wasted is easily seen to be a complete and absolute fraud.  There are wasted votes in this way in every election.  The only thing that this does is to ensure that the smallest minority's votes will not be wasted, but that the votes of those who are in reasonable agreement with a substantial number of their fellow electors will be the ones most likely to be wasted.  At the last general arbitrary way, but in a way that is <Col N="1973" /> election under this system which claims to deal with this &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo;, as they call it, of wasted votes, there were constituencies in which the number of wasted votes exceeded the quota, that is, considering as wasted both those that were non-transferable and those which were for a candidate who was in the last count but was not elected, the non-transferable votes, of course, being the votes of people who refused to take part in this farcical electoral system.</P>
    <P>We were told here in this debate that the system we propose must result in a one-Party dictatorship, that it must perpetuate the Fianna Fáil Party in office.  Nobody indicated just how or why this should happen.  The circumstances in which elections will be conducted under the system we propose will be completely clear-cut.  We shall have 144 separate constituencies, and in each of these constituencies each party proposing a form of Government &mdash;with proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs&mdash;will devise the best policy they can get, put forward the best candidate, and his task will be to convince the electorate in a reasonably small area that he is the most suitable man to represent them and the policy for which he stands is the most suitable policy.</P>
    <P>When the Opposition Parties say that elections conducted in these clear-cut circumstances must result in the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil in government, must result in what they describe as a one-Party dictatorship, they are clearly admitting that it is inconceivable at any time in the future that they will be able to devise a policy or attract sufficient suitable representation to their Party to convince in the majority of the constituencies more people than we can, that their proposals are the most suitable, and that their candidates are the most suitable as public representatives.  If they want to admit that, that is their own business, but it is clearly an admission that Fianna Fáil policy is in fact the best, or else it is a continued assertion of what we know to be the actual belief of the Opposition Parties, that is, <Col N="1974" /> their belief that the people are incapable of making an intelligent decision.</P>

      <P>In the next breath Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to try and deny that the system would in fact give stability.  That is typical of the contradictory attitude they adopted right through the debate.  It was put forward as an objection to this scheme that the system would give rise to a Government without an absolute majority of the votes.  It is conceivable, but it could happen only if there were not an absolute majority of voters for any one Party.  So far as I could see this was an argument in favour of Deputy Norton's amendment but the Opposition Parties did not support it when they had the opportunity.</P>

      <P>I showed that this system of the transferable vote cannot and does not change what the people have said in the ballot boxes.  There is not, in fact, any way of establishing a majority in favour of one Party or one candidate unless the people do so. Any attempt to prove otherwise by the manipulation of votes after they are cast is a fraud and a cod, as Deputy Dillon described it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strongest argument so far as I could see put forward by Fine Gael against the proposal is that this is what they call the British system.  The fact that it operates in Britain apparently is a reason why it should not operate here.  I admit that in so far as it is the situation that it is the system in operation in Britain, it could be described as the British system, but it is also the system that operates in most other stable democracies.  There are two British systems involved here. The system we have here is also a British system.  The difference is that one is the system the British have for themselves and the other is the system <Col N="1975" /> that these cranks and crackpots whom Deputy Dillon described invented for us and people like us, and inflicted upon us for definite purposes.</P>
    <P>So, there are two British systems involved here, one which was imposed on us, and which we are suggesting the people should get rid of, and adopt instead the system the British retained for themselves.  They considered the possibility of changing it and rejected it.  They set up a Royal Commission to consider the system we have as an electoral system and decided that this system which was invented in Britain was all right for us, but certainly was not all right for them, and they made sure not to adopt it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of why and how it was imposed here, it was introduced here and imposed here in the Local Elections Bill which was introduced by the British Attorney-General, Mr. Samuels.  I want to quote now from volume 114, columns 175 and 176 of Hansard.  Speaking on the reasons for asking the British Parliament to pass the Local Elections Bill which would introduce this system here but not in his own country Mr. Samuels said:</P>
    <P>At the general election, on the parliamentary franchise, 75 per cent of the representation has gone over to the Sinn Féin Party.  What is the declared object of that Party? It is to make local government in Ireland absolutely impossible, and to break down British reign and rule in Ireland by capturing local bodies...</P>
    <P>Who are you going to trust the administration of these things to? Are you going to trust them to bodies elected on the present franchise and under the present machinery&mdash;bodies which have been absolutely captured by people who call the rest of the United Kingdom `the enemy', and whose object is to break down the rule of the `enemy' and make the whole administration in Ireland impossible.</P>
    <P>In other words this system was introduced into this country by a British Act of Parliament in 1919 in order to frustrate the attempts of the people <Col N="1976" /> of this country to break down British rule and establish rule by the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Why did Mr. de Valera put it into the 1937 Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to that. We are coming to the question of the 1937 Constitution.  Having already dealt with Deputy Dillon's different changes of view on this matter, I propose to go on to deal with the question of the Constitution of 1937.  Before I deal with that, I want to deal with another allegation made by Deputy Dunne that the system of the straight vote was invented by the ruling clique in Great Britain to keep themselves in power.  In fact, there was no need for anyone to invent the system we are proposing of the straight vote with the single-seat constituencies.  It was obviously the simplest and most natural system, giving the people the choice of a number of candidates and the opportunity to vote for the one they favoured and thought was the most suitable to represent them.  It was the limited franchise which kept the Ascendancy classes in power and the extension of the franchise which changed this.  The clear-cut system of election in fact facilitated the ousting of the Ascendancy.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that this system operates in Britain and the system we have does not operate in Britain.  It was invented there.  In fact, there is a special PR society in existence for the purpose of promoting this system, but not of promoting it in their own country apparently.  So far as I know, they operate over here only, and their only objective is to ensure that we do not get rid of this system with all its inherent dangers.</P>

      <P>So far as I know, they operate over here only.  I do not know who finances them.  I know they campaign at by-elections on behalf of Fine Gael and Labour, but so far as I know, they do not conduct their operations in <Col N="1977" /> their own country.  There is no attempt to secure the benefits of this system for their own country.</P>
      <P>Since Deputies are so worried about it, I might as well deal with the 1937 Constitution.  Deputy Dillon, for instance, will remember just exactly what was being done in 1937.</P>
