      <P>I do not foresee any decrease in over-all employment in 1969 arising out of the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  In fact, I expect total employment in that year to show an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (Acting Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of the stamp duty of five shillings on administration bonds in District Probate Registries is required to be made by impressed stamp as, under stamp duty law, payment of duty exceeding 2/6 may not be denoted by the use of adhesive stamps. In Cork and Dublin the duty on administration bonds is payable at the local Stamping Offices and elsewhere at post offices.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Taoiseach not aware that court fees on probate cases are payable by means of adhesive stamps and it appears to be only in the case of the stamp on the bond, which amounts to 5/-, that it is necessary to have an impressed stamp?  This entails sending the bond up to the Four Courts in Dublin and having it stamped and would the Taoiseach not consider that matters would be simplified considerably if the regulations were changed to permit the use of an adhesive stamp which could be purchased in the local post office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must admit that, but as I said to Deputy Barrett if he, or Deputy Fitzpatrick, can indicate cases of difficulty I will certainly have them looked into.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that a new school is urgently required at Corofin.  The preparation of plans is in hands but there has been delay in getting information from the county council regarding the <Col N="638" /> water supply.  As soon as this has been cleared the plans will be completed, bills of quantities prepared and tenders invited.

There is a strike on there at the moment.  I have made repeated representations about this matter over the last two years.  I have sent the Minister a cutting from the <i>Herald</i>, Tuam, with a photograph of the children on strike and a letter also from the reverend manager.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the very serious damage caused by the recent flooding of the River Moy, despite the operation of the arterial drainage scheme; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Arterial drainage schemes are not designed to prevent all flooding&mdash;it would be entirely uneconomic to do so.  The recent abnormal rainfall&mdash;4&rdquo; in 40 hours&mdash; produced flows exceeding the design capacity of the River Moy scheme and led to some flooding of short duration. The improved channels functioned very satisfactorily and were able to clear the floods in two days in the worst hit areas; formerly this would have taken weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that scores of people had to flee their homes and that crops, particularly potatoes, were ruined as a result of the flood?  Is he further aware that Ballylaghan Bridge on the main road between Foxford and Castlebar was flooded to a depth of 18 inches? I saw the flooding and the evacuation of the people.  What steps does the Parliamentary Secretary propose to take to prevent this happening in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can take no steps whatsoever to prevent the incidence of extremely heavy rainfall, but I would point out to Deputy O'Hara that this particular <Col N="640" /> rainstorm between 30th October and 2nd November was the worst in living memory; four inches of rain fell in 40 hours and this produced flooding, not only in the Moy area but all over the West.  I am aware of the losses sustained by the people, not only in the Moy valley but in the country generally and particularly in the West where the storm was most severe.  The work done on the Moy Drainage Scheme proved very satisfactory indeed in coping with that rainstorm because the flooded areas were cleared very rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  May I inquire if he is aware that on this occasion, though it could easily have happened, there was no snow on the mountains?  I admit the rainfall was extraordinary, but is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that people have lost furniture, crops and everything and are living in terror, particularly in Foxford, Twomore, Meelick, Straide, Clongee and Ballina, of a repetition of this flooding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if in view <Col N="641" /> of the increased freight charges which farmers and people in the cattle trade have to bear arising out of recent decisions by the British and Irish Steampacket Company he will now abolish the existing restrictions on the haulage of livestock in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided last December to extend the scope of operation of any existing carrier merchandise licence which permits carriage within a restricted area, so as to authorise carriage operations throughout the State.  Under this concession over 700 hauliers, excluding over 100 who are already authorised for State-wide livestock carriage, are entitled to have their licences extended for country wide carriage of livestock and to date over 520 have availed themselves of this concession.</P>
      <P>I recently set up a study group to examine the desirability or otherwise of general long-term measures to liberalise haulage for reward.  I have directed the group to give urgent priority to consideration of the livestock question and I hope to have their recommendations within a very short time; I will then be able to consider what, if any, further action I should take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is fully aware of the very undesirable position that exists.  The people who, in the main, are doing cattle haulage are running into corners hiding away from the Garda Síochána.  CIE do approximately three per cent of the total haulage.  Could the Minister explain why he is so reluctant to clear up this situation, a situation to which everybody in the trade is opposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that CIE reduced their charges for cattle recently in order to get more traffic.  We have already taken a number of steps, as the Deputy knows, to relieve the situation, including the plating of private vehicles and having licensed carriers at fairs and marts. There is also the question of the viability of the position in which licensed carriers would find themselves <Col N="642" /> if there were complete liberalisation. All this, as well as the position of CIE, has to be examined.  I hope we will find a satisfactory solution.  I agree the position needs to be considered very urgently, but the fact is there are undoubted evasions of the law and there have been prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the present position that CIE is, in fact, a licensing authority on its own and, if a man rings up from a particular area and says he cannot get a CIE truck, CIE can license a local carrier to do the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a very large number of licensed carriers.  The question is whether they and CIE together can operate the livestock haulage business satisfactorily or whether something more needs to be done.  The Deputy must be aware there are 1,000 licensed carriers in the country, of whom 520 have availed of this livestock licence in addition to the 100 who already had such a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

Is there any civilised community in the world where power and <Col N="644" /> light are available in which potential consumers are told that their application for power or light will not even be considered for three years from the date on which it is made?</P>

      <P>It is possible that ours is the only institution that tells the truth.  The position is that this is a post-development scheme that is being conducted on a planned basis.  The indications are that it will take from three to five years to get rural electricity to the areas re-canvassed and to get the work done.  I do not think there is any reason why we should say anything but the truth.</P>

Does the Parliamentary Secretary think it proper in a country which has a complete monopoly over electric power and light in rural areas to authorise a State established monopoly to inform citizens of the State that their applications will not be considered for three years from the date on which they are made?  Outside Saudi Arabia I do not believe any such prerogative is claimed.</P>

I have no evidence or complaint that this is contributed to by unloading of coal boats at a point further away.  My information is that it is the intention to remove coal yards and wharves to another position in the port area within the next few years.

      <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for taking this question at short notice.  Is he aware that this problem of coal dust is the straw that will break the camel's back?  Because of the fact that the original plan to instal a dust extractor in the building was scrapped the people working there are now working under worse conditions than in the old sorting office.  Is he aware that the windows can be opened on one side only because from unloading the bags coal dust gets in and adds to the dust from the mail bags?

I am annoyed that we have not made sufficient progress in dealing with the problem of getting the coal yard removed. Apart from the fact that we are trying to get the coal yard moved to another part of the portal area, all possible steps are being taken.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the statutory assessment of housing needs submitted by Clonmel Corporation under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, <Col N="653" /> the estimated net need for local authority dwellings in the four-year period ending in March, 1971, is 141.  To meet this need, 37 houses have already been provided by the Corporation.  Detailed proposals for a further scheme of 118 houses at Cashel Road were approved by me on the 4th instant, and contract documents are now being prepared by the Corporation with a view to the early invitation of tenders.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the serious housing shortage in many towns in County Mayo; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Mayo County Council that a scheme of six houses has been completed in Crossmolina to cater for the existing housing needs of the town; that sites are being acquired by them for schemes of ten houses in Belmullet and Claremorris to meet the present estimated housing needs; that they are not aware of any sizeable housing needs in other non-municipal towns in the county area; and that they are concentrating all their available resources in the first instance on meeting emergency and other urgent housing needs in the rural areas of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the urban areas in the county, in Ballina the National Building Agency Ltd. have recently completed a scheme of 12 houses for the Urban District Council and I have recently authorised the Council to get them to build a further 22 houses.  In Castlebar a scheme of 24 houses has been undertaken by the Agency for the Urban District Council and is nearing completion.  The Council have <Col N="654" /> already acquired two sites, comprising approximately 40 acres, for local authority houses and private sites.  In Westport, the Agency have been authorised by me to provide 48 houses on behalf of the Urban District Council and plans for the scheme are well advanced.  The Council also intend to develop land for 60 private housing sites.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have been consistently pressing Mayo County Council to make better progress in solving their housing problem and will continue to do so.  Special periodic visits have been made locally by officers of my Department and close liaison has been established with officers of the Council, in order that we may co-operate fully in their effort to expand housing output.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that reply and despite the lengthy reply of the Minister for Local Government, surely he must be aware that in many towns like Foxford, Swinford, Castlebar and Killala there is still an urgent need for workmen's houses?  What steps does the Minister propose to take to see that these houses are erected and provided for these people?  Many are young people who would like to get married but they have no houses to go to and they are unable from their own resources to provide these houses themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, provides that any person concerned in a dispute, question or difficulty under the Act may apply to the county registrar to have the matter determined by arbitration.  The clear intention of the Act is that arbitrations should be as informal and as inexpensive as possible.  For that reason no provision is made for procedural formalities by way of prescribed application forms or otherwise.  An ordinary letter suffices for the application, and the county registrar notifies the other party concerned in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received no complaints that <Col N="665" /> this simple procedure has given the parties to applications under the Act any difficulty whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No rules of court have been made dealing with arbitrations or appeals under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  The circuit court rules committee are at present engaged in drawing up rules relating to appeals to the circuit court under section 22 of the Act.  I understand that the committee expect to submit these for my approval in the near future.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the Act or elsewhere for the making of rules or regulations by county registrars in relation to procedure under the Act.  I am not aware of any formalities which may have been laid down, settled, recommended or established by county registrars in the exercise of their functions under the Act.  Indeed, there is no need for any such formalities.  A ground rent arbitration is a statutory arbitration to which the Arbitration Act, 1954 applies.  As in the case of other statutory arbitrations, the procedure is a matter for the arbitrator concerned.</P>

      <P>Some of the men concerned were in receipt of ration allowance prior to commencing work on the film because they lived out of barracks.  While they were working on the film, however, they were accommodated in barracks and the ration allowance ceased to be paid to them because they were in receipt of rations in kind in the form of meals, some of which were supplied to them in barracks and some on the film set.

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was discharged from the Army in 1945 and was in receipt of a pension from my Department which was being paid to him at an English address.  His death in 1966 was notified by a person resident at the same address and the usual forms were issued to the informant to enable the legal personal representative to claim the balance of pension.  No further communication was received until 1968 when a member of deceased's family called to my Department and arrangements were then made to pay the balance due to the estate.  Normally notification of the death of a pensioner is received from his next-of-kin but in this case it appears that the deceased was not in contact with his family in Ireland prior to his death.  My Department had no way of knowing that this was the case.</P>

Is he not further aware what the feelings of distress, anxiety and dismay to which the family were subject are due to and does he not consider that the family should have been informed having regard to the fact that the ex-Army man's Irish address at Clonmel must surely have been known to the Army authorities? Does he not consider it a grave omission on the part of the Department that the family were not informed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Interim Report dated 13th December, 1967 of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I begin I would point out that in this respect I approached the Taoiseach and asked him if he would change his mind and allow it to be discussed in Government time.  I did that as I was anxious to have a discussion in as non-partisan a fashion as possible.  He was kind enough to agree <Col N="757" /> to my suggestion and for that I now wish to thank him.</P>
    <P>This matter may seem at first sight a small matter between two officials. Actually, there are fundamental principles involved.  Those of you who have read the interim report will understand that it concerns the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General derives his authority on two bases, on a Constitutional basis and a statutory basis.  His Constitutional basis I will give from Article 33 of the Constitution, page 108 which reads:</P>
    <P>1.  There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>2.  The Comptroller and Auditor General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>3.  The Comptroller and Auditor General shall not be a member of either House of the Oireachtas and shall not hold any other office or position of emolument.</P>
    <P>4.  The Comptroller and Auditor General shall report to Dáil Éireann at stated periods as determined by law.</P>
    <P>That is the exact wording which was laid down in the original Constitution in 1922.  It has been represented that the statutory position is less satisfactory. The Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923, stated that the working of his Department was to be carried out in accordance with the 1866 and 1921 British Acts.  Some doubt has been expressed as to whether this matter came within the realm of the Adaptation Act, 1922.  It has also been suggested that it is outdated because it is 100 years old. Commercial audit and company law have kept pace with the times but the statutory law in connection with State Departments has remained unchanged since 1866.  In practice of course the Gladstonian concept of audit limited to regularity, has for many years been <Col N="758" /> developed and expanded to meet the conditions of modern society by our Comptroller and Auditor General as has been the practice in most modern States.  I would direct the attention of the House to page 6 of the interim report which I quote:</P>
    <P>We always in the Department of Finance supported his investigation, not just of regularity, but also of economy in the carrying out of policy decisions.  We are concerned as the Finance Department with helping him in investigations designed to ensure that there is no failure to get value for money, that there is no inefficiency or waste or inadequate financial control.  I would like to emphasise that this is a function of the Comptroller and Auditor General which goes back many, many years.  There is nothing essentially new about it.  I think that what is new, as probably the Comptroller and Auditor General will confirm, is that this has got an increasing emphasis in recent years.  That is all I would like to say for the moment.</P>
    <P>That is the contribution in evidence given on the 30th November, 1967, by Mr. Whitaker, Secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Now, to give a short résumé of the position as it has developed.  In paragraph 2 of his Report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1966-67 the Comptroller and Auditor General states that he requested three files which appeared to relate to travelling expenses of a Garda Superintendent; the supply of medicines to Gardaí in Dublin; and an organisation and methods report relating to the payment of witnesses expenses.  The Accounting Officer suggested to him that his request be withdrawn because he saw objection, in principle, to making available any papers which might contain administrative directions or arguments of a policy character and matters of that kind.  The Comptroller and Auditor General informed the Accounting Officer that he rejected his suggestion and that the matter would be reported to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In this way the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I had the honour <Col N="759" /> to be Chairman, was called upon to investigate and we took evidence from the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice, the Secretary, Department of Finance, and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The question raised is of such fundamental importance to our democratic processes that the Committee decided to present to the House an interim report with the minutes of evidence appended.</P>
    <P>I propose to briefly review the evidence tendered to the Committee.  The case for the Department of Justice was based on a contention that the Comptroller and Auditor General had no statutory right to demand papers relating to administration or policy proper. His powers are set out in the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866 and 1921 and in the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923. Section 28 of the 1866 Act states that &mdash; the Comptroller and Auditor General shall have free access, at all convenient times, to the books of accounts and other documents relating to the accounts.  But the Accounting Officer was prepared to concede that down the years a system had evolved where Departments recognised that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have the right to inquire into any questions of extravagance or waste in administrative matters which arose out of items of expenditure which the Audit Office had been looking into.</P>
    <P>The Accounting Officer further appeared to contend that the Comptroller and Auditor General had changed his procedure for obtaining information, but this was denied by the Comptroller and Auditor General who maintained that audit queries were usually issued after examination of departmental files.  The Accounting Officer also mentioned that he had obtained an opinion from the Attorney General which, from the extracts he quoted, appeared to indicate that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine departmental files or papers were restricted by law and that the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts were also limited by the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In a statement supplied to the Committee, <Col N="760" /> the Secretary of the Department of Finance states that it has always been the view of that Department that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be facilitated in investigations designed to ensure that in the carrying out of policy there is no failure to get value for money, no waste or inadequate financial control.  This important function has the sanction of custom and good sense rather than of an express statutory provision.  It is admitted that there is a rather narrow legislative definition of the scope and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General's activities.  The Department of Finance felt that, in view of the responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General in our system of Government, it would be unfortunate if his access to official documents were to become strictly a matter of legal definition.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General told the Committee that his report on the accounts must include a statement that he obtained all the information and explanations that he required.  He considered that he must be the judge of what papers or information he needed and that this had been accepted generally by the Departments for over 40 years.  His practice was to get the background information from departmental papers so that he could judge whether there were grounds for an audit query which would put the Accounting Officer on notice that a particular matter might be reported to Dáil Éireann.  He could scarcely be interested in police files or matters of that kind but, if such files were referred to in the accounts submitted to him, he might ask to see them.  The production of papers is a fundamental business as far as audit in any context is concerned and the Comptroller and Auditor General felt that he could not properly discharge the duties imposed on him by the Constitution if the Accounting Officers were permitted to withhold papers requested in the course of audit or to carefully select papers to be shown to the Auditor.</P>
    <P>In the course of its deliberations the Committee learned that the British Committee of Public Accounts many years ago felt that no Department <Col N="761" /> should have a right to refuse information, even though of a highly confidential character, to the Comptroller and Auditor General if he requires it to discharge his duties.  It was also told that there had been no previous difficulty that had not been surmounted in getting papers from the Accounting Office of the Department of Justice or, indeed, from other Departments.</P>
    <P>One appreciates that the Department of Justice must be careful and that, in the nature of things, security must impose its own rules.  But the Comptroller and Auditor General is in a special position holding a quasi-judicial Office, one of the organs of the Constitution which is thoroughly safeguarded in the public interest.  If it is found that under existing law he may be delayed or obstructed in obtaining all the documents or papers he judges to be necessary then the law relied upon &mdash; which is 101 years old &mdash; should be revised and brought into line with modern thinking.  Although I have learned that in England the Audit Office do not remember a case where even secret documents were withheld so long as to bring the Comptroller and Auditor General to complain to the House of Commons, Dáil Éireann is now faced with this delicate problem.</P>
    <P>I understand that the position of the auditor in private practice is thoroughly safeguarded by the Companies Act, 1963, and that he could be found guilty of negligence if he failed to obtain documents necessary for the completion of his audit.</P>
    <P>More appropriately, however, I looked up legislation enacted by this House in 1941.  I refer to the Local Government Act, 1941, Section 86, which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a Local Government Auditor may, by giving notice in writing to any person, require such person to attend before him to give evidence &mdash; on oath if necessary &mdash; or to produce any books, deeds, contracts, accounts, vouchers, maps, plans, or other documents in his custody or control.  There is a penalty for failure in this respect.  It would seem that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be placed in a not inferior position to that of the Local Government Auditor.</P>
    <P>I was also able to check on the position <Col N="762" /> in the United States of America. I found that the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, provides that all departments and establishments shall furnish to the Comptroller such information regarding the powers, duties, activities, organisation, financial transactions and methods of business of their respective offices as he may from time to time require of them; and the Comptroller General, or any of his assistants or employees when duly authorised by him, shall for the purpose of securing such information, have access to and the right to examine any books, documents, papers or records of such department or establishment.  This Act also contains provision for the Comptroller General to make recommendations looking for greater economy or efficiency in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that this House should not even be suspected of encouraging any Minister or civil servant to withhold papers which the Comptroller and Auditor General wishes to see.  Indeed, he should be commended for interpreting his task more widely so as to cover the administrative processes involved in the collection and spending of public moneys.  But, at the moment, his rights have been challenged on an interpretation of the law, and the position must be put in order by this House.</P>
    <P>I made some inquiries to find out what the position was in this regard in other countries, as I felt the matter was of such extreme importance.  A questionnaire issued in 1963 by the Permanent International Secretariat in Vienna of Supreme Audit Institutions to member countries requesting information on the legal basis and organisation of Supreme State Audit Institutions included the following questions:</P>
    <P>1.  Has the Institution the right of perusal of all the documents it may choose to request (not only vouchers, but also records, correspondence, contracts, etc.)?</P>
    <P>2.  Are the auditing officials empowered to demand all the verbal information they deem necessary?</P>
    <P>3.  As regards the powers of control as covered by questions 1 and 2 are there any restrictions imposed on the Institution in respect of supreme <Col N="763" /> government organs (head of State, members of government, etc.)?</P>
    <P>With the exceptions mentioned below all the replies received were affirmative in the case of questions 1 and 2 and negative in the case of 3.</P>
    <P>In Germany the reply to question 1 indicated that the personal ministerial papers of a Federal Minister could be made available to the State Audit Institution only with the Minister's agreement, but otherwise there was no limitation to the Institution's right to peruse documents.</P>
    <P>The replies to question 3 indicated that in Belgium and Holland Royal Family papers were excepted; in France special ministerial and Parliamentary funds were excepted but were audited by a special commission on which the Audit Institution was represented; in Germany Budget legislation permits specified individual items to be withdrawn from the Audit Institution as in the case of grants in aid in Ireland; in Sweden papers of the Cabinet are not subject to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Among the 68 countries who replied to these three questions were Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Holland, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Venezuela.</P>
    <P>Article 15, subsection (10), page 38 of the Constitution states that each House of the Oireachtas shall make its own rules and Standing Orders. Standing Order 127 which gives statutory authority to the Public Accounts Committee reads:</P>
    <P>There shall be a Select Committee to be designated the Committee of Public Accounts for the examination of the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums operated by Parliament to meet the public expenditure and of such other accounts laid before Parliament as the Committee may think fit...  The Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and to report from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee takes evidence from Accounting Officers of each Department, usually the Secretary <Col N="764" /> of a Department but not necessarily, and publishes an annual report with minutes of evidence incorporating a minute from the Minister for Finance on the Report.  The Committee depends largely on the Comptroller and Auditor General who, as well as presenting his own Annual Report, furnishes the Committee with information based on his audit and sits in and contributes to the examination of each witness or Accounting Officer.  Therefore, if the Comptroller and Auditor General is unable to conduct a satisfactory audit, the function of the Public Accounts Committee is gravely impaired.</P>
    <P>I would finally direct your attention to page 21 of the Interim Report and I quote from the last paragraph of Mr. Suttle's statement to the Committee:</P>
    <P>In my work in the auditing of accounts, I will look for papers which I consider are relevant to the accounts, which are the only papers I am interested in, and if I do look for such files, I must insist on obtaining them.  In this particular case, I did not know what the files dealt with.  All I had was the vouchers which referred to these particular files.  If it was left to accounting officers to decide what papers I should see or what papers I should not see, I could not certify the account as correct because I would not be sure until I had seen the papers I asked for whether I had obtained all the information and explanations that I required; but on the basis of looking for every document I would not like to put a limit on what I was looking for because every action of the State has financial repercussions somewhere, and I feel that once I ask for a paper, I must see it, as has been the custom for years in every other Department.  If some papers are highly confidential, it has generally been the practice of the accounting officer to get into direct touch with the Comptroller and Auditor General, explain the position to him and then invite him across to see them, no matter how confidential they are.  But it is he himself who will see them, and then having satisfied himself whether things are <Col N="765" /> correct or not, he will notify his staff: &ldquo;I have seen that file: you need not look for it further.&rdquo;  That has been the custom for years.</P>
    <P>It was in view of that position that the Committee of Public Accounts, having taken all the necessary evidence and having discussed the matter in detail, asked the House to consider the following:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the proper discharge of the duty placed on the Comptroller and Auditor General by Article 33 of the Constitution, viz. to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, requires that such documents as he determines to be necessary for the carrying out of this duty should be made available to him by Accounting Officers and</P>
    <P>(2)  that as the statutory position in relation to the making available of documents is not satisfactory legislation to give effect to (1) should be enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to make quite clear that I do not want to add to or decrease anything already published in the Interim Report which has dealt with this matter at great length, but as a member of the Public Accounts Committee I feel very strongly an obligation to get up here and explain the stand we have taken on this matter.  The files in question are of very little importance.  I think there may have been an impression created through newspaper reports that some big scandal was being covered up.  As a matter of fact, the items referred to involve very small expenditure and are of no importance so far as the running of the State is concerned.  But what we are concerned about is the principle involved and the fact that certain papers were withheld from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as members of this privileged Committee, look upon ourselves as watchdogs for the public and the Comptroller and Auditor General, upon whom we rely greatly for our information, is a man whose position is set down in the Constitution.  As already stated by Deputy Hogan, the <Col N="766" /> functions which he has to perform are clearly stated in Article 33: &ldquo;to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were amazed, when this matter arose, to find that the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice was withholding certain files from the Comptroller and Auditor General and we went into the matter as thoroughly as we could.  We had to arrive at the conclusion that it was not stated emphatically and clearly whether or not the Comptroller and Auditor General was right or whether Mr. Berry was right.  We felt we were forced into the position where we would have to bring the matter before the Dáil and have the Dáil decide. While requesting that legislation should be introduced, I would be satisfied if the position was clearly stated &mdash; a policy statement made as to what should happen in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The principle of making files available to the Comptroller and Auditor General is something which has existed for 40 years and, I think, there has been a breach of this principle on only one previous occasion and on that occasion the matter was brought before the Dáil and legislation was introduced. There is no legal entitlement but the principle is good.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I should like to say briefly that, if the position is clarified to my satisfaction, I shall not press for legislation and I do not believe any of the other members will press for it either. However, we want this matter cleared up.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been placed in a most awkward position and we feel that we could not carry out our duties if papers were to be withheld.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, being appointed under the Constitution and receiving his appointment from the President, is a most trustworthy person and a person who is surely entitled to see any file in any State Department.  We know that he only requested files that related to accounts.  My personal view is that, if there are people in the Department who can see these files, surely the <Col N="767" /> Comptroller and Auditor General should be allowed to see them?  At no time was it requested that the members of the Committee should see these files. We do not wish to see them; we are quite satisfied if we can have the information from the Comptroller and Auditor General, on whom we rely for most of our information, that he has seen them and that he is satisfied with what he has seen.</P>
    <P>If any file is deemed to be of a confidential nature from the point of view of the safety of the State, for instance, surely the accounting officer in the Department could request the Comptroller and Auditor General to come to the Department and see the file personally so that the file would not be seen by any junior official in the Department. It is astounding that this file has actually been refused.  It is quite clear that the two men involved are men of great integrity and I believe that they would both be very happy to have the Dáil resolve this matter for them.  I am under no illusion as regards Mr. Berry.  He feels he has done the right thing and, within the law, he has.</P>
    <P>We, on the Committee, feel that we cannot continue to do our duty to the public until there is a clear statement as to the availability of all papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I hope the Dáil will be able to settle this matter without having to introduce legislation.  If we were to start defining limits, maybe we would place greater restrictions on ourselves in the long run.  As the principle was adhered to down through the years it can continue to be adhered to, but I am not satisfied that it was adhered to on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Public Accounts Committee for a number of years, I must say that it was a matter of great concern to us when this problem arose concerning the refusal of the head of a Department to make certain information available to the Comptroller and Auditor General. This affects the integrity of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his function, duties and responsibilities but it also undermines very much the authority of the Public Accounts Committee and the traditional duties <Col N="768" /> which this Committee has performed in the past.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the proposal that this House makes clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General is entitled to call for all documents, files and evidence of all kinds which he regards as essential for the proper auditing of accounts.  It has been proved to be true in most countries that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have access to all documents and it is disturbing in the extreme that the Secretary of any State Department should have the audacity to refuse what the Comptroller and Auditor General considers as essential information to assist him in compiling his accounts.</P>
      <P>It is disturbing, also, to learn that the Minister in charge of that Department at the time was unable or unwilling to make the civil servant concerned co-operate in the traditional way.  This gives rise to the belief which is abroad in this country that vast power and control are vested in the hands of certain civil servants and that even Ministers, the Taoiseach or the Government, for that matter, seem to be unable to grapple effectively with it.  It would seem that they have lost control to these higher civil servants.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason, also, that the House must make clear the right of the Comptroller and Auditor General to information of this kind and that no civil servant shall have the right to impede or frustrate an official of the standing of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the pursuit of what he considers to be his duty to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on the Public Accounts Committee are proud of the part we are playing as watchdogs for the people and for this House in particular.  It is only fitting that we can claim whatever information we require.  Each year the responsible chiefs of every Department unhesitatingly make available to us and to the Comptroller and Auditor General all relevant information required for the purpose of our business. I believe this is the first occasion on which we have been refused information. The information sought on this occasion was not such that it would set the country on fire or endanger our security.  It had to do with the routine expenses of the Department of Justice <Col N="769" /> such as expenditure on supplies of medicines, expenses of court witnesses and also, I think, had to do with an efficiency report concerning administration.</P>
    <P>It was felt, at the beginning, that the Secretary of the Department, Mr. Berry might have acted in a huff but the situation grew into one of obstinacy which could not be resolved, despite all the endeavours which went on behind the scenes and despite appeals to the Minister for Education who was Minister for Justice at that time.  I am sure the present Minister for Justice, too, has also been involved and the Taoiseach himself must know of this. However, all these important representatives of our people have been unable to resolve this difficulty between this particular chief of the Department of Justice, Mr. Berry, and the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is regrettable that the matter should have to come to this House.  However, it is here now and I hope the House and the Government will make clear that it is a fundamental right of the Comptroller and Auditor General to have access to all relevant information.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is a man who secures his prerogatives through our Constitution and through legislation of this House.  He is a man who can surely be trusted.  I am sure he and his predecessors have seen far more confidential files in other Departments down through the years than the files which are the subject of our deliberations on this occasion.  If confidence is to be restored in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; indeed in respect of the whole matter of the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his fundamental right to investigate in depth and in detail, according to his wishes all files in any Department &mdash; this is something which must be made clear in this House.  Otherwise, the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General would be made untenable. There would be an obvious breakdown of confidence in respect of the membership of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The public at large are likely to lose confidence in the whole method of supervision in respect of <Col N="770" /> the expenditure of State Departments.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, comprising members of the Government Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, are, I believe, unanimous in their full and sustained support for the claims of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this matter.  It is a cause of much concern to us that any one man, any one civil servant, however important he may feel, could frustrate this traditional procedure which we have pursued here in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Hogan of South Tipperary, our Chairman, has given us very excellent information here today. He demonstrated that what has been asked on this occasion is something that is granted in most democracies we know of, certainly in Britain and very many other countries.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself, Deputy Jones, was the honoured Chairman of our Committee for a number of years. I do not want to involve him in this debate at present but he, too, participated in and contributed greatly to the work and the worth of that Committee down the years.  It would be a great tragedy if anything were to be done now, in a fit of pique, obstinacy or unbridled opposition, which would undo the great work of the Committee of Public Accounts down the years.</P>
    <P>This is as much as I want to say on this matter.  Let me express the hope that we can be given the assurance we desire, the assurances we deem to be a prerequisite to the proper functioning of the Committee of Public Accounts in the future, as in the past, and to ensure the integrity and the ability of our Comptroller and Auditor General to pursue his work in accordance with his lights and his responsibilities to this House and to the public at large. I appreciate that Mr. Berry is standing on what he calls a matter of principle. There is also a greater matter of principle, as far as Mr. Suttle and ourselves on the Public Accounts Committee are concerned.  It is that, in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts, there shall be unhindered access to all State Departments and that, in respect of this matter, justice <Col N="771" /> shall not merely be done but shall in fact be seen to be done in the clear light of day.  It is vitally important that the lack of confidence or the unrest which has given rise to this matter be set aside and that the Committee get down to functioning, as it did in the past, and that it not be hindered in its work by a refusal to give reasonable assistance to the Comptroller and Auditor General in the pursuit of his duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I have the qualification of having presided over this Committee for a greater number of years than any other Deputy in Dáil Éireann since the State was founded.  Deputy Patrick Hogan, the present Chairman, has laid the facts of the situation before the House with absolute clarity.  I think Deputy Treacy makes a mistake in believing that there is any kind of personal conflict between the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I believe this is simply a situation in which a highly conscientious Accounting Officer felt it was his duty to act on his interpretation of the obligations placed upon him by the Standing Orders of this House and the law, and found that the traditional interpretation put upon the same document by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is at variance as between both parties.  The Accounting Officer and the Comptroller and Auditor General stood for their respective principles which is what brings this matter to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to emphasise two points &mdash; (1) the unanimous report of the Committee, representative of all Parties in this House, and (2) the subject matter on the files in question is trivial in the extreme.  However, out of the question of these files arises the matter of principle which the House must now itself resolve.  This is our duty.  The function of this Committee is to represent not the Government but the Oireachtas.  It has a duty to ensure that the authorisations the Oireachtas have provided to the Executive, either through legislation or Financial Resolution, have been carried <Col N="772" /> out in accordance with the intention of the Resolution or the legislation adopted by this House.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that neither the Comptroller and Auditor General nor the Committee of Public Accounts have anything to do with politics.  It is one of the perennial occupations of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, for the first month or so of every new Committee, to keep reminding novice members of the Committee, who want to raise questions of policy at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, that that is quite outside the scope of the authority of the Committee.  Their only responsibility is to determine whether public money has been spent in accordance with the will of this House.  If it appears that the Executive, that is, the Government, have been trying to spend money other than in accordance with the will of this House, it is the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to the Committee and of the Committee, having heard all the evidence, if it accepts that view, to report back to Dáil Éireann and to impose on the Executive, that is, the Government, the necessity to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in order to get retroactive authority from this House for any expenditure they may improperly or inadvertently have entered upon without prior authority by Resolution or legislation of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Now, I cannot improve on the statement of the case made by Deputy P. Hogan.  If there is anyone who wants to study it in detail I refer that person to his statement.  I have tried to simplify this matter into two issues and I do that now qualified by the warning that anyone who wants to study this matter closely should peruse every line of what Deputy Hogan has said.  Subject to that reservation, two points of principle appear to me to emerge and call for resolution.  One is the question: ought the Comptroller and Auditor General have access to any file he requires for his audit or is there any limitation?  My answer to that is that the Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer of the Constitution.  There is no officer of State who holds a more responsible or confidential post.  If there <Col N="773" /> is anything contained in a Government file which is accessible to the eyes of anyone in the public service, it should be accessible to the eyes of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy is right and I agree with him when he says that when we say the file should be available to the Comptroller and Auditor General we speak advisedly because I can well imagine a situation arising in which it would be proper to say: &ldquo;This file is accessible to the Comptroller and Auditor General but only such parts of it as are relevant to the accounting problem he is called upon to deal with for publication in the records of the Committee of Public Accounts.&rdquo;  There could exist a file part of which was highly confidential and not fit for general publication but part of which should, on the net question as to whether public money had been spent within what we call in the technical language of the Committee come &ldquo;within the ambit of the vote&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I advise the House to place on record beyond yea or nay for the guidance of every Accounting Officer, particularly those who have conscientious scruples which are admirable in a public servant, and as evinced by the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice in this particular case, a clear indication that Dáil Éireann wishes the Comptroller and Auditor General to have available to him every file, whatever its character, but recognising that it is not unreasonable for an Accounting Officer where a file contains confidential material to direct the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General that those parts of that file remain confidential and should not be communicated to anybody else even the junior members of the staff of his own audit office.</P>
    <P>Now the second point of principle that I see arising in this matter is how correctly to interpret the words &ldquo;within the ambit of the Vote&rdquo;.  Here we have available to us a useful guide. It is true that if we are driven back to the Act of 1866 for a definition of the words we would find the language in practice over 100 years ago inappropriate to the problems with which Dáil Éireann, the Executive <Col N="774" /> and the Department of Finance have to deal perennially at present.  Therefore, we must ask ourselves in the context of the present time what the words &ldquo;within the ambit of the Vote&rdquo; imply.  There is well known to the common law and to Statute law the doctrine of exclusion and that provides that if when enacting a Statute in this House we specifically exclude certain matters from the ambit of the Act we are deemed to include all relevant matters other than those we have categorically excluded.  Now, there is a means not uncommonly employed by this House whereby we withdraw from the supervision of the Comptroller and Auditor General the detailed examination of certain moneys that we vote and that is the device of the grant-in-aid. Where a sum of money is declared to be a grant-in-aid the Accounting Officer can clear his record with the Comptroller and Auditor General and with the Committee of Public Accounts by simply producing the certificate of the grantee that he has received the money.  That is the only obligation that devolves upon the Accounting Officer and beyond that evidence of payment of the grant-in-aid neither the Comptroller and Auditor General nor the Committee of Public Accounts can pursue their inquiries.</P>
    <P>But I think it is reasonable, since we made that perfectly clear by the terms habitually employed in authorising a grant-in-aid, that it should be reasonably clear, and if it is not we should now make it perfectly clear, that the words &ldquo;within the ambit of the Vote&rdquo; cover not only the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine whether the public money has been laid out by the Executive in accordance with the letter of our resolution or Statute, but that the money has been effectively laid out. Here I think is the root and branch of this difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>Let me recall that there is no obligation on the Comptroller and Auditor General to satisfy himself that the grant-in-aid has been effectively expended by the grantee.  The Oireachtas decides that in the special circumstances the grantee gets the money for <Col N="775" /> the purposes it thinks it proper to give it, and it is no part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's responsibility to see that it has been effectively expended. We have determined in the Oireachtas to leave that to the discretion of the grantee but we use the form of the grant in aid and we never give the Executive a grant in aid.  Any money made available to the Executive or to any administrative Department is hedged round with the presumption that it is not only expended but expended effectively.</P>
    <P>I can give two cases in point which I recall from my recollection of hundreds of cases that came before the Committee while I presided over it. We were continually considering the position when a Department of State was authorised to carry out public works of one kind or another, erect buildings, equip offices, do any kind of public work and, on occasion, we would come up against a case in which a Department determined that work should not be put out to tender but that there should be a contract based on time and material, plus a percentage. It was commonly the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General to query that practice and to ask why, in that particular case, there had been a departure from the usual procedure of accepting the lowest tender.  If the Committee thought the reasons for the departure inadequate then, in their annual report, they would comment upon it, perhaps, unfavourably and, when the Minister for Finance made his rejoinders to the report of the Committee, he might share the Committee's disapproval of the particular course of action or he might say that, in the special circumstances, he had given express sanction to this departure from the normal and the Committee could reconsider that in the course of its deliberations in the ensuing year.  That is an example of the kind of case which occurs practically every year, the kind of case in which the efficacy by which moneys appropriated have been spent is investigated by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> I can give the House another rather entertaining incident in which this necessity became abundantly and manifestly necessary.  I remember, when I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General said he had come across an unusual account in a part of the country, which, for the purpose of our debate here today shall be nameless, and he had discovered that a Department of State, which also shall be nameless for the moment, had paid grants appropriate to the building of two houses and, in the course of his investigations, the Comptroller and Auditor General had discovered that the two houses were built <i>en pair</i> in rural Ireland and the fact that semidetached houses had been built in rural Ireland in the middle of a rural area caused him some concern and put him upon his inquiry.</P>
    <P>On inquiry being made, he discovered that, in one of the houses, there was a kitchen, a livingroom and one bedroom and, in the other, there were two bedrooms and a diningroom, a lavatory and a bathroom.  In one house there was a staircase; in the other there was none.  There was a manifest space left for an aperture through which a door could conveniently be made after the grants had been paid.  I do not know whether the responsible Department went back and inspected the semidetached houses after attention had been directed to their odd construction by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I do not even know whether we ever succeeded in frustrating the ingenious device employed by the builder of the pair of houses, but it was abundantly clear to us that the gentleman who had built the pair of houses had got two grants for one house and, piling Pelion on Ossa, it became abundantly clear to us that he had got two grants for one house that did not qualify for any grant at all because its area was too big to qualify.  He simply split it down the middle, got a grant for two and was riding high, wide and handsome.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General thought it right to investigate how moneys provided for grants were being used proved abundantly, I think, that it has been <Col N="777" /> well established practice for the Comptroller and Auditor General to interpret the words &ldquo;within the ambit of the Vote&rdquo; to mean not only the money spent in accordance with the letter of our resolutions and legislation but that such money is effectively spent in accordance with the mind and will of this House.  And that is something we cannot too strongly emphasise.</P>
    <P>The matter is not one of controversy between the various parties.  It is a matter of determining what the House as a whole deems it is expedient to do to protect the public purse.  I have no doubt whatever that the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as expounded by Deputy Patrick Hogan <i>(South Tipperary),</i> should be made to prevail, but I want to make it perfectly clear that, in so far as the Accounting Officer of the Department had a conscientious duty which he saw as a binding principle, I applaud him for standing on a point of principle.  He did the right thing that he believed it was his duty to do.  It is our duty when the matter comes before us in irreconcilable conflict to inform both the Comptroller and Auditor General and all Accounting Officers what we wish to see done if, by that procedure, we can avoid the possibility of any future clash in matters of this kind.  I doubt if express legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am rather amazed that the Minister for Labour sheds his radiant presence upon us in the resolution of this particular problem.  I rather thought it was the Taoiseach who would be involved. However, so long as the Minister for Labour speaks for the Government, that is all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the statement by the Minister clarifies the position from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government I think that probably will resolve the matter satisfactorily.  I would be reluctant to undertake amending legislation because our experience has taught us that, with the incomparable skills of our own Comptroller and Auditor General since the State was founded, of our own Department of Finance since the State was founded, <Col N="778" /> and of our own Departments of State, we have been able to evolve skilfully the machinery of control in a way that has been satisfactory to all up to this particular point of principle.  I think that is the best way if at all practicable.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the mover of this motion proposes legislation.  I do not express any opinion as to whether legislation is desirable.  On the whole, I believe that it may not be necessary.  If it should be I would support it.  I want to make it quite clear that in this matter I think the Comptroller and Auditor General is right and that the interpretation put upon the situation by the Accounting Officer is mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise at this point in this civilised debate that this is an all-Party motion. Agreement was reached at the Committee of Public Accounts of which I have the privilege of being a member that this motion would be put to the House.  It is an all-Party agreement and it is non-controversial.  There is a principle involved here.  Basically it is a clash of personalities, a clash of interpretation. An officer of one Department thinks he is entitled to withhold files and the Comptroller and Auditor General thinks he is entitled to have a look at those files.  The issue is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts presented a report to the House.  We as members of that Committee have come to the House for a ruling.  Like Deputy Dillon, I think this is not a matter for legislation but for commonsense. We hope the Minister will uphold the interim report which the Committee sent in.  In a matter of this nature legislation will not be necessary. Legislation on a matter of principle can be very restrictive and inflexible. That is one problem about legislation on an issue of this kind.</P>
      <P>To come back to the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General, they are clearly defined in Article 33 (1) of the Constitution which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys <Col N="779" /> administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This effectively places the Comptroller and Auditor General in the position of a judge.  He cannot be removed without resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that way he is as independent as a judge.  He is an exalted person in our community.  In this instance we are being asked to give our opinion as to who is right and who is wrong.  In my opinion the request of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Accounting Officer was reasonable. It is conceded that the particular files are not important.  The Accounting Officer says they are important as a symbol of principle.</P>
    <P>If Mr. Berry can see this document, why in the name of all that is wonderful cannot this Constitutional personage, Mr. Suttle, see it?  Is one unreliable?  Is Mr. Suttle unreliable? Is there a suggestion that Mr. Berry is unreliable.  They are men of integrity. Mr. Suttle would not run around telling various people what he had seen on departmental files.  If Mr. Berry or any other Accounting Officer in any other Department can see the files, in my opinion the Comptroller and Auditor General can also see them.  That is the basic issue here.  It is important that we should get the guidance of the House on the position.</P>
    <P>One can sympathise with a Minister or an Accounting Officer who claims privilege for a file.  It is not being claimed in this instance.  In fact, the whole idea of State privilege has from time to time proved somewhat of a bogeyman.  There is a report of the case of Duncan versus Camell Laird. In this case the House of Lords in England decided that it was sufficient for the Minister to say that documents were privileged.  That was reversed, and rightly so, in a case recently reported, the case of Conway versus Rimmer.  In this case the British Home Secretary claimed privilege for a report of a superintendent on a probationer and it was held that the court could call for those papers despite the claim of the Home Secretary, and that the production of the papers would not be injurious to the public interest.  Our <Col N="780" /> Supreme Court in the case of O'Leary versus the Minister for Industry and Commerce reported in the 1966 <i>Irish Reports</i> held similar to the case in England.  Privilege should not be claimed except where it is required.</P>
    <P>There is no question of privilege being required in this instance.  There are no State secrets involved.  There are no confidential documents involved. This brings up another issue.  We must have a reasonable definition of the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the case of secret documents.  Is he precluded from having a look at them?  It is important to bring up a number of examples as to why we are making this case for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I want to refer the House to page xi, Vote 21, of the Appropriation Accounts 1967-68.  The Comptroller and Auditor General acts as a watchdog and reports to us.  We are his fellow watchdogs. We are representatives of the people.  We examine all these matters which come before us at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We examine them as trustees for the people.  I want to quote now from the Appropriation Accounts:</P>
    <P>£1,750 was paid to a bank for lodgment to the account of the Garda Síochána Medical Aid Society and was charged to Subhead E. &mdash; Station Services.  I have been furnished with Department of Finance authority for this payment but my request for the relevant file was refused and the payment has not been accounted for in detail to me.  As I am required to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, the principal exception being those cases in which Dáil Éireann expressly stipulates that expenditure of sums issued out of a grant-in-aid is not to be accounted for in detail to me, I have asked the Accounting Officer for an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point and I will go off that altogether.  I want to bring it to the attention of the House that this shows a breakdown in communications.  There has been a suggestion that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not go to the Department of Justice to have a look at these papers.  I think the general argument by the Accounting Officer in this instance is that the files at issue would get into the hands of the staff or subordinates of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has undertaken to go to the Departments to have a look at papers which the Accounting Officer considers to be of a confidential nature.  I quote from the Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts 1966-67:</P>
      <P>Mr. Suttle: If some papers are highly confidential it has generally been the practice of the Accounting Officer to get into direct touch with the Comptroller and Auditor General, explain the position to him, and then invite him across to see them, no matter how confidential they are.  But it is he himself who will see them, and then having satisfied himself whether things are correct or not, he will notify his staff: &ldquo;I have seen that file: you need not look for it further.&rdquo;  That has been the custom for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been the custom for years <Col N="782" /> and I do not see why it should not be the custom for years to come.  It is a very reasonable tradition.  We know that civil servants are bound by tradition but it is one of the worthier traditions and it should be continued. Other people like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Molloy, who is a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, may think it does not require legislation. It requires commonsense and the application thereof.  It requires the withdrawal by certain people from positions of pride and prejudice.  I do not wish to reflect on the Comptroller and Auditor General or Mr. Berry. They are men of integrity and they are not on trial.  We are not indulging in public execution or, indeed, pillorying them.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has sought from the Dáil the permission it now seeks.  It would be my fond hope that the Minister for Labour, replying on behalf of the Government, will support the observations of the Interim Report produced by the Committee in December, 1967.</P>
    <P>I may add that Deputy Hogan has not been too long on the Committee of Public Accounts, but in the words of my learned colleague, Deputy Burke, he is an estimable Chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think from the tone of what has been said by the members of the Committee that what they want is a resolution by the House of a problem which has arisen between people whom Deputy Dillon has described as conscientious officers and I may be able to help by outlining the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, the Government, since the inception of the post of Comptroller and Auditor General in 1923 have always accepted that his functions as auditor embodies not only the ordinary audit of Government accounts for accuracy and regularity but also locating and commenting on incidents of apparent waste of public funds in the implementation of Government policy and nearly every one of his annual reports on the Appropriation Accounts has drawn attention to instances of this type.  The scope of the audit, therefore, has always been wider than that of the commercial auditor. <Col N="783" /> He has never had the duty, nor has he ever claimed to have the duty, of examining and criticising policy decisions. The position here is that he takes policy for granted as a starting point and looks only at how economically it has been carried out.</P>
    <P>The documents dealing with policy and with administrative matters were given to the Comptroller and Auditor General on the basis that they were required not for examination of policy aspects but rather to obtain background information, or to enable him to satisfy himself that there was no waste of public funds in carrying out the policy, or that the authority necessary had been obtained.  It has always been understood that if the Comptroller and Auditor General should ask for a paper which was of such a secret nature that the Minister concerned considered that the disclosure of the information it contained to the Comptroller and Auditor General would not be in the public interest the circumstances would be explained to the Comptroller and Auditor General and efforts made to find other ways of satisfying him.  If not satisfied he could discharge his obligations by reporting the matter to the Dáil.  The circumstances in which the Department of Justice in the course of the year refused the Comptroller and Auditor General access to three of what have been described as relatively unimportant files are described in the minutes of evidence circulated with the report by the Committee of Public Accounts which we are discussing.  The report on the 1967-8 Appropriation Accounts which has just been issued showed that a further seven files have since been withheld.  The Government have considered the whole matter fully and have decided that papers and files should continue to be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General in accordance with the practice that has prevailed here for the past 40 years.</P>

      <P>This practice, as Members of the House pointed out, has operated under existing legislation and there is no reason to change the legislation because there is no reason why <Col N="784" /> the practice should not continue under the existing legislation.  It is, of course, not necessary to predict whether or not it will be necessary sometime in the future for a Minister to refuse papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General which he asked for, but should this prove to be the case the Comptroller and Auditor General can report the matter to the Dáil.  It is my opinion that the Government believe that serious cases causing difficulty could be settled if it were explained by the Accounting Officer personally to the Comptroller and Auditor General that particular files were of an exceptionally secret nature and, further, if the files in question were made available or shown personally to the Comptroller and Auditor General in confidence.  I believe that is what the Government are thinking.  I think it should be the solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The public service is a very large and complicated organisation and notwithstanding a very high degree of zeal and competence on the part of public servants it would be remarkable and, I suppose, miraculous if mistakes were never made or if wasteful procedures did not creep in from time to time.  The various Departments, and, perhaps, in particular the Department of Finance, are constantly attempting to improve efficiency and to eliminate waste.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is in a very favourable position to uncover examples of waste which have not been observed by the Departments themselves and the Government welcome and appreciate the increased activity in this direction which the Comptroller and Auditor General mentions in his 1966-67 report.  As I say, I do not think there is need for legislation.  I think conscientious people needed guidance and I hope this statement of Government thinking will resolve the situation.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement made by the Minister, I do not think there is very much more that we have to say but, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I want, first, to compliment our chairman on the way he presented his case here today.  I feel the same as the Minister feels about it.  There is a misunderstanding <Col N="785" /> or clash of personalities here.  I expressed a personal view, of course, at the Committee of Public Accounts.  My view was that the Department of Justice is responsible for law and order in this country; that it is responsible for seeing that we as a democratic institution should survive; is responsible for getting secret information and various other things; is responsible for the wellbeing of every citizen.  It is for all those reasons that we have a Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>While I have no axe to grind one way or the other, I, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, must pay special tribute to Mr. Suttle, a most impartial, conscientious officer. He has done his job well and so have all the members of the committee.  They have taken their work very seriously. The chairman, as I have already stated, is a kindly, gracious fellow and very helpful to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I feel, as the Minister has stated here, that this is a storm in a teacup, because it has now been explained to me that Mr. Suttle, the Comptroller and Auditor General, could see this file privately and report to his officers.  At first, of course, when I did not know that was the position, I suggested that the Accounting Officer was right in doing what he had done but now that it has been further explained, now that I have the explanation given by the Minister, I feel that there is no need to pursue the case any further.  I would just repeat that I believe that both of the people concerned are very honourable men.  I believe that there must be some misrepresentation outside about it.  We are here to defend. The Accounting Officer is not here to defend himself.  Neither is Mr. Suttle. I feel that both are very honourable men, most conscientious men, that one man, that is, the Accounting Officer, stood on one ground and was supported by what he thought was right.  On the other hand, Mr. Suttle thought he was right.  Both men felt that they were right.  Now that it has been explained, I feel that further legislation is not necessary, that there is enough legislation in existence to deal with this.  In future, the spirit of <Col N="786" /> goodwill should exist.  Now that the Minister has spoken, I shall not say any more but just leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  Now that the Minister has spoken and made the view of the Government known to the House, I do not think there is very much else to say.  I should just like to add that, in my opinion the Accounting Officer has been the victim of some very bad publicity both in the press and elsewhere over the past couple of months.  He took a decision and he stood by it and his Minister backed him in this decision.  The chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Hogan, initially read out the statement by Mr. Whitaker to the effect that it was the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General to go into Departments and investigate and to ensure that there is no inefficiency. Then, Mr. Whitaker came out at the end of this report, on page 26, and said that since the Comptroller and Auditor General is not concerned with policy decisions or how they are arrived at, such papers do not come within his purview and need not be produced to him.</P>
      <P>There is the Secretary of the Department of Finance making what I consider to be two contradictory statements about the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was very necessary that we in this House should have clarified what the Comptroller and Auditor General is entitled to get when he puts his request to the various Departments and we on the Committee of Public Accounts felt that he should have all reasonable access to all matters dealing with any type of financial expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, of course, that there is a large staff in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, something in the region of 53 people. Obviously, every one of those members of the staff could not have access to all the confidential files that there may be in the various Departments but we felt that the Comptroller and Auditor General himself should, if necessary, have access to these files in order to be able to clear the audit.  The Minister has clarified the position.  We had two <Col N="787" /> men standing on their principles, both of them believing themselves to be right.  I think the situation has now been righted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Mr. Berry has got some very bad publicity out of it and I do not think that any one of us in the Committee of Public Accounts agrees with this type of publicity that has gone on against Mr. Berry.  We feel that he is an Accounting Officer or Secretary of a Department in the highest traditions of the Civil Service and that he was only doing what he considered was his job.  It was an unpopular decision to have to take and my information is that he had the backing of several other Secretaries of Departments in the stand that he did take.  It is a very good thing that the matter did come before the Dáil and that it was clarified in the way it was clarified today.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the chairman on the way he presented the report.  It showed comprehensive research and knowledge of the systems in operation in various other countries and, broadly, it represented the view of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would be remiss if I did not put in my halfpenny's worth and say that the Comptroller and Auditor General has given 40 years' service to this State and he has in that time never been refused, to my knowledge, any file.  This is the first time that he was refused a file. His opposite number in the United States, during the making of the atomic bomb, which was highly secret, was allowed facilities to examine the cost of the various materials that went to the making of that bomb.  If he could be allowed to have these facilities I do not think there is anything so secret in our society that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be refused.  Also, if we were to condone the concealing of documents in a policy file it would be a very useful way of stopping the Comptroller and Auditor General from tracing the origin of certain expenditures.  If he opens a file and sees the reference: &ldquo;See Folio 44&rdquo;<Col N="788" /> and Folio 44 is a secret file, then he must be allowed to have that file, in my opinion, and this is the judgment of the Committee of Public Accounts and this is the judgment, certainly, of the Dáil here.  We hope a situation like this will not arise again.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not under any misapprenhension as to what his duties are.  He has been working at them long enough.  If junior clerks in the Department of Justice have access to files, I see no reason why the Comptroller and Auditor General should not have access to the same files.</P>
      <P>As others have said, this should never have arisen.  However, it is good that it has arisen because it gives the public an opportunity of seeing that all expenditure in all Departments is accounted for by an independent section, if you like, of the Civil Service.  I make no apology for standing up in support of the action that is being taken.  It would be unfortunate if we had to introduce legislation to deal with this matter when it is not necessary. This is the first time in 40 years such a matter has come before the Dáil and this is the best way of dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have very little to say but I should like to compliment the Committee of Public Accounts on having brought this matter before Dáil Éireann.  I join with the views expressed by Deputy Briscoe when he said it is proper that this matter should have been brought before the Dáil.  I would not have risen at all were it not for the fact that some of the speakers this afternoon appeared to be apologising on behalf of the Committee for bringing this before Dáil Éireann.  I do not think any such apology is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts here are very simple.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, in discharge of his duties, considered it was necessary for him to inspect some files and he asked for those files.  The Secretary of the Department considered that he was entitled to withhold the files because they contained matters which he thought should be treated as strictly secret.  It is a question of <Col N="789" /> deciding in principle which of these two officials or officers is correct.  There can be no doubt that the Comptroller and Auditor General is correct or, as emerged from the debate, that the files in question are relatively unimportant &mdash; they deal with matters involving only a few pounds in value.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, and I hope in so far as the Committee are concerned, it is entirely irrelevant whether there was five shillings or £1 million at stake.  The principle is what matters.  If an Accounting Officer is entitled to withhold from the Comptroller and Auditor General a file dealing with expenditure of £5, equally he is entitled to withhold a file dealing with thousands or even millions of pounds.  If by bringing this motion before the House we have established that the House is satisfied the Comptroller and Auditor General is entitled to have access to such files as he considers necessary to enable him to discharge his public duty, we have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>From listening to the debate, particularly what the Minister for Labour had to say, I understand the Government are of the opinion that there could be, and indeed are, certain files which should not be made available to what might be described as an ordinary clerk in the ordinary way, but that these files should be and must be made available to the constitutional officer, who is the Comptroller and Auditor General, if he requires them. I accept that as being completely adequate.  I understand from the Minister's speech that the Comptroller and Auditor General may say: &ldquo;I personally must see this file,&rdquo; and then he initials a memorandum to his staff stating: &ldquo;I am satisfied, and you need not pursue that file further.&rdquo;  That is a reasonable approach, an adequate approach.</P>
    <P>However, I should not like the debate to conclude without making it perfectly clear that, as far as I am concerned, there is no apology due to anybody for bringing this into the open, into the House, and making it clear beyond yea or nay, not only to the particular officer who happens to <Col N="790" /> be involved but to all heads of Departments now and in the future, that the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer with constitutional duties and that in order to discharge these duties he is entitled to have access to any file he wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising after all the other speakers, I am conscious of the fact that much or all of what can be said on this motion has been said.  I think it is no harm, however, to draw attention to the fact that this House is, as far as I can see, unanimous in its considered opinion.  We have here a case of Parliament functioning at its best, carrying its responsibility in a considered and dignified way and we should not allow this occasion to pass without adverting to the fact that, if in the future any such question affecting a very fundamental principle should arise, this unanimous, considered and responsible attitude of the House today will be on record and will be a precedent for all following Dála, because we are here asserting the fundamental principle of democracy &mdash; the supremacy of Parliament.</P>
      <P>From one point of view, it is better that conflicts like this should be avoided &mdash; there are always disadvantages in having them aired widely, so to speak &mdash; but on this occasion the situation is productive of a great deal of good.  It is good that at this time this question should have been raised and that it should be resolved; but I hope never again will there be any reason for resolving it because, fundamentally, no matter how you look at it, the issue being raised in this matter is not merely whether somebody could see a file, not whether moneys were being misappropriated, not whether there was a danger that somebody was getting away with anything, not that police security was involved, but what is to be the effective controlling body in the State.  Is it to be the representative Parliament of the country or an executive arm of the administration? It raises, in other words, the fundamental question of democracy and bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that in principle this matter is of such supreme importance, <Col N="791" /> because the control by Parliament of the expenditure of moneys, which is a large part of Parliamentary control in its function in the State, depends on the ability of Parliament to follow up and to have accounted for expenditure and the administration of the moneys involved.  We seek to be effective.  A democratic Parliament is effective through two committees, or to put it another way, through two constitutional instruments.  Democracy is made possible and it functions as a whole through a committee of Parliament, that committee being nothing more nor less than the Government. We function through the Government, though we sometimes in our Party controversies tend to forget that the Government are not merely representative of one Party or group of Parties but a committee of this House as Parliament as a whole.  The effectiveness of the House depends on the Government and the Government, of course, depend on the House.</P>
    <P>The other constitutional agency is the Comptroller and Auditor General who, as far as the House is concerned, functions through a committee of the House, the Committee of Public Accounts.  Between these two agencies Parliament has control of the permanent administration; and if there is any erosion of that democratic control then the permanent administration will ultimately find themselves independent of Parliament or independent of the people.  Any responsible member of the administration; any responsible member of the Government or of the House or of the public will agree that trends in that direction are not to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, despite what Deputy Crowley said, that since there has been reference to the Department of Finance in this debate I think that Department appreciate the realities of the situation and that their outlook is proper.  The importance of this motion is that it has raised the issue about which I have spoken, in a sense, the issue of the sovereignty of Parliament and, therefore, it has raised in a sense the issue of the validity of the whole Constitution.  That may seem a dramatic <Col N="792" /> and over-statement of the issue but, fundamentally, that is the reason why we are considering it in this way here today.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enlarge at length on the desirability, nor do I need to, of Parliament maintaining its powers and of the Constitutional functions being upheld.  If I may say so without disrespect to either our institutions or any individual Members here, or to the House itself, we neither lack the powers nor the facilities, nor the wholehearted support of the administration in doing our job.  If we here are deficient, I should like to say now in case it should be misunderstood, if this House have not asserted themselves, if they have left too much to the Executive, if they have not been able to discharge their duties, whether or not as individual Deputies, we might examine our own conscience.  We might ask ourselves why it is of such relative infrequence that we approach matters in the way we are approaching this: from the point of view of reasoned principle and objectivity &mdash; a point of view from which, unfortunately, issues are too often not approached.</P>
    <P>I say that, conscious of the beam in my own eye before I start thinking of the mote in my brother's eye.  I do not want it to be taken amiss when I say that this Motion is of the greatest interest to the other side in the potential conflict, the permanent administration and particularly the people who hold permanent and most responsible posts in that administration.  What appears to be at the root of this is a matter of potential concern.  It is vital in the interests of the administration &mdash; and every reflecting civil servant will agree that it is vital in the interests of the civil administration &mdash; that certain balances are safeguarded and maintained in their interests.</P>
    <P>It has been said in this debate &mdash; I forget who said it &mdash; and with great interest I heard it said that the Department of Finance welcome the activities and assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Right through the history of the State this duality of control has worked happily and I hope it will continue to work.  If anything like this broke down you immediately <Col N="793" /> have a situation that will tend to weaken the confidence of the public in their administration.  I know it is fashionable sometimes to make disparaging remarks about our Civil Service but it is well to recall that we have had a very fine instrument.  As far as I can recall, never once has their integrity been called into question. They enjoy, and justly so, a high reputation and follow a fine tradition of service and integrity.</P>
    <P>One of the things that supports, and shall I say highlights and brings out, this very desirable feature of our public administration is the very fact that there is an efficient inspecting machinery there to show it up in its true light.  For more than 40 years now the joint action of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts of this House, presided over by different Deputies from different Parties from time to time, has resulted in a picture of and a confidence in our public administration which is a very valuable asset, so valuable that I regret that we take it for granted so often.</P>
    <P>It is far too valuable, indeed, to ever risk the situation where its value in the past might be detracted from by some venial incident now.  This machinery has highlighted these fine qualities.  It would be a terrible pity if in the public mind or anywhere else that image should be in any way disturbed. It would be a terrible pity if we in the House were in any way to lose that implicit confidence which we display from day to day here in accepting official information.  If anything in this line were to continue or, worse still, if there should be any limitations put on the Comptroller and Auditor General beyond those that are implied in Article 33 of the Constitution, it would be extremely damaging from the point of view of public confidence both in the Parliament and in the administration. It would bring about a very undesirable situation in the Public Service itself.</P>
    <P>This is something which one hesitates to say, because one might so easily be misunderstood, but, nevertheless, this <Col N="794" /> is an opportunity on which I think it should be said.  You must put yourself in the position of an executive officer, a man who is trying to get things done. These people in these Departments are hard-working men.  They are not ornaments or pundits.  They are the people who do the national work.  A man who is doing a job wants to do it in the most direct and efficient way, as he sees it, and he only sees it from his point of view.  Where you have a completely balanced community you must have some compensating instruments. For instance, why do we have to have the courts to protect the criminal against the Executive?  If we had not the courts in control, how would the police function for instance?  You must have balance and you must not blame a man who is trying to get a job done, if he sees it from his point of view, and, perhaps, mistakenly sees it from his point of view.  This is where we come in.  This is where we have our responsibility.  This is where we, as elected representatives of the people, function through our principal committee, the Cabinet, to see that the balances are kept and particularly balances of a Constitutional nature such as are provided for in Article 33 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am very forcibly reminded of that by some experience I had myself as an officer in the Defence Forces during the war.  I am afraid I was extremely critical of the Department of Defence or what we called the civil servants. However, in my maturer years and, having had an opportunity of looking at things more soberly, I realised how necessary and how important they were and how much they contributed to the result I wanted to get; whereas the direct methods that would have appealed to me might not have been as successful at all or might have been completely wasteful.  With that experience behind me I can understand the conflict that is there.  It is too much to ask of human nature that any man, or even a body of men, should be two things at the one time.</P>
    <P>Let us face it.  It is no disgrace to anybody, nor is it any reflection on anybody, that in every big organisation whether it is the management of <Col N="795" /> a big company or the Civil Service of a State &mdash; and this goes for every State in the world &mdash; or any other body who have to get things done and run things, there is a temptation to paternalism. You are trying to get work done. It is very easy to decide what is good for everybody else and to go along in the perfect confidence that you know what is best for everybody.  I do not say that is a state of mind that is to be criticised.  It is a limitation of human nature, and I say that in the full knowledge that any of the senior people I have ever met have been remarkably balanced in regard to these things.  I do not want anything I say here to be taken as an adverse criticism.  What I want to emphasise is the basic necessity for a balancing mechanism here.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Hogan on his presentation of the case here today.  I do not think anybody could improve on that.  The clause I want to add is to point out just how deep the problem that was raised here went and how it is just as much in the interests of the administration as it is in the interests of anybody else that this thing should be resolved in a proper way.  I am very jealous and I hope we are all very jealous of the exceptionally good reputation of our Public Service.  But that reputation has to be safeguarded and all temptations or weaknesses that would conduce to the type of thing I have been talking about must be obviated.</P>
    <P>I could go further but I will leave Deputies to fill in the hiatus for themselves. I could point to the dangers to our Public Service if a particular Department could acquire an autonomy and not account to anybody, because that is what it would involve. I shall leave it to Deputies themselves to think out where that could eventually lead &mdash; I do not think I should use words that could bring implications &mdash; but I do commend to all concerned that thought.  We have no particular virtue of ourselves.  We are merely the emissaries and the representatives of the people.  But if that situation were allowed, even in the smallest way, to develop, I leave it to yourselves to see <Col N="796" /> what the possible consequences could be.</P>
    <P>In saying these things I know that responsible people in every category would at least admit that there was ground for fear.  Fortunately, there is now no ground for any apprehension in this matter.  The matter has been clarified.  As I understand it &mdash; and it is no harm that we should have on the record a very clear understanding of the position here now &mdash; the Comptroller and Auditor General is entitled to see all files or public documents that are relevant.  We will all concede that there are secret and confidential documents that must be treated as that.  But when it comes to any question of secrecy or confidence I agree with those Deputies who say that if some member of the Service, or even of Parliament, has seen it then the Comptroller and Auditor General who, for all the lack of glamour attached to his office, is as much a constitutional organ as the President, the Supreme Court or the Dáil, can be trusted with that information and if he could not I think we would reach an absurd situation.  The traditional solution should be sufficient. If the Accounting Officer says: &ldquo;No, this is confidential&rdquo;, with reasonable men there should be no difficulty and the Comptroller and Auditor General himself could be restricted to a sight of the document.  I think all problems are met.  I cannot find, and nobody has advanced any good reason why any matter of information whatever to which the Dáil is entitled should be withheld from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I assert here and now that the Dáil, as the supreme and direct representative of the State and the people, is entitled to every bit of information in the Public Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let there be no ambiguity about that before the Deputy says: &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  In principle the Dáil is entitled to that but, getting down to practical facts, obviously we cannot call for every file.  Under the Constitution there is the Government as the Executive and they must have their confidence and discretion in functioning as an organ <Col N="797" /> of the State and, servicing that Government and this Dáil, we have the Public Service.  It is obvious that a large amount of the information will be of a confidential nature that we cannot bring here to the Floor of the House, nor do we want to assert that we want to bring it before any Committee of the House.  That is no practical solution. But there is, however, one practical way in which the sovereignty that I have uncompromisingly asserted, and which I think is the actual position, can be exercised and that is through the medium of this other constitutional organ, the Comptroller and Auditor General, who, as an independent, directly charged instrument can satisfy himself of the situation.  He is one we can completely trust &mdash; we trust everybody else also &mdash; but I mean one we can trust in the sense of being utterly impartial and detached, and he accounts in the traditional way to our Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arrangement has worked and can work and should, I think, work in the future.  Therefore, it seems to me that the second part of the motion raising the question of legislation is hardly necessary.  We have a very definite constitutional practice and a very definite way of ensuring that balances are maintained.  I think we do not need legislation and on another ground I would be opposed to specific legislation because if we were fools enough to begin legislating specifically we would legislate ourselves into all sorts of corners and we would then be confined within the legislation.  What we must do is boldly assert the principle that Oireachtas Éireann has that sovereignty of entitlement and that it is exercisable through the constitutional organ of Government and the Comptroller and Auditor General and that the Comptroller and Auditor General in the discharge of his duty is absolutely entitled to any information he seeks concerning the Public Service.  If it is confidential it is not too much to ask him to deal with it personally. Nobody suggests it should go to somebody else, much less into an office. We must be reasonable and I think the Comptroller and Auditor General is being eminently reasonable in this <Col N="798" /> matter.  He himself, while Comptroller and Auditor General, is absolutely entitled under the Constitution, in order to make this Parliament and Government function, to the information he seeks and there can be no more question of either refusing or evading that.  That is the principle the House should unequivocally affirm.  There should not be any legislation.  If the matter should arise again a simple, direct and curt order from this House or a curt direct <i>ad hoc</i> Act &mdash; and I might add axe &mdash; from this House would be the answer.</P>
    <P>Let us not fool ourselves about legislation. It is very important that the legislation setting out the duties of Accounting Officers and so on should be considered but the whole matter of the administration of the State is far too important to be tied up in niceties of legislation like that.  We are clear on what are the rights and duties of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If there are any more repercussions of anything like this it is up to the House to face the matter in the same unanimous, responsible and considered way that we have faced it today.  Personally, I believe it never will be necessary but, if it should, then the <i>ad hoc</i> remedy should be applied forthwith.  This is the only way to deal with matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this conflict should arise.  Yet also it is a good thing in one sense.  A great service has been done by bringing before the House this conflict, as I term it, between democracy and bureaucracy &mdash; because fundamentally that is what it was &mdash; in a manner in which we can dispose of it without any earthquakes or anything like that, the manner in which it comes from a Committee of the whole House where partisanship and Party politics do not bedevil the issue.  I should prefer to forget any reference to personalities or accounting officers but, like Deputy Fitzpatrick. I think that, perhaps, a little bit of balance must be applied in matters of this kind.  I am disturbed that any head of a Department should have looked at the situation in the way that it was looked at here.</P>
    <P>I shall go the whole way with Deputy Dillon.  I do not wish to <Col N="799" /> apportion blame; it is a good principle to accept that people are trying to do their jobs in the best way they can. I would always adopt that principle until it is positively proved they are not.  I think all of us in the House accept that was the case here but it is a little disturbing to find such an attitude adopted when we already had this situation with the Comptroller and Auditor General, that he could go personally and inspect the files.  I could understand the Accounting Officer objecting &mdash; and I would back him &mdash; if anybody tried to say that information should be given in a routine way and would get into an office of even as few as three or four people, let alone 30 or 40 people.  I would back him the whole way if he took a stand and said: &ldquo;In the public interest this was not intended; you cannot bring this before just anybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not sought to go into the details of exactly what happened, but I am presuming from what was read in the report that the Comptroller and Auditor General was willing to go and inspect the file personally and to preserve all secrecy.  I am very disturbed indeed that any accounting officer should have taken such an attitude. In fairness to all &mdash; I have said I have no knowledge of this particular case but Deputy Crowley has said certain things &mdash; I want to deal merely with the principle and to agree with Deputy Dillon in the approach that it is better to assume that everybody was doing everything in the best interests of the State and of his own Department. I believe that is the better way to approach it.</P>
    <P>Again, I express a certain amount of anxiety that such an attitude should have been adopted but the waters should be let run under the bridge now. I am very happy that Dáil Éireann &mdash; it would appear unanimously &mdash; have, in a responsible way and with due consideration, faced up to a matter of extreme public importance and that they are disposing of it in the same considerate and responsible manner.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should leave me alone.  My name is a good Irish name.  I do not know from where the Deputy got his.  As I was saying, my view will be different from the views already expressed because I cannot believe that any Resolution of this House will suffice to do what it is proposed to do and in that connection perhaps we ought to ask ourselves what in fact is the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He is, as Deputy de Valera has reminded us, an officer appointed by this House &mdash; an officer appointed under Article 33 of the Constitution which, among other things, prescribes that there will be a Comptroller and Auditor General, who shall control all disbursements and audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas. The Article further provides that the terms and conditions of this office are to be determined by law.  Mark the words &ldquo;by law&rdquo;&mdash; not by a Resolution of this House or by a Resolution of the Committee of Public Accounts, but by law.  In determining these functions by law, the law which eliminates them or defines them has to be a law which is in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can claim to speak with some authority on this matter because, more than 40 years ago, I was a chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  It was in that early formative period that the functions of the Public Accounts Committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to Ministers of State and the Accounting <Col N="801" /> Officers of their several Departments were elucidated, made plain and discernible.  At that time a readily perceptible distinction was drawn between audit inquiries proper, that is to say inquiries initiated and pursued for the purpose of establishing that payments had been made and expenditure incurred only as authorised by Vote in Dáil Éireann, and other inquiries, that is to say, inquiries which might encroach on the powers reserved to a Minister to settle and organise through his Accounting Officer &mdash; generally the Secretary of his Department &mdash; the activities and procedures of that Department and the administration of the services for which the Minister was responsible to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise here that for these services and for the Department which organises and administers them the Minister is responsible to the Dáil, and only to the Dáil.  He is not responsible to the other House of the Oireachtas for the proper and efficient administration of the services, neither is he responsible to the Public Accounts Committee for them nor to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In my view, when legal authority is lacking, any endeavour on the part of any statutory officer, whether he be an officer of this House or otherwise, to make any Minister or his officers responsible to him is an infringement of the constitutional position not just of the Minister but of the Dáil itself. The Minister is a member of the Government which is nominated by Dáil Éireann to administer the public affairs.  The Government, by Article 28 of the Constitution, is collectively responsible to Dáil Éireann and to Dáil Éireann alone.  This collectiveness of responsibility is an uninfringeable unity, something which must not be broken or violated.  No one can impose on a Minister any responsibility without imposing that responsibility on the Government which is collectively responsible with him for all his official actions.  To do this would be a violation of the Constitution.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924 Ministers hold office as Heads of the Departments to which they are <Col N="802" /> assigned.  Section 1 of that Act under which the several Departments of State are established provides that the:</P>
    <P>...powers, duties and functions thereof shall be assigned to and administered by the Minister hereinafter named as head thereof...</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the same Statute provides that:</P>
    <P>Each of the Ministers, heads of the respective Departments of State mentioned in Section 1 of this Act, shall be a corporation sole under his style or name aforesaid...</P>
    <P>The habit has grown up in recent years of referring to the principal officer of a Department as Head of the Department.  This is creating a notion in the public mind that every Department is controlled by a diarchy in which the Minister carries all the responsibility and the Secretary exercises all the power.  This allegation has no basis in law and is repugnant to the Constitution.  The Minister, assigned by the Taoiseach to a Department is the Head of that Department and there is no other Head.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the 1924 Act provides that:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act contained shall derogate from the collective responsibility of the Executive Council as provided by the Constitution notwithstanding that members of the Executive Council may be appointed individually to be Ministers, heads of particular Departments of State.</P>
    <P>Having made the position, what I regard the Constitutional position, of the Ministers clear, I should like now to consider the position and the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General as they are at the moment determined by law.  Article 33 (1) of the Constitution, as I mentioned, prescribes that there will be a Comptroller and Auditor General who shall control all disbursements and audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.  The Article further provides that the terms and conditions of this office are to be determined by law.  They are in fact so determined by the Comptroller and Auditor General Act of 1923.  But, in <Col N="803" /> this Act, they are determined mainly by reference to two British Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (3) of the Irish Act prescribes that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall perform all such duties as are prescribed by it and all relevant statutes &ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash; I quote &mdash;&ldquo;particularly by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts 1866 and 1921.&rdquo;  Accordingly, in order to ascertain the Constitutional and statutory functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is necessary to refer to these British statutes.  The first of these, the Act of 1866, was introduced in the House of Commons by the great William Ewart Gladstone when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was entitled:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Act to consolidate the Duties of the Exchequer and Audit Departments, to regulate the Receipt, Custody and Issue of public moneys and to provide for the audit of the Accounts thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under it is prescribed, in section 27, the manner in which the examination of the Accounts shall be conducted.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that &ldquo;the Comptroller and Auditor General shall have free access at all convenient times to <i>Books of Account</i> and other documents relating to the Accounts of such Departments, and may require the several Departments concerned to furnish him from time to time, or at Regular Periods, with Accounts of the Cash Transactions of such Departments respectively up to such times or periods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 29 gives authority to the Treasury to require more detailed examinations of the Accounts.</P>
    <P>This Act of 1866 was amended by an Act of 1921 which is also referred to in this section 7 (3) of our Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923. The really significant section of the 1921 Act is section 1 which requires the Comptroller and Auditor General &ldquo;to satisfy himself that the money expended has been applied for the purpose or purposes for which grants made by Parliament were intended to provide and that the expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> These are the only Acts from which the Comptroller and Auditor General derives his power.  These are the only Acts that have any validity in law &mdash; the two Acts which determine the functions and confer authority on the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Outside these statutes, that officer has no power or function whatsoever and anything which he does or may seek to do outside them is <i>ultra vires</i> and indeed is in breach of his Constitutional position, as I see it.</P>
    <P>Now let us return to the later of the British Acts in accordance with the provisions of which our own Act of 1923 obliges him to operate.  The purpose of the measure was outlined by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hilton Young, M.P., who, when introducing it, said:</P>
    <P>In preparing the Bill, the British Government had the assistance of an expert Committee consisting of the then Comptroller and Auditor General, his successor designate; and, as Chairman, the M.P. for Camborne, a certain Mr. Acland.</P>
    <P>That was said in relation to the Exchequer and Audits Departments Bill, 1921.  Mr. Acland subsequently became a British Minister of State.  In introducing this Bill, Mr. Hilton Young, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said, and I think his statement goes to the root of this matter, at least, it does in my view:</P>
    <P>The principal alteration is this.</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is, the alteration in the 1866 Act &mdash;</P>
    <P>Under the Exchequer and Audits Departments Act of 1886, it is necessary by law that the Auditor General shall carry out a full detailed 100 per cent arithmetical audit over the great bulk of the Appropriation Accounts.  That was necessary in 1866... because in the first place accounting methods were bad and arithmetical irregularities were frequent; and, in the second place, because the accounting staffs of the offices were in a rudimentary and undeveloped condition.  Since then the accounting staffs of the great offices have developed with the growth of modern methods and <Col N="805" /> modern ideas on these subjects to a standard of efficiency of the very highest.</P>
    <P>The reference is Exchequer and Audit Departments Bill, 1921.  Second Reading 5.VIII, 1921.  Hilton Young, Financial Secretary to the Treasury; volume 145, column 1884.  Let me quote further:</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, this arithmetical checking of every account by the Auditor General of every voucher and arithmetical detail is no longer considered essential by those who are best informed of the work and it leads to a very great waste of time and energy.  The effect of this provision... is to give the Auditor General discretion to dispense with 100 per cent of arithmetical detail and minute check, wherever he... considers it unnecessary...; and, most important from the point of view of this House and the safeguarding of its control, whenever the Comptroller and Auditor General makes a substantial change in the methods by which he audits such accounts, he has to report that change to this House.</P>
    <P>At column 1885 Mr. Hilton Young continued:</P>
    <P>The principal point of substance is to replace an out-of-date method of meticulous repetition of arithmetical calculation and total checks by the more modern, more scientific and more useful method of a test applied by intelligence and discrimination.</P>
    <P>At column 1885 Mr. Hilton Young went on to say:</P>
    <P>Remaining provisions... not of same substantial importance.  One of interest to the House is to give statutory power to the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with ...trading accounts.  Trading accounts are a growth that has sprung up since the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act... such operations as it was necessary to make in the nature of trading during the War were unknown in Government activities, and so the trading accounts had not come into existence <Col N="806" /> in Government accounts... but trading accounts of income and expenditure are now of the greatest importance....</P>
    <P>The point I want to make, arising out of these remarks, is that quite clearly nothing more was intended in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the person responsible for piloting the 1921 Act through the British House of Commons than (1) that he need not make a 100 per cent arithmetical check and (2) that this was to be an audit pure and simple.  This is merely to ensure that the moneys had been spent in accordance with the Vote &mdash; not whether efficiently or effectively spent but merely that there was the authority of the House of Commons to spend these moneys and that they were spent in accordance with that authority.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I submit that no one can find in these words any support for the policy which, of calculated purpose, the Comptroller and Auditor General appears to have pursued in relation to the Minister for Justice and his Department, his Department whosoever the Minister may happen to be.</P>
    <P>Now let us examine the provisions of the 1866 Act, the principal Act upon which our Comptroller and Auditor General Act of 1923 is based.  I have already recited its special provisions. The Act of 1866, like the amending Act, followed an investigation by a House of Commons Committee of the problems to which it was to be applied. Though it was introduced by Gladstone, it was, in fact, piloted through the House of Commons by Sir Stafford Northcote who had been Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee which had formulated the programme to which it was to give effect and who subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Having pointed out that while the measures had amalgamated the previously separate offices of Comptroller and Auditor General he said that it had virtually abolished the controlling power.  It is the controlling power which it is sought to resurrect here.  I do not object to that but I want it to be resurrected in such a form that at <Col N="807" /> least we ourselves will show respect for our Constitution.  It is the controlling power which is now sought by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not wish in any way to deprecate his motives, I merely deprecate the manner in which this subject is being pursued.</P>
    <P>Having pointed out, as I said, that while the Act of 1866 amalgamated the offices of Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; there were separate audits at the time &mdash; and that the controlling power had virtually disappeared, he gave his reasons for that in the following terms:</P>
    <P>True they might have made the power of the Comptroller a real living power, capable of preventing the expenditure of any money except in the way directed by Parliament, but then they must have much hampered the action of the Executive.</P>
    <P>The Bill, Sir Stafford went on to say, was to be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts, but the House should understand what were the functions of that Committee.  The Committee he said was &ldquo;not one to which every question of finance was to be referred&rdquo;, it was:</P>
    <P>the organ of the House appointed for a very special and uninteresting purpose... that of revising the audit of public accounts.</P>
    <P>There were two kinds of audit, first the administrative audit conducted at the instance of the Treasury in order to see whether the money had been expended in accordance with the direction of the Treasury.  The second was the appropriation audit which was performed not for the Treasury but for the House.  It was with reference to this latter that the Committee was appointed.  Again, mark the words of the Bill which we adopted, which we enshrined in our own code, in the Bill setting up the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Mark the words in which it was recommended to the House of Commons, the words which backed the Bill.  This again, let me repeat, was what the Member of the House of Commons <Col N="808" /> piloting the measure through the House said:</P>
    <P>The second was the Appropriation Audit which was performed not for the Treasury but for the House.</P>
    <P>An audit power enabling not an investigation, not a probe, not an exploration to see whether the moneys had been effectively spent but merely was there authority to back the expenditure. It was with reference to this matter that the Public Accounts Committee was appointed.  Then Northcote, who had sat on that Committee, who had been chairman of the Committee which formulated the provisions of the 1866 Act went on to say that he had sat upon the Committee since its appointment and during the six years of its existence and that:</P>
    <P>its members had devoted their attention to general principles rather than looking into the details of accounts.</P>
    <P>He hoped that the House would be cautious about how it supplied the members of the Committee of Public Accounts with matter more attractive than their proper business.  The Irish Act of 1923 incorporates the British Acts of 1866 and 1921.  This is the Act from which the Comptroller and Auditor General derives his authority. It defines that authority and his functions narrowly.</P>
    <P>He is to satisfy himself that the money expended has been applied for the purpose or purposes for which grants made by Parliament were intended to provide and that the expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.</P>
    <P>Now, I would agree that it may be that the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's authority and powers as thus defined are too restricted.  It may be that, having regard to the multifarious nature of the State's activities and enterprises, the Comptroller and Auditor General may wish to delve deeper than the law permits, but that does not justify his striving to do so outside the law.  It certainly does not justify a high officer of the State embarking, as has been alleged, on a mini-revolution without the support of <Col N="809" /> the law to sustain him.  I submit, despite what my colleague Deputy de Valera has argued, that for what the Comptroller and Auditor General seeks to do now statutory support is essential.  The support of the Comptroller and Auditor General will not suffice nor will a resolution of this House.  The requirements of Article 33 of the Constitution are quite definite.  The functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be determined by law.  Now, to demand access to files, even to confidential files, for the purpose of establishing, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has done, whether payments have been made or have been adequately vouched for, is quite in accordance with the law but to challenge or criticise the wisdom or effectiveness of such payments is to seek to usurp the authority which by the Constitution is vested in Dáil Éireann and in Dáil Éireann alone. Therefore, I suggest that before we go too far in this matter it is essential that the Dáil should establish a committee representative of all sides in the House which would consider what general powers might be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, what powers of investigation are necessary in order to fulfil the functions which, as the Members of the House who are on the Committee of Public Accounts have shown, they believe to be essential in the interests of sound administration.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to an extension of the Comptroller and Auditor General's authority in a matter of this sort.  I am conscious of the fact that the activities of the Government now are so widespread, so diverse and, indeed, so complicated, that it is highly desirable in the public interest that there should be some closer control over expenditure, or examination of the way as distinct from the purpose in which the expenditure is incurred.  I am not opposed, therefore, to the idea which lies behind the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts but what I am suggesting is that if we are going to do this then in order to do it effectively we should do it in the right way, set up a committee to investigate the matter &mdash; perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts is as good as any other &mdash; but at least that we should produce in this <Col N="810" /> House something rather more definite and precise than has been suggested by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the gentleman who now holds that office, but it is quite absurd that we should give any officer of this State a power to range through every Government Department in the hope that he might find &mdash; perhaps, not in the hope but it is difficult to find another word &mdash; perhaps with a suspicion that he may find concealed in the files of a Department, in the recesses of that Department, some instance of maladministration which should be exposed to the country.  A roving commission of that sort is the very worst type of commission.  If we are going to have this we should have it set down in black and white so that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the officers with whom he may have to deal may know what the scope of his authority is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I wish, first of all, to thank all the speakers who have contributed to this debate and I am particularly pleased with the spirit in which the matter has been debated.  There is just one small point I should like to clarify. The point was not raised but, lest there should be any notion abroad that this is a personal vendetta, I wish to bring to the notice of the House the fact that this file was, first of all, refused by a junior officer in the Department of Justice; subsequently that refusal was sustained by the Assistant Secretary and, ultimately, the Secretary refused the file, sustaining his officials in their refusal, and, at a later stage, having taken his own decision, he got the support of his Minister in writing.  I mention this because this decision was apparently taken on a broad basis; it was not just one individual with a notion in his head and some kind of vendetta.  It is only fair that that should be stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion with regard to legislation is really nothing more than a convenient peg on which to hang a hat; the Committee are really more concerned with getting things done and <Col N="811" /> getting things put right and the suggestion of legislation was really for the purpose of giving the House an opportunity of discussing the matter.  Deputy MacEntee has very clearly covered what would appear to be a defect, but most speakers here this evening would, I think, be quite satisfied with a return to and the maintenance of what was the <i>status quo</i>.  I do not think anybody is much pushed about legislation. Deputy MacEntee is, of course, a purist; he wants cut and dried legislation. The Department of Finance take the opposite view.  They are afraid that, as a result of legislation, we might find ourselves in a much more inflexible position than we are at the moment.  They are inclined to leave the matter in the flexible state in which it is at the moment.  That appears to be the Government's thinking also. Presumably the matter ends there.  It appears to me that the Government have decided to restore the <i>status quo</i>; the Comptroller and Auditor General will have access to all files and, if there is a secret and confidential document, he will go personally to the Department and examine the document there.  That has been the practice in the past.  It has worked for 40 years and, perhaps, it will work for another 40 years.  The Government are probably working on the basis that the system has given satisfaction for a long time and they do not see any reason why they should introduce legislation to change it.  Perhaps the Committee may think later that they still want legislation but, judging by the debate here, I think the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of everybody.  The impasse is resolved with the restoration of the <i>status quo</i>.  I am grateful to the Minister for coming to that conclusion because it resolves our problem for the present, at least, and we hope also for the future.</P>

      <P>Last night I referred to the fact that Fine Gael are once more in the process of manufacturing a new policy.  On the occasion of every election in the last few years a new policy statement has emanated from Fine Gael.  Deputy Tully jocosely reminded me that Fine Gael had a very short policy statement in the referendum; it was &ldquo;Vote No&rdquo;.  Apparently that policy statement carried the message. However, the proliferation of policy statements by Fine Gael has been a feature of the political scene in recent years.  The proliferation causes no little bewilderment to those of us who are interested in politics and the pronouncements of political Parties.</P>

    <P>Deputy Michael O'Higgins said last night that the two Coalition Governments &mdash; I think he used the word &ldquo;inter-Party&rdquo;&mdash; were periods of great progress.  That is a belief shared by very few.  In the last period of Coalition Government I was a member of a local authority and I know only too well what happened in 1955-1956 and early 1957 in regard to all the works that local authorities undertake.  Work on the building of houses, the construction and repair of roads, and all the rest of it was held up.  Work was at a standstill because the necessary finances were not available.  For <Col N="813" /> Deputy Michael O'Higgins to make that statement was self-delusion of the highest order.  These are the things the people fear may happen again if we have another Coalition Government some time in the future.</P>
    <P>People should know why it has been necessary to impose extra taxation in a period of eight or nine months after the last Budget.  It is no harm to tell them the reason why this taxation has to be imposed.  First of all, the increases in salaries and wages of public servants have to be met; those increases amount to £9 million.  In the past five or six months we had the best summer and finest autumn we have had for years. We had a great harvest, the greatest any of us can remember.  We had increased production in milk and a bigger crop of wheat.  As those two agricultural commodities are more or less guaranteed in relation to price it was necessary for the Government to find the extra money to pay for the increased crops, and the increased amount for milk that became available and, in addition, an increase was given in the support price of milk. All those extra moneys required to be found, and the only way to find the money, as all Governments know, is by increased taxation.  No one likes taxes.  Everyone is opposed to taxes but tax imposition is the only way we know of raising money.  We were in duty bound to pay the public servants the increase that had been granted to them, and won by them through negotiation.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Deputy's own version.  Deputy O'Hara should remember that there are other drainage areas that require attention, and that the Office of Public Works cannot concentrate on the Moy and keep it going forever like Tennyson's brook.  If it is tapering to an end as it appears to be, there are other areas where the work is also tapering to an end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>In the KylemoreCappagh catchment area in my own district work has been going on over the past three or four years and it is now drawing to an end.  I am not making a plea that work in that catchment area should go on forever.  I am realistic enough to realise that there are other drainage districts that have to be done.  People should be delighted that the drainage work on the Moy is nearing completion.  According to Deputy O'Hara, too, the people are about to sing a <i>Dies Irae</i> so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, and that our end is drawing close.  We have been hearing that sort of thing so often since 1932 that very few people now believe it.</P>
      <P>The people have confidence and trust in this Government.  Statements and prophecies have been made recently.  Calumnies have been uttered. This appears to be part of the general pattern that always precedes an onslaught on Fianna Fáil.  If someone has allegations and charges to make they should be substantiated.  There will always be a generation that will believe them as there was in the past. To undermine the confidence of the community in the Government, in any Government, by making such statements is bad not only for the Government and Members of this House, but also for Parliament as a whole.</P>
      <P>I was here the other day when a responsible Deputy made allegations and circulated wild rumours without specifying what he was talking about or naming anyone.  It was so bad that the Leader of the Labour Party called on him to state what he was talking about.  That is what they should do.  If they have charges to make of corruption or what have you, they should name people so that these charges can be investigated and the Head of the Government can make the necessary inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Parties in the House approve of the fact that moneys have been raised to extend educational facilities.  We have witnessed great changes over the past few years, and more luck to the Legislature that enacted these laws and voted the moneys required to give us an increased number of schools, a new <Col N="816" /> system and free transport.  One thing that is not getting as much attention as it should is the question of mentally retarded children and in particular their transport.  In Galway city which is within 25 miles of where I live, a number of these children are attending special schools.  The friends and parents of these mentally retarded children are arranging a rota system for transporting the children to day schools and residential schools.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Department of Education in conjunction with CIE to arrange for the free transport of those children to Galway so far as accommodation is available.  While the accommodation might not be 100 per cent and might not meet all the requirements, a certain amount of accommodation is available.  They have arranged some schemes.  I do not think there are sufficient to meet the requirements of the people.  I think we all feel, having a special regard for this type of child, that we would like them to be singled out for special attention even at the expense of other children, if that were necessary.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Acting Minister for Finance on seeing that the economy of this country is kept on a sound footing and that if money is necessary to run services the people will be told that it is necessary.  They will be told how it is being raised and they will know for what it is being raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are confident that the House and the people will realise that the proposals are intended and are needed to safeguard our economic progress.  I know full well that the increases in taxes and charges will not be welcomed but <Col N="817" /> this Government never flinched from taking unpopular measures when they are necessary.</P>
    <P>I defy any Member of the Opposition to explain how the increased production of butter and wheat and the increases in the public services could have been provided for by any method other than the methods in this Financial Statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main theme of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech has been the question of confidence in the Government.  No matter how often the Taoiseach says on television or anywhere else that the referendum was not a political matter, the truth is it was.  The proposal came from a political Party, was voted through this House with the majority that Party enjoy and financed not only by these people themselves but, according to the Taoiseach, by £100,000 of the people's money &mdash; money voted by the majority of this House with the other Parties all voting against it.  They produced a specific proposal to the people that was defeated by 267,000 votes.  I was extremely lax in not correcting a statement of mine when I was reported as saying three-quarters of a million votes.  It was somewhat more than a quarter million votes.  They were defeated by these votes having made their proposals, put them through this House, with everybody else voting against them and having gone to the people confident that the majority for Fianna Fáil would see them home. Where is the confidence the Parliamentary Secretary is talking about?  Where is the confidence in the institutions of the State, or in the Party in Government when in fact their proposals, voted against by every other person in this House, ended up defeated by 267,000 votes?  May I say if they had not skin on their necks as thick as the heaviest grease on the oldest animal in this country they would go to the country like men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time Fianna Fáil had created a situation where there was a lack of confidence in some people in the Government of the time.  We were prepared to go to the people and give them their choice.  What is now proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party from the front and back benches, referendum or otherwise, is: When you get in power you stick there, no matter what the people outside think.  You stick there for your own Party political purposes and for no other purpose.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest confidence in the Government is non-existent at this stage today.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it was, of course, necessary to do something because of the economic trends at this time.  That was necessary for one reason only.  Last April there was a political Budget designed to get Fianna Fáil home in the referendum, designed to make the people happy, to give them a tranquilliser pill and put them to sleep.  Thank God, the people of Ireland could still see the duplicity of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They could see they were trying by any means in their power, by using the Budget and the people's money &mdash; while not addressing themselves to the cares of State &mdash; to instal themselves in power for the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long on this.  This supplementary Budget is necessary because of the sins of the Budget of April, 1968.  I am proud of the fact that I was able on that occasion to point out those sins.  If anyone desires the reference they can get it in the debate on the &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo;<Col N="819" /> motion a fortnight ago.  I said it was a referendum Budget last April.  Let us face the fact that the Government Deputies and the Parliamentary Secretary have clarified and crystallised this.</P>
    <P>They have one purpose only, and that is to stay in power no matter how it is done, and not to give the people the chance to say whether they want them to remain in power.  They are not prepared to stand before the people but want to take their full term.  I might use the expression &ldquo;set up the bar&rdquo;. Let me explain that term.  When one is at a pitch and toss school one &ldquo;sets up the bar&rdquo;.  Sometimes the clever man sets up the bar to his own advantage. He might set it up against a hill.  They are &ldquo;setting up the bar&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are prepared to use and abuse their opportunities as the caretakers of this State.  They are prepared to use and abuse the Budget and every Estimate for the purpose of staying in power.  They have proved it by their action in the referendum and in the Electoral Amendment Bill which is coming before us now, and by every action.  Theirs are not the cares of State.  They are caring for themselves, and for nothing else.  How base this is, how completely ridiculous, how completely divorced from people who are prepared to give for their country instead of take!  I think they have reached the end of their tether.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the allegations of the Parliamentary Secretary when dealing with the allegations of corruption made here by Deputy James Dillon.  I want to say, first and foremost, that the personal character, integrity, family life and contribution to the State of Deputy James Dillon stand unchallenged against anybody, from Deputy Seán Lemass, Deputy Jack Lynch and the President of Ireland, down.  There <Col N="820" /> is no man in this State or in this House who can say that Deputy James Dillon ever &ldquo;did&rdquo; anybody a penny.  I shall not deal with the things he said.  I shall deal with one thing and one thing only.  I shall refer you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to the debate of last week and the reply of the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, when interrupted by Deputy L'Estrange, on the question of whether or not there had been a settlement in court because there was &mdash; shall we say &mdash; a civil action because somebody had not got paid for getting a planning permission made and when a settlement had occurred in court and was on the court records&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass from it by saying that, when that was so, the reply of the Taoiseach was that court records were not evidence.  If he wants &ldquo;out&rdquo; by the side door, he can have it but there is as much oil flowing from these matters as if <i>Universe Ireland</i> blew up.  Let nobody attack Deputy Dillon.  There is not anybody on those benches opposite fit to clean his boots and there never was.  I will pass from that and say no more.</P>
      <P>The selective wholesale tax has been raised from five per cent to 10 per cent.  That means that the farmer who buys a hammer in order to drive a nail, the farmer who buys the head of a clippers in order to shear his sheep, the industrialist who tells his fitter that he should buy a new set of tools, new spanners or a new drill or any of these things related to production, will pay to the Government, not five per cent but 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest that there is within this mini-Budget a very great measure of over-estimation and that the purpose is quite simple, namely, to have an easy Budget in the spring and to go to the country and try to cod the people again.  I do not think the people will be codded this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us also realise that if one is building a house, if the doors of that house, interior or exterior, were made off the site, as happens in 99 per cent of cases at the moment, the Government <Col N="821" /> will take from that, not five per cent, but 10 per cent.  I suggest to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that these people of duplicity, who must be removed from office if Ireland is to progress &mdash; and I am confident it will happen in the next few months &mdash; will exact from the people far more than, in fact, they have budgeted for in this mini-Budget which I call a maxi-Budget. I want to suggest to you that the scope of the selective wholesale tax is so all-enveloping that they are over-budgeting, that they are doing it deliberately and, therefore, that they are fiddling with the people's finances.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the taxation on particular commodities such as cigarettes, beer and spirits but the selective wholesale tax is the usual Fianna Fáil slithery one in among all the rest that will mean that the people will pay far more without realising it.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the resultant impact on wages.  In this country we have good institutions.  Our employers' organisations are decent, good institutions.  Our trade union organisations are decent, good institutions. Remember, employers have a duty to their wives and families, to their investors and, if they exist on a bank overdraft, to their bankers, and that duty will be exacted by their families, their investors and their bankers.  Therefore, they must seek at all times to produce in respect of each £, each man and each machine employed a proper profit.  Let us remember what we were all talking about last night.  The Taoiseach, Cardinal Conway, I, representing Deputy Cosgrave, and Deputy Dunne, representing Deputy Corish &mdash; I noticed that Deputy Moore was there also &mdash; were talking about greater productivity.  I have dealt first with the employers.  When each section of the community desires to get its proper due and knows that its facet of production will go down if it does not, then it will look for it. Similarly, as Deputy Dunne pointed out last night, the trade union side will look for their due.  Therefore, if there is a greater impact of taxation, proportionately there will be industrial chaos in the next two or three months.</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that, as everybody <Col N="822" /> knows, civil servants and employees of State institutions were held up in their pay demands because the Department of Finance suggested a two year agreement and 11 per cent, not more than seven per cent in the first year and the other four per cent in the second year.  When the referendum dawned on the horizon, they settled for nine per cent for one year and there were no remarks passed about the second year.  Again, this is evidence that the Government, in order to stay in power, will prostitute anything, will do anything that is possible for them in order to ensure that, not in justice but in power, they will succeed.  I believe passionately that, by any means, they must leave power, because they have reached this stage of degradation.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Carty, on education.  In regard to education, let us get this thing straight.  I went to a country school across the fields and there was nothing in it but dry toilets and an oil lamp, and I was 45 years of age on 29th October last.  That was the lot of most of the people, except those living in towns, who occupy the benches here today.  That remained the position until about eight years ago.  At that time Fine Gael produced their policy for education and eventually the tide of public opinion was running to such an extent against the Government that the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley was put in charge of education, as being a man of revolutionary ideas, as a man who would create a stir.  He created a stir but, just like Fianna Fáil in relation to housing, the neglect and delay of all the years has meant that they cannot catch up.  In fact, if Fine Gael are in Government in the next four months, which I think we will be, we will have such a mess to clear up, such a backlog of capital work, that the criticism and abuse that we shall have to take from Fianna Fáil, in Opposition, will be quite unbearable.</P>
    <P>There are people who would opt out of that situation.  I want to assure the House that Fine Gael are not opting out of that situation and Deputy Liam Cosgrave is not opting out of that situation.  We believe that notwithstanding the &mdash; shall we say &mdash; minor <Col N="823" /> gerrymandering of the constituencies, which would have been major if they had got their way in the referendum, the few seats they keep shall not matter very much and that, in fact, what will happen is that Fine Gael will be the next Government inside the next four months.  We will take on our shoulders the load of neglect that lies on the country, as we did between 1954 and 1957, because we passionately believe &mdash; Deputy Cosgrave believes it as well as every other member of the Fine Gael Front Bench &mdash; that we have got to get Fianna Fáil out of office, that they are rancid, impossible, degraded, that they are prepared to stay in power by any means.  I make no reservations on that score.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked if there was any evidence of corruption in the allocation of grants and I will deal with the question specifically.  If there is a change of Government and if Deputy Cosgrave does not sack me, I will be Minister for Industry and Commerce and I would have to deal with the people giving these grants.  I do not believe there has been any corruption as far as the official side is concerned but I should like to give the trend of events in relation to Taiscí Stáit since its foundation.  The first bad run came when the Industrial Credit Company were asked to produce £1,800,000 because 1,000 men might be thrown into unemployment in Dundalk.  The board of the company said it was not a commercial risk and subsequent events proved they were correct.  That having occurred, the Government said they would underwrite the risk and they did so.  As I have said, the board of ICC proved correct: the thing was not successful and the Government did a good job over the years by providing employment at very heavy cost.  That experience having proved to them that they would be criticised by commercial people on State boards, they floated Taiscí Stáit and after the formation of that body, when they desired to give a loan they could give it, if they wished, directly by Cabinet decision. Most of the loan for Potez came in that way.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that these Cabinet <Col N="824" /> decisions on whether loans were given were, if successful, attributable to the Cabinet for praise, and if unsuccessful they were attributable to the Cabinet for blame.  The dreadful, spectacular failures we have had have been far too many.  I do not wish to go into the details but if the Minister for Transport and Power, who is present, desires me to take his own constituency I will do so because it is my job, looking after industry and commerce for Fine Gael, to know these things, to be able to find them out.  It is no difficulty for me, if facts and figures are required, to deal with County Monaghan and why money went wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for correcting me.  I move to another matter mentioned by Deputy Carty.  He asked who in this House could have said there would be a loss of £1½ million this year on wheat.  Let us face it.  Two days ago we had the announcement of the price of wheat for next year on the assessment of the flour millers and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The tonnage of Irish wheat has been reduced from 265,000 to 240,000 and a levy will be introduced later in relation to the difference between the price of Irish wheat for feeding over and above the 240,000 tons which the people will eat.  The situation this year, therefore, was known last spring but, of course, the referendum was coming up.  I am in the wheat business up to my tonsils but it was not my job to say there would be a levy.  It was the Minister's job to say it and if I were over there and he over here I would have told the people the truth.</P>
      <P>I am not advocating a levy on wheat. I am merely saying that the use of State finances for political ends must end &mdash; the deliberate use and abuse of the finances of the people must end. That is the reason why Fianna Fáil must leave office.  I would not have mentioned that matter if the Parliamentary Secretary had not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> Let us move now to a report by a non-political body which was presented to Deputies two days ago.  It is the report of the National Industrial Economic Council.  The members of that body are known.  The chairman is the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  There is Mr. Boland, our long-time representative at the United Nations.  There is Mr. Cuffe, representing the Federated Union of Employers. There is Mr. Jackson of Guinness. There is Mr. J. C. B. McCarthy, Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is Mr. Charles McCarthy, representing the Trade Union Congress.  There is Senator D. F. Murphy and others.  All of them are in business, in trade unions, the lot. They produced this report and I adduce it as the reason for the mini-Budget.  It reviews the results of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and on page one there is a table which refers to the percentage annual average growth rate between 1964 and 1967.</P>
    <P>According to the Second Programme, our gross national product was to advance by 4.3 per cent per annum during that period.  It advanced by 3.3 per cent, a deficit, or failure, of one per cent.  In agriculture, we were meant to advance in growth rate by 3.8 per cent per annum.  We advanced 0.8 per cent, three per cent behind. In industry our growth rate was meant to advance by seven per cent but we advanced by only 5.8 per cent, 1.2 per cent behind.  In other domestic activities, the growth rate was said to advance by 3.6 per cent per annum.  It advanced by 2.6 per cent, one per cent behind.</P>
    <P>On the question of consumption, it was felt that our people could live better.  This is important because there is no point in having advances of all sorts if the people cannot live better. In private consumption, in which we were supposed to advance by 3.6 per cent per annum, we advanced by 2.5 per cent, in other words, 1.1 per cent behind.  The Minister for Transport and Power is a great man for statistics and I hope we will hear something from him on this.  Public consumption is also important because it involves schools, housing and all that sort of <Col N="826" /> thing.  The Second Programme forecast an advance under this heading of 6.4 per cent.  We advanced by 2.4 per cent, 4 per cent behind.</P>
    <P>If we do not get investment, we do not provide jobs, and under the heading investment we were to advance by 4.4 per cent per year.  In fact, we advanced by 1.2 per cent.  Imports were meant to go up from 4.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent per annum.  They went up to 7.1 per cent.  If we can make more at home it is a good thing, and in this matter of imports we have the first optimistic note &mdash; the figure is only 0.2 per cent off the target.  We reached the target in exports: we were meant to advance from 4.9 per cent to 7.9 per cent and the figure was 8.1 per cent.  This was mainly because of exports of cattle which we will not have during the next two years.  The Fianna Fáil heifer subsidy has failed abysmally.  It was a badly done job. They would not do what we told them to do four years before and they produced a different one.  Because they could not produce the Fine Gael one they failed.</P>
    <P>We were to increase employment yearly by one per cent, a very modest figure that I am sure would not satisfy my friend, Deputy Seán Dunne.  In fact, we decreased by 0.1 per cent which meant a failure of 1.1 per cent per year.  Let us follow on to what the position is as given to Deputies.  I quote from the Industrial Analysis of the Live Register for November, 1968.  The Live Register of unemployed is not as important a figure as that for persons working.  The figure I quoted was in relation to the numbers working and I am now about to give you from the Live Register the number of persons unemployed.</P>
    <P>On the 13th September, 1968, the figure was 2,695 people fewer than it is in November of this year.  From the 13th October, 1967, to the same date in this year there are 4,145 people more unemployed.  Is there any reason that anyone can think of why there should be a mini-Budget other than that the real facts were closed off from the people last May, the purpose of the exercise being to get <Col N="827" /> them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing if you have been 15 years in this House and have done your best &mdash; and maybe you have not been any more an angel than anybody else &mdash; to find that people on the other side of the House are prepared to prostitute every political act in order to remain in office.  The suggestion across the House from the Parliamentary Secretary today was that we ran away in 1957.  What are they doing now?  They are like the fox that will not come out of his hole; you have to dig him out.  Might I suggest that, when you do, the hounds will be waiting.</P>

      <P>It might be easier to smoke them out.  They are afraid to meet the people.  They will meet them not in justice, not in the fair approach of political argument, not on the test of the last election, but they will be like the chap setting up the ball, like the people playing pitch and toss and throwing the halfpennies to settle odds. I want to ask the people of Ireland from these benches if they want Fianna Fáil to do that, or do they think they should be suited rather than Fianna Fáil?  The people of Ireland should be suited.  Fianna Fáil are not their masters but their servants.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer, Sir, to the disappointing growth in agricultural output referred to on page 6, paragraph 2, of the report of the National Industrial Economic Council which reads:</P>
      <P>The disappointing growth in agricultural output occurred despite the fact that monetary transfers to the agricultural sector from the rest of the community grew much faster than the programme envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with that statement because I do not think that there are monetary transfers from the community. There would be a correction of prices to make up for the dumping of goods, if we opened our ports to agricultural goods, even butter and beef.  You could then buy cheaper beef here than anywhere else.  These are not monetary transfers but corrections, <Col N="828" /> necessary corrections, but they are not accepted by GATT or any international body that deals with the handling of produce.  But, whether this is or is not the truth, the fact is that the backbone of this country and that which will keep people working in factories is good agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>As I have said many times, people will soon realise that if a bullock goes out of this country at £90 he probably leaves £80 with us because he eats our grass, he is fed on our grain and he is exported, whereas in fact an industrial article produced here may have been the end product of imported raw material which was then reexported. Re-exporting is a very good thing from the point of view of employment of our people.  I want to suggest that industry cannot advance; there cannot be an expansion in industry; there cannot be buoyancy in the whole economic situation until we have a prosperous and satisfied agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to you, Sir, that one of the reasons for this mini-Budget was not that we had Deputy Blaney as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, but that we had a Taoiseach who was prepared to go on television and back him up.  In the last five days we had the Taoiseach extending the olive branch to the farmers and then going back on his word.  We had leading articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> pointing to the fact that the row was still on.  Are the Government to descend on the farmers with new strictures about increasing production?  You can bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.</P>
    <P>The NIEC, a non-political body, pointed to a paramount failure.  There are some political persons on this body but these are drawn from all Parties. The figures I have quoted from the first page of this document show our failure in targets from the time of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. This results from the fact that agriculture in the first instance never got a chance, and there never was co-operation between the Minister and the people.  It ended up in an unholy row.  I do not see how the sort of <Col N="829" /> fellows I know, the decent young fellows living on a little land with rushes in their fields, who are being asked to pay loans and do capital works and increase their production can do this. Perhaps they should go instead to their neighbours and talk about the vicissitudes of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach backs the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to the hilt and this is the whole point.  The present Taoiseach and his predecessor have backed the sins of their Ministers to the very hilt.  I do not want to delay the House too long on this matter.  I feel strongly about it.  I want to make the point that our progress towards full employment has failed.  I had hoped, and I acted on a joint Labour Committee in the Labour Court, that a certain item of Fine Gael policy might, perhaps, have come right through the Public Service, the local authorities and the ordinary industrial employment in this country in this year of 1968.  Something we were trying to do as far back as six years ago was to produce a contract of service, something adopted a year or so after that by Aer Lingus, Guinness and various other people.  The sort of thing I am talking about is a two year agreement whereby in the first year there is an increase in pay budgeted on the probable increase in the cost of living, a further increase on the anniversary date, a discussion in the meantime on productivity, certain agreements on productivity, certain arrangements of hours, a detailed production.</P>
    <P>That might take a committee in the Labour Court, perhaps, as long as ten, 12, 15 or 20 sessions.  Remember when one gets into industry at the top level one finds that some of the best men involved are involved in trade relations. This was coming to a stage when it, perhaps, could have produced the start of a prices and incomes policy. One of the things about a prices and incomes policy that I firmly believe in is that it does not have to succeed 100 per cent to be successful.  If you can get away from this stop-go system, if you can be 70 per cent successful, then you have done a great job for your country. Many people thought that and worked very hard for it but in the middle of it <Col N="830" /> all the referendum occurred and instead of having an arrangement whereby there was a two year system with a discussion on hours, a discussion on terms, a discussion on all these things and the phased increase that might have produced the start of a prices and incomes policy, Fianna Fáil under Deputy Jack Lynch, the Taoiseach, and Deputy Neil Blaney, master politician until he went over the rails, and all the rest of them, threw all this over the side because the referendum was to be decided.  That is the measure of their help for Ireland.  That is the measure of their regard for the people.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to you, Sir, that there is only one way that we can now face the future and that is by the removal from office of the Fianna Fáil junta and the installation in office of a Fine Gael Government which will occur anyway and more important that if they like they can wait because theirs is the power, they are on a slippery slope and every month will cost them another two seats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>When speaking on taxation we should recall the words of Edmund Burke who one time said: &ldquo;There is no man wise enough to tax and to please or to love and be wise&rdquo;. Whatever about the latter part of his saying the first part is surely true. Surely no Government would impose taxation unless they thought it was very necessary?  We have ample proof that it was very necessary at this time.  Even since the Taoiseach as Acting Minister for Finance brought in these measures he has been vindicated by the newspapers of last Saturday morning which gave the official trade return for the month of October.  In that month the adverse trade balance rose by £8½ million.  Any Government seeing these signs and not taking corrective measures should not be in Government. The present Government, under the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, displayed the traditional courage of the Fianna Fáil Party by facing up to this difficult situation in the best way possible. They could have decided on other means.  They could have cut back on social services, education and various things but that would not have been in our tradition.  They could have imposed <Col N="831" /> import levies.  In that respect I recall the action of a previous Government who saw the trade balance running into dangerous waters and took no action until the last minute even though most people at the time admitted that the then Government had difficulties and urged them to take some measures. One morning we read of all the new levies which were put on overnight and as a result thousands of our people lost their jobs.  The Government went out of office shortly after that.</P>
      <P>We are not alone in this country in taking such measures.  The British Government at the moment are planning to take more severe measures because they, too, have their difficulties. If one looks at France one sees that they are taking really drastic measures because of the position of the franc and their trading situation.  I believe the people see the necessity for this.  As Edmund Burke said nobody but God Almighty could tax and please but the people have the intelligence to face up to this position and say: &ldquo;Yes, we believe measures must be taken.  We do not like them.&rdquo;  It is like being ordered by a doctor to take medicine.  You do not like taking it but it is very necessary. I believe the people will vindicate the action of the Government in facing up to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested here and in other places that if you change the system things will be all right.  History is full of individuals who thought they had a short cut to prosperity and happiness. Lenin, Hitler and many others decided that the slow way, the democratic way, was not the way to the full happiness of the people.  They took short cuts but they still have not produced the perfect society and, of course, they never will with these measures.  Even in Czechoslovakia, recently invaded by the Russians, one of the complaints from the Czech people was the fact that the western democracies under free enterprise were doing far better than their people were doing under communism.  Surely we must take heed of the lessons of history which show that a man must pay his way whether in his own life or in the life of the nation and it is only <Col N="832" /> by paying its way that a nation can survive?  There is no use in telling airy-fairy stories of socialism and unbridled capitalism or anything else. There is a very simple lesson whether it is taught to us by Adam Smith or any other economist.  We have got to get back to the fact that we must work and produce and earn money and we will find our own salvation in our own methods.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday was Human Rights day. People inside and outside this House referred to the tax on cigarettes and on the pint but I wonder have we got the courage in this country and in this Oireachtas to go out for full human rights?  Are we prepared to declare war on poverty and to impose taxes to abolish poverty?  The standard of living of our people compares favourably with most countries in the world. Wealthy countries like Germany and the United States have a much higher standard of living but whether they are a happier people is a question.  We hear in speeches from the Opposition that we should do more for the farmers, more for education, more for everything, but the crunch comes when a Government must impose taxation to do some of those things.</P>
    <P>This generation will be tested by history on what has been done for old, disabled and sick people and on these counts the record of the Fianna Fáil Government will stand any examination. In every Budget they have brought in there was always something for the old people, the blind, the widows and orphans.  We often say that, perhaps, this is not enough, that it is not sufficient in budgeting to say there is so much for the disabled, the old and the blind.  We should have the courage to go forward and say that these are our first charges, that we provide for their needs and after that go on to those less needy.  When we speak of cigarettes and the workman's pint we should surely spare a thought for the fact that if we speak here for even a quarter of an hour thousands of youngsters have died of starvation in Biafra, despite our puny efforts to alleviate this frightful, almost worldwide starvation situation in which twothirds of the people have not enough to eat.  If the Minister for External <Col N="833" /> Affairs came to the Minister for Finance saying we should give X pounds for relief immediately we would be assailed not because we were giving to these people but because we would have to increase taxation to do so.  It is time that we looked at ourselves in this age of human rights and considered how sincere we are in regard to what we want to do for those people who cannot very well help themselves.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that the world democracies are losing touch with the people.  To some extent, perhaps, this is true not only of our own Oireachtas but also of Britain, France, the USA and others.  Frequently this may be because suggestions or allegations are made in a democratic State that all is not as it should be on the government side.  Last week Deputy Dillon of Fine Gael came into the House and made certain allegations. Deputy Dillon is a long-serving and respected Member of the House and even Members on this side hold him in very high regard but last week when he made a speech about alleged land transactions by members of the Government I think he dealt a harder blow to democracy than any subversive group in the country because he undermined the faith of the people, not in the Government, but in Parliament as a whole.  If he had proof of these allegations he should have named people or should have gone to the Attorney General and given him the facts to investigate.  Unfortunately, he came here, made allegations against the Government without a bit of evidence and mentioned no names despite the fact that he was speaking, as I am, under Parliamentary privilege.</P>
    <P>When the Nazis set out to gain power in Germany one of their biggest weapons before they adopted physical force was to undermine democracy by telling stories about corruption and all sorts of malpractices in the Government of Germany.  Later, when the Nazis suggested themselves as a Government the people said: &ldquo;What have we to lose?&rdquo;  So democracy was swept away in Germany and the Nazis took over power.  We all know how dearly the German people and, indeed, <Col N="834" /> Europe have paid for that mistake.</P>
    <P>Democracy with all its faults has also its great virtues and the Irish people, who passionately believe in democracy, have now begun to doubt if it is such an effective system because of the charges made against it by Members of the Dáil.  If Deputy Dillon has this information let him give the proof to the Taoiseach or the Attorney General.  Let us have the charges proved and these allegations probed so that at least we shall clear the good name of Parliament because, with all due respect to Deputy Dillon, I do not accept his allegations.  Very often here we say things in the heat of the moment for which we are sorry afterwards but when a Deputy comes in and coldly, probably in a prepared speech, makes such allegations as I have referred to, he does democracy no service and he has certainly weakened the tie which we want strengthened between the people and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another Fine Gael Deputy spoke about the housing situation in Dublin. I shall refer only briefly to the 1957 position.  It is often said that when Fine Gael left office there were too many houses.  My answer to that is that we had too few people because of heavy emigration in preceding years. If anybody does not take my word for it they can go to the official statistics and to Dublin Corporation and see how many empty houses they had at that time.  It took us almost two years to restore progress in housing.</P>
    <P>What happened in 1957 is over and done with but what is happening in 1968 is another matter.  An official report of the Dublin Corporation housing committee last Friday night shows that at the moment there are 2,430 dwellings under construction and tenders have been received or development works are in progress for another 2,805 making a grand total of 5,230.  I wonder is there any city in Europe of comparable size which can show a housing drive of such magnitude. I emphasise that I am referring merely to the corporation's housing drive and I am not mentioning the county council or Dún Laoghaire Borough Council or the private building <Col N="835" /> which involves hundreds of houses in this city.</P>
    <P>A total of 5,230 dwellings are under way plus some 100 temporary dwellings. This all takes a great deal of money and the Government must find the money or the houses will not be built.  If we are criticised for taxation we are taxing for a good purpose.  At present Dublin Corporation's indebtedness is about £30 million of which about £28 million is for housing.  We may be criticised for many things but as regards housing at present in Dublin I think we are doing a very good job. We are, perhaps, still not satisfied that we are making the greatest possible progress but if we can maintain this drive the old legacy of bad housing which we inherited in Dublin will be gone, thanks to a Government which at all times has given housing top priority. Surely they should tax people in order to provide houses for those who cannot provide them for themselves?  This has always been the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan in his speech referred also to some of the allegations which have been made against the Government.  I do not speak as a partisan politician on this but I say that if these Deputies he mentioned have proof of any misdemeanours on the part of any Members on this side of the House they have a duty to come forward with the proof because when an allegation is made against this side of the House by members of the Opposition, they are also condemning their own side who are part of this assembly.</P>
    <P>When the people hear these allegations they lose faith in the Government and they lose faith in democracy. There are a number of people, perhaps not a very great number, who are working very hard towards the time when democracy will be treated as it was in Nazi Germany.  If that time should come, it will then be too late for the people to realise how baseless the allegations against Fianna Fáil were.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to continue much longer but before concluding I wish to compliment the Taoiseach on doing the very unenviable job in the way he did. <Col N="836" /> He had to find the taxation.  Although the people may criticise us, I am sure they will admire the integrity of the Government.  The Government could have taken an easier way out and have had no second Budget but eventually, as the previous Government found out, the moment of truth has to be faced. Fianna Fáil have met this challenge of threatened inflation and have taken measures which we trust will check this run on the trade figures and which will be passed on to the people eventually.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the Budget was the fact that drawings from the Savings Bank were exceedingly large. Once that happens in any country there is a danger sign.  While on this point, I should like the Post Office Savings Committee &mdash; who are doing a very good job &mdash; to step up the tempo of their efforts to promote more savings. No matter how small the amount in the Post Office Savings Bank is it can give us more money for capital development which, in turn, will mean more jobs.  To say, as Deputy Donegan has said, that we are not facing realities in regard to employment is not true.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, speaking on Saturday night last at the bankers' dinner, said that we were not producing jobs at the rate at which they were needed.  This is something we must face up to.  Even though productivity has increased tremendously the jobs that we hoped for have not come about. I judge the success of any Budget by the number of jobs it will provide and by the number of houses it will provide and by the other real benefits to the people but we must say that jobs are not coming as fast as we would wish.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, join with the Minister, in reminding the bankers that we want this position changed and that we want a flow of jobs to offer to every man and woman in the country who wishes to remain here.  I do not know of any country in the world where there is total employment, unless it is compulsory employment, and we do not want that here.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish again to compliment the Taoiseach and the Government on the way they are dealing with this problem and I believe that the <Col N="837" /> people, even though they may criticise us will realise what the Government are doing.  I trust that the people will accept the impositions placed on them by the Budget because this has been done in the interests of the people themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that next year we shall see a great increase in the number of houses and in the number of jobs and that we will be able to give in benefits much more than we can give this year. I hope the people will face up to the circumstances as the Government have done on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage in the debate most, if not all, that can be said has been said.  Therefore, I shall be as brief as possible.  My view, as a Deputy of this House, on taxation &mdash; I do not profess to be an economist nor do I take on myself the right to direct a Government in the way in which taxation should be levied or collected &mdash; is that the first obligation of any Government, of any good Government, is to control inflation.  In spite of this, no matter how rigid the control may be, inflation will take place.  This has been a natural development since the beginning of time, since we got away from the barter system.  We have had to live with inflation and governments in societies such as ours have endeavoured, during the whole history of time, to fight inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, no matter how stringent are the controls that are taken, inflation will take place but if a Government neglect their duty and if a Government, purely for Party political gains, introduce Budgets which are entirely designed with a view to the future of that Government and that political Party, then they are not living up to their obligations.  If a Government encourage inflation we will live in a period in which the real value of property cannot easily be assessed.  We will live in an era in which the racketeers and, indeed, the &ldquo;Tacateers&rdquo; can take full advantage of their playing a very prominent part in encouraging this spiral of inflation. They will speculate by purchasing property and that property will appreciate so much that when they offer it for sale it will have held its value <Col N="838" /> because of the terms of the appreciation.</P>
    <P>Too many people who are close to some members of Fianna Fáil have become rich overnight.  This is an unhealthy sign and this, in my humble judgment, is why the Government were rejected in the terms in which they were rejected, in the recent referendum. Admittedly, there was some merit in their proposals but the arguments against them were so great that I could not see, by any stretch of my imagination, a Fianna Fáil victory in that referendum.  The reason the people rejected them was that they were afraid to give to those who have now taken control of the Government, those who had not the courage to stand before the people and to be elected in this House, the power which they sought, because they did not trust them.  They did not distrust them because backbench members of the Fianna Fáil Party made statements in rural Ireland that certain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage, I should like to direct the attention of the Deputy to the fact that we are discussing the Budget and not what might be regarded as part of last week's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall move away from that point now.  I just want to say that I do not think the people rejected the Government in the manner in which they did because Deputies of the Fianna Fáil back benches made speeches or because they promised things and could not fulfil the promises or because they have failed in their duties as public representatives.  I do not think the people have lost confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party because back-bench members have fallen short of what they were elected to this House to do.  I am convinced beyond all shadow of doubt that the reason the Government sustained such a defeat was that the people are not prepared to trust them any more because people in groups, now commonly described as &ldquo;Taca&rdquo;, have more control over Government expenditure than have members of the back benches of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not take a very experienced <Col N="839" /> financier to forecast what taxation is needed to run a country for 12 months. However, the modern trend seems to be that it is now only necessary for a Minister for Finance to balance the books for six months.  Like other Deputies, I should just like, at this stage, to wish the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, well and a speedy return to the House.  When introducing the annual Budget in April last the Minister stated he would be less than honest with his Government, with Parliament, and with the people if he were to increase taxation over and above what he had asked for in that Budget.  However, within six months, the former Minister for Finance &mdash; the present Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, who made such a hash of one of his Budgets that a former Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, felt it necessary to write a detailed letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> criticising him and asking him what went wrong with his Budget &mdash; introduces a second Budget which he describes as &ldquo;mini&rdquo;.  However, it is not so &ldquo;mini&rdquo; when we look at it.</P>
    <P>Was there bad foresight on the part of the Government in the early part of the year?  I believe there was either bad foresight, because of incompetence, or it was introduced completely &mdash; I do not rule this out &mdash; for Party political gains.  They knew, at that time of the year, that certain by-elections were pending and that a severe Budget at that time could have adverse effects on the results of the by-elections &mdash; and losing by-elections on what one could describe as the eve of a referendum could not be considered a healthy political situation either.  Therefore, no Deputy could be blamed for thinking that one of the reasons Deputy Haughey did not introduce a proper Budget was that he could have made his Party that much more unpopular.</P>
    <P>In an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 9th November, 1968, this Budget is described as an exceptionally heavy burden.  It said that, with a relatively lenient major Budget last April, this one was unusually severe.  That is how an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> described this Budget which the Acting Minister for <Col N="840" /> Finance, the Taoiseach, described as a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; Budget.  Some of the provincial newspapers described it as a &ldquo;maxi&rdquo; Budget.  No matter how it has been described, the full effects of this Budget will not be felt for some time and, of all the increases, I believe the increase in selective wholesale tax will prove the biggest mistake of this Government between now and the next general election because this will have an effect on a very wide variety of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>No consideration has been given to the less well-off in our society.  The old age pensioners must exist on the sops which were given to them in recent Budgets.  They can be codded by giving the old age pensioners an increased pension post-dated to a certain date: this is when the annual Budget is being introduced in April.  However, by the time these people come to receive the increase, a second Budget, which the Taoiseach has the audacity to describe as a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; Budget, is introduced and, in effect, these people are receiving no benefits whatsoever.  Is it any wonder we have the lowest and worst social service structure in Western Europe?  Is it any wonder, in a Christian country such as Ireland, we have such a bad service for our aged, our infirm and our handicapped?  Is it any wonder Deputies go on bended knees to institutions run by voluntary associations or religious Orders asking them, for God's sake, to admit a mentally-handicapped child from rural Ireland?  Is it any wonder that we in public life refrain from bringing such a subject into the political arena &mdash; though we live in hope that someone will step into the breach and do something about this problem &mdash; believing that, if we mention these things publicly when we are speaking on political issues, people will point the finger of scorn and say: &ldquo;He is using this subject for his personal advancement&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to use a political platform to expose weaknesses in our society, particularly in the field of the mentally handicapped.  The Government are falling far short of their obligations in this regard.  The Government are not alive to what is needed in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for the <Col N="841" /> Minister for Health.  He may be doing something, but he is not doing enough. Perhaps the Government are not going with him on the road he would like to travel.  Whatever the reason, the fact remains that there are too many beds needed, too much accommodation required, to help solve this problem.  The sooner some Government get to the grass roots of the problem and tackle it the better.  There is a ludicrous situation in Donegal where the Donegal County Council with the consent of the Department and the Government handed over a hospital formerly used as a sanatorium&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I was making, Sir, before you came into the House was that the Fianna Fáil Government believe that this taxation was necessary. Taxation is certainly necessary but this taxation was never necessary. It is imposed because of mismanagement on the part of the Government, because of bad book-keeping and bad foresight and I am trying to bring out the point that, if there is a change of Government &mdash; and there is every indication that there will be, and the sooner the better &mdash; this Party can provide better government without extra taxation by providing honest government, just government and better book-keeping.  One point which I was illustrating was the ludicrous situation in Donegal where a hospital was converted into an hotel at a cost of £240,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the Chair did.  However, we will leave it at that. Deputy Moore said that the Government found it necessary to introduce this Budget to increase housing.  Deputy Moore must be fooling himself or else he is living in a fool's paradise.  On the other hand, he could be playing up to the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine. Whatever he is doing, the fact is we are now building more houses than we did in 1966.  The argument can be advanced that we are building more houses than we did in 1966 but in 1966 we built no houses at all.  You are aware, Sir, that in County Donegal we hold the record of having built 47 houses in one year.  In Strabane, just <Col N="844" /> across the Border where the people are fighting for civil rights, Strabane Council is building more houses than the Donegal County Council.  I can see civil rights marches in this city before long.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore spoke about the great housing drive in Dublin and, at the same time, spoke about what happened in Nazi Germany.  Were it not for the names on the streets, on shops and on the buses if you woke up in Dublin without knowing where you were, you would imagine that you were in Nazi Germany after the War.  The capital is a disgrace.  When you leave the Parliament Buildings and move in any direction you will pass through derelict areas.  This just did not happen by accident; this is part of the Government's policy.  The Government in their first White Paper, which was a lead-up to the five-year plan which became the First Programme for Economic Expansion, decided that housing was a bad investment and that people would have to tolerate bad housing, that people living in bad houses would have to stay there so that Mr. Potez and his like could get handsome grants from the Government and fly off by night. This type of Government policy is wrong.  This is the type of Government policy which the people have rejected.</P>
      <P>These are some of the reasons why the people no longer trust Fianna Fáil. This is why the Fianna Fáil Party used gerrymandering to its full in order to try to retain power.  You have gerrymandered the country, you have run the country into unwanted referenda, you have spent money wrongly, but no matter what you do, whether you postpone the general election for 12 months or until the constitutional period is up in 1970, no matter how long you sit there, the certainty is that there will be a change of Government. Even the most ardent Fianna Fáil supporters have lost confidence in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amazing thing is that a Mr. K. Fitzsimons wrote to the <i>Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, 24th September last offering his resignation from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Mr. Fitzsimons is an MA and was chairman of a Fianna Fáil Cumann for over 15 years.  I do not <Col N="845" /> know the gentleman but I understand that he is a gentleman in every respect and here are the reasons he gave for leaving Fianna Fáil:</P>
    <P>It is with extreme regret and after long consideration that I tender herewith my resignation from the Fianna Fáil Party.  There are many reasons for my doing so but I will list the more important ones.</P>
    <P>1.  It appears very evident that a well filled wallet is a more essential qualification than sincerity if one is to progress or even secure a right of audience in the present organised structure of the Party.</P>
    <P>Here is a man who supported the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government all his life.  Here is a man who begins his letter of resignation by saying: &ldquo;It is with extreme regret...&rdquo; I believe Mr. Fitzsimons is sincere.  I believe he did not reach for his pen on a sudden impulse, deciding he should no longer support the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe he fought with his conscience for some time &mdash; maybe years, maybe months, certainly weeks. He decides he no longer can give the Government his support because the Government no longer have his confidence. His is not an isolated case, but this is a case in which a man with enough courage decides, at a very grave time for Fianna Fáil, to offer his resignation, and do it publicly.</P>
    <P>There are many more people who no longer give the Fianna Fáil Party their support.  It is not a case of the local Deputy not pulling his weight or neglecting to reply to a letter.  It is not because of minor details that the Government have lost the confidence of the people.  A Deputy may lose support; he may come under heavy fire, but he can always be replaced by a colleague under the system of proportional representation. When a Government lose the confidence of the people the only alternative &mdash; it is not the alternative Deputy Moore suggested, imposing more taxation &mdash; is to go to the country and say to the people: &ldquo;If we have fallen short of the promises we made in 1965, if we have not implemented the policies we presented then for your consideration, then give another Party <Col N="846" /> the mandate to govern.  However, if you believe that, due to circumstances beyond our control, we deserve another chance, then give us a mandate, but let us wipe the slate clean here and now.&rdquo;  This is what the Government should be considering at the moment. No Government, no leader of a Government, no businessman, no father even can control anything under his command if he has not got the confidence of those whom he is supposed to command.  That is the situation pure and simple.  I believe the Government realise they no longer can command the respect of the people.  That is their own fault and, the longer they stay there, the surer it is they will be replaced when a general election is called.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzsimons says later in the same letter:</P>
    <P>There are many fine men, sincere men, in the Fianna Fáil Party, some very fine Ministers who quietly are doing the job to which they were appointed, but there are many more who have lost touch with the common man-in-the-street and whose only ambition seems to be to climb aboard the bandwaggon, collect as much as possible and chuck Kathleen Mavourneen overboard.</P>
    <P>What does Mr. Fitzsimons suggest in these comments of his?  Does he see the situation as I see it &mdash; too many people, faceless men, too close to the centre of gravity in the Fianna Fáil Government, who have got too rich too quickly to be healthy?  I have nothing against a man succeeding in life. Many men have done so and many more will do so in the future, but there are too many smart Alecs &mdash; they have been described as the mohaired executive types &mdash; wandering the corridors of Leinster House and, as Deputy Oliver Flanagan said, carrying in their pocketbooks the private telephone number, which is ex-directory, of every Minister of State. I wonder how many loyal supporters of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, sincere men who believe in Fianna Fáil, could reach for a telephone and dial the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I wonder could <Col N="847" /> Deputy Cunningham in the Minister's own constituency do it.  Is this another reason why Mr. Fitzsimons no longer supports Fianna Fáil?  Is it because he believes there are too many mohaired executive types wandering the corridors of Leinster House, walking in and out of Ministers' offices, as if they were senior civil servants, arriving at the gates of Leinster House and demanding that they be let in without informing the usher on duty for which Minister they are looking?  Is it because of the faceless men who have become rich that Mr. Fitzsimons ceases to support the Fianna Fáil Party?  I do not have to mention their names.  There are too many of them for me to list.  Periodically they hit the headlines.  Some even hit the international headlines.  Some have become involved in elections which are none of their business.  Some who have become involved in elections have ended up by selling hotels or buying hotels from semi-State bodies. These faceless men carry in their pockets the telephone numbers of the Ministers' offices.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will bear me out when I say that if one asks for a number which is ex-directory the telephonist will refuse to give it.</P>

We would provide a just, honest, better administration.

      <P>One of the reasons is that these people who are travelling the corridors of Leinster House have more influence in Cabinet circles than the backbench Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have the courage to stand before the electorate and say they stand by the policies of Fianna Fáil.

      <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party have to be absolved from sin we will do so, but until such time as we are satisfied, so far as I am concerned corruption is taking place in high places. If the Taoiseach had the same courage as his counterpart in Belfast he would be asking for a few resignations.  One adverse effect of this increased taxation is that it is crippling motor transport in the Border counties.  In the next few months, as Deputy Cunningham knows, most of these counties, particularly Donegal, will be faced with something short of a crisis in motor transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Cunningham wakens up and listens for a second I will answer that.  The petrol tax has been increased, motor tax and insurance have been increased, and the cost of the selective wholesale tax on commercial vehicles is criminal and penal, with the result that one of the scarcest things in an agricultural county like Donegal is a cattle lorry.  You will not get a cattle lorry in the county of Donegal at the moment.  All the cattle are carried by Northern Ireland carriers.  The Donegal man cannot compete.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has as little knowledge of the northern problem as the Government have of the Irish problem.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has said that the heifer subsidy scheme is a failure and that he proposes to introduce a new system.  A Cheann Comhairle, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries when he was Minister for Local Government spoke in Milford during the 1965 General Election campaign.  He spoke in glowing terms of the scheme about to be introduced giving every farmer £15 subsidy in the calf-heifer subsidy scheme.  From the same public platform he criticised very severely a Deputy of this House for having the audacity to vote against such a scheme which was going to benefit the small farmer of Donegal.  All this was reported in the <i>Derry People</i>, of that week.</P>

      <P>There is a man who is confused; which explains why the majority in North East Donegal was only 700.  I would still vote against such a scheme and, when the Government are finished their pipe-dreams of the cattle subsidy, they will eventually come to the straightforward calf subsidy. It is simple, but simplicity is the essence of genius, something Fianna Fáil know very little about.  It is a straightforward calf subsidy, but that would be too British.  This is what the British do, and then it might not, therefore, appear to be original.  The heifer subsidy scheme was a failure.  The present scheme which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is now contemplating will be a failure.</P>

      <P>The Land Project was <Col N="856" /> objected to by Deputy Smith on 8th June, 1949.  He thought you would have three times the benefits by putting the money to other purposes.  For example, he thought it better, and Fianna Fáil went ahead to be part of it, to give three times that amount of money to people like Potez who could build a factory in Galway and make heaters and Fianna Fáil began to raffle them in order to get rid of them. I do not believe they ever sold one.  Is Deputy Geoghegan silent now?  What happened in Galway?</P>

      <P>The 1948 Trade Agreement benefited the agricultural community for the first time since 1932. After 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration, it gave new life to agriculture. As Deputy Cunningham says, we flooded the British market with eggs. Now the farmer's wife has no trade for eggs.  Is it not a fact that a Deputy who asks his wife for a boiled egg in the morning will probably get a stale one?  He cannot guarantee that there will be fresh eggs in the local shop.</P>

This is what Deputy Cunningham sees wrong: the Trade Agreement was wrong because the Irish farmer flooded the British market with eggs.  Now the Irish farmer cannot get a market for eggs.  This was described by Deputy MacEntee as a very bad Agreement and Deputy Lemass described it as a very poor Agreement.  Now we come to the Local Authorities (Works) Act. The 1949 Local Authorities (Works) Act was introduced by the inter-Party Government.</P>

It is still available for machinery to be used by any local authority provided the Government vote money for it, but it has been strangled because the Government have not voted money for it. If there is a change of Government all these fancy ideas which Fianna Fáil use for propaganda, shifting the Special Employment Schemes to the Department of Local Government and calling it by a different name, will be cleaned off the slate and we will vote money for local authority works.

      <P>Sir, the workers of this city suffered another savage blow on their way home from work this evening when they saw this headline: &ldquo;Huge Bus Fare Increases&rdquo; in what at any rate used to be the official organ of the Government Party and, while this does not fall strictly within the terms of the Financial Resolution we are discussing, nonetheless it does represent a further savage increase in the cost of the living for hundreds of thousands of men and indeed women who are already struggling to live at subsistence level on inadequate wages which have been rendered still more inadequate by the provisions set out in the Financial Resolution which it is our business to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> The proposals for increased taxes have been touched upon in the course of this debate, and I say touched upon advisedly because I have studied the Official Report of the Debates and it seems to me that so far as the Government side is concerned at any rate their spokesmen have been permitted to deal in depth and indeed in falsehood with every subject under the sun except matters strictly relevant to the Financial Resolution, but where they have been touched upon it has been made perfectly clear that this supplementary Budget has come about as a result of gross inefficiency on the part of the Government and gross mismanagement of the affairs of the nation during the comparatively few months that have gone by since the annual Budget was introduced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>While the referendum has been referred to <i>ad nauseam</i> and the cost of the referendum and the time wasted by the House and through the country and by the public officials in preparation for the referendum and in the carrying out of the multifarious duties that were contingent upon the referendum, while these things have been referred to almost to the point where people may very well have become sick of the mention of the referendum, it nonetheless remains true that most of the Government time which should have been devoted, had it been properly applied, to the affairs of the country, to seeing that the finances and the budgetary situation of the country were in proper shape, was in fact misapplied in a political direction in trying to create a situation for themselves by means of the referendum whereby they could be in office for the rest of all time or as near as possible to that.  So that this supplementary Budget which we are dealing with is the result of the Government's folly, nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <P>Like many others I am no expert in the analysis of figures and like perhaps not quite so many others I do not pretend to be an expert in the analysis of figures, yet I am puzzled to know what exactly is meant by the detail in the statement with which we were supplied in connection with <Col N="868" /> this Budget which sets out as an allowance for errors of estimation an amount of £4 million: £4 million for errors of estimation and we are told that these moneys which are being raised by this Budget are needed to carry the country through, presumably to next Budget time.  Is it therefore to be taken that the Government are so inept and uncertain of themselves that they cannot calculate with any degree of accuracy nearer than £4 million how much it is going to take to run the affairs of the nation for the few remaining months that are left until the time of the next annual Budget? It would appear so, but it is obvious also, of course, from the figures with which we have been supplied that the Government, by means of these penal taxes which impose such great hardship as invariably they do upon those least able to bear them, are trying to make a profit from the situation and to arrive at the time for the presentation of the next Budget with money in hand so that they will be able to make some effort at the traditional trick of bribing the electorate on a short-term basis to bestow once more its favour upon them.</P>
    <P>Such a pursuit by this Government is in my view a complete and utter fatuity because, whatever else may be said of them, I think the bulk of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party do accept in their hearts that the country has come to a conclusion about them as a Party and the conclusion is that the Fianna Fáil Party has had it and that the time has come for a change. This has been brought about by the arrival on the electoral scene of huge numbers of young people, uninfluenced and uninhibited by things past.  We have had here in the course of the past fortnight the spectacle of efforts being made to revive animosities and enmities which had their beginnings in events of 50 years ago.  It is a grotesque performance to hear young men, who could not have reached the use of such little reason as they eventually achieved and who must have been of tender infant years at the time of these events, talking about them as if they were matters of current concern among the people.  The people are sick to the back teeth of that kind of performance. <Col N="869" /> I suppose it was good enough during the Thirties to inflame passions and work up emotions when there was not the great development of enlightenment such as is a phenomenon of the present day and which has come about as a result of the spread, to some extent, of education but more, I think, as a result of the development of news media, particularly television.</P>
    <P>Young people &mdash; when I say young people I mean those of 40 years or less &mdash; are too harried and worried by the pursuit of the means of livelihood to be impressed by, let us say, the performance of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who developed a middle-aged republicanism recently something to all intents and purposes that had been lying dormant in him over a long period.  Nobody will be persuaded that that effort and the extravagant claims he made for the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to republicanism were anything more than a gimmick to deflect people's minds from the essentials of Government administration and the very important questions of the standard of living of the people and the future, the housing situation, social services, the education and needs of children and the many other things which make up the realities rather than the illusions of life in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Going through the somewhat dispiriting debates of last week and the week before in search of some enlightenment as to what the Government propose to do for the people I was struck by one of the most unnecessary exercises that has ever been carried out in this House and, also, I would think, one of the meanest.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries followed by another Fianna Fáil Deputy, sought to rush to the defence, unnecessarily, of the ushers and the staff of the House who, as far as I can discover, were not in any sense under attack from any quarter.  Statements were made here in the context of the discussion on these resolutions to the effect that it would appear that entry to Leinster House seemed to be freely available to certain gentry who could parade the corridors at will in search of whatever peculiar business they <Col N="870" /> have, or had, without let or hindrance; but at no time was it suggested, as far as I can discover in the debates, that the staff of the House had any responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>Do we not all know very well what happens &mdash; that a Minister or a Deputy, but particularly a Minister, may leave instructions, which must be accepted by the staff, for the admissions of any person or persons and that these people can make their way about Leinster House?  The staff are in no way responsible and it was not suggested by anybody that they were. Nonetheless, in an effort to deflect the political attack made upon the Government, the Minister did not spare even the staff.  He dragged them into it as much as to say that the Opposition were striking at the staff of the House whereas, in fact, nothing of the kind occurred.  That sort of thing is to be deplored.  People should stand up and take their medicine and make their own defence without having to reach out for such ridiculously transparent defences as the Minister and the other Deputy I have mentioned made use of on that occasion.  It was time wasting and unnecessary but I suppose it did, in a sort of way, light up the paucity of ideas which has come upon the Government Party and particularly it has demonstrated the completely numbing effect which the result of the referendum has had on that Party.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that posing as they do, as the Iron Chancellors who are unafraid of unpopularity and who will proceed to impose on the nation the most rigorous economic regulations in regard to taxation in the interests of the nation, the Government are to some extent motivated by the knowledge that, no matter what they do, they are on their way out.  While, I suppose it would be reasonable to deduce that they will put the longest possible time between the referendum results and the date of the next election, it would also seem that they are anxious to launch whatever little lifeboats they can find to save as many survivors as possible from the political seas which are about to engulf them.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="871" /> must expect to be engulfed because for many years they have been getting farther and farther still away from contact with the very people upon whom they could once lean with such assurance for support.  Last night I had the privilege and honour of being present at a function where there was inaugurated the National Productivity Year and we heard a very intelligent and inspiring address from His Eminence, the Cardinal.  We also had an address by the Taoiseach, at the end of which he used a quotation which he said was from an old song, but which seemed to me to be more in the nature of a Freudian slip than anything else.  The old song he quoted was: &ldquo;It is time we were moving; it is time we passed on.&rdquo;&mdash; most apt words I should imagine for a gentleman in his peculiar situation at the present time.  The Taoiseach is very much a hazard man.  Indeed, looking around at some of his own supporters, the Taoiseach might very well repeat the words of Wellington when he looked at his regiment and remarked: &ldquo;I do not know what they will do to the enemy, but they terrify me&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Productivity is something which I suppose would be out of order in this debate if what we have seen earlier in the evening is to be taken as a lead, but reading through the speeches I notice that there has been a great deal of confusion about what actually is allowable in this debate. I wish to make the claim that in this debate, as in every other Budget debate, practically anything goes. In proof of that I would refer to the Taoiseach's speech in introducing the supplementary Budget, as reported at column 2058 of volume 236 of the Dáil Debates, dated 5th November:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimates of current expenditure in 1969-70 which we have obtained <Col N="872" /> from the Department point to an inevitable increase far exceeding any hope of revenue buoyancy and there is no doubt whatever of the need for every penny of the extra revenue now being raised to meet the extra expenditure to be faced next year under existing commitments and policies.  To illustrate the magnitude of this extra noncapital expenditure, I may quote some of the increases over the current year which are looming up&mdash; over £9 million on Central Fund services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Central Fund services cover a very wide field.  The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as much as £8 million for agriculture,</P>
    <P>Agriculture is a pretty wide-acred field.  Quoting further from the Taoiseach's speech:</P>
    <P>£5½ million for education, £2½ for social welfare and over £2 million for health.</P>
    <P>I take it that it will be in order and acceptable, and it ought to be, that reference, at least to matters which fall under these headings, may be discussed in the course of this debate. It seems to me, from reading the debates &mdash; I did not have the opportunity of that inestimable pleasure of coming in and listening to my colleagues last week and the week before but some of them read very well, especially Deputy Corry &mdash; that Government speakers were allowed to talk about practically anything but when other Members of the House took up the same subjects, I regret to observe, that they did not seem to be accorded the same degree of latitude.</P>
    <P>This may have been due to a combination of circumstances over which the Chair had no control.  I know that the Chair has a difficult job to do and I appreciate that it is not easy to maintain order in this House at all times but, nonetheless, the aim should be that there would be tolerance for everybody, otherwise the democratic nature of the establishment would lose its character.  I hope, however, that whatever I have to say will fall within <Col N="873" /> the Rules of Order, certainly within the very wide terms of reference set out in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    <P>For instance, one of the things mentioned last week was the thoughts of Mao Tse Tsung which, according to a Fianna Fáil Deputy, have been circulating in the Ballyfermot area and into which he reads the probability of the destruction of our civilisation and a conspiracy, which, if let grow, would bring about disaster for the State.  I spend a lot of my time in Ballyfermot &mdash; never a week goes by but I am there with the people of Ballyfermot &mdash; but I have yet to meet anybody carrying the little red book of Mao.  However, I have met a lot of people, and these in increasing numbers during the last few months, who are carrying other kinds of documents, notably what they call their labour exchange cards which is proof that they are signing on as unemployed at the labour exchange.  This Government, by reason of their policies and their neglect of the urgent business of the nation and because of their concentration on their own selfish Party political future and the preservation of their privileged status, by reason of their connivance in the referendum and general neglect of the important things which they are charged with doing, have permitted a situation to arise in which unemployment is becoming an ever-increasing evil in this town.</P>
    <P>Not a week goes by but I have representations from several of my constituents, even within the district of Ballyfermot &mdash; the biggest working class district in the country with almost 40,000 people living there.  These people come to me &mdash; a lot of them married &mdash; and they ask if I could suggest where they might get a job because they say, if they cannot get work, there is nothing for it but to clear off to England.  It is not the thoughts of Mao that are worrying these people but where they will get work and a decent week's wages and how they are going to try to carry on and meet the ever-increasing cost of living which is such a feature of the rake's progress of this administration.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fares increase. My God, what a piece of news for the average Dublin working-man.  In the <Col N="874" /> area of which I speak, most of the people are bus travellers, bus users.  Most of them probably have to take two buses, one to bring them into town and then another to take them to their place of work and they must also take two buses for the return journey.  To them, it can mean anything from 25/to 35/- a week.  That is a conservative estimate in relation to the proposal for a minimum fare of 6d.  This evening, we see announced in this newspaper a sanction for a further 20 per cent by the Minister for Transport and Power, a colleague of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lalor, who is now present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these evening papers give varying accounts.  However, an increase of 20 to 25 per cent &mdash; that is what they say &mdash; has been sanctioned by the Minister and that means that they have to find that money.  Already, the people have had to pay the increases which come about as a result of the Budget.  God knows, they are savage enough and bad enough.  There is the turnover tax, the concealed, hidden, sneaking increase, which is very substantial.  Five per cent means one-twentieth.  As somebody pointed out to me, in a gallon of petrol, this wholesale tax is an additional 3d&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know that.  In any event, coming on top of these impositions &mdash; the impositions invariably are made on the bulk of the people who cannot afford them &mdash; we get this proposal about bus fares.  I really think, speaking apart from political considerations, that it is nothing less than a damned scandal that the bus fares of the people living in these areas should be increased in this fashion or that the Minister should sanction such a proposal. There must be some other method and some other method should have been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You see, the Dublin system makes a profit.  The Dublin bus system always did make a profit.  Possibly it was the only part of CIE which did operate at a profit, and continued to do so, and yet the impost is made on it once more. Once more, the screw is turned on the Dublin system.  The thing is completely and utterly indefensible.  I have not the slightest doubt but that the people concerned must be filled with utter disgust, even those who have been misled into supporting Fianna Fáil on occasion.  They must be filled with despair at this kind of thing.  I was speaking to a woman this evening who has to work for her living.  She said: &ldquo;My God, this is desperate.  Every day you pick up the paper, there is another increase in the cost of living&rdquo;.  It is true, is it not?  Hardly a day goes by <Col N="876" /> but we read of some increases in something or other.  If it is not taxation, it is something like this &mdash; and it is invariably something about which the Government should take steps, something in which the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government say these taxes must be levied now and these Financial Resolutions implemented.  We say that the need for them has been created by the Government's own selfish policy of neglecting the affairs of the country &mdash; by wasting the time of the nation on a completely idle exercise about which they were advised, informed, abjured and criticised long before they even brought it to the Floor of the House &mdash; when they went and lost the referendum. It could not be said that they had not been told they would lose it. They must have been told many times by their own people they would lose. Yet, because of the influence wielded by one or two characters in the Cabinet &mdash; this is the kind of Cabinet we have that can be brought to heel because of one or two dictators in it &mdash; the country was put to this ridiculous expense.  The affairs of the country were neglected. Ministers were off in other directions trying to chase votes.</P>
    <P>Here we have another Budget and, on top of that, the Government have the cheek to ask us to accept a provision for errors in estimation of £4 million.  Is it suggested we have people not able to do even simple arithmetic? £4 million for errors in estimation! The other explanation for that figure, of course, is that the Government are plotting to have something in hand so as to make, maybe, the usual miserable, lousy gesture to the old aged category of people: that is the only way to describe it.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Seán Moore speak here this evening.  He gave expression to one sentiment with which I find myself in agreement.  He said that this generation will probably be judged, historically speaking, by what it did for the old aged, the disabled and the sick.  He went on to qualify it, of course, by saying &mdash; I do not want to question his sincerity because I know he probably believes what he is saying but it is completely contrary to the facts <Col N="877" /> in this case &mdash; that the record of this Government in the matter of such treatment is proud &mdash; something to that effect &mdash; but the opposite is the truth. The old aged people and the disabled and the sick, particularly the old aged and the disabled, stand out as being treated in the grossest possible fashion. I often think that the real crudity of politics is shown by the lack of humanity which has become, as it were, a symptom of Irish politics.  It is a growing symptom of the disease of Irish politics, the lack of humanity for people exemplified by the callous attitude of the Government Party towards the aged and the sick&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting mixed up.  You are the people who gave 2/6d in three years.  We gave 17/6d in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that. If the Parliamentary Secretary will be patient I have many interesting points to deal with.  I was referring to the callousness of the Government in giving a few shillings to these people and invariably it is at some distant date and you can be fairly sure that many of the old people who read about the increases will not be there to receive them.  It seems to me that that cynical attitude so typified in its essential nature by Fianna Fáil particularly in the last ten years, perhaps, longer, with the uprise of a more careerist type, less dedicated to ideals than to self-advancement, is due to the fact that old age pensioners number so few as a political force compared with others who number so many.  These are the things which are looked to &mdash; what is their voting value, not what is their merit, not what is our social obligation to them, but how much can they damage us if we do not give them this, that or the other.  Is this not the truth?  Is this not the yardstick which is applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous that it should be so but we do not know how many disabled persons there are.  As some Deputies will remember I introduced a Bill here to try to help the disabled and one of the facts which emerged from the discussion here on the Bill &mdash; which I may say failed because the Government Party turned it down &mdash;<Col N="878" /> was that we have no record of how many disabled there are.  It has been estimated that there are some 20,000 but that is merely a vague estimate. It is a very small number compared with the total electorate.  As far as I can observe this is what determines the attitude of the Government towards them when it comes to doing anything for them.  A disabled person gets 52/6d a week.  That type of cynicism and callousness may succeed for a little while, as it has succeeded amongst the present Fianna Fáil administration, but is has nothing lasting in it.  The people are fairly good judges of those running their affairs and over a period of years they are able to form judgments &mdash; by what process I do not know &mdash; as to the genuineness or otherwise of the Government and in time they are able to deal with them.  No matter what the apologists for Fianna Fáil may offer about the referendum it was not just a question of the people objecting to the attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party to cement themselves in office; there were countless grievances, distrusts and countless other things to which people felt they should give expression in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>All the talking here is irrelevant, only another election will show how much of that tidal wave against the Government will recede.  One can have whatever views one likes on it but inevitably it cannot all go back to its place of origin.  I am prepared to say that never again in our lifetime will there be a Government Party in a position of overwhelming power, strength and dictatorship such as they have enjoyed at periods within the last 30 or 40 years.  The day has come when people are moving towards a democratisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is probably not permitted in the constituency from which the Deputy emanates but I am expressing my point of view.  It may well be that in the constituency which the Deputy infests it may be illegal to express a contrary view but up here <Col N="879" /> you have to learn to take it as well as hand it out.  Nobody here has a monopoly to come in and hand it out. That is the great thing about having Parliament in Dublin ; you have to take it when you give it out.

    <P>*Already partly allotted.</P>
    <P>NOTES: 1.  It is not possible at present to indicate when the individual estates mentioned will be allotted but there will be no avoidable delay.  The necessary local enquiries preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>2.  During the last three complete financial years the aggregate area allotted in County Kildare was approximately 2,250 acres.</P>
    <P>3.  The properties numbered 2, 8, 9, 21 and 22 are being treated as a unit for resale purposes.  Work on the formulation of a composite scheme is proceeding as quickly as possible.  Properties numbered 10 and 13 have been retained on hands pending the acquisition of other lands so as to make for a better division of these estates.</P>
