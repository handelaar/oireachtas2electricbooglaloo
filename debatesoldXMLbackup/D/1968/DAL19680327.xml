      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to despatch a fact-finding mission as the Deputy's question suggests.  I am already only too well aware of the essential facts and sad consequences of the civil war in Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that this country has anything to contribute, as a result of Irish nationals living in all parts of that country, by way of mediation in the present dispute?  Since peace is the desired end, does the Minister think that we have anything to contribute by mediation as a result of the influence we have in that country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Any influence that we have is being used and has been used and was used even before the civil war broke out in order to try to get a peaceful settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think the situation is so serious that this country should use the undoubted goodwill that we have and the position we have in that country, in bringing peace?  Surely, it should be possible, <Col N="1184" /> by offering our disinterested services to make a contribution, by mediation, to the cause of peace in that country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no one in Nigeria who has any doubt as to our attitude on this disastrous conflict. They know that we are very anxious that there should be a cease-fire as quickly as possible and that negotiations should be entered into with a view to a lasting and stable peace that would uphold the rights of all the people of Nigeria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will report on his discussions with the British Minister of Agriculture regarding more satisfactory marketing arrangements; and whether improved transport facilities in England formed any part of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>At our meeting on 21st March, the British Minister and I had a further useful discussion on the cattle and beef trade between the two countries.  Our discusssion covered the general features of the trade and the possibility of further improvements in the interests of both countries, including the question of trends in cattle and beef supplies over the year.  While we did not come to final conclusions at this stage, we were able to clarify the main aspects arising.</P>
      <P>The question of transport facilities for cattle and beef did not form part of my discussion with Mr. Peart but my Department has been keeping in close touch with the companies engaged in the transport of cattle and beef so as to ensure that the best possible transport facilities are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that transport arrangements in England have been pretty hopeless for almost two years, through shortage of wagons?  Can anything now be done about the Fishguard line, when cattle <Col N="1186" /> are landed at Fishguard, to provide efficient transport?  I see by to-day's paper that the Birkenhead position has improved as a result of the decision to provide road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation.  I am further aware, as the Deputy now is, of the recently announced arrangements by B &amp; I in regard to road transport substituting for the run-down wagon trade and it would appear at this juncture that the road transport facilities proposed are pretty well adequate but, again, we will find this out as we go along.  We seem to be satisfied at the moment that it is a fair enough effort on their part to take our trade by road and we can only watch and wait and see how it works out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the prospect of a similar sort of arrangement for Fishguard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>These things, as I say, are being kept under review.  There are certain discussions going ahead in regard to the overall transportation of our cattle in order to try to improve the situation and, indeed, to prevent any disimprovement.  Loading through Fishguard is being looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if arising out of the discussions generally, any positive steps are being taken by either Government to bring about more efficient arrangements for our exports of cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily arising from the discussions.  I would not say that they have produced anything of any great worth in this regard other than to highlight and isolate the difficulties that were encountered some time back, not least of the contributing factors being the undue rush of cattle at one particular time of the year.  We have learned a great deal from this experience and last year we utilised this knowledge and experience to obviate, through the co-operation of our farmers and exporters, any recurrence of this back-end glut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will comment on the new outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England; and whether he is contemplating reintroducing more stringent precautions here to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a recurrence of foot and mouth disease on some farms in Britain which had previously been infected and were in process of restocking.  Apparently some traces of virus still remained on these farms, following the original outbreaks.</P>
      <P>While this is naturally disappointing, the cases in question appear to be isolated ones which do not represent a new spread of the disease.  In fact, cases of this kind were not wholly unexpected.</P>
      <P>Stringent precautions are still in operation here against the introduction of the disease into this country and the position is being kept under close and constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will state with regard to the dismissal of a veterinary surgeon (name supplied) from the tuberculosis and the brucellosis schemes from 31st July, 1967 to 1st December, 1967, why documents and submissions in the case remained unacknowledged and untraced for four months and were only acknowledged when the veterinary surgeon in question was reinstated and after several letters had been sent by him to the Department demanding acknowledgment, in view of the fact that all important letters were delivered by hand to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The correspondence referred to, which consisted of three documents, seems to have been handed in to the Department about 27th November.  This was at the height of the foot and mouth disease crisis, <Col N="1188" /> when all available staff resources were concentrated on the highly important duty of strengthening our defences against this disease.  As a result of these abnormal circumstances, the correspondence could not, unfortunately, be traced for some time but at the request of my Department, the veterinary surgeon furnished copies of two of the documents to the Department on 21st December and these were, of course, acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (<i>a</i>) why a veterinary surgeon (name supplied) was dismissed from the tuberculosis and brucellosis schemes from 31st July to 1st December 1967; (<i>b</i>) whether any inquiry was held by his Department into this case; (<i>c</i>) whether the veterinary surgeon was informed of it beforehand, and, if not, why; (<i>d</i>) whether he was afforded an opportunity of stating his position; (<i>e</i>) whether he, being an assistant, was asked for a written explanation as to why irregularities occurred; and (<i>f</i>) whether the principal veterinary surgeon received a similar inquiry; what were the findings of the inquiry; if he was similarly penalised, and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the two veterinary practitioners in question are to appear before a disciplinary committee of the Veterinary Council and it would not be appropriate to offer detailed comments on the Deputy's question at the present time.</P>
      <P>I may add, however, that Ministers for Agriculture have at all times retained and exercised the specific right to review the performance of practitioners who are paid fees under my Department's schemes and to take appropriate action where necessary. In all such cases action has been taken only after careful and exhaustive examinaton of all the facts.  Such action does not, of course, interfere with a veterinary surgeon's right to practise his profession, as this is a matter for the Veterinary Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>From information received by my Department it appears that up to 90 per cent of the wool on offer in 1967 has been sold.  I have no specific information about how much of it might have been considered inferior but it would appear that there was an improvement in the presentation of the wool as compared with other years.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a sewerage <Col N="1190" /> scheme for Glantane, Mallow, were submitted to my Department by Cork County Council on 24th November, 1967.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The rapid rate of private and local authority house building in the Dublin area where more than 25,000 dwellings have been provided in the present and last five financial years has resulted in the danger of a shortage of serviced land for building arising in some parts of the area.  To ensure that this shortage does not, in fact, materialise I have encouraged the Dublin local authorities to undertake a special programme for the provision of services in additional areas and also for the execution as soon as possible of sanitary services schemes to serve further large areas.</P>
      <P>Sites resulting from the provision of additional services and as a result of the special site subsidy introduced by me are being made available for private building.  I may add that, as I indicated last September to the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers, Dublin Corporation have said that they will consider making land available in the Dublin area for private housing to small builders who require sites and cannot get them and discussions between the corporation and the federation have already taken place on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of boys who may be accommodated in St. Patrick's detention home, Dublin; what steps are being taken to relieve the over-crowded situation there; whether it is proposed to build a new detention home to replace St. Patrick's and, if so, when, where and at what cost.</P>

      <P>The number of youths who can be housed in St. Patrick's Institution is 204.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act of 1960 empowered the courts to commit youths up to the age of 21 years to the institution for periods of less than two years, instead of to the prisons, as was the law up to then and the courts have been making increasing use of these powers.  In consequence, the time has arrived when it is necessary to provide additional accommodation. Arrangements in that regard are in motion and it is hoped that additional <Col N="1203" /> accommodation for about 60 will be available in a new premises in a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention to build new premises in replacement of St. Patrick's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no reduction in the extent of foot patrols performed in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, where the number of gardaí is greater than at any time in the past. Foot patrols are supplemented by additional patrols by gardaí in motor cars or on motor cycles.  The number allocated to various duties is varied on occasions as may be required by circumstances, and I am satisfied that the Garda authorities are making the most effective use of the manpower and police equipment at their disposal.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda have a duty to take all reasonable measures to prevent possible breaches of the peace in circumstances where a dispute between groups of persons is in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> The standard measures taken by the local gardaí in the cases referred to by the Deputies, which included the provision of escorts for vehicles entering and leaving the premises, were in pursuance of their ordinary duty.  There was no need for them to look for instructions from me and, in fact, they did not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As mentioned in the question, there were changes of escorts across the country on the night in question.  Is the Minister aware that, at 3 a.m., the vehicle, escorted by gardaí, went through the town of Nenagh without any lights at 57 miles per hour?  Has the Minister any comment to make on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no comment to make on what the Deputy alleges.  If he is referring to a breach of speeding regulations, I do not know if that is so. If the matter has been reported by the Deputy, no doubt it will be investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that, in the circumstances of this dispute, gardaí should be involved in a trade dispute which, as the Minister is aware, concerns a breach of established industrial relations conventions in this country?  In such circumstances, does the Minister think it proper that the taxpayers' money, as well as the time of the gardaí, should be used in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí are not involved in this or any other trade dispute.  Their duty always has been to keep the peace.  That is what they are doing in the circumstances of this particular dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our regret that the valuable time of the gardaí is wasted in connection with this dispute. They have more important work to do than merely to protect a company which wishes to ignore our industrial relations law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda escort might not have been necessary if those concerned had not got into a car and followed the particular lorry on this occasion.  In these circumstances, the gardaí would be in breach of duty <Col N="1205" /> unless they anticipated trouble and followed in order to keep the peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they had, so long as they did not commit a breach of the peace.  Nobody stopped them from following the vehicle in question. The gardaí saw them follow another vehicle and naturally, in the circumstances of the dispute, felt it their duty to follow and to see that there would be no breach of the peace</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is his intention to take over the provision, repair and upkeep of courthouses required by his Department in the Republic and to include these matters in his estimates for the coming year, thus relieving the ratepayers of this onerous burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have under consideration the question of capital expenditure on courthouses and have decided, as an initial step, to set up an inter-departmental committee which will consider, among other things, whether a prototype building could be devised which would serve for both courthouse and other purposes</P>
      <P>Additionally, the committee which is inquiring into Court Practices and Procedures is considering the venues at which court sittings may be held in the future and it may be that, as a result of what they may recommend, some existing courthouses will be closed.</P>
      <P>As soon as the reports of these committees have been received and examined, the Government will give further consideration to the question of capital expenditure, but I cannot say how soon this point will be reached.  In the meantime, it is not the intention to alter the position in which, pursuant to the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, the maintenance of courthouses is the responsibility of the local authorities.</P>

I wish to inform the Minister that I have no intention of placing that burden on the shoulders of the large number of ratepayers of my county who have to come in there as unpaid jurors to take up these cases.  I do not know where the Minister will find the money but we have no intention of striking any rate for it in the coming year.</P>

      <P>The recent run on gold had no direct effects on this country.  As I have already indicated, developments are being carefully watched and I am not aware that they are causing undue public anxiety.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have seen the statement issued by the governors of the central banks of the countries participating in the gold pool after their meeting in Washington on 16 and 17 March.  I am hopeful that the decisions made at that meeting will help to stabilise the situation and restore confidence in the international monetary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent events, however, confirm the need for basic reform of the international monetary system.  The proposed scheme of special drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund, the plans for which are at present being completed, would be a <Col N="1213" /> substantial move in this direction.  As I stated at last year's annual meeting of the Fund, it is important that the new scheme be formally established and activated without delay.</P>
    <P>The measures being taken by Britain and the United States to correct the disequilibrium in their external payments may create some temporary difficulties for exporters to these countries and for the tourist industry.  It is now more important than ever, therefore, to ensure that our goods and services are fully competitive.  The US and British restrictions on foreign investment underline the importance of increased investment of national savings in the economic development of this country.</P>

      <P>The contribution conditions governing entitlement to any social insurance benefit are designed to secure that in order to obtain benefit a claimant must be in effective insurance and that that insurance has covered a reasonable period.  In the case <Col N="1223" /> of maternity benefit these conditions are (a) that at least 26 contributions have been paid and (b) that not less than 26 contributions have been paid or credited in the contribution year to which entitlement to benefit is related. The contribution year in the case of women is the 12 month period from the first Monday in July.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise, however, that the contributions required to satisfy the second condition mentioned need not necessarily be paid contributions as the Deputy implies; they may, in fact, be contributions credited in respect of periods of duly notified incapacity or unemployment.</P>

We have been challenged by commentators why individually we did not say how the changes might affect our particular areas.  There has been a strange lack of comment in that respect from the opposite side of the House.  If a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies stood up and really spoke the truth, a lot of them would say: &ldquo;I am going out under this new system.&rdquo;  I could pinpoint several Fianna Fáil Deputies who would disappear under the new system, and they know it.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am helping the Government Party because I have examined all the reasons they have advanced so far.  They have been helpful to us.  They are very anxious that we should have a good Opposition with a view to forming an alternative Government.  I feel it is my duty to help them and give them an added reason for altering the electoral system.  The abolition of Partition would, in the heel of the hunt, be an excellent reason to advance.  You would synchronise our electoral system with that in the north of Ireland and I would imagine, with a few more journeys between North and South by the various Ministers, that if we altered the electoral system, we would just have the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, last night I was dealing with the situation in my own area, South Tipperary and Waterford.  As we stand, we have three Fianna Fáil Deputies, two Labour and two Fine Gael Deputies.  That was until the death of the late Deputy Lynch: <Col N="1227" /> seven seats: three, two and two.  I am convinced that under the suggested system of tolerance voting, they could so arrange matters that in both South Tipperary and Waterford, Fine Gael and Labour would not get a single vote in any of the four seats in South Tipperary and the four seats in Waterford.  I have no doubt at all about that in the case of South Tipperary.  Fine Gael has fair support in South Tipperary.  On average, we get 13,000 votes.  Labour has possibly 7,000 votes.  Does anyone suggest it would be either fair or just to deprive 20,000 people in South Tipperary in our lifetime&mdash;I do not know how long any of us will live, but certainly during the next ten or 12 years&mdash;of representation?  Does anyone think it would be either fair or just to put those 20,000 people into a position in which they could never effectively participate in an election?  I should not like to see Fine Gael do this.  If Fine Gael were to adumbrate a policy such as this, I should immediately suffer a crisis of conscience and I would have to decide whether or not I should leave Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The safest thing in any democracy is to allow people to express opinions. There is an old-fashioned institution in London called Hyde Park Corner.

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> No system should be evolved which will either silence or suppress people. Why should we introduce a system which will drive people underground? We know what has happened in other countries.  The safest system is to allow people to express themselves.  As people grow older, they change their views.  Look at our universities.  Young men do the most unstable things and these same young men ultimately become the most stable members of the community and the leaders of society.  This is a process of growing up.  Our system here allows Parties to grow up.  It is part of an educational system and our people, although we are backward in many ways, have apparently grasped the system.  They use it and they like it.  They are able to distinguish between individuals and Parties.  We allow them to do that. But, under the proposed new system, we will tell them that they must vote in one small area for Mr. A, in another small area for Mr. B and in another small area for Mr. C.  We will deprive them of choice.  Backward as we are, are we to become even more backward still?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend that our system could not be improved but I believe the principle underlying it is the right principle.  There may be defects in the system.  I am no specialist in proportional representation, but, whatever the defects may be, they could have been examined by the Committee.  But they were not examined by the Committee. The system could be improved.  Not one suggestion has come from the Opposite Benches to show how the system could be improved.  All they <Col N="1229" /> want to do is to abolish the system and introduce in its place something alien to this country, the British system.  We are told in one and the same breath that we must abolish proportional representation because it was imposed on us by the British and that we must adopt the British system.  Are 20,000 people in South Tipperary to be disfranchised under such a system?  I have given the statistics for South Tipperary.  Other Deputies can give the statistics for their particular constituencies.  In that way we would have a staggering total of people disfranchised under this proposed system.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we could have the single seat with proportional representation.  That would be something like a by-election.  It is incorrect to talk of the single-seat with proportional representation because there is no such thing.  There is the transferable vote, but that is not proportional representation.  I have heard many Fine Gael Deputies and one Labour Deputy say that would be a good idea.  I do not know how many Government supporters believe that the single seat with the transferable vote would be a good thing.  I think many of them still believe that.  They have the notion &ldquo;proportional representation is the thing we want and if they make single seats, what harm, that is fair enough, so long as we have proportional representation&rdquo;.  That is a dangerous situation and it is dangerous thinking.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if Fianna Fáil had to make a choice between the question of single seats and proportional representation &mdash; and they want the single seat and the abolition of proportional representation &mdash; they would opt for single seats, whatever form of election you would have.  From their point of view, in so far as they could secure more seats, in that way they would be right and it would probably delude a lot of people in this country that this was a fair compromise.  There could be no more unfair compromise. The single seat with so-called PR&mdash; because it is not PR&mdash;is a delusion and a trap and a trap which might ensnare many Fine Gael people up and down the country.  I do not know how many Fine Gael Deputies it might ensnare <Col N="1230" /> because it has not been discussed but I am convinced that it would trap an awful lot of honest, well-thinking Fine Gael people all over this country.</P>
    <P>I am dealing now specifically with it because it has been the most dangerous suggestion that has ever emanated in this House, even from the narrow Fine Gael viewpoint.  I will try to explain it.  It is not necessary to explain it, probably, to many people in this House although, possibly, some Fine Gael Deputies still do not understand it and certainly the rank and file of the Fine Gael people up and down the country, as far as I understand from going amongst them, do not yet understand its significance.  They are convinced that this is a fair compromise, that we will have PR, that it will give Labour and other minorities a chance to survive and get representation and as regards the single seat that there is not very much wrong with that.</P>
    <P>It must be apparent to anybody that as you cut down the number of seats in constituencies, you are interfering with the question of proportionality.  Proportionality is inverse to the number of seats in constituencies.  Down through the years the number of seats has been reduced to the constitutional minimum of three in a large number of constituencies.  I do not know whether there was much opposition here from Labour or from Fine Gael during the various Electoral Bills that went through, reducing the number of seats in the constituencies.  Deputy Corish would know that better than I.  I do not know what attitude was adopted here but I presume that Labour must have objected to the reduction of seats in every constituency.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is clear that not alone Labour but any minority Party, Independents, any new Party that might arise, would reject the notion of single seats in any circumstances and it is, therefore, <Col N="1231" /> obvious that, from the Fine Gael point of view, if the question of single seats with the alternative vote&mdash;because that is all it is&mdash;is promulgated, there is very little future for any Opposition on this side of the House in that proposition.</P>
      <P>For example, take it that there are 144 seats.  If we accept the fact that Fianna Fáil will get 100 of these seats in the first count, it is probable then that Fine Gael will get, say, 28 or 30; Labour, nine or ten.  Let us envisage the position that there is a transferable vote system in operation.  Where is this Party going to get its transfers?  With Fianna Fáil first in 100 constituencies, there could be second or third in only 44.  I could not tell you in what number of these they would be second or third.  The minorities would be second or third in, possibly, 100 seats.  Therefore, the great reservoir of transfers, from the Fine Gael point of view, would have to be the minority Parties. That is in the order of things.  If, therefore, the minority Parties refuse&mdash;I think they could not do otherwise&mdash;to accept the notion of single seats with so-called proportional representation, where are Fine Gael to go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They could, for instance, vote straight but the Fine Gael Party have already rejected that.  They could not very well vote for the minorities because the minorities would not be giving them transfers because they had already been let down by Fine Gael. They could do a deal with Fianna Fáil. They could do a transfer arrangement with Fianna Fáil but in so far as Fianna Fáil would be in front four times out of five, it would be a oneway street and all that would come out of it would be that Fine Gael would give all their transfers to Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil, even with the best will in the world, would be in no position to help Fine Gael because they would be in front four times out of five.  All that would eventuate, probably, in the complete obliteration of Labour.  A situation could arise where Labour could not get a single seat in this House.  Does anybody want that? Do even Fianna Fáil want that?  Mad <Col N="1232" /> as they are, I doubt if they are that mad.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, see no future whatsoever in the amendment which the newspapers have promised us from Deputy Norton.  I cannot speak for Fine Gael. I am just a member of the Fine Gael Party.  The Fine Gael Party have not discussed Deputy Norton's amendment. It has not appeared on the Order Paper as yet.  I do not know how it would be worded but I have tried to analyse it from the Fine Gael attitude as objectively as I could.  Several other members of the Fine Gael Party may have different views from the one I have put but I see no future whatsoever in that amendment and no value to be got from it, from the narrow Fine Gael viewpoint.</P>

I wrote a short article recently in a local newspaper in which I used the term &ldquo;single seat with PR&rdquo;.  I did that deliberately because I felt it was the only way to get my ideas across to the people.  The correct term is: single seat with the alternative vote.  The Irish people have become so accustomed to proportional representation and understand it so well that when you are speaking to them, you have to use that kind of terminology, even though it may be incorrect.</P>

The Deputy will agree with me that the principle of proportional representation was enshrined in the 1923 Constitution, but, later on, in the 1937 Constitution, Mr. de Valera copperfastened it as the existing system.  He was challenged at that time and advised from this side of the House not to make it so watertight, just to leave it as the principle of proportional representation, which would give this House a certain latitude to improve or amend it.  So long as only the principle was enshrined, that could be done.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> From the point of view of proportional representation, let us take the simple example of the last by-election in Wicklow.  There was a case where the Fianna Fáil candidate, Miss Nancy O'Neill, secured something over 30 per cent of the votes.  Under the new system the Government are proposing, she would be the Deputy today.  Something over 60 per cent of the people would have come to the polling booths and voted and felt dissatisfied that their first, second, third and fourth preferences were being ignored.  If that is democracy, I just do not understand the term.  Why should the candidate who secured not more than one-third of the votes be the elected Member? Deputy Molloy is a member of many committees.  He probably is a member of Galway County Council.  I know county councils have not many appointments to make now but, if there is an appointment to be made there, what system do they use?</P>

The lowest is eliminated and the second count is taken. Then the next chap is eliminated.  That is the system we have adopted as far as I know since the inception in South Tipperary and I think it is the system in every county council.</P>

Here we are trying to have the best of two worlds.  We have adopted the British system where we have one election to elect a house of representatives or Dáil and that body elects a Government.

    <P>There is no suggestion whatsoever in this report which has been submitted to us here that the existing system should be altered.  Many arguments could be advanced in favour of the suggestion that we could do something better than have our President as a mere rubber stamp, and interviewing VIPs from other countries.  We could have an executive president as obtains in the US, a president who works and <Col N="1236" /> gives a return for the money he receives.  If the Minister thinks that is a proper suggestion, he is in a position to put it forward.  So far, he and his Party have failed to put forward that suggestion.  Much could be said for it.</P>
    <P>In so far as the electorate have to fulfil a dual function of electing a representative assembly and through it, an executive, I think the PR system should be the paramount consideration.  I disagree entirely with the notion of the Fianna Fáil Party that the primary function of the electorate is to elect a Government.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I was trying to get around to the question raised last night by Deputy Andrews.  I am sorry he is not here. I told him I would try to explain something to him.  I think he was genuinely looking for information and I am delighted to convey the little information I have to him.  He had the notion that the single-seat system, the by-election system, was proportional representation, and that even using the alternative vote was still proportional representation.  Of course it is not.  It is nothing more than the single seat with the transferable vote system.  Deputy Costello mentioned this in the House and expressed his opinion that our by-elections here have all been unconstitutional.  From a lawyer of his eminence, one must take notice of that observation.  If PR is, as it is, enshrined in the Constitution, then the by-election system which we operate here, if it does not subscribe to the notion of proportionality within a reasonable degree, is unconstitutional, I presume.  The single-seat system even with the alternative vote does not give proportionality.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> If proportionality is an essential factor in our system here under the Constitution, then it is quite probable that all of our by-elections could be described as unconstitutional.  I will give the Deputy some examples.  In one election in Britain, the Labour Party got almost a two to one majority of the seats on 48 per cent of the votes.  That was under the system which we operate in by-elections, and which would operate under the new scheme proposed by the Government.  In that election, 177 members were elected with fewer votes than the combined Opposition.  In the last election in Britain, Labour got most votes in Lincolnshire and Rutland, but they won only three seats, whereas the Conservatives won six seats.  In two consecutive elections in Leicester, the Conservatives got more votes but won only one seat to Labour's three.  If proportionality is enshrined in our Constitution, it would seem that the arguments advanced by Deputy Costello are well-founded.</P>

I think it was the Minister who said it would be&mdash;I may not be reporting his exact words&mdash; simply catastrophic almost if Fianna Fáil remained in power for too long.

He is still a man with influence and respect in this House and outside it.  Here and now, I would ask him to depart from his notion of submitting an amendment which people up and down the country are questioning why he is doing it.  He is leaving himself in a position of being misinterpreted.  There would be no misinterpretation if he used his good offices and his still powerful influence to secure a common front on this side of the House, a common opposition.

May I invite him to use his undoubted talents for division in the opposite way and he may find he is equally talented for unifying, if he is sincere, if he believes in the national interest that a unified Opposition should be provided?  If Fine Gael and Labour Members also believe that a unified Opposition is essential to the national welfare, every member of Labour and Fine Gael should do something about it.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I must apologise on behalf of my interrupters.  I will conclude my remarks.  I made the points I wanted to make and I feel I have secured one friend in the House.  I may mention him by name, Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton has got a new approach and I believe he is with me in the broad concepts which I have outlined.  Again I would appeal to Deputy Norton to use his influence to provide us here with what the country demands and what the country would welcome tomorrow morning, a united front on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> I believe there is a new awakening and I believe that, not alone in the camps of Fine Gael and Labour but elsewhere, there will be a new awakening of non-committed people who are standing on the sidelines waiting for some means of reversing the downward trend, of ending the stagnation which we have endured over the past 36 years, the impossible position we found ourselves in that we could not provide an alternative Government.  I believe we can provide an alternative Government through a united Opposition in this House under the present electoral system.  I want that electoral system to be maintained and I advocate unity on this side of the House to maintain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity that the debate on this important matter which we are submitting to the people should have degenerated into partisanship, because the Government are open to constructive thought being brought to bear on these matters which are before the House with a view to devising a system of election here which is acceptable to our people and, at the same time, for future generations of Irish men and women, will guarantee an effective Government.</P>
      <P>The basic purpose of all organised society is to secure a government. That is the whole reason initially why men came together to organise themselves into society and to elect a head. There have been various forms of society created over the years, totalitarian forms of government.  Out of men's mature consideration and out of the centuries gradually has emerged the democratic form of government. The whole challenge facing democracy today is to ensure, along with preserving the essential liberties which man has evolved for himself out of the democratic system, that, at the same time, the democratic system would yield effective government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen how the monolithic communist system has guaranteed effective government of a type which would not be acceptable to free men and women, but it has given effective government in Soviet Russia and other countries throughout the world.  We <Col N="1249" /> want to make sure that we can at the same time preserve the democratic liberties and yield effective government.  In this respect I think the election system is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>The proportional representation system of election evolved out of the thinking of various Victorian thinkers of the last century who regarded parliament as a debating chamber rather than a means of providing effective government.  That system of election is based on a fundamental philosophical misconception of the whole purpose of organised society.  It is based on the misconception that the purpose of electing people to parliament is to yield an exact statistical representation.  That is the secondary purpose of elections.  That is the secondary purpose of having an organised democratic society.  The primary purpose is to have an election system that will yield an effective government when the election is over.</P>
    <P>Although certain Victorian thinkers in Britain advocated proportional representation, including John Stuart Mill and Thomas Hare, who thought up this in the first instance, the British people out of their maturity garnered over the years never thought of adopting this system.  It is pertinent in this context to read what was said in the British House of Commons in 1924 by the then Leader of the Labour Party, the late Herbert Morrison.  Although the Labour Party was the third biggest Party in the British Parliament, it was the minority Party in the British House of Commons, as the Irish Labour Party is in Ireland today.  Did Herbert Morrison or any of the Labour Party leaders at that time seek to secure the shelter of PR as a means of securing statistical representation for themselves in Parliament?  No.  They accepted the challenge of the straight vote and proceeded to go ahead and organise themselves on a national basis, eventually becoming the Government Party in Britain.</P>
    <P>I quote what Herbert Morrison said at column 2022, volume 172 of <i>Hansard</i>, 1924, when a discussion took place on a Private Member's Bill in <Col N="1250" /> relation to the introduction of PR. Speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, at that time the minority Party in the House of Commons, Herbert Morrison said:</P>
    <P>Proportional Representation is a philosophy which is not unnatural to small new parties struggling to get a footing in the electoral field, and not having much staying power or pluck to fight.  It is also perfectly natural to decaying political parties, who are doomed to extinction in the course of time, and who can only retain their position by elevating the power of the minority and subjecting the power of the majority.  It is perfectly natural to them, but it is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly, and I hope, therefore, that the House will not accept that type of government.</P>
    <P>Herbert Morrison continued to struggle and organise the people of Britain who were attracted to the Labour philosophy along with the other leaders of the Labour movement in Britain, and saw the day when he in 1945 took his place in the Labour Government.</P>
    <P>I think his remarks were very apposite to our present situation.  We have here in the Labour Party in Ireland a Party who do not appear to have much staying power or pluck to fight.  We have in the Fine Gael Party a decaying Party doomed to extinction and seeking to hold their representation in the House only for the purpose of debating rather than governing.  This, of course, is the fundamental issue in this proposition of ours.  I put it again, as we have already put it, to the leaders both of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party: are they seriously interested in the essentials of politics?  What do they regard as their function in this House? What do they regard as their purpose in fighting elections?</P>
    <P>I would put it to them that the whole purpose of every one of us being in politics is to achieve power through Government and in the achievement of power through Government, to do the greatest good we can, which according to our lights, should be done, for the greatest number of people.  We all have <Col N="1251" /> our ideals.  They are the basic motivation of anybody going into politics but the purpose of going into politics is not merely to come in and debate and talk about politics as if it were some academic exercise removed from the realities of life.</P>
    <P>If there is any purpose in the Dáil, the whole purpose is that strong men and women, having common ideals, seek to achieve power and when in power, seek to do the best according to their ideals. This system of election can enable an alternative national Party, whichever of the alternative Parties here&mdash;the Labour Party perhaps, or the Fine Gael Party&mdash;under the system we propose, to guarantee that, because it is a complete admission of failure on the part of Labour or Fine Gael to suggest that that system would result in a permanent Fianna Fáil Government.  It has not happened in Great Britain.  We have seen the Whigs and the Tories, the Liberals and the Conservatives, fighting out their great battles over the centuries.  We have seen the Liberal Party going into decay and being replaced by the Labour Party.  We have seen the Conservatives challenging for power and the people sometimes accepting one of the Parties and then, when the other Party offers a challenge and presents a broad programme before the people and appeals to the national consensus of opinion, we have seen the people rejecting the Government and accepting that other Party.  The system is operated in that other great democracy, the United States of America.  We have seen two great national Parties evolve, challenging each other for power on the basis of suggesting to the people a broad programme on which they seek to secure acceptance from the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen the people making their decision between the two.  Mark you, when one considers that vast continent of democracy, the United States of America, and when one considers Great Britain itself, and the numbers of people involved in these <Col N="1252" /> countries in this great democratic process, one finds it very hard to believe how we in Ireland, with three million people, cannot channel our various aspirations and points of view within the broad stream of two national Parties challenging for the soul of our people and challenging for support from the people.  Two national Parties can absorb the political energies of the people in the United States and in Great Britain and I fail to see how two political Parties, or three national Parties, if the Labour Party come forward as the Labour Party has in Great Britain, and supersedes one of these national Parties, cannot contain and stand for the aspirations for progress which arise in the minds and hearts of the people.</P>
      <P>This is a fundamental thing which has been ignored by Fine Gael and Labour speakers.  It is the sort of thing that was uppermost in the mind of Father Fergal O'Connor when he made an interesting contribution along these lines in using this kind of argument recently.  It was borne out a few moments ago by Deputy Hogan.  Proportional representation in our society has led to stagnant politics, politics in which there is not the cut and thrust of challenge and change.  It has led to that form of politics over the years, led to the sort of politics where under this system at present the only alternative to Fianna Fáil is a form of Coalition, in which the Labour Party quite plainly state here they do not wish to participate.  This is the only alternative to Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again in the next election, if we have the system of PR, we will have all the old arid arguments again of for and against Coalition.  We have heard these arguments for long enough.  I should like a better type of politics; let us have an Opposition Party challenging us on our policies, putting forward candidates of character and challenging our candidates in single seats, and if accepted and we are beaten, taking office in Government and pushing forward their points.  That would put the onus on us to put ourselves in order and to come up with a better personnel as candidates.  This is the very guts of politics.  You will never get it under <Col N="1253" /> PR because PR of its very nature tends to stagnation and defeats change.  There is an in-built resistance to change in the PR system of election.</P>
    <P>We all know that various Deputies are elected to the Dáil under that system who might well suffer defeat under the single-seat system.  The single-seat system would improve the calibre of the people in this House as well as putting the onus on Deputies to be progressive.  It would improve the political Parties who challenge for government.  You would have candidates of a calibre who would win under the single-seat system rather than be carried in on preferences under proportional representation.  These are the facts that we have plainly seen, in my view, under PR: too much stagnant politics and not enough challenging politics.  We will continue to have that under PR.</P>
    <P>The situation is now worse than it used be because quite plainly from recent Labour Party statements, they will not participate in a Coalition Government so that after the next election, in the event of Fianna Fáil not securing an overall majority, you would have Fine Gael as the second Party and the Labour Party as the third Party and refusing to go into a Coalition.  There you have all the basis for anarchy.  You have a stalemate position in which the Parliament elected by the people will be frustrated from electing a Government.  The only alternative would be another election with possibly another stalemate, resulting eventually, after a number of elections, in the position that we will succeed on the negative argument that there is no alternative to us.  Is that the kind of stagnant politics the politicians want in the 60s, the 70s and the 80s?</P>
    <P>Today, for good or ill&mdash;I think for good&mdash;the Government are playing a stronger part in the whole economic and social development of the community.  This is the great new achievement of the 20th century.  I feel it is an essential thing in modern life because we were faced with the challenge of the totalitarian system, the challenge of the communist system, and the onus was on the democratic countries <Col N="1254" /> to work democracy and to avoid the dangers of the 20s and the 30s when democratic government failed because they did not participate in managing the economies of their countries.  They went to the wall, became bankrupt and so, in the post-war period, more democratic governments have taken a stronger hand in running their economies in order to prevent any more the hunger marches, the mass unemployment, the suffering and misery of the 20s and the 30s.  That very fact has meant, since the war, strong central government and that depends on strong and effective political Parties, depends on a strong electoral system which will return strong and effective political Parties who can compete for power from the people and on achieving power, exercise effective government.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of democratic politics that are the right politics in the 60s and in the 70s.  This is the sort of politics that neither Fine Gael nor Labour are willing to face up to&mdash;the sort of politics that evolve under a strong and effective Government based on strong and effective nationally organised Parties, such as you have in America, now in France, and West Germany where they are getting rid of the transferable vote system, in Canada and New Zealand.  That is the sort of politics we want.</P>
    <P>I was challenged on one point I made on television.  I stated that our system of proportional representation did not exist in any other country in the world. That is quite true.  I think it was Deputy Esmonde who challenged me.  Our particular system of proportional representation, involving, as it does, a choice of personalities on the ballot paper, exists in no other sovereign country in the world.  It is in operation in Tasmania in regard to the Lower House only, but it is not used as a system of election to any sovereign parliament in the world.</P>
    <P>There is another system of proportional representation, which is known as the list system, which is used in a number of continental countries, for example, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Austria.  Under that system, the voter puts an X <Col N="1255" /> opposite the party list, but it is not a system that allows the voter to make a choice between personalities in the same constituency.  We know what goes on under our system.  We know the sort of skulduggery that goes on between members of the same political Party, the sort of competition that exists between the Deputies of all political Parties.  We know&mdash;let us face it&mdash;that elections are not as straightforward as they should be.  We know that the system is not as clean a system as the single-seat system under which each candidate is alone representative of his political Party and fights for his seat on his personality and policy against single lone representatives from other political Parties.  That is a far cleaner, a more open and a more rational system.</P>
    <P>As I said, our system of proportional representation, based on competing personalities within the same constituency, does not operate in regard to elections in any other democratic sovereign parliament in the world.  These facts must be brought out into the open because what we want to see here are broadly-based national Parties.  That will be the correct way in which to govern in the years that lie ahead.  We do not want dictatorship by a minority, such a dictatorship as we had during the two Coalition Governments.  Is there anything democratic in a situation such as that which existed under the last Coalition Government in 1957 where, because members of a three-man Party, the Clann na Poblachta Party, decided to withdraw their support, the Government broke up?  That is not the majority calling the tune. That is a small minority calling the tune.  There was a similar situation in 1951 when the first Coalition Government broke up, again because of division within the smallest Party in that Government.  That is democracy gone mad.  That is a situation in which a small splinter minority can upset the Government at will.</P>
    <P>The basic weakness of coalition government is that you have in that government members who are not loyal to one common party but loyal primarily to the parties that put them <Col N="1256" /> there, rather than to the government, and, if the party that put them there, as happened in 1951 and 1957, decide to withdraw support, those particular members of that party are responsible to the party itself and not to the majority view of the government of which they are members.  That is the basic weakness in the coalition system. However, we do not have to deal with that argument now because the Labour Party have made it a main plank in their programme not to co-operate in coalition with Fine Gael again but rather to pursue some vague socialist shibboleth.</P>
    <P>Other matters raised in this debate have been, in my opinion, of a dishonest character.  The Six Counties have been bandied about here.  The argument has been that, because the straight vote system operates there, that <i>per se</i> is the cause of the Unionist domination in the Six Counties.  Unionist domination has nothing whatsoever to do with that.  Unionist domination in the Six Counties has been and is based on naked sectarianism.  It has nothing to do with the system of election.  In the 1920s they had proportional representation in the Six Counties.  An analysis of the results is rather interesting.  In 1921 and in 1925, under proportional representation, the National Republican and Sinn Féin group got 12 seats and the Unionist group&mdash;there were a few Independent Unionists&mdash;got 34 seats.  In 1929 they changed over to the straight vote system and it is interesting to recall that, in that election, the Republicans actually dropped a seat from 12 to 11; but they got it back again under the straight vote system in 1933.  In 1933, under the straight vote system, representation went back to what it was under proportional representation in 1921 and 1925.  In 1933, the Unionists got 34 seats and the Republicans and Sinn Féin 12 seats.  There was not one whit difference in representation.  That should discount for all time this highly dishonest argument of trying to equate Unionist domination of politics in the Six Counties with the system of election.</P>
    <P>Here there is no inbuilt sectarianism. We are a fairly integrated community. <Col N="1257" /> There are not great divisions of ideology or class.  Were there two broadly-based political Parties here, there could be no question, in our circumstances, of one of these broadly-based political Parties gaining power at every election, unless, of course, that Party was doing its stuff for the electorate and continued to command the allegiance of the electorate.  That is a very difficult thing to do but, short of that, under that system inevitably, in a country in which there are no inbuilt loyalties of ideology or class&mdash;most of us come from the same sort of stock and the same sort of <i>milieu</i>&mdash;you have the ideal community on which to build two national Parties, broadly-based, one in government and the other challenging for government. There would be no inbuilt prejudice in voters.</P>
    <P>If we were the Government and if we were not doing our stuff, the voters would have no difficulty in rejecting us and putting in the other broadly-based national Party because, fundamentally, there is no deep ideological chasm existing and, between these two broadly-based Parties, there would be no deep ideological cleavage and the percentage of the people in the middle, so to speak, would have no difficulty in crossing the bridge and rejecting a Party they considered was not doing its stuff and electing in their place the other broadly-based national Party. That is precisely the way in which politics would develop under this proposed system and that is precisely the way in which they should develop in order to give us a healthy political environment.</P>
    <P>A great many people over the years &mdash;I shall not go into quotations&mdash;who have contributed much to the parliamentary life of this country and who represent different political Parties have thought in exactly the same way as we are thinking now.  I shall not go into what Deputy Dillon said or Mr. Frank MacDermot, writing the other day in the <i>Irish Times</i>; he was a member of this House in the 1930s. Suffice to say that many leaders of Fine Gael are on record as holding the same opinion as that in which Deputy Cosgrave believes now.  I accept that <Col N="1258" /> these statements typify the real beliefs of influential men seeking to achieve the right thing for this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton put down an amendment which deserves mature consideration.  There are arguments for and against.  But, at least, this amendment and any other amendments that any people here may wish to offer should get consideration because we are seeking to evolve here a system of election which will be acceptable to the people and that can yield an effective Government.  The present system has failed on the count of yielding an effective Government.  The present system will continue to lead to dormant and stagnant politics.  It is for that basic reason that I would suggest that we should give very mature consideration in this Assembly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In order to eliminate, in addition, every attempt to introduce the Trojan horse of PR into the democratic structure, let us note that just as the common good is not a simple sum of individual goods, so the common will is not a simple sum of individual wills.

      <P>1942.  Political Parties should reflect the common currents of will that exist in the community and the election system should not be a divisive election system that gives rise to small Parties and that gives rise to stagnant Opposition.  Instead, the election system should represent on as broadly-based and on as national a basis as possible the broad currents of opinion that exist in the community so as to ensure that people can come together within broadly-based national <Col N="1260" /> Parties and hammer out a common programme and, through that broadly-based organisation, achieve government and stay in government for the full statutory period and, as I say, let the people then decide at the elections whether or not they have done a good job.</P>
      <P>I feel that the people will come down to mature consideration of this matter.  There has been much fog thrown around the matter so far by the destructive nature of Opposition speeches.  But, the people will come down to mature consideration of this matter.  The referendum is an educative process and we here in Parliament have a duty to participate in that process and have a duty to avoid any mud-slinging, any destructive criticism, in fact, which clouds the basic issue.</P>
      <P>The basic issue presented to the people is this: Do they want challenging politics that can give effective government or do they want a continuation of the system where men compete against one another in constituencies for the purpose of coming in here solely as representatives and not as people who want to make any contribution to Government?  That is the issue in this.  If you want Dáil Éireann as a debating chamber, if you want it as a version of the Literary and Historical Society in UCD, if you want it as some form of local parish pump committee or council, if that is what you want Dáil Éireann as, fair enough; proportional representation will always give you that.  It will give you representation all right, but if you want challenging government to face up to the problems in the future then you will have a system of election such as the straight vote that not alone performs the secondary function of representation but performs the primary function of effective government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proportional representation puts things the wrong way, puts emphasis on statistical representation, provides people to come in here and have nice debates but frustrates the capacity of these people and the capacity of the Parliament to which they are elected. It frustrates the capacity of the representatives and of Parliament to provide a Government.  We think that in the <Col N="1261" /> world of today and the future the emphasis must be on government and we must have an election system that will yield government, while providing at the same time the necessary modicum of representation that is important.  But government must come first and representation second in our order of priorities.  Proportional representation reverses the order and gives an unnatural order of priorities.</P>
    <P>I feel that the people will come around to this point of view when they emerge from the clouds of Opposition talk, when they get away from the scare headlines and the scare commentators.  When they get down to the guts of this whole problem and the guts of what is involved in this matter, the people will see quite clearly that the right thing to do in 1968 is to vote for the election system that has proved its worth in the great democracies of the world and can prove its worth in Ireland in the future by giving us national and effective government.</P>

      <P>There are very few things I want to say about this question of eliminating proportional representation except what, perhaps, a lot of Deputies have said up to now, that there are more important issues facing the country at the present time and the Government are only trying to consolidate their position by means of the straight vote.</P>
      <P>It should be obvious to everyone that the people gave a decision in 1959 and it is a disgrace that any Government should come into this House after such a short period of time and demand that the people be asked to make a decision again.  There are too many more important issues facing the country.  There are housing problems, health problems, considerable employment problems which could be occupying the attention of Ministers and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, definitely, a case for retention of the present form of PR we have by means of which minorities have direct representation.  There is no doubt about that.  PR prevents artificial parliamentary majorities which exercise a sort of tyranny over minorities for as <Col N="1262" /> long as they are in office.  PR was originally devised as an almost infallible means of averting the tyranny of parliamentary majorities and as a means of securing a Parliament which would reflect with mathematical accuracy the differences as well as the unities in public opinion.  With the majority system, the large Parties would need to widen their policies to appeal to the widest possible electorate and they will be tempted to make promises which they could not or would not fulfil.  With the majority system, there would be very little difference between the policies of the large Parties.  That is one other aspect.</P>
    <P>There is also, of course, the danger under the majority system of the large Party not only staying in office until ripe old age but, perhaps, continuing in office long after they have declined into a state of dotage.</P>
    <P>We might say that the case for the majority system is strongest where we have an electorate manifold in character but not like what we have in Ireland&mdash;a homogeneous community and a uniform pattern of life, which is not at all suited to the majority system.  The Minister for Education has mentioned the great democracies in the world that have adopted the majority system with success, but in every case he mentioned, they are communities which are manifold in character and not homogeneous as is the case in this country.</P>
    <P>At present the Government are a little confused.  First, they are calling for a change in the electoral system for representation in the Dáil.  Next, in reply to a question of mine, they said they had no proposals for altering the electoral system for the election of President in this country.  They are to hold on to proportional representation for the Presidency and are to have it eliminated for election to the Dáil.  They have not given an answer on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that as soon as the public are aware of what is involved, they will definitely go for the change to the majority system.  We all know that the public can be confused. <Col N="1263" /> Sometimes the difficulty besetting the ordinary citizen is that of distinguishing between what is false and what is wrong, what is fact and what is propaganda.  It is vital that it be aired here and that considerable time be given for debate on it so that the people can finally know what is in the best interests of the country and of the people.</P>
    <P>There is a case in point with the majority system that, if we had precisely equal electoral constituencies, under the majority system we could have two Parties in an election campaign, with one holding only 51 per cent and yet securing all the seats.  In theory this could happen.  While, in practice, it is very unlikely, the inference is that a Party can gain power without having the support of the electorate under the majority system.  A Party could actually have under half of the total poll and still not secure a single seat.  This is possible under the majority system.  It is the case of a disparity decidedly to the advantage of the larger Party.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have 18 three-seater constituencies, which is as near to the majority system as to the proportional representation system.  It is by means of this that the Government have remained in office for such a long period.  It has become obvious to them that, if they consolidate this a little more, they will retain office for the lifetime of every member of the present Fianna Fáil Party.  As I say, there are 18 three-seater constituencies, which is almost half.  With the changes brought about by the 1935 Electoral Act, that has been to the advantage of Fianna Fáil. That is why they have remained in office for so long.  There is not much proportionality in the 18 three-seater constituencies.  It is obvious that they looked at this and decided that, if they could consolidate the position a little more, they could remain in office until a ripe old age.</P>
    <P>This matter is being discussed in the cities and country and it should be obvious to Fianna Fáil that the opinion of the public is against changing the <Col N="1264" /> present system.  The people want to know why there is need to consult them again after such a short time.  The Government and Fianna Fáil know this, and Deputy Norton's amendment will serve as a face-saver if they accept it when the public reject wholeheartedly what is in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The question is also being asked whether, if Fianna Fáil are rejected on this issue, they will give a guarantee that it will not be brought before the Dáil for the next 20 or 30 years.  You cannot keep consulting people on an issue.  Remember, 75 per cent of the electorate voted against it.  The same 75 per cent of the present electorate were against it, because only about 25 per cent have been added on.  That is sufficient reason for not bringing it before the public again after such a short period.</P>
    <P>In Britain it was shown how a Party with a minority of votes in the country continued to be privileged over a long period with a decisive majority in Parliament.  It also showed how the majority system paid the leading Party an enormous premium in parliamentary seats.  There is no question of Fianna Fáil saying that it is giving a chance to other Parties to take over.  Perhaps it might in the next 50 or 60 years, but not in the lifetime of the present Parties.  There is no hope whatsoever of this happening.  It is an effort by the Government to consolidate their position and to see there is no attempt, as they know is taking place at the moment, to consolidate the Labour Party with the support of the unions and so offer a strong alternative to them.  They want to nip this upsurge of the people's enthusiasm for the Labour Party in the bud.  I must give them credit for seeing the writing on the wall.  If the Labour Party with the support of the unions and the working-class people&mdash;who know that only the Labour Party can give them the support and social justice they need &mdash;can consolidate their position, the Government realise that unless they nip this in the bud they will have no hope of fighting off the resurgent strength of the Labour Party in a few short years to come.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When the debate was adjourned yesterday evening, I was explaining to the House that the object of the introduction of this Bill by the Fine Gael Party was simply and solely to transfer the hearing of town planning appeals from the Minister for Local Government to a judicial tribunal proposed in the Bill.  I fully appreciate that only a small percentage of planning applications come to the Minister by way of appeal.  The Minister says some seven per cent; he has figures and I do not quarrel with them.</P>
      <P>I was saying, and I now repeat, that it is absolutely essential that these appeals should be adjudicated upon fairly and openly, and in a manner which will not give grounds for suspicion, distrust, or worse.  I was making the case that the Fine Gael Party consider that their introduction of this Bill is justified on the grounds of public uneasiness, suspicion and distrust of the present system, on the grounds that there is public demand for a change over from the hearing of appeals by the Minister to a judicial tribunal such as we suggest.  I was saying that that public demand was evidenced by the reaction of the unfettered national newspapers to the present system, and by the fact that RTE thought it their duty to focus public attention on the abuses in the present system.</P>
      <P>Finally, I made the case that the Association of Municipal Authorities, which is a national association representative of corporations, urban councils and town commissions, unanimously passed a resolution at its annual conference in Tralee last year demanding that the present system of hearing of appeals be abolished and that appeals be heard instead by a judicial tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought they suggested there should be no appeal but that it should be made a reserved function of the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is something else.  I am talking about the resolution in Tralee last year.  They passed a resolution advocating that the present system should be abolished and that appeals should be heard instead by a judicial tribunal.</P>
      <P>Yesterday evening the Parliamentary Secretary, obviously worried that a national organisation vitally interested in planning and planning appeals should pass such a resolution, sought to explain away the resolution by saying that it appeared on the agenda towards the end of the conference and was merely passed in order that it might be possible to take up the matter with the Minister.  In view of that statement by the Parliamentary Secretary, I find it necessary to put on the records of this House what actually happens at a conference of the Association of Municipal Authorities, what it consists of, what the composition of the Association is, and how it transacts its business.</P>
      <P>The Association of Municipal Authorities consists of two representatives of Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, Galway Corporation, Limerick Corporation, Wexford Corporation, Waterford Corporation, Clonmel Corporation and, so far as I know, every other corporation in the country and every urban council and town commission, with some few exceptions&mdash;in order that the record may be right.  It has been in existence since before the foundation of the State.  Some people boast of the fact that they attended a conference in Derry before the country was partitioned.  The Association meets once a year.  An agenda for the conference is sent out by its very efficient secretary about a fortnight in advance of the conference.  The agenda contains a list of resolutions which will be proposed and discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the House that these resolutions are dealt with in three ways. <Col N="1267" /> Some are passed; some are rejected; and some are referred to the National Executive of the organisation to be dealt with throughout the year.  The resolution to which I refer&mdash;and it is on the records of the House already&mdash; which proposed that planning appeals should be transferred from the Minister to a judicial tribunal, appeared on the agenda which was circulated to each delegate approximately a fortnight before the conference.  It was proposed in my hearing&mdash;not by me.  I did not speak to it.  I believe the man who proposed it was an independent councillor.  It was seconded and passed unanimously.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for me to put on the records of the House the names of some of the delegates who were present at that conference.  I want to put on that record the names of some such well-known custodians of Fianna Fáil policy and the Fianna Fáil conscience as Deputy P.J. Burke from Dublin County, Senator P. Fitzsimons from Navan, Senator J. Farrell from Dundalk, Senator Browne&mdash;who by a coincidence has just entered the lobby &mdash;and Senator J. Brennan from Castle-blayney.  All those Members of the Oireachtas are members of the Association of Municipal Authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> They all got the agenda.  Senator McGlinchey is also a delegate.  A number of those I mentioned are vice-presidents.  I was present when the resolution was proposed.  Although sometimes Fine Gael are accused of not doing their homework and not looking after their business, I was present when the resolution was proposed and Senator J. Farrell from Dundalk was present.  I did not speak. Senator Farrell went to the microphone &mdash;I want to be absolutely fair&mdash;and the only criticism he made about the resolution was that he thought it might lead to expense.  He did not propose a negative and he did not vote against it.  It was passed unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not afraid to stand over every word I have said in connection with <Col N="1268" /> that transaction.  I am blessed with a fairly good memory.  Therefore it cannot be said that there was not a demand for this Bill from the national newspapers, the national television station, and the Association of Municipal Authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is a pity the Parliamentary Secretary did not listen to me when I was speaking before or that he did not read the report of the debate because I am making the same case now.</P>
      <P>We have reached the concluding stages of this debate that has gone on for 14 days since 31st January last. It is my duty, in concluding, to summarise and to try to analyse the case that has been made for and against this Bill.</P>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party have proposed that appeals be heard by a judicial tribunal because we think it is necessary.  As far as I can summarise the case that has been made in favour of the proposal, I think I could truthfully say that the case was based, in the first place, on the grounds that there is public uneasiness, public disquiet, public distrust and suspicion in the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, in speaking on this Bill, has said that Fine Gael introduced it in order to refer to specific cases and to ventilate them.  I make no apology at this stage for referring to specific cases.  It is necessary to refer to specific cases in order to demonstrate to the House <Col N="1269" /> that public uneasiness, disquiet, distrust and suspicion exist and that it is well-founded.  For that reason, and for that reason alone, I propose to refer to a number of cases that have already been referred to.</P>
    <P>The Mount Pleasant Square case is one in which Dublin Corporation, on a number of occasions, refused planning permission because the city plan provided that this should be a public park. That decision was appealed against on a number of occasions to the Minister for Local Government and he upheld Dublin Corporation.  On two separate occasions, I understand that Dublin Corporation refused planning permission and on two separate occasions the applicant appealed and on each occasion the Minister for Local Government affirmed Dublin Corporation. But, then, another gentleman got an option on this place for something like £8,000 and applied for planning permission and was refused.  He appealed to the Minister for Local Government and, for some reason or another, the Minister changed his views about it and granted planning permission.  As a result of having got planning permission, the appellant&mdash;who, I understand, is an active member of the Fianna Fáil Party and supplied three cars in the Cork by-election&mdash;sold his rights to a petrol company, making a profit of a number of tens of thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>That is one of the cases that has created public uneasiness, disquiet, distrust and suspicion.  That case is not over yet because, as recently as last night, Dublin Corporation, in the exercise of its rights under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 1963, decided to alter the decision of the Minister for Local Government. Only eight Fianna Fáil Members of Dublin Corporation could be got to stand over the decision of the Minister. Not an Independent, not a member of the Labour Party, not a member of the Ratepayers' Association could be got to go into the lobby of Dublin Corporation and stand over the decision of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

I was explaining that when Deputy L'Estrange mentioned this case during the debate, it drove the Minister for Local Government into a white fury and the Minister by way of interruption said Deputy L'Estrange seemed to forget that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had the right to intervene and he promised intervention by that Minister and said: woe betide Deputy L'Estrange and Fine Gael when the Minister for Agriculture intervened.

In my opinion, when we have come to a stage here when obtaining planning permission is becoming a matter of contract between lay individuals and when breach of contract arising out of a promise to get planning permission for valuable consideration of £3,000 ends up in the highest court in the land, we have reached a sorry plight, an all-time low level.  In the light of that, one would think that whether the action was justified or not, the Minister for Local Government would be only too pleased to come here and say: &ldquo;Whatever doubts I had about this beforehand, this case which I have sent to the Attorney General puts the matter beyond doubt.  You were right.  I agree with you.&rdquo;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The next case I shall mention which was discussed here is the case of a housing site at Kilbarrack which had been scheduled for local authority housing.  A man named Gallagher bought it and appealed to the Minister for Local Government under the Planning Act to lift the order&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;which scheduled this for local authority housing, and despite <Col N="1277" /> the wishes of Dublin Corporation, it was released.  As a result Mr. Gallagher built 700 or 800 houses on it and offered them back to Dublin Corporation at a considerable profit.</P>
      <P>Public men have distasteful things to do at times.  I am mentioning these cases to prove to the country and the House that the public mentality on this Planning Act and planning appeals system is well founded.  Deputy Cluskey of the Labour Party came in here and made the accusation that I am now repeating about this Kilbarrack business, and he mentioned the name of Deputy Gallagher of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy Gallagher came in a couple of days afterwards and I must say in the shortest few words that I have ever heard dissociated himself from the transaction.  He said that he was a member of the company concerned, but he understood that it was the Gallagher Group who had offered houses to Dublin Corporation.  Let us stop shadow-boxing and let us be realistic.  Does the world and his wife not know that the proprietor of the Gallagher Group is another Mr. Gallagher, a brother of Deputy Gallagher, who was an unsuccessful Fianna Fáil candidate at the last Seanad election?  That is the sort of thing that gives rise to disquiet.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think five members of the Cabinet are now lawyers, and the old tradition of Fianna Fáil of slagging the lawyers has not been abandoned by the old fellows yet.  This planning appeal case I want to talk about is in connection with a man called Mr. Brady who bought the old GNR or GSR railway station in Cavan; I am not sure which station it was, because the two of them interlink a bit.  Anyway he bought one of them from the county council and he was told by the county manager when he was selling it to him for £6,000 that he, the county manager, would not give him permission to run a cattle mart there.  But Mr. Brady went ahead and bought it, and in or about the same time a man called Mr. O'Reilly bought another bit of land outside the town with the idea of starting a cattle mart. Let us be clear about it.  Mr. Brady was a well-known Fianna Fáil supporter, and Mr. O'Reilly was an equally well-known Fine Gael supporter.  Mr. Brady applied to Cavan Urban District Council for planning permission because he was in the urban area.  Mr. O'Reilly applied to Cavan County Council for planning permission because he was in the county council area.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Wait till you hear this, because it is good.  On 13th July, 1966, the county manager refused the application of Mr. Brady and granted the application of Mr. O'Reilly.  An appeal was brought in each case.  Bear in mind that Mr. Brady had bought the place in the knowledge that the county manager was not going to give him permission to start a cattle mart.  On 17th October, 1966, Mr. Brady was informed that his outline permission was granted and that he could get on with the work.  Poor Mr. O'Reilly was informed some time later that the oral hearing of his appeal and the objection to his case would be heard in the Courthouse, Cavan, on 5th December, 1966, nearly two months later.  Of course, in the meantime Mr. Brady had his cattle mart practically built and the decision in Mr. O'Reilly's case would not have come for a couple of months.  Mr. Brady would be in business and Mr. O'Reilly would be washed out.  Those are the facts and I leave the House to judge.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As a matter of justice, decency and common sense, if the two decisions were given in Cavan on 17th July, 1966, the decisions on the appeals should have been given on the same day also.  Is it not patently obvious what happened, that Mr. Brady, the Fianna Fáil man, was slipped and that Mr. O'Reilly the Fine Gael man, was hung up, so to speak, so that the other fellow could get on with his business.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have given the facts in that case, and I think what I have said to date justifies, without a doubt, the uneasiness, disquiet, distrust and suspicion which exist in the public mind about this system of planning appeals.</P>
      <P>The next ground in favour of our case was that there was a public demand for it.  I do not think I need waste any time developing that case, because we have had an outcry in the national newspapers, the <i>Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Telefís Éireann, all condemning the present system, all spotlighting cases that it is hard to understand, all spotlighting cases of apparent injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next argument we have put up in favour of our case is that we think that a tribunal should decide planning appeals, a tribunal consisting of a judicial officer and two assessors. Fianna Fáil speakers have gone to considerable lengths to downgrade the qualities of a judge to hear these appeals.  I say that a judge is well qualified to hear these appeals, as well qualified as he is to hear every other kind of technical case that he hears and determines every day of the week.  Here he is to have the assistance of two technical assessors, two experts in town planning, sitting on either side of him, one, the representative of the Minister and the other, <Col N="1281" /> appointed by the Appointments Commission.  Surely all the judge has to do then is to hear the evidence, consult his assessors and give a decision?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We can all be wrong unless we are the Minister for Local Government or unless we are inspired by Deputy Geoghegan, who is infallible.  The judges have given absolute satisfaction down through the years.  They have never been criticised and never gave ground for criticism.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been slighting lawyers in this House on this Bill since the 31st of January last.  They are continuing the tradition set by some of their illustrious predecessors.  Have they forgotten that the newly-appointed Minister for Education is a lawyer, or that the Minister and aspirant to the position of Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is a lawyer, and that the Minister for Justice is a lawyer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Here you have an array of lawyers on the Front Bench but the tribunal I suggested should be set up has precedent to recommend it, has precedent to defend it and precedent to support it, because the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission are lawyers, whether they are appointed by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  Some may never have had much experience in land but they give fair decisions.  One of the characteristics of lawyers is that once appointed to a judicial position, whether they are appointed by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, they behave as judicial persons and are not influenced by political pressure one way or another.  The Minister for Lands does not decide what lands are to be taken over; his Lay Commissioners do, and they have given absolute satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very important statutory quasi-judicial officer, the arbitrator who assesses compensation for <Col N="1282" /> lands which have been acquired under the Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Act.  He is not a lawyer; he is an engineer, but he is independent and he sits on these cases and decides how much compensation will be paid.  His decisions are never questioned but are accepted as fair and reasonable.  There is no public disquiet about him, notwithstanding the fact that he has been operating for the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>You also have the Special Commissioners of income tax, a number of whom are lawyers and some of whom are not, but they are all independent and discharge their duties fairly and give satisfaction.  I wonder if Fianna Fáil Deputies have forgotten the arbitrator they appointed to adjudicate on applications for pensions under the Army Pensions Acts?  Judge Sheehy acted and some other judges acted, but they went around the country in an informal way, heard these cases and decided who was entitled to receive compensation and who was not.  They gave absolute satisfaction.  There was no barrister or lawyer appearing before them.  The thing was informal and inexpensive and gave every satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that one of the proudest boasts of the legal profession is that when judges are appointed, no matter who appoints them and no matter what their political affiliations were before they were appointed, they act fearlessly and impartially and honour absolutely the oath they take on their appointment.  I have no fears in handing over to a judicial officer, whether he be a Circuit Court judge, a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge, the duties of determining appeals under this Act.  However, I am not tied to a judge.  I want somebody appointed who will have the independence of a judge, who will hold office on the terms of a judge, somebody who is not subject to political pressure, whether from Fianna Fáil cumainn, a Fianna Fáil TD or a Fianna Fáil subscriber.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make in favour of transferring these duties from the Minister for Local Government to a quasi-judicial tribunal is that I consider the present holder of <Col N="1283" /> the office of Minister for Local Government temperamentally, politically and traditionally quite unsuited to adjudicate in a fair, unprejudiced and unbiased manner.  We heard him speaking on this Bill for seven hours &mdash;I will return to that again&mdash;and anybody would have to come to the conclusion that he is a most politically-minded man and by that I mean Party politically-minded.  He acts as director of elections in practically every by-election and in that way he must get to know many political people in many towns, whether they are supporters of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or any other Party.  How could that man be expected to go back to these towns in which he presided as director of elections and adjudicate impartially on a planning appeal between some known friend of his and perhaps some known enemy?</P>
    <P>It is asking much too much.  It is something that could not be expected of anybody.  The man who is deciding these appeals should be well qualified to determine, a man well paid for determining, a man with no other obligations and no other commitments, a man who is not dependent on public popularity to keep him in public life, a man who is independent and who, when he signs his name to an appeal, does so in the sure knowledge that whether it pleases anybody or displeases anybody, he has done his best, and having done his best, his conscience is clear and he is not afraid that it will cost him or his Party either money or votes in the next general election.</P>
    <P>That is the appeal I am making to this House and to the country.  I am not discussing the Minister personally. I do not know him socially&mdash;perhaps he would not wish to know me&mdash;but I do say from observing him in this House that he is charged, electrified with political emotion.  He thinks politically; he acts politically; and, as Deputy L'Estrange says, he speaks politically.  I do not blame him for that, but it is asking much too much of human nature to expect him to be an impartial judge in matters of this sort.  That is the case Fine Gael have made for introducing this Bill.  These <Col N="1284" /> are the grounds upon which I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>It is my duty now to consider briefly the case the Government have made against the Bill.  It is their duty to make such a case if they consider the Bill a bad Bill or one which does not deserve the support of the House.  We had two Ministerial interventions in the debate.  The first came on 31st January when the Minister for Health, Deputy Flanagan, intervened.  He paid a number of compliments to me as, indeed, did the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy P. Brennan.  At column 101 of volume 232 of the Official Report the Minister for Health said:</P>
    <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests a simple procedure it is a praise-worthy sentiment.  I agree with many of the things he said with regard to the present appeals system.  He cites the case of the objector who has no right of audience.  That is something that should be remedied.  In general, most of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick seemed to me to be well thought out and worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>That was what the Minister for Health had to say and, in the light of that, it was hard to follow the next Ministerial intervention which came from the Minister for Local Government.  It took him seven hours to make his speech.  I heard a great part of it but, over the last two days, I read it tediously and painfully and I have no hesitation in saying that no speech made on either side of this House justified this Bill more than did the speech of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>We believe that the appeal system is wrong and that it should be taken away from the Minister for Local Government and given to an appeals tribunal. The Minister for Local Government spent at least half of his seven hour speech making oily innuendoes against a former Minister for Local Government, Deputy P. O'Donnell.  Although, in a roundabout way, he suggested he was not making charges, it was obvious that he was making charges and accusing Deputy O'Donnell of having made wrong decisions or made decisions for the wrong motives.  Surely, if the Minister <Col N="1285" /> for Local Government thinks that, that is justification for this Bill?  Surely, if he thinks that he himself is an archangel, notwithstanding Kilbarrack and notwithstanding Mount Pleasant Square, the charges he made against a former Minister for Local Government are more than justification for accepting the proposals we have put before the House.</P>
    <P>I sifted the speech made by the Minister for Local Government in the hope that I could find something into which to put my teeth, something to grasp. This was the theme of his entire speech: Deputy O'Donnell was a ruffian and he, the Minister for Local Government, was infallible, two extraordinary assertions but two assertions which, in my opinion, completely justify this Bill.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Fianna Fáil contributions, apart from that of the Parliamentary Secretary, who dealt with a few technical matters, were a little odd, to say the least of it.  Deputy Molloy said he was dealing with planning appeals at the rate of half a dozen a week and he was the best fitted to deal with them.  He wanted to hold on to his power.  Deputy Lemass said he was consulted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In my opinion, the case made against this Bill simply does not exist.  In fact, no case has been made against it.  The Minister, towards the end of his speech, conceded that he was considering changing the system; he thought the system needed change.  That was his opinion after spending seven hours ballyragging and abusing and threatening that he would expose people in one way or another in defence of the present system.  At the end he says he will change the whole thing.  When will he change it?  What does he find wrong with the system we propose?  Does he see anything wrong with two town planning assessors?  If he finds something wrong with them, does he think a judge an unreliable or unsuitable person?  If he does, why does he not let the Bill go to Committee and put down an amendment that we have a statutory officer similar to the arbitrator under the land legislation, or something like that?</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is the Minister is very annoyed because the Bill has been introduced and has been taken so much notice of by the mass media in the country, and that its enactment would remedy an unsavoury state of affairs prevailing in the Custom House under the chairmanship of the Minister for Local Government at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have dealt with that at some considerable length.  I want to recommend this Bill to the House on the ground that it will restore public confidence in the planning system, that it will <Col N="1287" /> meet a public demand and that it will ensure that justice in town planning is not only done but will be seen to be done.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, before I sit down, I feel compelled to refer to statements made by Deputy Corry, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, concerning me, during this debate.  I concede that on the sitting of the House before 20th February, I did endorse a statement made by another Deputy, a factual statement, which suggested that Deputy Corry's father pursued a certain vocation or profession in life.  On reflection, I say that it would have been better if I had ignored the statement.  But, on 20th February, 1958, Deputy Corry came into the House and, as I say, with the full and vocal approval of the Minister for Local Government, made a disgraceful, insulting attack on me personally and on my parents whom I hold in the highest esteem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had considered ignoring these charges as having come from an irresponsible Deputy, but seeing that the records of the House have been blotted and disfigured with this vile accusation concerning me and my parents, I want to put on the records of the House, with your permission, Sir&mdash;I think I am entitled to do so&mdash; that my father, John Fitzpatrick, was born in the townland of Aughnahola in the county of Monaghan where his father farmed a not very big farm, a farm that had been in the family since approximately 1820 and, thank God, is still in the family.  My father was one of a family of 13.  Two of his brothers served the Church in the diocese of Clogher and one of them was a doctor in the county of Offaly.  Three of <Col N="1288" /> them were farmers.  One of them, the eldest boy in the family, having attended a Latin school, held a high position in the Land Commission as far back as before the beginning of this century.  One of my father's sisters married a man called John Dolan in Manorhamilton in the county of Leitrim and her son was Charlie Dolan who represented Leitrim in the British House of Commons and who was one of the first members of the Irish Parliamentary Party to resign his seat in the House of Commons and contest it as a Sinn Féin representative.  He was defeated.  His brother, James Nicholas Dolan, went forward, I believe, in 1918 and was elected as a representative for Leitrim and served as a Deputy of this House and as the late Mr. William T. Cosgrave's Parliamentary Secretary for a number of years in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have to go on in this tone but it is necessary.  My father was one of the first Sinn Féin members of Monaghan County Council.  He died many years ago, when I was a boy of four.  I am pleased and proud to be able to say that the people of Monaghan, just as they had confidence in my late father, had equal confidence in my brother whom they have returned as a representative from the Clones area of Monaghan on Monaghan County Council for the past 17 years and he now presides over Monaghan County Council as chairman of that body.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more, Sir.  I felt very strongly that I should put on the records of the House those facts out of the regard that I have and always have had for my parents and my people.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in view of the widespread unemployment and consequent hardship caused by the merger of minor employment and bog development schemes with rural improvement schemes, the reduction of the total vote in respect thereof by approximately one-half, and the absence of any or any adequate plan or scheme to absorb those who have lost employment, Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government to restore the said schemes in their original form and <Col N="1291" /> the amount of money needed to implement them.</P>
    <P>This motion is being discussed long after the decision was taken to merge these two well-known rural schemes, the minor employment and bog development schemes and the rural improvement schemes.  The operation of those schemes is well known to Deputies on all sides of the House, particularly those who represent rural areas and areas where there are a great number of by-roads, bog roads, accommodation roads and drains, none of which comes within the category of major allocations for this particular kind of work.</P>
    <P>I recall being at an interview with several other Deputies from the west of Ireland, the north and the south, in the company of people who were employed on those schemes as supervisors and gangers.  To those men this merging meant very real problems.  It meant the cessation of employment which they had, admittedly over a limited portion of the year.  Nevertheless, it was employment for them of a highly remunerative character and it was extremely necessary to meet the calls made upon the average small householder at that time of the year. We had this interview with the Parliamentary Secretary at the time, Deputy Gibbons.  The whole business has since been transferred to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>It was said during the course of that interview that the earnings of those men and the men who worked under them, were needed to buy Christmas commodities and also helped towards paying the rates at that time.  The rates question is not valid now because of the reduction in or in some cases the wiping out of rates on agricultural land.  That was a small matter because the rates on buildings are still there. Anyone who builds a new house or makes an addition or instals a bathroom still has to pay relatively high rates in areas such as these, rates indeed which it is doubtful that they will have the capacity to bear for very much longer unless there is some kind of plan or scheme to implement the half of these works that has gone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> A very essential difference between the two schemes was that the minor employment and bog development schemes generally did not carry any burden of local subscription.  They were completely free, as the saying goes, and the money was granted in full to do a particular job.  Rural improvement schemes, on the other hand, were subject at various times to a subscription of five per cent, ten per cent or possibly higher, but there was always a certain amount of tolerance, if I may use that word in this regard, as to what the percentage would be.  Nevertheless, it meant there was a subscription.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was a tolerance beyond that in some cases. That showed that the people administering the fund were trying to administer it as fairly as possible, and they gave the best possible value to the people who lived in the area.  When these were merged, it meant a reduction of half the works and that meant a reduction of half of the spending money available.  Of course only half, or possibly a little more than half, of the required works would be done in any given period.  That meant unemployment for some and it meant a loss of earnings.  It also meant a further deferring of much needed amenities by way of improvements of roads and drainage of drains so necessary in those areas.</P>
      <P>What prompted the Government to do this I do not know.  We will probably be told it was designed to bring about some streamlining or to make for greater efficiency, but anything that reduces spending in areas such as these and causes unemployment should not be tolerated, and certainly would not be tolerated for long by the people in those areas, and should not be embarked upon by any Government, however valid it might appear, in the name of efficiency and economy.</P>

      <Col N="1293" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

      <P>We must realise that Britain is geared to the straight vote and that to introduce anything else into the British electoral system, even proportional representation, would create confusion.  By seeking to introduce the straight vote system into this country, the Government are obviously endeavouring to create political confusion.  The Taoiseach has given no sound reasons for the necessity for this change.  He cannot point to instability of government. He cannot show that proportional representation has held up any important legislation.  When the Government wanted to introduce what they considered important legislation, the turnover tax, they found the means to do it.  If they could do that with a majority of one, then one might well contemplate with fear what they could do with a substantial majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise that proportional representation was introduced in the 20th century.  John Stuart Mill was an <Col N="1294" /> advocate and exponent of proportional representation.  I have here a copy of his book <i>Representative Government.</i> He made the point that, in a really equal democracy, every and any section would be represented proportionally. He said the majority of electors would always have a majority of representatives and a minority of the electors would always have a minority of the representatives.  He said that, man for man, they would be as fully represented as the majority and, unless they are, there is not equal government but a government of inequality and privilege where one part of the people rule over the rest.  He pointed out that in such circumstances, there is a part of the people whose fair and equal share of the things in the representation is withheld from them, contrary to all just government but, above all, contrary to the principle of democracy which professes equality as the very root of its foundation.</P>
    <P>Continuing, he said that the injustices of the violation of principle are not less flagrant because those who suffer from them are a minority.  In advocating proportional representation, John Stuart Mill felt that, without it, any government would ride roughshod over liberty-loving people.  The evidence is there.</P>
    <P>We have had a modification of proportional representation.  If the Government say that, in essence, proportional representation is not good they cannot doubt that a modified form of proportional representation can assure the Government of majority government.  There can be no question but that there can be a parliamentary majority for a government with this modified form of proportional representation.  Having been in office for so long, Fianna Fáil cannot say that proportional representation has produced unstable government.  People are suspicious that the Party which has benefited most by this modified form of proportional representation want to change it in favour of this complete majority system in order to consolidate their position.  There can be no other motive behind the present proposal to change our electoral system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said we do not want <Col N="1295" /> a multiplicity of Parties and a series of coalition governments.  If that had been said 20 years ago, the situation would be different but there is no question of a series of coalition governments today nor is there any question of a multiplicity of Parties at the present time.  Our modified form of proportional representation is already very heavily loaded against the smallest Party in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach points to the success of the straight vote system in the United States, which is a very unfair comparison.  The United States is a very large community and is far from being homogeneous racially, culturally, socially or economically.  Therefore, it is admirably suited to the straight vote system.  Our people, however, have been moulded by history into a unified pattern of life which is ideally suited to the proportional representation system.  The altered form of proportional representation which we have is really extraneous to the country and its homogeneous nature.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this Bill provides more definite guidelines, that the bar of resort to the courts has been removed and that the Dáil may amend the Commission's report by a simple majority.  The Taoiseach must have a very poor opinion of the mentality of the Members of this House.  This means a simple Fianna Fáil majority. He says &ldquo;a simple majority of the Dáil&rdquo;.  Under the straight vote system, the simple majority will be Fianna Fáil majority&mdash;and it will be used.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach speaks in vague generalities of the reasons proportional representation has not worked. He says people become confused with the number of names on the ballot paper.  Nowadays, with the mass media educating the public, I do not think this arises.  The public are becoming more and more informed. The Government want to step in now to prevent the expression of individual thought and to get the majority before the public become sufficiently informed to make up their minds on what they want.  That seems to be the only conclusion any sensible person <Col N="1296" /> can reach, that it is an effort by them to seek dictatorial powers before the people can decide for themselves.</P>
    <P>They realise that nowadays people are giving a lot of thought to politics and the nature of governments: people want more and are exercising their rights to a greater extent.  The Government realise this and see what one might describe as the writing on the wall and want to do something to consolidate their position.  No other motive can be ascribed to their present proposals. The people are not enthusiastic about any change.  They are very definite in their decision to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in this referendum.  I think it will be quite a set-back for the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party when they realise that once again the people will say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We should like to be assured by the Government that this proposal will not be brought before the Dáil again for at least another 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come for a realistic assessment of what is behind the two Bills now before the House, widely divergent in their constitutional conception but designed to serve the same purpose as Fianna Fáil have in mind.  We must first ask ourselves who sought this constitutional change.  From where did the clamour come?  What is the ultimate hope behind it?  When Fianna Fáil suggest that they are doing something for the benefit of Fine Gael, it gives me the pip because I know their mentality always runs in the direction of what is good for themselves and nobody else. When you come to grips with the question of who wanted the change, you find no section of the community made any demand for it, and when the referendum ultimately goes to the people, Fianna Fáil will get a very salutory indication of that in the defeat they will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to nail some stupid statements and deal with the kind of vague, malicious, semi-nationalistic aura that Fianna Fáil have tried to create around their present catastrophic stupidity.  We are told that this was a system imposed by the British, and the fugitive Minister for External Affairs, of course, had to revert to the Civil War period to make <Col N="1297" /> a completely irrelevant, unjustifiable and unsustainable statement.  Whether we like it or not, PR was the conception of Griffith and other Sinn Féin leader.  As Deputy O'Connell said it worked here remarkably well over the years.  It was not imposed on us by the British but it was brought into the Constitution and copperfastened into it by the man who lead the opposition to the Treaty.  The sooner the Tánaiste assesses the facts and looks at the reality of the situation the better for himself.</P>
    <P>When one realises how right we have been proved and that we had the courage to accept, to build and develop on the Treaty, we contest the sincerity of the Fianna Fáil approach. The clamour for the change comes from a little power-drunk group in the Fianna Fáil Party who think they can now set semi-dynastic proportions to their control and it is because the cold breath and whisper of defeat is around the corner that we get this sudden embullient anxiety to get rid of a system that has properly been described as indigenous to us.  It is because the Irish people, becoming adult and experienced in politics, are beginning to see the real value of PR and use it effectively that the Government are getting the tremors and delirium from which they are suffering.</P>
    <P>What is behind the clamour for change?  One of the avowed aims of the Government is to eliminate and virtually annihilate the Labour Party.  I want to go on record here as deliberately and positively describing that as a dastardly bit of political chicanery because, whether I go the whole of the road with the Labour Party or not, it is time the House realised that the establishment of the House and all the principles of democracy on which we build our Parliament and Government owe much to the courage and effort of the Labour Party.  It would be a shocking thing for the country if a group of power-lusting young men were to get their way and eliminate from our political life the type of contribution that has been helpful and effective throughout the years.</P>
    <P>They will not get rid of Fine Gael&mdash; they have been trying to do that in <Col N="1298" /> every possible way since the establishment of the State&mdash;but, thank God, we are a healthy, robust Party still, giving Fianna Fáil the fright of their lives now because young people are flocking to where tradition and service are appreciated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And you should ask Deputy de Valera what he thinks and he bears an ancient and honoured name on the crest of your organisation.  To me who has experienced what freak results can be got under PR, it still presents the only reasonable way of getting a representative parliament and a representative government.  Nobody can query my experience, because my experience was that somebody who got nearly 2,000 votes fewer than I did succeeded in getting my seat on one occasion.  He is now eliminated from public life, but just because I might have been the victim does not alter the fact that we have to take this objectively and see what is the nature of our country's body politic and what is the system that is likely to give us effective representation and ultimately government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this country a very definite type of outlook that revolves in <Col N="1299" /> the main around agriculture in the rural and semi-rural areas and to a certain extent around industrialisation in the big centres.  We have a good deal of vocationalism running through our whole economic and social background. We have of necessity a variety of organisations that are entitled to a voice and representation in proportion to their importance within the Assembly here. If the Government were to get away with this gimmick of the straight vote, their design and purpose, in spite of the platitudinous boasts of the Minister for Education today about a new type of democracy, would be one thing only, to use the new system to create confusion and to create a situation in which they will be able to grab a dictatorial majority here and use that majority to design the type of voting and parliamentary control that would suit themselves.  There is no other purpose behind this.  The Government Party feel that if they could get away with it&mdash; after a long period in Government getting an effective majority and showing the arrogance that they are already starting to display again&mdash;they would be able virtually to use intimidation for the purpose of stultifying political development, methods not unknown to them in the past.</P>
    <P>One must look very carefully into the background of this organisation. Even though the Minister for Education frankly admits that power is their aim and power is their game, we in this country will have to come to grips once and for all with this domineering arrogance that gives them the right, according to themselves, to govern for all time.  This is political chicanery at its best, and no matter how they try to sugar-coat the pill, we refuse to swallow it.  The issue is clearly knit, whether we are going to accept a change of system that must in the immediate future lead to a tremendous majority and the capacity to use their power effectively to repel for at least a generation any development other than sycophancy to a Government.</P>
    <P>What has gone wrong all of a sudden with PR that the Government want to change it?  Out of the 40-odd <Col N="1300" /> years of home government, and in particular from 1932 to now, Fianna Fáil have had a monopoly of government and the country a succession of economic crises.  We have this political gambit at a time when the nation has many problems and great stress to face up to.  We are in a situation where we have to gear our whole economy to new types of competition.  We are in a situation where we have difficulty in industrial relations at home.  We are on the brink of a national crisis, with blackouts and shutdowns threatening a vital national State-sponsored organisation.  In such a situation the time of this House and the consideration of the people are directed to what I call gimmickry.  This is merely a red herring to cover up the many debacles for which the Government have been responsible and to divert the minds of the people from the economic difficulties that abound around us, whether in agriculture or industry, whether it is rising unemployment and the difficulties arising from various redundancies and the switching of personnel to new types of industry.</P>
    <P>These are all matters of immense consequence that are being pushed aside and not being dealt with while the Government take it upon themselves to try and change the system of voting for no more elevated purpose that their own aggrandisement and the increase of their own power.  They are not going to get away with it.  Let us again ask why we have suddenly to get rid of PR.  As I said, over the past 36 or 37 years Fianna Fáil have had more than 26 years of government. At present they enjoy a supreme majority.  Remember, if Fianna Fáil believe that the will of the people must prevail, under the PR system if you get enough votes you must prevail, but because Fianna Fáil know that there is no prospect of a majority vote under PR in the future, they are making this desperate bid to get through the direct vote for the purpose of trying to manipulate on a 35 or 40 per cent vote, the greatest possible number of seats for themselves.  You may talk about commissions or anything else being set up but if Fianna Fáil got away with this <Col N="1301" /> effort to gerrymander, they would be capable of it and they would leave the North of Ireland trotting after them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not worry; we all know what you would do.  It has been done before very effectively. Added to that, in case they would not be able to manipulate well enough in some of the more populous areas where their bluff would be called, they want another amendment to the Constitution to give a tolerance that would create a situation in which two votes west would be equal to three votes east.  It is no use wagging your head; that is what the Bill proposes to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If we add the two, we get a very simple result.  You think that where you have introduced mendicity and grants for unfortunate people, you will be able to cow them and bend them to your will.  The Fianna Fáil methods are well known to us all.  Fianna Fáil are a full time political organisation and a tough, ruthless one.  The Minister for Education indicated quite clearly today that power is their object, that they want power and they want to hold on to power.  That is the sole motive activating the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not power for the benefit of the nation but for the aggrandisement and development of their own Party, with all the consequential and attendant difficulties.  Their capacity for patronage and bestowing largesse, they feel, will ensure, if not a loyal support, a support of necessity from vast sections of the community.  There is no doubt that any major contract, any big escalation in building or in any other industry for some strange reason always arrives on the table of the supporter, whether he is a member of Taca or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of system which can subvert and stultify democracy, the type of system which it is our duty to prevent continuing.  That is why there <Col N="1302" /> is going to be such a vigorous and sustained fight against this proposal. If we can, we will not allow this Government to try to differentiate in an advantageous way to themselves between the votes of one section and another.  We are going to stop if we can this philosophy of divide and conquer which you are trying to impose with the straight vote: we will exercise the tolerance where it is in our favour and we will use the upper limit in the populous areas to defeat whatever large majority may tend to show its head.  That is the proposal.</P>
    <P>Cutting out all the verbiage, this is what it amounts to: we want to get control of Parliament and we are going to do it if we get away with the straight vote and the assistance of this tolerance suggestion.  That is the blunt reality of the avid power-lust that is now apparent in the new minions of the Fianna Fáil Party who want to ensure that in their time they will grab hold of whatever position they can. They feel that if they can get the people away from their now adult concept of the use of PR, they will be able to do extraordinary things in the ballot box in the next election.  We have to come down to the interests of minorities of the people.  No matter what words are used there are definite sections in the community who have representation and, even though they may be small, they can be vociferous and effective.  I am warning those people that the intention of the Government is the strangulation and annihilation of all that kind of independent thought in public life.</P>

Why are they afraid of representation of the ordinary Irish people who have a right to a voice in their own affairs?  The purpose of an election is to elect a representative Parliament.  Parliament elects a Government.  Fianna Fáil have been in office for 31 of the past 37 years.  What complaint could they have about representation?  They have been able to carry on with an effective Government.  At the moment they are running at a higher level of effectiveness than ever before.  Why do they want to change?  Because they want to ensure an even stronger position for their Government.  Is that not the answer? Is that not what they want: to hell with the Irish people; they will look after Fianna Fáil.  Is that not what you are saying?  Is that not what you and the pipsqueak behind you are saying?  Is that not the purpose of this referendum?</P>

Deputy Andrews' face may be very red by the time the referendum is over.  The Irish people will be left under no delusion as to the real purpose behind this proposed referendum.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the position in Britain and the Tánaiste. no less, talked about proportional representation being imposed upon us by the British.  The alternative he himself wants to impose on the country is the system that operates in Britain.  We know the skulduggery and the graft in the Fianna Fáil organisation.  If they got away with the straight vote, they would not only eliminate the Labour Party, but they would try to eliminate us.  And then we have all the blandishments and the crawthumping about the great democracies here, there and everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> One cannot compare this country, with its small population and its vastly different economy, with Britain.  One certainly cannot compare the electoral system in the United States of America and argue that it would suit our condition here because, even though there is a two Party set-up there, there is a completely different type of government.  To begin with, there is an executive president who carries tremendous executive power.  This is a two-headed penny Fianna Fáil apparently want to keep.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Article 12 of the Constitution and the manner in which the President is elected. Apparently that system of election is not to be changed.  It must be satisfactory enough from the point of view of the Government.  Why change the system for election to Parliament? What is wrong?  How can we support two different systems of election to public office?  There has been no reference to any change in the system of election to local authorities.  Apparently the Government will try one gimmick first and, if they succeed in that, they will carry out further experiments, experiments in which the people will have no say.</P>
    <P>This is a haphazard approach to legislation.  No really serious thought must have been given to the matter. There must have been no real analysis of the general framework of our electoral system.  We can only be suspicious and we become even more suspicious when we are lectured by Fianna Fáil spokesmen about how good it would be for Fine Gael.</P>

They never yet had a majority vote of the Irish people and when they go with the referendum, they will be staggered at how their effort to reach even parity will fail.

      <P>As one who did not have the opportunity to speak on these proposals the last time they arose, in 1959, I should like emphatically to state my support of them on this occasion.  I am sorry to see Deputy Collins leaving the House.  He spoke about grave national issues which should be discussed in place of these proposals and it sounded very shallow coming from a man who appears in the House once a month.  I consider these proposals as important now as they were in 1959.  Deputy Collins referred to gerrymandering at some length and compared us unfairly and dishonestly with the situation which prevails in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As he well knows, if and when these proposals pass through the House and are acceptable to the Irish people, there will be a Commission set up under an independent judge to ensure that the constituencies are evenly, equally and equitably divided.  Of course, Fine Gael are great people to tell us about the independence of the judiciary.  I accept unequivocally the independence of the judiciary.  Fianna Fáil are giving in to them on this point and are appointing a judge as head of this independent Commission. There will be no question of gerrymandering, therefore, and comparisons with Northern Ireland are somewhat invidious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we heard a rather garbled historical lecture here from Deputy <Col N="1309" /> Hogan of South Tipperary.  He spoke of the history of PR, which, as the House knows, was mooted in the middle of the last century by a gentleman in England and a citizen of Denmark.  John Stuart Mill was its great protagonist in the middle of the last century in England.  There was a society set up here in 1911 with which, I understand, Arthur Griffith had something to do.  Then it was introduced effectively in this country in 1918 in the Sligo Corporation elections of that year.  The reason it was introduced at that time was to ensure that ratepayers and other minority interests would get representation on Sligo Corporation.  In fairness to the system at that time it was introduced on that basis to ensure the rights of minorities. I am now challenging any Member of this House to point out to me a case in recent history where the rights of the minorities were overridden, where there was any abuse of the rights of our so-called minorities.  I do not think such a case can be produced. There is no question about it at all.</P>
    <P>There is then this dishonest comparison with Northern Ireland.  Proportional representation was abolished in Northern Ireland in 1929.  The suggestion is being made by Opposition speakers that various Parties will be wiped out.  This was shown to be very far from the truth in the North.  Before 1929, the Nationalists had 12 seats in Northern Ireland and in the subsequent election under the straight vote system, they had 11 seats, so that effectively the situation was more or less the same.  I do not find the Northern Ireland electoral situation very acceptable but I do not think the same position would prevail here in the 26 Counties as prevails, certainly in some instances, in Northern Ireland.  I think we have become mature and civilised enough to recognise and to accept that, if the straight vote system is introduced into this country, it will be operated equitably.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to make on these proposals relates to the alternate vote or the straight vote itself. Quite frankly, I would of course prefer the first past the post system but if the alternate vote is acceptable to the <Col N="1310" /> House, fair enough by me.  I am, as it were, anxious that the country has a series of single-seat constituencies. That is all.  What system of election is produced when this debate concludes is immaterial.  I believe that, if the single-seat constituency is introduced, it will benefit the people living in the constituency which I represent and will benefit the country as a whole.  Apart altogether from the well-worn arguments about competition between Deputies of different Parties, and indeed Deputies of the same Party&mdash; all, by the way, totally true&mdash;in the same constituency, one point has been missed.  This is the question of final responsibility in relation to a given situation or a given problem in relation to a constituency under proportional representation.</P>
    <P>At the moment the position in the constituency which I represent, for instance, is that there are four Deputies representing 104,000 people. That is 26,000 people per Deputy. This of course would be a 61,000 electorate.  Effectively, in real terms, it means that each Deputy represents 104,000 people because his responsibility extends over the whole area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  If a situation or a controversy arises in that area, which Deputy and which Party is responsible for its solution?  In theory and practice, the four of us are &mdash;two Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael Deputies.  There are no Labour Deputies in this constituency at the moment.  This brings me to another point.</P>
    <P>I believe that under the straight vote system the Labour Party would get a seat in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  If the area is small and we have one Deputy for the area in which the problem arises, he is responsible for the solution to the problem and no one else.  Consequently the idea of final responsibility in a problem, local or national, is at the door of the one Deputy elected for that area.  If something occurs at the moment, the responsibility is disparate and we all share in the blame or the praise even having had nothing to do with it.  All the representatives are responsible in a given situation for the solution of a particular problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> This is what I find distasteful.  As a reasonably young Deputy and newly elected to this House, I feel that young people want responsibility, but at the moment as a Deputy I find myself running around in all directions, not knowing what I am responsible for, not knowing where I am being blamed or being praised for something I have had nothing to do with at all.  This, Sir, is the reason why if the single-seat constituency is introduced, assuming I am re-elected under this system, if something occurs in the constituency which I represent, I will be the one who will accept the blame or the praise and will be responsible for the solution of a particular problem.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that it is too soon to place the single-seat constituency proposal before the people again.  Apart altogether from the fact that many young people have come of age, electorally speaking, who should be given the opportunity of expressing their views, many Deputies opposite have changed their opinions over a reasonably short period.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although not necessarily agreeing with him on all expressions of opinion, has come out in favour of the single seat, first past the post system.  I have genuinely got great sympathy with the man in his present predicament.  Here is one Member who has openly expressed his opposition to a proposal being put forward by his own Party.  His position is all the more invidious because he is the leader of the Party who are putting forward this proposition in which he does not believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, the respected Fine Gael Member for the interests of the Party opposite in <Col N="1312" /> Monaghan, would appear to have changed his opinion.  I would refer the House to the Official Report of 12th November, 1947.  At column 1714, Deputy Dillon said:</P>
    <P>Personally I think proportional representation is a fraud and a cod, and that it ought to be abolished.</P>
    <P>At column 1715, he said:</P>
    <P>Proportional representation is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation.</P>
    <P>I have a little note after that: &ldquo;Poor Miss Lakeman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog.  I doubt if any other sane democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament.</P>
    <P>Later on, he said:</P>
    <P>It was foisted upon us by a collection of half-lunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle.</P>
    <P>He ended by saying that he looked forward to the day when</P>
    <P>... we may provide our people with an opportunity of getting sick of this fantastic system and hasten the day by which we will return to a normal system devised to ascertain the will of the people....</P>
    <P>So much for a change of opinion. The year 1947 is not, historically speaking, a very long period of time. I do not suggest to the House that 1959 is such a long period of time, historically speaking.  I suggest it is not too much to ascertain the will of the people at such a reasonable period of time on the basis that we all have changes of opinion and we all have changes of mind, given changed circumstances and a change in situation.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with Deputy Dillon changing his opinion and I see nothing wrong in Deputy Cosgrave maintaining his opinion.  Equally, I do not think it is wrong to go to the Irish people nine or ten years later and ask them if they have changed <Col N="1313" /> their opinion.  That is effectively what we are doing.  I hope the referendum will be conducted in a civilised manner and that it will show if the people have changed their opinions.  It is not the Government who will be deciding this issue; it is the people.  That is what this is all about.  I often wish that on other issues more referenda were taken to ascertain the will of the people on them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan is a well-known opponent of PR, as his act on the <i>Late Late Show</i> showed.  It is an expression of opinion completely acceptable to me because I agree with him.  As I say, it is important to remember that it is not the Government who bring about the change on the referendum; it is the people.  They, in the final analysis, have the final say. Deputy Hogan in his long speech, not altogether uninteresting, last night and today stated that recently on television we had some professor propounding the theory that if the straight vote single-seat constituency were introduced, Fianna Fáil would get 93 seats. Of course, this academic theory suits them.  I notice a lot of academic sooth-sayers coming into political life recently.  This decent man produced this figure of 93 seats for Fianna Fáil under the straight vote system.  He produced impressive drafts on television to prove his case.</P>
    <P>The professor based his figures on the local election results and the highly academic assumption that in a straight vote single seat in a general election, there would be the same variety of candidates as in a local election.  I know in my own constituency in the Dún Laoghaire section of it in Ward 2 or Ward 3&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;in the last local elections, there were some 21 candidates.  We had to decide who out of those 21 people would take over the five seats.  It was a five seat ward with 21 candidates.  It is really a crazy system.</P>
    <P>Now, to get back to the professor's hypothesis, the whole point, as I say, of the single-seat constituency is that there are fewer candidates and the Opposition is vastly superior.  This leaves me to believe that PR is an intellectual's paradise.  I would like to know how <Col N="1314" /> those professors from UCD and from Trinity&mdash;there seems to be a great anti-Government move in both of those colleges&mdash;arrive at their figures.  I would like them to be good enough to come out and say whose side they were on, whether on the side of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, and we could deal with them as political professors, if of course we bothered to deal with them at all.</P>
    <P>Those hypothetical propositions are produced so that the arguments are based on entirely faulty assumption. There is nothing incorrect in the question of the changing attitude in regard to the straight vote system and the PR system.  I believe there is nothing wrong in going to the people ten years later on the same issue.  We can witness the Taoiseach's statement on the proposed package deal in connection with the two proposals before us.  This change of attitude&mdash;again this is a personal opinion&mdash;was brought about by public opinion and nothing else.  The Taoiseach received praise and admiration for this and there is nothing to be ashamed of coming to the decision to which he came.  Public opinion is what the Government is all about. Public opinion is what politics is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Public opinion is what the Dáil is about and public opinion is what Deputies are elected on.  Public opinion is what the referendum is about.  When we talk about the Government interfering in this or coming to a decision, when we are dealing with a referendum, we are dealing with public opinion.  It is public opinion which governs everything that happens in this country. That is the way it is and as long as I am in Fianna Fáil, I sincerely hope that is the way it will always be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of disfranchisement was also mentioned by Deputy Hogan, who, with no disrespect to the man, used the word incorrectly.  Disfranchisement is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as a denial of the right to vote in an election.  It has been said that if PR is <Col N="1315" /> abolished, this situation will arise.  That is not so.  People will still have the right to vote and elect the Party they want. The principle of one man, one vote is maintained in its real form.</P>
    <P>The PR system of voting is unreal because if you have 15 candidates going for four Dáil seats, how can you really go through the 15 candidates and then say afterwards that you voted for the man who possibly got in or that you voted for the man who failed to get in?  It is so incredibly confusing that I challenge most Deputies, and myself included, that if somebody came up to one of us in the morning and asked us to explain PR, I genuinely could not answer him.  I believe 98 per cent of Deputies could not give the answer.  They do not know how it operates.  They do not know how to go in and vote for 15 candidates, and neither do the people.  Do they just mark their papers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and so on?</P>
    <P>We know that if you go outside the House, stop somebody in the street and ask what PR is, he will tell you he does not know.  Such a person will not know what you are talking about.  I know this is not the case with everyone.  If you go to a person and ask him what PR is, he will say: &ldquo;Yes, I do; it is a form or system of election&rdquo;.  Ask that person to explain it and I very much doubt if he would be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The corollary to all this about disfranchisement is that some people vote for A and B is elected.  Consequently those who voted for A will not be represented.  That is not so because the Deputy elected in the single-seat constituency will have a responsibility to the whole population of his or her area, irrespective of class, creed or otherwise. His responsibility in that particular area will be total.  I suggest it is somewhat similar to saying that because under 21's do not vote, they have no rights under PR.  They may have no constitutional right to vote but they have an inalienable right to representation, and that is the situation, as I envisage a civilised and mature single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>In my experience when someone <Col N="1316" /> calls to my door, or calls me on the phone or drops me a note, my immediate reaction is not to ask him to produce a Fianna Fáil membership card and to examine this card to ensure that his subscriptions are fully paid up.  I listen to people's problems, and do what I can.  If I cannot do anything, I tell them and that is the end of it.  I never ask anybody what his or her political affiliations are.  I think it would be impertinence to do this.  I live in Blackrock and I have not a flag saying: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil supporters only welcome here.&rdquo;  All are welcome.</P>
    <P>That is so much about disfranchisement.  I cannot understand this line of argument.  I am sure we are all sufficiently mature and civilised to recognise the fact that if I am elected for Fianna Fáil, the suggestion is that the Labour supporters and the Fine Gael supporters will be disfranchised, to use the word incorrectly again.  That is not so. People can rely on any Member of this House elected under the single-seat system to represent the overall and individual interests in the constituency, irrespective of religion, class, or Party political affiliations.  That is the way I would want it and that is the way I am convinced the single-seat constituency is the best.</P>
    <P>This again brings me along to Miss Enid Lakeman and her Electoral Reform Society.  Her plank is this whole question of disfranchisement if proportional representation is abolished.  This is rubbish.  That society has an address at Westminister and I wish it would cease meddling in the affairs of Ireland. We are mature enough to go our own way and settle our affairs without these ivory tower merchants talking down to us from a distance.</P>
    <P>The minority groups have been put forward as an argument here for the retention of PR.  As I said at the beginning, I challenge anybody to produce a case in recent Irish history where a religious or other minority suffered as a result of any action of this House.  We are mature enough to recognise our responsibility to all sections of the community.  As we all know, the most any parliament can do is to pursue policies that are generally acceptable.  I should <Col N="1317" /> now like to deal with another matter brought up by Deputy Surgeon Hogan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan mentioned that the Fine Gael Party were looking around for some Party with which to coalesce when they had the general election.  I again challenge any member of the Fine Gael Party to announce that they will form a Coalition Government before we go to the people on this referendum.  If you tell the people frankly and openly that you are prepared to form a Coalition Government.  you will get the greatest hammering of your life.  You have not announced how you are to form a Government, nor has your leader.  On the basis of what Deputy Hogan said, with Ireland following a traditional pattern of voting, Fine Gael have no hope of forming a Government on their own.  How will they get power?  I suggest the only way is to coalesce with the other political Parties.</P>
      <P>Tell the Irish people this before you go to the nation in the forthcoming referendum, whether in June or in the autumn.  I do not know when it will be; it depends entirely on how long we continue this debate.  That is briefly my reasonably short contribution.

It is amazing in the complete change of their present leaders compared with the founders and the former leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party: and it is amusing in the fact that Deputy Booth told us that he thought there should be a very strong safe Government here&mdash;as a matter of fact, he wanted it to be so strong that there would be an opportunity <Col N="1318" /> for the Government Party even to criticise their own actions.  That is the type of strong Government he wanted and why he wanted a straight vote. On the other hand, they have been telling us it is to have a strong and viable Opposition that they are introducing the straight vote.  How can anybody tell me you can increase a Government majority and increase an Opposition, in spite of the fact that the Government have said that there will be no increase in Deputies?</P>
      <P>It is amusing to know how they will do this.  I cannot understand it.  Deputy Crinion got up and tried to make a case for the straight vote.  He told us the straight vote was simple and people understood it.  It was not as complex as PR but then he more or less put his two feet into it when he tried to defend the defeat of the referendum in 1959. He said that although the referendum resulted in a defeat by 33,000 votes, there were approximately 39,000 spoiled votes.  These are his words.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  He said that in a normal election in any constituency under PR there are about 200 spoiled votes.  That would make a total of 7,600 in the 38 constituencies.  In the case of the referendum, it was a straight vote, for or against, and according to Deputy Crinion, there were 39,000 spoiled votes.  That would indicate that instead of simplifying the issue for the electors, there would be confusion.  The electors seem to have understood PR much more clearly than they understood the simple vote in the case of the referendum.  The Deputy then started to blame the Labour Party and said that the Labour Party had not always advocated PR.  I am not saying whether they had or had not: I do not know. The Labour Party are well able to defend themselves on that matter, I am sure.</P>

      <P>He asked why did not Labour go out in the last by-elections, why did they wait until now, to tell the people that they were for PR He suggested that they should have <Col N="1319" /> done it long ago.  I am not saying whether that is true or not, but if it is true, as he alleged, is it not also true that Fianna Fáil have not yet started to tell the people that they are in favour of the straight vote?  In the recent by-elections, did they tell the people of Clare and Wicklow that they wanted only a straight vote and that nothing else was of any use to them? I do not think they did.  I was not in Clare during the by-election there and did not see much of what happened there.  I do know that prior to the election I saw on television the Fianna Fáil candidate who, I am glad to see, is here now as a Deputy.</P>
      <P>When he appeared on television, did he tell the people of Clare that he wanted to represent only a small section of Clare?  Did he tell them that, if elected, he would do everything in his power to see that he would represent only a small portion of Clare? My recollection is that on television, he presented a picture of a man who was ready, able and anxious and who would spare no effort in travelling the length and breadth of Clare to represent the people.  If my memory serves me right, he used the phrase that he would represent the people from Loop Head to Lough Derg.  He is here now.  I think he used that phrase.  That did not indicate that he would represent only one section of the people of Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Wicklow.  In Wicklow, they did not ask the people to vote only No. 1 or that No. 1 was the only thing Fianna Fáil were looking for.  I do not know whether or not the Parliamentary Secretary, who is here now, asked the people of Wicklow for No. 1 only, but a voter told me that a certain Fianna Fáil Deputy, who spent quite an amount of his time in Arklow, canvassed very hard for a No. 1 vote and the woman in question replied that she wanted to be truthful, that she had promised her No. 1 vote and could not give it to Fianna Fáil and that he then asked if she could not give Fianna Fáil her No. 1 vote, would she give the Fianna Fáil candidate her No. 2 vote.  This woman, who lives in a remote part of the country, was quick <Col N="1320" /> enough to reply: &ldquo;I thought that according to you people there should be no such thing as a No. 2 vote&rdquo;. They did not tell the people there that they did not want their second preference votes.</P>

      <P>It was, and we are fighting hard to ensure that there will be always a second preference.  Definitely, we want to retain that and we want to retain, third, fourth, fifth and sixth preferences.  I wonder what the founder of the Fianna Fáil Party must think if he listens to the arguments being put forward here.  We are told by the Taoiseach that PR was a 19th century development.  If it was a 19th century development, I wonder why the then Taoiseach wrote it into the Constitution of 1937, a time which was well into the 20th century.  At that time, he thought it right and proper to write into the Constitution that the method of election should be PR. Despite that, the Taoiseach now says that it was a 19th century development, and this evening the Minister for Education told us that all that PR produces is parish pump politics.  I wonder what the founder of the Party would think of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth treated at length with the faults of PR.  The main fault he had to find in it was that it led to coalitions and, according to him, coalitions were to be avoided at all cost. Which was the first Party in the State to look for coalition?  Fianna Fáil have gone back to tell us what Cumann na nGaedheal had to say about coalitions many years ago and have even reproduced newspaper cuttings about what was said by Cumann na nGaedheal in regard to the faults of coalitions.  This led me to wonder why Cumann na nGaedheal should talk about the faults of coalitions and to wonder was it just that they stated in this House or issued statements to the press condemning coalitions for no apparent reason.  I have discovered that their reason at that time was that Fianna Fáil were planning a coalition. <Col N="1321" /> I do not know how many of the Deputies here now ever heard of a former Leader of the Labour Party, Tom Johnson.  At one time Fianna Fáil were so anxious to form a coalition that they were willing to appoint Tom Johnson as Taoiseach&mdash;the term was not in use at that time&mdash;Leader. Fianna Fáil at that time favoured coalitions.</P>

      <P>I will come to him in a minute.  We are told by Fianna Fáil about the dangers of coalitions, the bargaining it leads to, how each Party stands out and says: &ldquo;If we do not get this, we will not support the Government&rdquo;.  The advent of Fianna Fáil to Government took place in 1932. They came in on the support of the then Labour Party.  I admit that the Labour Party had the right to vote for whatever Party they liked.  That is their prerogrative.  They are entitled to do that.  However, Fianna Fáil came in with the support of Labour.  That is an undeniable fact. That is how they came to government. They told us then that they were not satisfied, that they wanted one-Party government.  They got away with it on a couple occasions, but in 1951, <Col N="1322" /> Fianna Fáil held on with a collection of Independents in this House, a rather varied assortment of individuals, none of whom had anything particular in common, but yet they supported Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil were very glad to carry on with them.  They did not tell us then of the dangers of not having a safe Government majority.  They told us that everything was safe, the Government was stable.</P>
      <P>I come now to what Deputy Treacy reminded me of, 1961.  This beats all. From 1961, the Government held on for practically four years with the support of two Independents.  Again we were told there was safe, strong Government.  Everything in the garden was lovely.  Fianna Fáil were satisfied, despite the fact that they had to depend on the whims and fancies of two Independents.  Talk about the bargaining that went on among the Parties forming a Government.  I wonder what bargaining went on with those Independents?  We never will know the truth of what happened, but one fact was unmistakable, that one of them has been rewarded by a seat in the Seanad.  He joined Fianna Fáil, I grant you, but he was not very long with Fianna Fáil.  Prominent members of Fianna Fáil even here in Dublin who were defeated in the General Election of 1965 tried hard to get into the Seanad but failed.  Why did the Taoiseach not nominate them among his 11?  I wonder why he went to one man who was, if you like, only a wet-day member of Fianna Fáil?  He was hoisted into the Seanad.  It just shows that several other bargains may have been struck of which the people were not aware and of which, I suppose, we never will be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have told us that PR was a British imposition.  At the moment they themselves seem to be willing to take the present British system.  If PR was a British imposition, why was it written into the Constitution of 1937?  We were told that the 1937 Constitution was going to rid us of everything British and that all ties with Britain would be gone.  Introducing these Bills, the Taoiseach told us that Fianna Fáil had always stood for the straight vote.  I do not know how <Col N="1323" /> long the Taoiseach has been associated with Fianna Fáil.  Not long after he became Taoiseach, somebody hinted that at one stage he had aspirations to join another Party.  He denied that.  He said his only recollection of politics was running along the Mardyke in Cork beside the car of the then Taoiseach.  Although the Taoiseach may be a relatively young man, he surely remembers 1937?  He surely knows that the Party he now leads did not favour a straight vote at that time? There is no doubt about it.  Fianna Fáil were in power from 1932.  While they were in power and felt PR suited them, they adhered to PR.  It was the perfect system of election.  Lest there be any doubt about it, they wrote it into the Constitution of 1937.  That continued from 1937 to 1947.  Then they were put out of office, but they did not decide immediately to change PR.  However, when they discovered they were put out a second time, they began to realise that they could be put out of office under PR.  The last time they were put out of office was, I think, 1957.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, it was only when Fianna Fáil realised that they had been defeated twice under PR and an alternative Government formed that they began to think to themselves that under PR, they were not safe.  They then began to think what was the best way of consolidating their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1959, we had this first attempt to do away with PR.  Government speakers have reminded us of people on this side of the House who thought the straight vote was the proper method of election.  They have gone back over the years to recall what different Deputies said in different years, but I would remind them that <Col N="1324" /> the founder of Fianna Fáil, now the President, said at one time that PR has served us well as a system and that it is a system we have a lot to be thankful for.  PR, he said, is a system we have a lot to be thankful for and a system from which we should not lightly depart.  Those were his views. If it was no harm for such an illustrious man as the President to change his mind, surely it is no harm for Deputies on this side to change their minds?  If that were not enough, until very recently the last Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, said that while we had PR, it was not possible to gerrymander.  That is worth noting.  Under PR, it is not possible to gerrymander.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the leaders who advocated PR would be pleased to think that the present members of the Party do not understand it.  Perhaps there was something in what the Taoiseach said about better Deputies, that the straight vote would produce better Deputies.  Naturally, he has a better knowledge of Deputies of his own Party than Deputies on the other side of the House, and perhaps he recognised that the standard of Deputies on that side was not very high. <Col N="1326" /> In 1937, PR was fully understood by the people over there.  We are supposed to be advancing as the years go by, and yet 30 years later Deputy Andrews tells us that practically none of them understands it.  Surely that is an indication that there is a deterioration among Fianna Fáil Deputies?  There might be something in the Taoiseach's desire to improve the standard of Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and different members of the Government have become accustomed recently to visiting the North.  There was an old saying in this country at one time that some of the English who came here and settled became more Irish than the Irish themselves.  I am beginning to wonder have the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party become more English than the English themselves, because they seem to be adopting everything British. Many years ago, with flag waving and ballyhoo, we were told to burn everything British except their coal, that they were our traditional enemy, and that we were traitors if we advocated trade with Britain.  All that is in the past now.  Now Britain is a lovely place and the British are lovely people. They have gone so far now that they want this British system.</P>

      <P>Of course, Fianna Fáil can do anything to meet a changing situation.  They told us they did not come into Dáil Éireann because of the Oath: it was as big as Mount Everest.  It debarred any Irishman from coming into this Parliament. Suddenly, when they decided to come in, the Oath became a molehill, just an empty formula, nothing at all: they could walk in and there was no hind-rance in doing so.  Then, as soon as they were in, this little molehill again assumed the proportions of Mount Everest.  They abolished the Oath.  A thing can grow to giant proportions when it suits them and it can vanish into oblivion when it suits them.  They are experts in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present proposal of the Fianna Fáil Party is the straight vote system for election to Dáil Éireann, the first <Col N="1329" /> past the post system, which I prefer to call the British system of election. It is a carbon copy of what we have in Northern Ireland.  Fianna Fáil spent many a year bewailing and lamenting the loss of our brethren in the North&mdash;they were gerrymandered; they were being deprived of their rights and deprived of their representation there.  Fianna Fáil's last Leader, Deputy Lemass, says it is not possible to do that under proportional representation.  Now, Fianna Fáil want to have the straight vote system.  I think certain people cannot be blamed for wondering if Fianna Fáil want to gerrymander with the same system as is practised in the North.</P>
    <P>On the issue of tolerance, they told us they are worried about the West. Back in 1927, Fianna Fáil told us they were worried about the West: that is 40 years ago.  I do not think they have done much for it since then.  They have spent the past 40 years being worried.  Have they done anything practical to try to help the West?  It is a sad reflection that, 40 years later, they are still worrying about the West, so much so that now they want to make any two votes in the West or in the rural areas&mdash;when I say &ldquo;the West&rdquo; I include all that area from Donegal to Kerry that has become depopulated&mdash; equal to three votes in Leinster.  They are worrying about them and they want to make any two votes down there equal to any three in, say, Dublin, where the population is.</P>

When I saw that heading, I began to wonder if it was something akin to what Fianna Fáil are attempting to do here.  I began to wonder if it was the case that Fianna Fáil had rejected the idea of the one man, one vote principle and considered that it should be abandoned. Fianna Fáil are now trying to make two votes in the West equal to three votes in the Dublin area.  They want any two votes in the depopulated rural <Col N="1330" /> areas to have as much say in the election of a Member to this House as three votes in Leinster.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to note that, despite the Fianna Fáil worry over the rural areas and the flight from the land since 1927&mdash;which is now over 40 years&mdash;their constructive achievements in those areas are noticeable by their absence.  I happened to find the figures for Donegal. In Donegal, in 1932, the voting strength was 72,000: at present it is 54,000.</P>

      <P>That is a drop of exactly 25 per cent.  It is fairly significant.  It does not speak too well for the Fianna Fáil attitude towards those rural areas.  No wonder they are getting a bit worried now.  I suppose it explains their idea of trying to make two votes there equal to three, say, in Dublin. They hope that will justify the same number of Deputies up there as they have had all along.  Actually, in a national school there in 1936, the number of pupils on the roll was 164: at the moment, it is 38.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the present effort of Fianna Fáil to introduce this straight form of voting is motivated by their realisation that having being beaten twice by PR, they could possibly be beaten again and indications are that under PR it will not be very long until that happens. If they were to be honest with themselves and the country, they would realise that any Party getting a majority of the votes can form a Government.</P>

      <P>No, a majority of votes is sufficient.  If the Deputy will look at the percentage of votes Fianna Fáil got down the years, he will find they succeeded in forming Governments on several occasions and rarely&mdash;perhaps once or twice&mdash;did they exceed 50 per cent of the votes, which proves that if you get half the votes or a little less, you can form a Government.  What they are attempting now is to make sure of forming a Government with little more than one-third of the votes.</P>

I wonder when this amendment comes in, will it be stamped &ldquo;Déanta in Mount Street&rdquo; because possibly that would be the correct stamp.  Or is there any truth in the rumour that this kite which is being flown to try to fool Members of the House was found by Deputy Norton on his way here along the Naas road and that it may have come from the Potez factory?

We had him telling us that he would really come down in favour of the amendment about to be introduced, and we had the Minister for Education saying that every Deputy should seriously consider it.  Does this indicate that Fianna Fáil realise they will be defeated, if not annihilated, in this effort?  Is this a way out?  Are they going to turn about face?

      <P>Public opinion and the newspapers shot it down, and then the Taoiseach shot it down.  There was no need for us to do so.  They realised that there is no hope of that getting through.  I wonder if they are now looking for some escape hatch.  There is no doubt that if they go for the <Col N="1335" /> straight vote and the single seat, they will be beaten and they will be beaten in the following general election. Fianna Fáil are careful manoeuverers. They are beginning to realise this and they will seek any way out.  The election in Wicklow gave them an idea, too.  They realised, with the fall in their vote in Wicklow, that the people were not kindly disposed towards this idea of abolishing PR.  With all these signs on the horizon, they are thinking, and thinking strongly, about the best way of getting out of the awkward situation in which they find themselves.</P>
      <P>They tell us that certain Members on our side of the House favour the straight vote and that this will help the Government.  I wonder what they think of the very many Members on the Fianna Fáil side who are afraid of their lives PR will be done away with. There are plenty of them over there. I do not know how Fianna Fáil control their Party meetings.  Whether Deputies are allowed to express freely their own opinions or what opinions they expressed at the meeting at which the decision was arrived at, I cannot say, but a very short time elapsed from the time Fianna Fáil made their decision and announced they were going for the single seat, straight vote, to the time of the meeting at which the Fine Gael Party decided what their attitude was to it.  At that time I myself was approached by several members of the Fianna Fáil Party to know what was our attitude, because they thought there was a danger that Fine Gael would go with the Government.</P>

I hope that they will not seek a way out now, but that they will go ahead and be well and decisively beaten in the referendum, and that the people will show them that, having voted against it in 1959, they do not want it again and that they object to the useless spending of some £150,000 on a question on which they decided only nine years ago. Nobody asked for this referendum; there was no need for it.  Fianna Fáil realise that they are slipping down the slippery slope and to retrieve their position, they want on a minority vote of anything up to 40 per cent to cement themselves in office.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> The first question we must ask ourselves is: is there a necessity for a referendum?  The people are entitled to be consulted occasionally, but it seems to be the view of the Opposition that the public should never get an opportunity to decide how the Constitution should be changed.  People have a right to change their minds, and what the Opposition members or people on this side of the House said ten or 20 years ago is not relevant to-day.  People have a right to change their minds in changed circumstances and that is why we should have this referendum.  The people have a right to change their minds and so have politicians.  I have no doubt that people who were in this House and left it would state, if they were here to-day, that we should have a referendum and that we should abolish PR.  For that reason we are going to give the people this constitutional right.  It is no prerogative of politicians in the Dáil to try to manipulate the Constitution if they do not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A great many young people are interested in politics and we do not <Col N="1343" /> know what they think about the present electoral system.  We are, I believe, right in putting the issue to the people to let them decide.</P>
      <P>By and large, we recognise we cannot have a referendum unless we have a majority in this House.  If we failed to get a majority in the next general election and subsequent elections, it would not be possible to give the people a chance of saying what they thought about proportional representation.  People change their minds.  The Church has changed its structure. When we go into the EEC, it is possible we will have to have referenda on various aspects of the Constitution. We will have to have a revision of constituencies before the next general election and surely this is the most appropriate time to consider the single-seat constituencies?  We all realise that practically every constituency will have to be changed before the next election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On today's Order Paper, I had Question No. 52 dealing with coast protection at River Row, Moville, County Donegal.  I want to say at the outset that I was prepared to elicit the information I required by way of Parliamentary Question but due to the unsatisfactory reply of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Gibbons, I was left with no alternative but to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> For the benefit of the House, let me go back over this problem of coast protection at River Row, Moville. River Row is an area where 14 families live, approximately 50 to 60 people. For the past ten years, agitation has been going on by the people there to have something done urgently.  Before I came into this House, Deputy Cunningham, whom one could describe as the local Deputy for that part of Donegal, made promises that this work would be commenced at a very early date.  One of the first problems presented to me by the people of Moville&mdash;to be more accurate by the Fine Gael group in that area&mdash;was River Row.  They went to the utmost trouble to spotlight the hardship which the people there had to tolerate and forced me to have the matter raised in the House by way of Parliamentary Question.  We were told at that time, in 1962, that the Coast Protection Act was being prepared and that when that Act was introduced by the late Donogh O'Malley, who was then Parliamentary Secretary, all our ills would be cured.</P>
    <P>The people in Moville were not satisfied that that was soon enough and two former members of the Fine Gael Party representing the Buncrana electoral area&mdash;Mr. McEleney and Mr. Deeny&mdash;had motions tabled in Donegal County Council asking the Office of Public Works to have repairs carried out there at the earliest possible date. The general trend of debate at county council level by members of the Fianna Fáil Party was: &ldquo;Do not waste ratepayers' money on having this repaired under the Local Authorities (Works) Act&rdquo;&mdash;or by any other means which were available to Donegal County Council&mdash;&ldquo;but wait until the Coast Protection Act is introduced and this will deal with this terrible problem.&rdquo; That was in 1962 and in 1963 the Bill was introduced, and from there on all sorts of pressure groups were being formed.  No doubt the people who live here and who support the Government Party were making representations to their public representatives.  I can assure the House that the people who support the Fine Gael Party were in constant touch with me about this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I am not particularly interested in who or what Party gets credit for carrying out repairs to River Row.  I want to tell the public through whatever medium I can that it is time certain Fianna Fáil Deputies and county councillors in Donegal stopped playing Mickey Mouse politics looking for half a dozen votes here and there, trying to frustrate efforts by me and other people to have something done here.  When Deputy Cunningham is approached in this matter, he is dealing with the Office of Public Works through the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, and if any mention of this coast protection work is made by any Member other than a Fianna Fáil representative it is being attended to, so much so that when I addressed a question to the Parliamentary Secretary he informed me that he was telling me what he told Deputy Cunningham some time ago.  I am not interested in what the Parliamentary Secretary told Deputy Cunningham. All I am interested in is when the Parliamentary Secretary will carry out repairs to River Row, Moville.</P>
    <P>You may have seen, a Cheann Comhairle, in the local papers in Donegal over the past week or ten days that damages have been sustained at Fahan on the other side of the peninsula, damages to such a major extent that a deputation was sent to Donegal County Council meeting on Monday to ask them to provide engineers, if the Office of Public Works were not prepared to do so, to provide expert advice on how they could carry out repairs to Lisfannon.  It may be out of order for me to mention Lisfannon.  I only use this argument to bring to the Parliamentary Secretary's mind that on numerous occasions in this House by way of Parliamentary Question and indeed on the Vote for the Office of Public Works, I have warned the Parliamentary Secretary that unless repairs were carried out, erosion would take place and the cost would be much greater than what it would have been if it were attended to there and then. That is exactly what happened at Lisfannon last week when we had high <Col N="1352" /> winds blowing in a certain direction and four holes of Lisfannon golf course were washed away.  Indeed the golf house itself is in danger and the main artery between Buncrana and Derry is in danger of being eroded. The same thing can happen at River Row, Moville.  The only difference is that there are lives at stake at River Row.  There are 14 families, approximately 50 to 60 people, living there.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion when a springtide flooded that area to a depth of two to three feet I had an urgent call from the people concerned to come down and examine it and see what could be done.  I went down on a wet, windy evening and all I could do was look on and sympathise with the people concerned.  These are poor people. These are people who cannot run to the bank manager when their homes are destroyed.  They cannot run to the nearest furniture supplier and order furniture, even if they were offered hire purchase arrangements.  These are people who are earning a hard living and need every penny they earn to support their families and to rear them in any type of comfort.  They cannot afford the danger or the terrors of being flooded now and then by tidal waves.  Indeed a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, the deputy chairman of the county council, who lives in Moville said at the county meeting on Monday that he did not wish to be against the deputation from Lisfannon but he wanted to impress on the county council that the need to have something done to River Row was much greater than anything Lisfannon could claim. I do not wish to push any open doors. I only want to spotlight that a resolution was passed at the Moville Development Association a fortnight ago, a copy of which was sent to the Parliamentary Secretary.  No satisfactory answer has been received from his office since, to my knowledge.  A resolution was passed on numerous occasions by Donegal County Council that something be done.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced, we were told all we needed was legislation, that the money was there and would be spent.  In 1965, £30,000 was voted for coast protection.  Before the <Col N="1353" /> Bill was introduced in the House, that figure was reduced to £5,000.  It was cut by £25,000 because of the credit squeeze but during that time even the Parliamentary Secretary refused to admit there was a credit squeeze.  We knew, and everyone else admitted, without being told, that there was a credit squeeze.  It seems from what has been said in the debate on the Third and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution, that the Government are more concerned about spending money on the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about River Row at Moville and I see no reason why I cannot compare the amount of money needed for the work there and that which the Government want to spend on the referendum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is coast protection where no action has been taken to alleviate the dangers there.  A sum of £25,000 was taken away.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm or deny this when he is replying.  In 1965, £25,000 was taken away because of the credit squeeze.  This resulted in people crying out to public representatives and the Government to do something before a disaster took place.  I hope there will be no such disaster. What I cannot understand is why the Government are so anxious to spend £100,000 on the referendum when something less than £10,000 would do to allow people to get to bed at night in peace, without fear of what will happen before the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in bed now only for you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I was referring to River Row and I apologise to the Parliamentary Secretary for keeping <Col N="1354" /> him out of bed at 10.45 p.m., but I can assure him that the people I am referring to now, the people in the cottages near River Row, cannot sleep in peace because they know that they may be awakened in the morning to carry their babies or any of their other children out of four feet of salty water. This is how serious the problem is.  I know when the Parliamentary Secretary goes home he can retire in comfort and he knows he can lie in slumber until the alarm clock or some other device awakens him in the morning but the people living near River Row at Moville have not got this guarantee.</P>
      <P>I know this may sound as a joke to the Parliamentary Secretary but in 1965 I was in constant contact with the Office of Public Works, and indeed with every power available to me as a county councillor, to try to get the Office and Donegal County Council to co-operate to have those works carried out at the earliest possible date.  I do not wish to read out the text of a letter which I received from the Secretary of Donegal County Council on 9th June, 1966.  I just want to say that I was assured that the Office had written to them asking for certain undertakings.  They assured me they had written back on 28th March, 1966 to the effect that they were accepting full liability for the cost of carrying out the work.  In other words, the green light was given to the Board of Works, to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is directly responsible to this House, on 28th March, 1966.  That is exactly two years ago tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the Vote for coast protection was reduced from £30,000 to £5,000 in the year 1965.  Then the Government told us it was due to a credit squeeze but two years later the Parliamentary Secretary, as a responsible member of the Fianna Fáil Party has taken on himself the responsibility to say to the people: &ldquo;I am more interested in having a referendum to decide what way we should be elected than to see money spent on River Row.&rdquo;  This is a scandalous situation and I feel it is time that Mickey Mouse politicians and Mickey Mouse politics ceased.  I invited Deputy Cunningham at a council meeting to go to the Parliamentary <Col N="1355" /> Secretary and say to him: &ldquo;Let us be real politicians.  Let us see that this work is done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House any further.  I have made most of the points I intended to make.  I just wish to say that in another years time or another two years time, no matter what the result of the referendum is, even if the Parliamentary Secretary is not back there, I will be back, and if this work is not done I will be back on the Adjournment telling him or somebody else that the people living beside River Row at Moville are still awaiting the money to be spent on this work so that they can go to bed as comfortably as he can go to bed tonight.</P>
    <P>There is just one thing which will prevent me coming back here to the Parliamentary Secretary on the Adjournment about this matter, that is, a change of Government.  I will keep this seat warm for him.  If you want to amend the Constitution to give the people an opportunity to provide a good strong Opposition, I say to you that after the next election on PR, you will have an opportunity of sitting over here in Opposition and Fine Gael will have an opportunity of providing this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that Deputy Harte's purpose in having me here on the Adjournment was to discuss the subject matter of Question 52 on today's Order Paper which concerns the coast erosion position in Donegal.  Instead, we have had a homily about Mickey Mouse politicians.  He was relevant enough when he was talking about Mickey Mouse politics.  Then we had a homily <Col N="1356" /> about the referendum, the cost of it and all kinds of irrelevancies.  In spite of all the irrelevancies, Deputy Harte did not succeed in concealing the most important aspect of the question as it affects him and it is this.  Deputy Harte has not done his home work and does not understand the position at all. He does not understand the position regarding the coast erosion scheme.  The text of that I gave him today:</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question by Deputy Cunningham on the 21st February this is one of the proposals, consideration of which had to be deferred because of the financial situation.  I cannot yet say when it may proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>During Deputy Harte's 20 minutes, he asserted more than once that there was a reluctance on my part to disclose the reasons for our inability to undertake more coast erosion jobs.  Other than what is given in this reply, in my introduction to the Vote on Public Works and Buildings, I said:</P>
      <P>The £5,000 in Subhead I is required to meet the cost of maintaining the completed coast protection works at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>I went on to say:</P>
      <P>The procedure prescribed by the Coast Protection Act is protracted and I do not think that any works will commence this year.</P>
      <P>I went on further to say:</P>
      <P>I hope to be able to make a bigger provision next year so that construction work may begin then.</P>
