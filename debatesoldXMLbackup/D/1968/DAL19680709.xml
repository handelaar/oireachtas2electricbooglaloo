While new Governments have, in the meantime, been formed in Belgium, Italy and France, the Council of the European Economic Community is at present preoccupied with internal Community problems and early progress on the questions arising out of the applications for membership is not expected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 2 to 5 together.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this year the Government authorised the Minister for Defence to make funds available out of the Emergency Relief Fund of Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann to enable it to help in maintaining University students from Nigeria who were cut off from receiving support from home.</P>
      <P>In May last, the Minister for Defence made £5,000 available to An Cumann Croise Deirge for sending food and medicine to the Nigerian districts in greatest need particularly those in the East and South East.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago, the Government decided to give a further sum of £100,000 for the same purpose.  In addition as the Deputy is aware An Cumann Croise Deirge has received the generous subscription of £10,000 from the Catholic Hierarchy and considerable donations of cash and supplies from organisations, business concerns and private individuals.  It is to be hoped that our people will continue to send in donations of cash and supplies as long as the need for them continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Cumann Croise Deirge has over the years despatched its relief supplies through the International Red Cross <Col N="499" /> Committee in Geneva.  The International Red Cross is a world-wide organisation and is usually in the forefront in bringing relief to areas seriously affected by war, famine, floods and earthquakes.  By using the experienced and efficient services of the International Red Cross for the distribution of relief, the minimum of difficulties have arisen and An Cumann Croise Deirge has succeeded in delivering the highest possible proportion of Irish donations of cash and supplies to people in distress.</P>
    <P>The International Red Cross has been active throughout Nigeria since the conflict broke out and it is considered the most effective and most economical medium to ensure delivery of supplies to the areas in sorest need of help.  Under present circumstances it is, of course, impossible to foretell what percentage of our supplies will reach any particular district in Nigeria.</P>
    <P>I see little hope at present of any significant number of medical and social workers reaching certain parts of Nigeria and in any event the Government have received no request for such personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the reports which have appeared to the effect that supplies sent through the International Red Cross did not reach Biafra, has the Minister considered sending any supplies through Caritas Internationalis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one plane carrying Red Cross supplies which crashed but the Red Cross have been delivering supplies by air into the improvised airstrips in the eastern portion and they are continuing to send them.  Of course, they can send only limited quantities but they are continuing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising further out of the Minister's reply, is it not a fact that the International Red Cross deals with the Government concerned in the country, and that all supplies go through that Government?  Is it not further a fact that if the supplies go through the Nigerian Government, the Biafran people will not accept them <Col N="500" /> because they are afraid the stuff going in to them may be tampered with before it gets there?  Is he not further aware that Caritas Internationalis have their own methods of delivering goods within stricken territories, and have succeeded in doing so over the past weeks?  Would the Minister therefore not consider that anything despatched from Ireland should go through Caritas Internationalis through whom it will reach the destination for which it is intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed when he says the International Red Cross cannot deliver supplies into the eastern portion.  They have been delivering supplies&mdash;that is the fact&mdash; and it was a Red Cross plane that crashed.  They are continuing and they intend to continue to deliver supplies by air.  However, we must realise that what can be delivered to improvised airstrips is a very small proportion of the goods and medicines most people would like to see delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact, in the case of anything delivered into Biafra by the International Red Cross, that the Red Cross have to go through the existing Government, the Nigerian Government, there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being delivered to an adjoining country, to Fernando Po, by ship or by air.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the concern of the Deputy.  I want to make the situation clear&mdash;what it has been, what it is and what we hope it will be in the future&mdash;in regard to the delivery of supplies.  The supplies that go to Fernando Po can be flown direct from there by the Red Cross.  They do not go through the territory held by the Federal troops: they go over it.  There is some hope in the news in the papers yesterday and today that there may be further agreement which will facilitate the delivery of more supplies by air. However, what is very necessary, if supplies are to be delivered in quantity, is that there should be a land corridor into the area and this is something the mediator, the Secretary-General of the British Commonwealth Secretariat, is trying to negotiate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the facilities at Fernando Po are too limited.  Is it not a fact, in relation to supply difficulties at Fernando Po, that the facilities there are so restricted that the quantity that can be brought in through that means is very limited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The airport facilities at Fernando Po are limited. Perhaps the Deputy has read some of the news items in today's and yesterday's papers which indicate that the Federal Government are prepared to allow relief supplies into the Federalheld territory and to give a clearance for planes landing in the Ibo-held territory.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, daylight is the best time to land at an unlighted airport or on a piece of a road.  They have further suggested that they will open up&mdash;and this is not a new suggestion on their part&mdash;a corridor through which these supplies can reach the people in distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether or not the International Red Cross are represented in Nigeria?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could there not be an arrangement whereby the Red Cross in Nigeria would arrange for the supply of these foodstuffs, medicines, and so on, to Biafra?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They are working on that all the time.  They have not succeeded in getting agreement on both sides on the technique of flying them in.  However, the situation seems a little more hopeful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Red Cross in Nigeria appreciate the situation there? Surely the Red Cross in Nigeria, being the humane society that it is, recognises the urgent necessity of getting foodstuffs, medicines, and so on, into Biafra?  There should be no difficulty about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he recognises the need for immediate action to resolve the very serious situation between Nigeria and Biafra; and if he will consider direct mediation by an Irish Parliamentary delegation to bring the conflict to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the dire need for a cease-fire in the disastrous Nigerian conflict to avoid the sacrifice of further lives and to relieve the starvation and disease which is prevalent in many districts.  Mr. Arnold Smith the Secretary General of the British Commonwealth Secretariat has <Col N="503" /> been accepted as mediator and has brought the parties together on at least one occasion.  It is known that he is continuing to work energetically to bring them to the conference table again and I am convinced that the best way to help him in his onerous task is to let it be known, as I have made it known, that we in Ireland hope and pray for an immediate cease-fire to facilitate the delivery of food and medicine and the negotiation of a stable peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that Ireland has an active part to play in negotiations in that unhappy land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a part to play in conciliation.  I think we have played that part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not further agree that the Government have done absolutely nothing in that direction?  They are waiting for the Commonwealth Secretariat or the Organisation for African Unity, both of which have failed so far.  Meanwhile, thousands of people are starving.  Does the Minister not think it is up to us to do something in a sphere in which we have so much interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is wrong in his assumption and must have forgotten what I said in this House on many occasions in relation to this conflict.  We did our utmost to stop it before it started.  We counselled all sides not to attempt to solve these difficulties by force because they would be followed, in their circumstances, particularly, by horrible consequences. Since the war started, we have consistently urged both sides, in private and in public, as far as we could, to bring about a cease-fire and to negotiate a peace which would be a benefit to the people in all parts of Nigeria.</P>

Specialised rail vehicles have been provided by the Board for the carriage of various types of bulk loads and where such traffic offers in <Col N="505" /> sufficient volume, for example in the case of minerals, cement and fuel oil, CIE have provided special trains carrying between 400 and 500 tons which are capable of running at speeds in excess of those for normal goods trains.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme for the development of major tourist resorts, 17 resorts and resort areas were selected for development.  One of the resort areas <Col N="506" /> selected is the River Shannon and lakes and a grant has accordingly been provided by Bord Fáilte for the provision of berthage and harbour facilities for pleasure cruisers at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. The total cost of the scheme is £100,000 of which Bord Fáilte are providing 75 per cent and the county council 25 per cent.  Total expenditure in the current year is £50,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>In addition, minor improvement works are being carried out in County Leitrim at Garadice Lake, Gulladoo Lake and Lough Allen, for which grants totalling £5,500 are being provided in the current year by Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the urgent need for modern facilities for trawler fishermen at the Coal Quay, Dún Laoghaire he will consider, as a matter of urgency, the provision of a filleting and ice shed: and if he will make a general policy statement in relation to the trawler fishermen in Dún Laoghaire in the context of plans for the future development of Irish sea fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that <Col N="508" /> the provision of a filleting and ice shed at Dún Laoghaire at the expense of the State would be warranted.  In fact fish filleting premises have not been provided anywhere by the State and I am informed that adequate supplies of ice at a reasonable price are readily available at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, all reasonable facilities will continue to be made available to the trawler fishermen at Dún Laoghaire but as Howth is scheduled for development as a major fishery harbour, a major development of fish landing facilities at Dún Laoghaire could not be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some ten or 12 trawler fishermen operate from Dún Laoghaire and the conditions in which they operate are primitive in the extreme? Would he consider sending out a team of experts to see the tremendous potential there is on the Coal Quay for these facilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to have something behind them.  So far as Deputy Andrews's supplementary question is concerned, we do not need to send out a team of experts.  We know that there is quite a sizeable fleet operating from there but we do not provide these filleting facilities and neither do we consider that in the case of Dún Laoghaire at the present time is there a situation wherein the Board should provide an ice plant for the reason that ice is available more readily and more economically from city ice plants than it could be provided at Dún Laoghaire. In addition to this, you have across the bay at Howth a major fishery harbour development scheme going ahead at which all these facilities will be provided. <Col N="509" /> Overall we feel the situation is not one which requires the provision of an ice plant at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Howth is concerned, it is very remote from Dún Laoghaire.  The reason I tabled the question was to ensure that whatever would be done for these people would be done in the interests of the community at Dún Laoghaire and not primarily in the interests of the people at Howth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not hold with the view that Dún Laoghaire and Howth are remote from each other from the point of view of berthage and on-shore facilities.  These are in the course of being provided in a substantial way at Howth.  The people at Dún Laoghaire who fish there are not bereft of such facilities because ice is available to them at a cheaper rate than it would be even if they had their own plant at Dún Laoghaire.  I cannot therefore see the point in providing these facilities at Dún Laoghaire.</P>

Part of a warden's duties will be the giving of evidence in cases which go to court.</P>
      <P>A good deal of thought has been given to the manning of this new service and it has been considered that in the interests of efficiency and integrity the most suitable personnel to operate a &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; system would be found amongst members of the Force who have retired on pension after long service.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 32 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised leaving certificate course will commence in the schools in September, 1969, and will be examined for the first time in 1971. <Col N="523" /> The course for the intermediate certificate in all subjects was drawn up in 1966 and has met with the approval of all the interested bodies.  The first examination based on it will be held in 1969.  In the case of the leaving certificate what I have done is to accept, with the approval of the Government, the recommendations made to me by a committee representative of the Department, the universities and the school associations that there should be a common and a second (additional) paper in the leaving certificate examination in Irish, English and modern continental languages.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which seem to have arisen in the case of English in particular are apparently based on a misconception of what is involved.  There was never at any time any question of the common paper and the syllabus on which it would be based not containing a substantial amount of literature. In laying stress on accomplishment in the matter of writing English fluently and correctly the desire was to get away from a position in which a pupil could through memorising large passages from essays and from Shakespearian plays pass the leaving certificate examination in English without any real knowledge or comprehension of the language.</P>
    <P>What is intended is a genuine effort to raise the standard of English teaching in the schools so that pupils can read and write the English language more efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that people do not read things fully and carefully.  This is a question of getting our priorities right.  Priority in regard to teaching English as a vernacular is to enable people to speak and write English correctly.  What has horrified me, on looking back over leaving certificate papers over the past few years, is the fact that children have received full marks for quoting passages from Shakespeare and the poets and have been, at the same time, unable to communicate their own thoughts properly in writing and I regard writing a language properly as more important than rote learning of poetry, for instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>There is no question about that.  It goes without saying that you must have a knowledge of the masters of English literature in order fully to comprehend the language.  In regard to emphasis, however, the priority must be on speaking and writing the language correctly and effectively.  The inadequacy in this respect has horrified me.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that anonymous complaints are never investigated. They are, in fact, frequently. Sometimes one can get anonymous complaints which are rather wildly worded and so imprecise as to make it impossible to investigate the complaints concerned.  I would point out that in the event of a complaint by a member of the public who gives his name and address being investigated and found to be well-founded, if we cannot persuade, say, the publican concerned to reduce his price and if we want to prosecute and the member of the public will not act as a witness, then we are in difficulty, so that the willingness of the public to co-operate in this is of considerable assistance in enforcing price control.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that a number of small farmers in County Donegal are unable to take advantage of the local authority scheme for the erection of houses for small farmers whose PLV does not exceed £5 owing to the fact that their holdings have not been revested in the tenants; and, if so, if he will take steps so that the Land Commission and the Land Registry will revest and register the holdings as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there are no cases outstanding for attention in the Land Commission at present where small farmers in County Donegal have applied to have their holdings vested in them so as to qualify for participation in the special housing scheme operated by the county council. Any such applications received are dealt with expeditiously and sympathetically&mdash;and where a particular holding cannot be vested immediately <Col N="529" /> as a unit the practice in the Land Commission is to divorce, by subdivision order, the site of the proposed dwellinghouse from the main part of the holding and vest it separately. I understand that registration is then effected in the Land Registry as a matter of urgency.  If the Deputy is concerned about a particular case and furnishes details, I shall have the matter examined.</P>
      <P>I might add that the number of holdings in County Donegal which remain to be vested in tenant-purchasers is about 1,400.  As a substantial proportion of these require rearrangement, enlargement or general improvement before they can be released for vesting, the work involved in dealing with them is necessarily tedious.  Every effort, however, is being made to bring the vesting proceedings for these holdings to a conclusion as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>Section 1: in lines 16 to 23, all words from and including &ldquo;any&rdquo; in line 16 to the end of the section deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  a university or university college in respect of its courses which are of degree standard, or</P>

      <P>This Bill has come from the Seanad with this very small amendment to section 1 which clarifies the section. There is nothing more to it than that. It is a question of ensuring that the institution which the Minister can deem to be equivalent to a university would be deemed to be a university for the purpose of the Act.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This amendment is, of course, acceptable to me.  It seems to be an improvement on section 46 as originally drafted and as carried in this House.  It seeks to ensure that an accused person shall have an opportunity of having a second test or tests made by an independent person of a sample of blood or urine as the case may be.  It is highly desirable that the new subsection should be inserted.  This makes it clear that, if the accused person goes into the witness box to establish as a fact that what I will describe as the technical requirements of subsection (1) of section 46 have not been complied with, he cannot be then asked any questions or called upon to give any evidence and that the case against him fails there and then.

This section might fairly be described as an afterthought by the Minister.  It was not in the Bill as originally drafted and the amendment was not introduced by the Minister on the Committee Stage.  I think it was introduced by the Minister on the Report Stage and the Bill was then recommitted.  We had not a very good opportunity of considering the amendment on Report Stage.  This amendment and the other amendments made in the Seanad, which I shall deal with later, are an improvement on the Bill as it left the House.  Amendment No. 3 spells out in greater detail what was sought to be put in a very concise form in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 61.  I accept it as an improvement on the section.</P>

    <P>The aim of this amendment is to clarify the position regarding the payment of costs and expenses to persons involved in an inquiry and the recovery <Col N="543" /> from any person of costs incurred by the Minister in connection with an inquiry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Again I welcome this amendment &mdash; introduced, I think, in response to a point made by me on this section during the brief discussion we had on the Report Stage.  As the Bill was originally drafted, the Minister had power to make provision for the payment of costs incurred by him in connection with an inquiry under the section but he had not power to make provision for costs incurred by any member of the public or anybody else. I pointed out then that that was an undesirable state of affairs.  It is clear now that under the amendment as passed by the Seanad the Minister has power to make provision (1) for the payment by the Minister of expenses incurred by a person giving evidence at an inquiry and (2) for the payment by the Minister of costs reasonably incurred by any person in connection with the inquiry.</P>
      <P>This was a serious omission in the Bill as introduced into the House. When a lawyer Deputy speaks about costs he is likely to be misrepresented, but it is not the lawyer who would be at a loss here but the person either dragged before an inquiry or who considered he had very good reason to go before the inquiry in his own interest. As the Bill was originally drafted a person might be wrongly brought before the inquiry or he might have thought it necessary to be represented there and he could be completely cleared of any charge, or any suggestion against him at the inquiry and yet under the Bill as originally drafted, I think it was clear that the Minister had no authority to indemnify that person against costs.  Of course if he asked a lawyer to represent him, the lawyer would have to be paid but he would have to pay it himself even if he were completely in the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has made <Col N="544" /> good that omission in the interests of the public in general.  It is also clear that the Minister has the right now under the section to recover costs or expenses from any person who appears at the inquiry and was involved there. I think he already had that power under the Bill as originally drafted. Without being too critical of or severe on the Minister's advisers, the Bill, as originally drafted, is a typical example of the anxiety of the establishment to ensure that their rights are protected. It is also typical of the industry that is shown to ensure that the rights of the State are protected while at the same time sometimes, as in this section as originally drafted, overlooking the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>The discussion here and the subsequent discussion in the Seanad and the introduction of this amendment by the Minister really demonstrate the value of Committee discussion in the House and also highlight the necessity for a second Chamber and the good that such a Chamber can do on occasions like this.  There is really much more in this small amendment than meets the eye.  The interests of the individual taxpayer and individual citizen have been put on the same level as the interests and rights of the State. I regret to say that was not the position in the section as originally drafted. I thank the Minister for acceding to my request.</P>

      <P>That the Secondary Teachers (Superannuation) (Amendment) Scheme, 1968 prepared by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under section 5 of the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928 and laid before the House on 7th March, 1968 be confirmed.</P>
      <P>This amendment is being introduced in implementation of a recommendation by the Conciliation Council for Secondary Teachers at its meeting of 7th October, 1966.  National teachers have enjoyed a similar privilege since 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides for the retention in approved teaching service <Col N="546" /> of those members of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme whose date of birth occurs in the last quarter of the school year for a period of not more than three months provided such retention enables these teachers to complete an additional year of service for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Only completed years of service as a member of the scheme are reckonable in the calculation of pension and gratuity and this amendment provides certain members who would normally retire with a year of service almost completed with the opportunity of completing the year.  It comes into force on or after 31st July, 1966.  I think it will be generally welcomed by the secondary teaching profession as bringing them into line with the primary teachers in this respect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 138 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the deletion in subsection (3) of `£45' and the substitution therefor of `£100'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to deal with what I regard as an injustice and anomaly in the income tax code.  I have not the Income Tax Act before me now but section 138 of that Act re-enacts a section of the 1920 Finance Act which provided then that the earned income allowance in respect of a wife's earnings would be £45.  That figure was fixed 48 years ago and it does not need any words of mine to emphasise that if at that stage in 1920 £45 was regarded as a reasonable allowance, it is very hard to justify the continuance 48 years later of precisely the same figure.  I suggest in the amendment that the £45 be increased to £100.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time this matter was raised.  It has been raised in one way or another in recent years and I think an amendment seeking a greater allowance was tabled last year by Deputy Noel Lemass.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter sympathetically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposal for an effective increase in a personal allowance under the income tax code, and consequently the first thing we must look to is the cost.  I am sure Deputy O'Higgins will be a little dismayed when I tell him it would cost about £750,000, so on budgetary grounds alone, it is completely out of the question at this stage and in this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am referring to the effect of increasing the figure <Col N="548" /> from £45 to £100.  There is another aspect to which Deputy O'Higgins may not have adverted, that is, where directors of family companies claim to have paid £100 to their wives for services rendered to the company and automatically gain this £45.  It is very difficult to disprove that the wife of a director does not actually render services to the company and very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to combat this device in respect of this personal allowance.  Deputy Byrne was smiling up there because, I am sure, he has very often advised client companies to adopt this device.  For that reason this personal allowance is not the first I would be inclined to increase if I had extra money at my disposal.</P>

      <P>I had not in mind any situations such as the Minister refers to in relation to directors' wives earning fees.  The cases I have in mind are genuine cases where a wife, by reason of limited circumstances, is earning and has to earn.  It is that kind of case that has been brought to my notice over the past two years, and it is in the interests of that approach that I have tabled the amendment.  I had not realised that the amount would be as large as that, but I would ask the Minister to consider this problem over the coming 12 months.</P>

      <P>I put down this amendment in response to a number of representations which have been made to me by Deputy Andrews and others; of course Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Higgins had their own amendments down.  The amendments put down by Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Higgins suggested we might bring the operative date for these new reliefs back to the Budget.  On thinking it over, I agree there is something in the case put up, and I am actually going further and going back to the start of the financial year which is probably a more logical thing to do.</P>

      <P>The Minister is reasonably familiar with the provisions of the Succession Act.  Under section 29 (3) of the Finance Act of 1965, there is no distinction between children where the deceased and his wife die simultaneously; in such a case there is no widow.  It is suggested that the Minister might consider abolishing the distinction, because I understand that in cases of that sort the relief which would be given does not apply. Perhaps the Minister would consider making it possible to aggregate and apportion it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well to point out, now that the Finance Bill is about to pass, that there are grounds for dissatisfaction with some of the contents of the Bill, in the sense that under the Bill we are carrying on, from <Col N="552" /> the point of view of income tax liability, scales of allowances which are out of date in relation to the real value of money.  As was pointed out in the course of the debates on Second Reading and Committee Stages with inflation, with rising costs and a falling value of money in many instances that inflation itself may operate as a tax gatherer for the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is true that personal allowances and earned income tax reliefs were fixed a comparatively long time ago at a time when money had different values, and since then the allowances were continued at the same rate.  It is well to point out that they are out of touch with the requirements of the people.  I should like to express the hope that after the passing of this Bill, the whole problem of a fair and just approach to the allowances made to taxpayers who are no longer a special group of the community and who are to be found in all walks of life, and particularly amongst the thousands of manual workers, will be examined by the Minister in an up to date and modern way.  I cannot feel the allowances are just and fair at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I made many appeals to the Minister when the Bill was going through about certain improvements which I think he or some other Minister for Finance should try to make in next year's Budget.  There is something which has to be dealt with, and I wonder could the Minister deal with it now?  There is general dissatisfaction in the country at the fact that old age pensioners who have to work for one reason or another have their pensions taxed.  Is there any way in which the Minister could deal with this matter without waiting until next year?  After all, we introduced a Bill to deal with pensioners who receive pensions from the United States and it was accepted.  Surely our own old age pensioners could be dealt with?  Would the Minister say if he would be inclined to deal with this matter between now and next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly undertake to deal with it between now and the next Budget.  There are merits to be argued with regard to it.  Whatever <Col N="553" /> would be done would cost money. I am quite certain that if I sat down with Deputy Tully and said I had so much money to spend in this area, he would agree it should be spent on increasing the basic allowances for all old age pensioners rather than, in effect, giving additional benefits to old age pensioners who are fortunate enough to be able to draw the old age pension and work at the same time.</P>

      <P>Still they are better off.  An old age pensioner who can work and draw the contributory old age pension will certainly be a great deal better off than a non-contributory old age pensioner.  There are merits to be argued.  I will not argue them now but it would be technically impossible to do anything between now and next year.</P>
      <P>I can only repeat in reply to Deputy O'Higgins that any substantial and worthwhile changes which could be made in the personal allowances could be made only in the context of some general and fairly radical revision of the total tax structure.  I will invite Deputy O'Higgins to co-operate with me and put forward alternative sources of revenue from which the deficiencies caused by increasing the personal allowances could be made good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £100,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come <Col N="554" /> in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain Services administered by that Office; for the Pay and Expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make provision for a sum of £100,000 which, as has already been announced, the Government propose to make available to the Irish Red Cross Society for the purchase of food and medicines in this country for despatch to Nigeria, particularly to the distressed districts in the eastern area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the widespread sufferings caused by the continuing civil strife in Nigeria.  The conflict has displaced countless numbers of people from their homes, particularly in the eastern and south-eastern areas, and they are experiencing conditions of great want and hunger.  Food supplies are scarce and there has already been widespread starvation and malnutrition, especially among children. There is every indication that the situation is likely to deteriorate disastrously unless supplies of food and medicines can be made available in large quantities without delay.</P>
    <P>International relief organisations are actively engaged in trying to relieve the situation.  In this country the Irish Red Cross Society have launched an appeal for cash and supplies.  The Irish Hierarchy have given the Red Cross a generous donation of £100,000 and business concerns and private individuals have been very generous in their response.  However, in view of the magnitude of the humanitarian problem, the Government felt that they should now offer a substantial contribution towards the relief efforts.  It was considered that £100,000 would be an appropriate contribution and that it would be best to make this sum available through the Irish Red Cross Society in view of their long experience in dealing with matters of this kind. The society are now urgently engaged in making the necessary arrangements for the despatch to the International <Col N="555" /> Committee of the Red Cross of the material aid to be provided.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Deputies generally will be in agreement with the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate.  It seems only right and proper that we should make this practical demonstration of our great concern to help in relieving the serious human distress that is now so widespread in Nigeria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be general agreement with the Supplementary Estimate introduced by the Minister for the purpose of providing aid for the sorely afflicted people of Nigeria and Biafra.  The reports which have been coming from those areas indicate that the human misery and suffering there are very grave.  There is, I think, a generally accepted realisation in this country that we have an obligation to use our best efforts to provide relief and assistance to the maximum possible extent within our means.  Indeed, the suffering and the widespread famine, particularly in the eastern area, have reminded the people of this country of the famine which existed here a little over 100 years ago and impressed on all concerned with the welfare of people and with humanitarian considerations that there is a very serious obligation on countries that have sufficient supplies of food and medicines to use their best endeavours to alleviate and ease the very serious conditions which exist in other countries.  We, therefore, agree with the proposal to provide relief for Nigeria and Biafra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assenting to this proposal, it is essential that we should express our concern that the supplies which are sent to those areas will reach the people and the areas which are in such dire need.  It has been the accepted procedure or the generally usual procedure for this country to channel supplies through our Red Cross Society to the International Red Cross Organisation. In the main that method of sending relief to stricken areas has proved satisfactory and has provided relief where needed.  There is, however, some evidence that in this particular case consideration should be given to sending some of the relief through an alternative <Col N="556" /> method.  I would urge the Minister and the Government to consider the desirability of consulting with at least one other relief organisation, Caritas Internationalis.  So far as this country is concerned we are not concerned with nor have we any desire to get involved in the different political or tribal disputes which have unfortunately caused this conflict but we are concerned with the suffering of the people in the areas concerned.  We have been moved by the very grave accounts of the hardship and misery, and, indeed, the obvious imminence of widespread starvation and lack of food, as well as lack of medical care and attention.  We, therefore, have a duty and a responsibility to ensure so far as supplies of medicine and supplies of food are sent from this country that they reach the people affected and that relief is provided in the areas where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>There is, as I say, evidence to suggest that some of the supplies which have been sent through the International Red Cross have not reached their destinations because of the internal conflict between the Federal authorities and the authorities or the people responsible in the breakaway Biafra region.  We are not concerned with those internal disputes or dissensions but we are concerned to ensure that the supplies sent reach the areas where they are most needed.  Here I want to mention one other fact.  If there is one criticism more than another that can be made of the United Nations with regard to this matter it is that their approach is too legalistic; they are adopting a legaltic or formal approach.  That type of approach may be all right when political aspects are being considered when a ceasefire is secured, if it is possible to do so, but in supplying the needs of suffering humanity the important thing is to get the food and medicines in in the quickest possible way.  I, therefore, want to urge that the Government should consider most carefully the methods by which supplies can be got in.  While this is not strictly a matter for the Minister's Department there is, nevertheless, an obligation on him and on the Government to ensure that when <Col N="557" /> public money is voted here for the relief of distress that every avenue open to us should be used, either in the United Nations or otherwise, to bring hostilities to an end and to look for a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason I expressed concern at Question Time at the fact that arms were being supplied to the Federal authorities by Britain and Russia.  It is not for us to concern ourselves with the political question but we have an obligation to see that when we are taking steps to provide relief we also take steps to ensure that the international organisation, of which we are a member, exerts itself to the maximum possible extent and avails of a realistic approach, when people are starving and when there is misery, want and hunger, to see that every possible step is taken to ensure that a ceasefire takes place.  When we read of the position of, say, eight million people in an area the size of either Munster and Leinster or Leinster and Connacht, and in an area that is very largely devoid of food and of the means of producing adequate quantities of food, then we can get before our minds and in our consideration of this problem a realistic understanding of the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us to exert our diplomatic and other endeavours towards arriving at a cease-fire. I appreciate that this is not only the Minister's responsibility as a member of the Government but in voting, as we do with approval, this money we indicate the concern which is felt and of the duty of all sections in the country to provide what relief we can. In the context that the Irish people are conscious of the contribution which the Irish missionaries, both religious and lay, and other people have made in those areas we are anxious to show, as a country who in our past history have suffered acutely from famine and want at a time when we had few friends, when we have now independence and the means to provide assistance for people in other lands similarly affected as we were a little over 100 years ago, that we want to help those people.  At the same time, we have an obligation to exert ourselves to the maximum extent and to ensure that no legalistic <Col N="558" /> or formalistic approach prevents us achieving the aims we desire, to provide relief for suffering humanity and not merely to bring succour by way of food and medicine but also to bring hostilities to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In expressing the support of the Labour Party to this proposal before the House, I do so in the knowledge that I suppose there is nobody in this House who knows more about the situation than the Minister himself because of the connection of his family with this area.  We are glad indeed that they have been able to get out of Biafra without too much of a scar on them.  They were on missionary work there and we are all glad they were able to get out of it.  At the same time, it must be a great sorrow to them and to the hundreds of other people who were involved in missionary teaching work in Biafra to have to leave everything they built up over the years behind them in ruins.  Indeed, I was speaking to a good Sister who was perhaps the most recent person to come out of it a week ago and she told me that their greatest worry was whether they would be able to get back and take up where they left off.</P>
      <P>When we talk about hunger here, we tend to think of the day we had not got our lunch, the day we had to do something and as a result had to wait until late evening to have a meal.  This lady told me that as long ago as the end of April there were literally thousands of refugees who could only be guaranteed one reasonable meal per fortnight.  In the face of that, surely nobody in the civilised world is doing enough towards ending that situation. The Government are giving £100,000. Other organisations are giving a lot of money.  As the previous speaker said, is there any guarantee that all our efforts to help will not be in vain.  Will the suffering in fact have died before this aid reaches them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an expert on these things. Therefore, it would be unfair of me to make a suggestion.  Surely it is ridiculous to suggest that the only way in which the Red Cross can get food into Biafra is through the Federal troops who are naturally suspect.  Surely if the food is being passed through enemy <Col N="559" /> lines we cannot blame the people of Biafra, no matter how badly off they may be, if they suspect that it may be tampered with.  It is all right to say they are afraid that arms and ammunition will be smuggled through as packets of food, but is it not up to the free world to ensure that food is sent directly to those people?  I am informed that even if it were acceptable, the flow of food through Nigeria could lead to big trouble as it will pass on so far by land to the base where it is needed most that it could be many months before it could reach the people who need it.  It appears that the only way it can be got in is to fly it in.  If it cannot be flown in with the authority of the Federal Government, surely the obvious thing is for sympathetic Governments to get food in by some other route.</P>
    <P>Our Party were particularly critical of the Minister for External Affairs.  He gave a fairly tart answer when he was asked if any attempt or offer of mediation could be made by the Irish Government.  The answer he gave was that if that offer were made, the suggestion would be that we were playing to the gallery and Deputy Seán Dunne's comment was very true &mdash; the gallery are dying of starvation so it does not matter whether we are playing to the gallery or not.  Surely some effort should be made in this direction?  If ever there was a case of man's inhumanity to man, with countless thousands hungry, this is it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence is doing everything he possibly can within the Government to do something helpful to improve the situation but a bigger effort must be made.  I would suggest that extreme pressure be put on those who can make an effort to settle the conflict in order to try to bring hostilities to an end.  There are two issues. One is the situation of people dying from lack of food and the second is that even if they live and are well fed, there is a grave danger that they will eventually all be killed.  If we can believe what we hear, and we must believe the stories of the religious organisations' representatives who have come out of Biafra, the Governments <Col N="560" /> on both sides for their own military objectives seem to be prepared to sacrifice everybody, even if it means killing every person in the country.  Some of the stories we have been told are too horrifying to repeat and we talk calmly about giving £100,000 for relief.  We cannot say whether if food is being bought and sent on, it will ever reach the people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dictate to the House.  I am sure there are others who want to comment on this.  However, I should like to express the opinion that no matter what effort we make to relieve the hunger and to end hostilities, whether we are laughed at for making that effort or not, I believe it is well worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that the Minister for Defence should be the Minister to bring in this vote of help for the people in Biafra and Nigeria.  In my view, the Government have been extraordinarily lax in relation to the problem that exists there.  I should like the Minister for Defence to know &mdash; he has been closely associated with that part of the world through his own relations &mdash; that any criticisms I may make are not directed against him but are directed to the Government of which he is a member and for which he must accept responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vote of £100,000 is a late attempt to show that the Government have some interest anyway in the appalling situation that exists in Nigeria today.  All of us in this House are fully in support of that effort on the part of the Government, but everybody here is conscious of the difficulties that exist in the area where the conflict rages and the difficulties which exist in supplying people who are most in need with aid.  Quite recently the Catholic Bishop of Owerri and the Protestant Bishop of Owerri made a united appeal to the world to help the people who are dying every day in the occupied territories of Biafra.  There are 15,000,000 people in the disaster area and owing to the vicissitudes of the war they have been reduced to an area the size of Munster.  The greater number of the people exist on small farms by growing the food that keeps <Col N="561" /> them barely in sustenance in normal times.  The majority have had to leave their homesteads and have become refugees, thrown on the help of the world and any food that is available to them.</P>
    <P>I would not like to feel, nor I am sure would the Minister, that the £100,000 they have given, together with the other subscriptions given to the Red Cross, might go the wrong way. The military station at Port Harcourt which was the only opening to the sea fell recently.  With it fell the aerodrome and the position is that they had to erect in Biafran territory, and that is where the real starvation exists, temporary aerodromes.  They are secret and anything that comes in has to come in at night.  These aerodromes are camouflaged during the day as they know they will be destroyed by the Federal forces of Nigeria who have had supplies of arms from Russia, the United Kingdom, Czechoslovakia and other countries, whereas the Biafrans are fighting to maintain their existence with practically nothing.  It is for that reason that any food that goes into Biafra has to go in at night.</P>
    <P>When I was questioning the Minister for External Affairs here this afternoon, I pointed out to him that the International Red Cross conduct their mercy expeditions through the agents of the existing government.  As Deputy Cosgrave very rightly said, this is being treated by the Government as a legalistic operation.  I fear, and many people in this country fear as well &mdash; because they have expressed their opinion to me &mdash; that there is a risk that this money voted by the Irish Government and the money subscribed here by rich and poor alike may be transmitted to the wrong area.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that there is a guarantee that this food will go into the area for which it is largely intended.  I do not deny for a moment that it may be necessary for some of it to go into Federal Nigeria itself, where conditions are not too good, but we must concentrate on the eastern territory, now known as Biafra, where so many deaths are occurring due to starvation. For that reason, I join with the Leader <Col N="562" /> of my Party, Deputy Cosgrave, in asking the Minister to ensure that some of the supplies will go through another organisation.  Caritas Internationalis, a non-political organisation, are very suitable for this work and have aleady done work in this respect.  The brain behind that organisation is, all honour to him, an Irish priest.  That organisation can deal efficiently with this matter and can get the supplies into Biafra where they are needed, as they have already done in the past.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the eastern region, the military situation is hopeless. They now have no major aerodrome or port of entry left.  Therefore, the only way in which food can safely and expeditiously be sent into Biafra is from the islands off the west coast of Africa.  I understand that a ship of a British line is taking it to Santa Isabella, Fernando Po, an island off the west coast of Africa.  Fernando Po is a very rich island.  Formerly, is was a Spanish colony.  Now it has a government of its own.  It imports a large labour force to carry out the necessary work on the island.  In the main, that labour force comes from Federal Nigeria.  Therefore, there is considerable apprehension among those who know &mdash; and the people who know are the people who made the appeal, that is, the two Bishops of Owerri &mdash; in regard to the risk that this food, intended in the main for Biafra, will never get there at all.</P>
    <P>There are other islands off the coast of Africa, controlled by another European power, whose record in this unfortunate business is a better one than the Irish record &mdash; the record we here should have as a nation that should primarily be interested in this particular situation.  Anyway, Caritas Internationalis are in touch with that nation and are in a position to ensure that the food will go in there and go in there immediately.  I can assure the Minister from the depths of my heart that there probably has never been a greater hunger or famine crisis in the world than now exists in that unhappy country.  This Government must accept collective responsibility if they fail to help the territory for which this country &mdash; our missionaries, our priests, <Col N="563" /> our nuns, our sisters and our lay folk &mdash; contributed so much to evangelise, to build hospitals and schools in, and so on.  Those things are now being swept away.  However, that is not the issue here this afternoon.  The issue here this afternoon is the saving of the lives of those people in Biafra for whom they are morally and religiously responsible.  They feel this crisis as deeply as anyone else and they feel it is the duty of the Irish Government to stand behind them.  I urge the Minister to consider these facts and to ensure that the food reaches the destination for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred briefly to the question of trying to get a cease-fire.  I would ask the Minister for Defence, with all the force he may command in this Government, with all the knowledge he has of that particular area, to convey to his colleagues in the Government that the one country, to my mind, that has not only an opportunity but a duty &mdash; and that will probably succeed &mdash; to restore peace to that unhappy land, is the Irish nation. That being so, I ask the Minister &mdash; I made this appeal to his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, on several occasions &mdash; to ensure that a political delegation will go out from this country as soon as possible to ensure that peace is restored there.  The information I had from His Lordship, the Bishop of Owerri, only the other day, was that no matter how much or how quickly food goes in, it will not prevent people there from dying of starvation and that the only thing that will rectify conditions in that unhappy land is peace.  With our record and with our tradition, it is our duty to play our part in seeking a peaceful solution in this unhappy tragedy.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;may think it miserable to offer a sum of £100,000 for the relief of starvation in a part of <Col N="564" /> the world in which many Irishmen and many Irishwomen have played such a prominent part.  May I join with the Minister's colleague, Deputy Tully of Meath, in congratulating the Minister on the personal safety of his own family in the area?</P>
      <P>Though this may be a meagre sum, there is a duty on us to ensure that we do all we possibly can to see that the proceeds of these moneys which we vote will reach the destination for which we intend them.  I understood from the Minister in his opening speech, although I had not a copy of it, that it is proposed to buy food and material in this country and then to forward it to the International Red Cross and to request them to deliver it.  It is notorious that medicines in this country are very expensive indeed.  It might be more beneficial to the people if we gave the money to whatever organisation through which we propose to channel the relief and leave it to them to buy in the best possible markets. That should not apply to foodstuffs but it should apply to medicines and other drugs.</P>
      <P>We contribute to the United Nations establishment whose duty it is to ensure that peace shall reign throughout the world.  We contribute to the International Red Cross whose duty it is to alleviate suffering and starvation throughout the world.  There should be greater liaison between the International Red Cross and the United Nations.  There should be some force or other which would ensure that relief, when granted by the International Red Cross, is delivered to the destination for which it is intended.  Some relief force should be established by the United Nations.  It cannot be done immediately as we are now at the height of this crisis but it should be done for the future to ensure that the International Red Cross will be facilitated in every way in carrying out the merciful task for which they have been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the United Nations are playing the part they should play in this matter.  They have peace-keeping forces in several parts of <Col N="565" /> the world and we contribute a fair sum towards that peace-keeping corps.  As I said, if the United Nations could have some liaison with the International Red Cross to ensure that the moneys which this House votes for the relief of starvation in this war-ravished area of Africa would eventually reach there, it would be of considerable assistance to the unfortunates who are suffering there.  Recently we read the book <i>The Great Hunger</i> and it brought home to us that we sometimes fail to realise what our ancestors had to suffer at that time.  It is only when we read articles or books of that sort that we realise this but here we have the <i>viva voce</i> evidence of our missionaries who are returning from Africa of the suffering and damage that is being caused in that area.  We should endeavour to ensure that every avenue of approach, both in regard to peace and in regard to getting supplies to these unfortunates, is explored.  If the Irish Red Cross cannot get supplies through for the reasons stated here today, it might be possible to consult Caritas Internationalis and ensure that between the two organisations at least the greater portion of the money we vote will bring relief to the people for whom it is intended.</P>

      <P>I welcome this generous gesture of the Minister for Defence for the suffering people in Biafra.  We in the Red Cross Society are deeply concerned about what the people are suffering in that country.  No matter who they are or what they are, the Irish Red Cross Society have tried to do their best, through the International Red Cross Society, to bring relief to starving people and needy people in any part of the world.  Some cousins of mine who had been in Biafra have returned home and they say that conditions there are very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the United Nations.  I have no doubt that there are great humanitarians attached to all international organisations but there is a particular problem when you have civil war in a country.  It is very difficult for us to do anything except in a charitable way.  Everybody will appreciate that there are thousands and thousands of people dying in Biafra <Col N="566" /> every day.  No civil war in any part of the world was ever as bad as this one because very often in civil wars people are not dying of hunger.  With our standards here, it is very difficult for us to understand how this could have happened and how so many thousands are dying.  The refugee problem is a big one and the only thing we can do is to help to relieve their suffering.  As a Christian people, as a people who are always anxious to help others, this is the best thing we can do.  I hope that reason will prevail in this conflict.  It is a matter of indifference to us whether they want to cede from the remainder of Nigeria because as a charitable people we are only anxious to do what we can to help the starving multitudes.</P>
    <P>I hope that all international organisations of goodwill will break down any barriers in order to ensure that the people will not die of hunger.  As a member of the Red Cross Society and one of the founder members of the Society in Dublin, I want again to offer our heartiest congratulations to the Minister and the Government.  The Minister had his own children teaching out there and he knows the position.  To repeat what I said last week, he is doing God's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this contribution but I only wish that it was five times as great having regard to the seriousness of the problem.  A sum of £500,000 would not be too much to send them.  We should have announced a national appeal and the Government should have led the way in this appeal. We should also have appealed to our industrialists and to our traders to contribute to this very worthy cause.  I often wonder if the Irish Red Cross Society have no funds at their disposal which they could send immediately to afflicted areas or must they always await an appeal to the country for funds?  Another point about which I wonder is why we cannot arrange to air-lift supplies in view of this emergency. The Government should consider this point carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of a cease-fire, which is the only way to solve this problem and prevent further starvation and deaths, the Minister for External Affairs should ensure that it <Col N="567" /> becomes known to both sides in the struggle that the Irish Government will make their services available as mediators in the conflict.  It is not sufficient for the Minister for External Affairs to say that he cannot do this.  It should be done immediately.  Ireland holds no brief in this struggle and is not like our neighbouring country which has vested interests.  Ireland has emerged as a very important country from the point of view of helping in situations like this.  Since the only personal interest we have is that of our Irish missionaries, who have done such tremendous work in this country, it must be realised that the Irish Government would be quite unselfish in offering itself as a mediator and I think the Minister for External Affairs should make it known immediately to both sides that he is prepared to offer himself as a mediator in an effort to solve the problem and prevent further starvation and misery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the leader of my Party and to that of Deputy Tully in their very genuine expressions of support for this proposal.  Those expressions are clear evidence of the unanimous desire of the people generally to assist financially and by every other means in their power in the relief of distress in the Biafra province of Nigeria.</P>
      <P>This Vote is one of the most important, one of the most necessary and one of the most urgent coming before this House in recent years.  The Minister is asking for approval of a very modest sum of £100,000.  It is a small contribution by comparison with what is required to relieve the distress of these afflicted people.  The country is torn by civil war.  In addition to civil war, there is tribal warfare.  We are very glad to make this gesture on behalf of the Irish people because of the very close ties between this country and Nigeria, ties manufactured over a very long number of years.  Irish priests and nuns have devoted their lives to the spreading of Christianity in Nigeria, particularly in the province of Biafra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Minister and, I am sure, other Members of the Government and <Col N="568" /> Deputy Esmonde, I, too, had the pleasure of meeting Bishop Whelan on his arrival here.  Having been told at first-hand the conditions that exist in this war-torn land, it is difficult to credit that civilisation has progressed to the point at which millions are being spent in an effort to send a man to the moon.  Side by side with that, the wheatfields are being burned in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in Canada; in the United States of America farmers are being paid not to produce food.  Millions are starving in Biafra.  People are dying at the rate of 300 per day because of lack of food.  It has often puzzled me that there is always an element ready and willing to encourage the prolongation of war with all its dreadful consequences.  We must speak out loudly &mdash; it is our bounden duty &mdash; about the appalling situation in Nigeria.  Let us hope this modest £100,000 represents the first practical step by the Irish Government towards relieving the dreadful situation that obtains in Nigeria.  Let us hope that the Irish Government will now through the United Nations, or by some other means, take steps to bring about a cease-fire in this war-torn country. Unless an end is brought to hostilities, all our efforts at relief will be in vain.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge in the United Nations and elsewhere that the Federal Government of Nigeria is being supplied with arms by Russia and others in order to keep this war going.  None of us has any desire to interfere in the domestic and political affairs of any other nation; we have enough to do trying to look after our own.  We have, however, an obligation as Christians and as a nation that has suffered, though possibly to a lesser extent than these unfortunate people, to do everything in our power to help to make peace.  The whole position is quite horrifying.  We shall have to do more than merely send £100,000 worth of food, clothing and medicine, the more so as we have no guarantee that what we send will go to those who need it most urgently.</P>
    <P>The Government should instruct the Minister for External Affairs to solicit the support of the United Nations who, as has been said, have peace-keeping <Col N="569" /> forces, so that steps will be taken to bring the civil war to an end.  It is not possible for the various tribes within Nigeria to solve this problem themselves. This war has gone on for one and a half years and it likely to continue, with consequential suffering to humanity there.  As Bishop Whelan rightly said in all his public utterances over the past ten days in this country, only a cease-fire will be really effective, although food and medical supplies will help to relieve the deplorable distress prevailing there at the moment. We can give a lead.  We are capable of doing it and can do it by setting in motion the necessary machinery whereby an end to the war will at least be sought and there will be a cease-fire as a result of efforts by the United Nations or by whoever may be responsible for bringing all the parties together.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the Government will follow up this contribution which is being voted by the House today. It is voted unanimously, with the approval of every Deputy.  That is the result of our realisation of our responsibility to fellow Christians and to human beings.  It is being done in response to the appeals by the leaders of Church, by the Pope himself and by all who believe in helping, in the spirit of Christianity, those in need.</P>
    <P>A very serious effort should be made.  The steps taken by the Government in the past have not been practical. Our Minister for External Affairs has been wanting in so far as serious action is concerned to bring world-wide attention to the deplorable condition that exists in the province of Nigeria. It would be the wish of the Irish people that he would be prepared to act as mediator or that the nation would act as mediator.  Something should be done to bring about a cease-fire.  Without the intervention of the Hand of God, it would appear to be an impossible task.  Therefore, in addition to sending supplies, all of us should pray for Divine intervention and that, through the power of the Holy Spirit, wiser counsels will prevail and peace will be restored to Nigeria.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there has ever been an Estimate introduced in this House <Col N="570" /> to which I so readily subscribed my fullest support and approval.  I trust that the amount of money involved will be wisely spent and will be the means of bringing comfort to those who are suffering from the disastrous effects of this civil war.  It is a great pity that every civilised government in the world would not take a similar step.  I hope that a leaf will be taken out of our book by the wealthy nations who can afford to contribute to this cause better than we can.  It is the poor who always help the poor.  We are a poor country but we are big in heart.  We are big in the extension of Christianity.  We are big in helping where our support is most needed.  The Government have acted wisely.  Perhaps, as the last speaker said, the sum involved can be described as very modest.  Nevertheless, it goes with a big heart from all the Irish people.  When the Government speak on this matter, they speak on behalf of all the people.  We are a small country and a poor country.  We give of our best.  If the economy permitted, we would give more.  If we were a much wealthier state, our contribution to this most worthy cause would be more substantial bearing in mind that many of our own citizens will benefit, people that our own priests and nuns have been living amongst and working with. Let us hope they will benefit.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that practical steps will be taken to see that order is restored in Nigeria.  It is most unfortunate that there should be civil war in Nigeria, a country that seemed to have such a great future.  We can only hope and trust that wiser counsels will prevail and that, before further distress is caused, Ireland will give the lead in focussing world attention on this problem and the necessity for serious action for the restoration of peace.</P>

      <P>I do not want to add to the length of this debate because it would be a pity to spoil the unity which has been achieved by engaging in too much acrimonious discussion.  Let me endorse all that has been said on all sides of the House of our obligation to give generously of our resources to the unfortunate people of Biafra.  Our <Col N="571" /> obligation to make this contribution is independent of whether or not any of us or our sons and daughters, kith or kin, have ever put a foot in Biafra to do good or bad works.  This obligation lies on us as human beings, as creatures of God, to give of our resources to those in need of them.  That is the simple truth of the obligation which lies on us and we should honourably and gladly discharge it.</P>
      <P>It may well be that there are a few people amongst us who would begrudge our giving anything outside our country.  This is a time when there is a clear obligation on us as public representatives to consider what are the issues involved and to make a decision. Irrespective of what the views of the electorate may be, this is an occasion when Members of Parliament are obliged to come down in favour of giving a contribution.  It is, however, an encouragement to know that the decision we take in the case is supported by the overwhelming mass of our people and that it is only a few odd cranks who may begrudge the giving of this money and, indeed, these would be the very people who would be loudest in demands as to what other people should do unto us, if we were in the position of the Biafrans today. We do not have to consider their opinion seriously.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate, I am conscious of the fact that this contribution of £100,000 in goods and in kind could be completely obliterated in one day's military conflict and, therefore, as we give this money, I consider that we have an equal obligation as a nation to make whatever efforts we can, either by way of diplomacy or by way of protest in this assembly, to see to it that the great nations involved in this conflict, and who have turned this local dispute into a national conflict, would withdraw from the Nigerian situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must condemn the political whited sepulchres of Britain, the British Government, who day in and day out have given military help and other assistance to the Nigerian Federal Government to inflict cruelties upon the unfortunate people of Biafra.  Whatever doubts the world may have had <Col N="572" /> about the conflict in that sorry land must have been dispelled when within the last few days the Federal Government threatened to shoot down any plane on a mercy mission to Biafra. That pronouncement by the Federal Government must be condemned without qualification.  Ample opportunity was available to them to supervise supplies going in by air or to have inspections carried out by people in whom they had trust to ensure that such planes did not carry arms.  But to say clearly, without qualification and without apology to anybody, that they would shoot down any plane on a mercy mission condemns them before the tribunal of mankind now and forever after.  No matter what may be at issue, to refuse to give food and medicine to suffering refugees is to commit a crime against humanity. Therefore, the Federal Government deserve properly to be condemned.</P>
    <P>I share the views expressed from the Fine Gael benches today that the Government have been far too shy on the question of breaking the diplomatic ice. This is an international conflict in Nigeria.  Russia wants Port Harcourt. That is why they are involved with the Nigerian Federal Government.  They hope that by giving them political aid this port will be made available to them.  On the other hand, Britain wants to keep their goodwill, so that every gun supplied by Russia must be matched by a gun from Britain.  All this supply of arms is being poured into Nigeria to be used against the unfortunate, ill-treated people of Biafra.</P>
    <P>It therefore shakes one's faith in the United Nations to see it unwilling to act, to see it reserved and impotent in that situation.  If the United Nations had cause to act in the Congo, Cyprus and the Middle East, there is equal if not greater cause for them to act in an effective way to bring the war in Nigeria and Biafra to an end.  Our Government are being far too shy in relation to this matter.  This is an occasion when we must step out and clearly assert that the conscience of mankind is stricken by this conflict, that it condemns the great powers for supplying military aid to either side and that mankind through the United <Col N="573" /> Nations must take action now to stop this unnecessary strife in this land.</P>
    <P>I would like to get the views of the Minister and the Government on a suggestion made to me within the past week.  As chairman of Dublin Health Authority, I was asked to make a donation from the Authority of drugs and medicines to the Biafran Relief Fund.  I am advised, however, that a health authority has no power to make such donations from its own resources. Of course, the reason why it would not have statutory powers to do so is fairly clear.  The suggestion was then made that there are in the stores of health authorities drugs and medicines which from time to time reach the date of expiration of their full potency as set out on the label.  However, I am advised by qualified medical people and drug experts that there is a substantial margin of safety allowed so far as these dates are concerned and that in many cases the full potency remains for some months, if not a year or more, after the date on the label, although the colour or some other aspect of the drug may change.</P>
    <P>One would not at all wish to furnish drugs which were in any way lacking in potency and which could only mislead people into a false situation.  That would be dreadful altogether and might lead to greater pain and suffering. But if it be the case that these drugs and medicines have potency after the dates on which we in this country are allowed use them, perhaps we ought to make them available.  At present health authorities get no monetary benefit when these drugs go out of date.  It might be possible to make a collection of them and dispatch them to Biafra or wherever else they might be required in any future conflict or emergency situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to endorse the support the Irish people are giving to this compelling request to assist the people of Biafra.  I wish to endorse also the mounting public criticism of the Government for their failure to act on the diplomatic and political plane to bring about a cessation of hostilities in this very sad territory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject one <Col N="574" /> could become very emotional about. One could speak at length on the situation that exists in Nigeria, that existed there since the civil war started and even before that, but I do not propose to follow that line.  I welcome the expressions of goodwill from spokesmen of the three main Parties in the House in giving their full approval to the provision of the money specified in this Estimate to purchase food and medicines in this country for relief of distress in Nigeria and, in particular, in the eastern region of that country.  The food and medicines already assembled are now on a ship in Dublin Port and will shortly be on their way to the island of Fernando Po.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde criticised the idea of landing supplies on this island for transhipment by air to the eastern region.  Appeals have been made to me and to the Government to change horses, so to speak, and to have the supplies we provide handled by the other organisation, Caritas Internationalis. Our practice up to now has been to give the money voted in this House to the Irish Red Cross and they, in turn, deal with the International Red Cross.  I have no reason to doubt that the supplies the Irish Red Cross have already sent to the International Committee have landed in the eastern region.  We know that the International Red Cross Committee are using the island of Fernando Po and flying in supplies to these stricken people.  Caritas Internationalis is operating in the same way from another island.  That is the only difference, in my opinion.  I am quite satisfied &mdash; so far as it is humanly possible to be certain in a war situation in which the Federal Government has announced its intention to shoot down these planes &mdash; that whatever food is provided by this country will reach its destination and that it will be distributed to the people who need it most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have a clear picture of the situation.  There are starving millions inside the steel ring in the heartland of Eastern Nigeria, or the bushland, as it is called, but there are also starving people outside the ring in the captured territory of the eastern region. Surely the House does not wish us to deny supplies to these people?  I know <Col N="575" /> they do not and I know that our people want to see these supplies going where they are needed.  It is not unusual in large areas of Africa to have hunger, want and starvation as a result of natural causes.  Indeed, it is a common thing, but this is something different; this is a disastrous situation in our view.  There are millions of people herded together in this heartland and it is our business to see, as far as we possibly can, that they are supplied with food in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I shall not enter into the questions of the political or military situation in that country.  I shall not even comment on the criticism levelled here at the Government because of their alleged inactivity in trying to arrange a cease-fire and failing to bring this problem more forcibly before the United Nations.  That is not my function but I want to say in passing that it is no simple matter to arrange a cease-fire in any war situation, great or small.</P>
    <P>As regards the role of the Red Cross Society in the matter of relief the position is that the Society is financed by the Government from money voted by this House, by means of the Emergency Relief Fund.  Money is provided yearly to the extent of some £10,000 or £15,000 by the House on the understanding that the amount may be increased to any amount that the Government may decide.  The Society has already a good record in giving aid to the people in eastern Nigeria.  They sent some £5,000 in cash this year when they were asked for it.  They have also sent supplies including medicines to the value of over £700.  I wish to say thanks again to the people who have subscribed, the industrialists, traders and workers, trade unionists and farmers and all our people from every walk of life, the majority of whom made some contribution in response to appeals in the Press and elsewhere.  I hope they will continue to subscribe as far as they possibly can.  I think further supplies will need to be sent if we are to save the lives of many of the people involved.</P>
    <P>I made a mistake in my introductory remarks in saying that the Irish Hierarchy <Col N="576" /> contributed £100,000 to the Red Cross.  The figure should have read £10,000 but it is a large amount for the Hierarchy to have subscribed.  The Government's contribution compares favourably in amount with the contributions made by other countries. Coming from a country with limited resources it is comparatively large and taken in conjunction with the amount coming from private sources the contribution is sizeable.  But what we consider to be large amounts, in this context are not sufficient to solve the problem.  I want to emphasise that so that people outside the House who want to make subscriptions will understand that every penny they can subscribe is needed.</P>
    <P>I am fully convinced that the International Red Cross Committee are capable of looking after the mechanics of getting the supplies to the people who most need them.  It is not true that Red Cross supplies and supplies going in through Fernando Po are subject to inspection by the Nigerian Government. It is true that the Nigerian Government offered to admit supplies by a different route subject to inspection. The International Red Cross are ferrying in supplies from Fernando Po and Caritas Internationalis are doing the same thing but from a different island.  I do not see any necessity to divert any of our supplies to the latter organisation.  The International Red Cross have served us well in the past and I see no reason to change our method of providing relief.  We are in touch with them and know what is happening.</P>
    <P>I thought I should be able to get out of this debate without any reference to my own family.  I did not wish to have that personal connection with this part of Africa introduced into the debate. Be that as it may, I wish to say on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government that we sincerely hope, as I am sure does every Deputy in the House and every person in the country, that this conflict will come to an end soon thus facilitating the delivery of food and medicines to the unfortunate people who are facing starvation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £32,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for Retired Pay, Pensions, Compensation, Allowances and Gratuities payable under Sundry Statutes to or in respect of Members of the Defence Forces and certain other Military Organisations, etc., and for Sundry Contributions and Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Extra-Statutory Children's Allowances and for Sundry Grants.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make provision for the expenditure which, it is anticipated, will arise in the current year in connection with the provision, in accordance with the Budgetary statement of the Minister for Finance, of free travel, electricity and television and radio licences for veterans of the War of Independence.</P>
      <P>Under the free travel scheme which came into operation on Monday 8th July, 1968, free travel is available in the State on the scheduled rail and road services of Córas Iompair Éireann and on the road services of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company and the County Donegal Railways (Joint Committee), subject to the same conditions and limitations as apply in the case of old age pensioners. A travel card will be issued to each applicant whose entitlement has been established&mdash;a number have already been issued&mdash;and the production of this card to an authorised official of the transport organisation will secure free travel for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free electricity allowance, which will come into operation from the 1st October, 1968, will consist of relief from the fixed charge for the Electricity Supply Board's domestic consumer tariff and up to 100 units of electricity free of charge in each two-monthly accounting period.  The allowance, as in the case of old age pensioners, will be available only to <Col N="578" /> registered consumers who are living alone or with certain specified classes of persons.</P>
    <P>The scheme for free television/radio licences came into operation on the 1st July, 1968.  Veterans who satisfy the conditions for the grant of a free electricity allowance are also eligible for a free television or radio licence. When a veteran's application for a free licence has been approved, he will be issued with a form and a letter of authority from my Department.  On production of the completed form and the letter of authority at his local post office, the appropriate free licence will be issued to him.  Persons eligible for free licences who hold a current licence which expires after 1st July, 1968, may obtain refunds in respect of the portion of the licence covering the period from 1st July, 1968, to the date of its expiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party wish to thank the Minister for acceding to the request of the Fine Gael Party for a considerable time past to provide these facilities for veterans of the War of Independence.  We are sorry it took the Government a year after the same facilities were provided for other old folk to provide them for the veterans of the War of Independence without a means test, but we are grateful he has taken this step.</P>
      <P>I am mindful of the fact that on 1st February last I addressed a question to the Minister asking him to take steps to permit old IRA pensioners at all times to travel on public transport free of charge, and I asked him to estimate the cost of providing such a facility.  I am sorry to say that at that time the Minister in his reply said:</P>
      <P>...It is not proposed to extend the existing free travel facilities as requested by the Deputy and it is not feasible to ascertain the estimated cost of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an example of the immense force of the Parliamentary Question. This is a demonstration that this is one of the most creative things in our democracy, that from a Parliamentary Question, from a good idea, can spring the necessary stimulation for a Minister, and through him, for a Department, <Col N="579" /> to think thoughts and to do good which perhaps, due to pressure of other distractions, they are not doing.  It would appear that as recently as 1st February last the Minister and his Department found it was not feasible to estimate the cost of doing what we in the Fine Gael Party were requesting. We are glad that the immense resources of the Department of Defence, which one would reasonably have considered to be over-staffed rather than under-staffed, have reached such a degree of efficiency and activity that they have found it feasible to estimate the cost of doing this necessary exercise.</P>
    <P>We think £32,000 is a very small amount to contribute from the wealth and resources of this country, which were to a great extent made possible by the sacrifices of the veterans and which we the younger generation today enjoy because of the decisions and sacrifices which the veterans made some 40 and 50 years ago.  It would be a very poor reflection on our society if we had not given this insignificant assistance to veterans in the winter of their day, so that the setting sun in their lives would at least be illuminated by this ray of kindness and of assistance to them.  We are doing no more than allowing them to travel free of charge on the public transport, than giving them electricity to cook their meals and to light and warm their homes, and a television licence if they have the wherewithal to purchase or to hire a television set; we would hope that, as this is being done, perhaps also from the goodwill and charitable disposition of the community, efforts will be made where necessary to provide television sets for veterans of the War of Independence and indeed for all old folk.  This is one of the greatest comforts which can be given to elderly people, people who are immobile, people who are confined to their homes.  A television set is one of the few boons of modern civilisation, and if we are giving them a television licence, while not making it possible for them to have a television set, it is an ease and something for which we should be grateful.  That is why we in the Fine Gael Party are only too glad <Col N="580" /> to support this Supplementary Estimate for the veterans of the War of Independence, people who have given a great deal, who ask for little, who often get less and even more frequently get nothing at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Supplementary Estimate on behalf of the Labour Party.  I am one of the people who believe that no matter what we provide for these people, it is little enough.  They are going from us and going fast, and the unfortunate thing about it is that very many of them feel they have been let down by the State.  I do not know why this is so.  I meet them from time to time, and the person who has applied for some little thing and has not got it always says that what he has done has not been recognised, and he hastens to point out that when he was taking part in the fight for independence, he never expected to get anything, and until he actually needed it did not ask for it.  He points out that other people who appear to be better off than he have got it, and it gives him a sense of grievance.  Therefore, I believe even if we make an error by giving to people whose claim to it might be doubtful, it is better to do that rather than not to give it to somebody who is entitled to it.</P>
      <P>The only thing that puzzles me about this is the figure estimated by the Minister, £32,000.  If my reckoning is correct, it makes no difference at all as far as the free travel is concerned, because, as was said by somebody else here previously, this is a question of giving a subsidy to CIE under a different heading.  It may not be possible for the Minister to decide how this works out, but if CIE require a subsidy of £1,200,000 and if, in fact, £20,000 of that is given under this heading, it means that CIE will not have to get that £20,000 under the other heading.  At least that is my reading of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister&mdash;maybe it would be difficult but I would urge him to do it if at all possible&mdash;to remove the regulation which states that pensioners are not allowed to travel at peak periods and around bank holiday <Col N="581" /> periods.  This is something which will irritate the veterans more than anything else.  I do not know whether it is possible to make these people more or less privileged card holders.  If it is possible I would suggest that for the little difference it would make, there should be no ban on these people using public transport at any time.  It was pointed out to some people already receiving it when they wanted to go to visit their friends around Christmas that they could not travel at that time.  That was a hardship.  It should be possible to have it changed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the ESB, I do not know how this will work out because it is so confined, and there are so many people who do not qualify, and so many people who qualify under another heading.  We are dealing with old people, people who are already around the 70 mark.  I think the figure quoted here over-represents the cost to the State.  This is an experiment and possibly the question of the people who qualify has not been taken fully into consideration.  Otherwise we could not possibly come up with a figure of £32,000.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ryan about the free television and radio licences.  I have been talking to some pensioners who think that the offer of a free licence is rather a cheap joke.  They find it hard enough to pay for heating and lighting without thinking of hiring or buying a television set.  They also point out that they cannot get it unless they live alone, or with their wife or children under 16 years, or with an invalid brother or sister.  I have been asked&mdash;as I am sure the Minister has been asked because he travels the same area&mdash;how they could buy a set.  Possibly the ADF or the ONE might be encouraged to raise a fund to assist these people who cannot buy a television set.  Again the figure here appears to be rather high.</P>
    <P>There is one reference which the Minister might explain to me because there will be doubt about it.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>When a veteran's application for a free licence has been approved, he will be issued with a form and a <Col N="582" /> letter of authority from my Department. On production of the completed form and the letter of authority at his local post office, the appropriate free licence will be issued to him.  Persons eligible for free licences who hold a current licence which expires after 1st July, 1968, may obtain refunds in respect of the portion of the licence covering the period from 1st July, 1968, to the date of its expiry.</P>

Perhaps the Minister would make this clear when he is replying, for my information and the information of the people concerned.</P>
      <P>I mentioned these people who are around the 70 mark.  I met a man last week who is hale and hearty.  He told me that he is only 63 years but that he will be able to avail of this free transport. He was a young soldier of Ireland and he is still hale and hearty.  He said that he appreciated this and that he would make use of it for many years to come.  We wholeheartedly support the ideas behind this proposal.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for me to say very much in concluding this debate.  It is true that Deputy Ryan put down a question, and he can claim credit for the concession if he cares to.  Since I entered this House, there has been continuous pressure for something to be done to ease the situation of the veterans of the War of Independence. The House can take it from me that so far as the administration of the Acts dealing with special allowances and other benefits made available by the <Col N="583" /> House is concerned, my Department goes out of its way to make the benefits available to the greatest possible number of applicants.</P>

It must be difficult for CIE at peak hours when there are so many working-class people who have to be carried.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. <Col N="584" /> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the decisions of the Government announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 23rd April last to increase the rates of non-contributory old age, blind, widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance, to increase the rates of various social insurance benefits and pensions and to modify the means test for old age pensions in the case of veterans of the War of Independence.  In addition, the Bill includes a number of provisions designed to amend and extend the social insurance and assistance schemes.  Some of these changes are consequential on the decisions announced in the Budget Statement. Others are the outcome of examination of existing provisions with a view to effecting improvements or eliminating anomalies which is carried out as a normal part of the work of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Bill is, of necessity, drafted mainly by way of amendments to existing Acts.  I have, therefore, had the explanatory memorandum which was issued with the Bill made as comprehensive and informative as possible so that it will be clear what each amendment really does where the text of the Bill itself is not self-explanatory.  I trust that Deputies will find it of assistance to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget increases in social assistance, which it is proposed to bring into operation at the beginning of August next, will give an extra 7/6d a week to all existing non-contributory old age, blind, widow and orphan pensioners, making the maximum personal rate of old age and blind pension £3 5s a week and the maximum personal rate of widow's pension £3 3s 6d a week.  In addition, an extra 2/6d a week will be given in respect of each qualified child of a pensioner making the weekly rate 12/6d for each of the first two children and 7/6d for each subsequent child.  These increases in the pension rates will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended in each case to give additional rates at the bottom of the scale which will be payable to persons who are outside the present means limit for pension.  Where there are qualified children, the means <Col N="585" /> limit is, of course, raised in respect of each qualified child.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are also being increased by 7/6d a week for the recipient himself.  A further 7/6d will be payable where there is an adult dependant and an additional 2/6d for each qualified child.  The maximum rate will then be £2 11s 6d for a single person and £4 17s 6d for a married couple resident in an urban area.  It will be £2 5s 6d for a single person and £4 9s 6d for a married couple resident outside an urban area.  These increases of unemployment assistance at the maximum will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions will come into operation at the beginning of January next.  They will provide an extra 7/6d a week for recipients of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, widow's (contributory) pension, orphan's (contributory) allowance and old age (contributory) pension.  There will also be an additional 7/6d a week for an adult dependant and an extra 2/6d a week for each qualified child.  The personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit will then be £3 5s a week for a single person and £5 17s 6d for a married couple.  A widow without children will get £3 5s a week while an old age (contributory) pensioner who is single will get £3 12s 6d, the rate for a married couple being £6 12s 6d.  The rates for children will be 15/6d for each of the first two and 10/6d for each subsequent child.  Certain rates of unemployment benefit which are payable after 156 days are the same as the maximum rates of unemployment assistance payable in urban areas.  As assistance rates are being increased from the beginning of August next, these particular rates of unemployment benefit will be increased at the same time.</P>
    <P>To meet the extra expenditure on the increased rates of benefits and pensions, an increase in the social insurance contributions payable by <Col N="586" /> employers and employees is necessary. In recent years, the Exchequer has had to bear considerably more than one-third of the cost of the social insurance scheme, and accordingly, and as forecast by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, the increase in contributions from employers and employees provided for in the Bill has been calculated so as to adjust the Exchequer's burden nearer to the traditional one-third.  It is proposed, therefore, to increase the rates of social insurance contributions, where all insurance benefits are covered, by 3s 4d a week, with lesser increases where only some of the benefits are covered. The increase of 3s 4d in the ordinary rate of men's contribution will be shared equally by the employer and employee and the total contribution will then be 21s 4d a week.  To this, however, must be added the existing contributions of 2s 1d paid by the employer in respect of occupational injuries insurance and of 1s paid under the redundancy scheme, of which 8d is by the employer and 4d by the employee.  The increase in the rates of voluntary contribution covering widows' and orphans' pensions will only be 6d, and will be 1s 2d in the contribution which covers also old age (contributory) pension.  A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.  On the basis of this year's estimates of expenditure plus the additional costs incurred by the provisions of the Bill, and taking account of the expected yield in a full year of the increases in contribution rates proposed, it is estimated that the Exchequer contribution will be close to one-third of the expenditure from the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployability supplement and of payments in respect of adult dependants and qualified children under the occupational injuries scheme are also being increased from January next.  These payments came into operation on 1st May, 1967 and were then equal to corresponding payments under the disability and unemployment benefit schemes but they were not increased when the latter were increased in January, 1968.  The increases now <Col N="587" /> proposed will restore the parity that originally existed.  It is estimated that the annual cost of these improvements in the occupational injuries scheme will be about £75,000.  It is not, however, necessary to increase the present contribution of 2s 1d to meet them.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a new benefit for old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, and for contributory widow pensioners aged 70 and over.  This benefit takes the form of an increase of pension of 45/- a week in respect of a prescribed female relative where the pensioner is so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and is living alone or has no other adult living with him who is capable of looking after him.  It will be necessary for the prescribed female relative to have a reasonably good employment record and to have specifically given up employment in order to look after the pensioner.  It is my intention to prescribe a daughter under the regulations to be made, as a daughter is most likely to be concerned in such cases.  There will, however, be power to prescribe other female relatives as satisfying the conditions for the payment, if it should ultimately be found desirable and feasible to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement announced that the Government as a token of recognition to those who served in the War of Independence had decided that Old IRA pensions or allowances would be disregarded completely in future when assessing means for old age pension purposes, Hitherto only the first £80 of these pensions or allowances was disregarded.  I have arranged to extend this total disregard to applicants for widows' pensions and unemployment assistance and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Up to 1966 a person receiving old age (contributory) pension or widow's (contributory) pension was disqualified for receiving the corresponding non-contributory pension.  In that year, statutory provision was made to enable the contributory pensioners mentioned to opt for the appropriate non-contributory pension, if they satisfied the conditions for its receipt and it would <Col N="588" /> be of advantage to them to do so.  The necessity for this arose because, as a result of increases in non-contributory pensions, some of the higher rates of these pensions exceeded some of the lower rates of contributory pensions. From August next, when non-contributory pensions are increased, until January next, when contributory pensions are increased, cases will arise where the non-contributory pension would be temporarily more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension.  It was never the intention that the provisions of the 1966 Act should operate in such circumstances and the Departmental machinery is not geared for short-term switching from one pension to the other and back again.  There is a provision in the Bill, therefore, to prevent switching from one pension to another where the advantage would be a temporary one only, but the right of a pensioner to switch where the advantage would be permanent will not be affected.</P>
    <P>At present, redundancy contributions are collected by the Department of Labour by means of a separate stamp. From the beginning of January next, the Bill will enable these contributions to be collected with social insurance contributions by means of a single stamp and the necessary adjustments to be made between the social insurance fund and the redundancy fund. This arrangement will be more convenient for employers and employees.</P>
    <P>A new superannuation scheme is being introduced by the Minister for Health to cover nurses and other persons employed in voluntary hospitals and by organisations providing district nursing services such as those providing Jubilee and Lady Dudley nurses.  When admitted to the scheme, the position of these employees will be similar to that of their counterparts in the hospital and district nursing services of local health authorities who are insurable for widows' and orphans' pensions and occupational injuries purposes only.  There is provision in the Bill, therefore, to enable the insurance position of employees being admitted to the new superannuation scheme to be modified so that they will be similarly insurable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> I do not propose to go into any greater detail at this stage as I feel sure that the explanatory memorandum will have given Deputies a good picture of the proposals in the Bill and of their effects.  It may, however, be helpful to Deputies if I summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side, there is £2,284,000 for old age and blind pensions, £406,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions and £810,000 for unemployment assistance, the total cost being £3½ million in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer. The gross cost of improvements on the social insurance side will be £5,719,000. Allowing for an increased annual income of £4,656,500 to be raised from the increases in rates of contributions, the cost to be met by the Exchequer will be £1,062,500 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending the Bill to Dáil Éireann and I ask for speedy and favourable consideration of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only disappointment of the Fine Gael Party in relation to this Bill is that it is not doing more.  I suspect that the Minister for Social Welfare is not that far distant from us in sharing that point of view, but he shares with the Government collective responsibility for the inadequacy of this measure.  To the Fine Gael mind&mdash; it has been said before and I repeat it &mdash;the old age pension should not be less than £4 a week and to offer less than £4 a week to an old age pensioner who has no means is to say that our society accepts that a person of 70 years or over must have a diet which is less than sufficient to maintain body and soul together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appreciate that this year there is an increase of 7/6d.  This brings it only to £3 5s.  That is 10/- per week less than any nutritional expert tells us is necessary to provide an elderly person with an adequate diet.  This is another example of the lack of thinking on the part of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health and Government agencies in general.  This is one of the reasons why we have in this country the highest rate of institutional care of any country in the world.  It is because we are not <Col N="590" /> providing people at home with sufficient diet to keep them in good health. It is because we are not supplying them with sufficient money to clothe themselves properly.  It is because we are not supplying them with sufficient money to enable them to provide food for themselves that we have a larger number of old people in hospitals and institutions in this country than there are in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>This is a simple fact.  Unfortunately, the Government have not yet grasped it and our people yet do not seem to comprehend it.  The simple fact is that we are the most institutionalised country in the world.  It is far dearer and less humane to say to any person &mdash;we will not keep you in good health but we will keep you in an institution. The result is that we have today three to four times the amount per week <i>per capita</i> that would be sufficient to keep the people in good health and ensure good care at home.</P>
    <P>Several social studies were undertaken by-qualified social workers in Dublin, Limerick and Cork, and the results published.  I think that to some extent they awakened some people in any event to the horror that exists in our midst of hungry old people and hungry families.  It has made people realise that destitution is a real thing in our land.  The pity is that the Government instead of resisting this standard do not admit that this is true and that they must do something about it instead of brushing this pitiful condition under the political carpet.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty and people in public life have a duty.  That is why we in Fine Gael are discharging this duty to convince our people of the need to devote more and more of our national resources to the relief of the misery which is rampant and unnecessary in our lives.  One-ninth of our population are in receipt of social welfare benefits of one kind or another and that one-ninth is deliberately kept at that low figure by various forms of means tests, many of which, Sir, were set five and ten years ago when incomes were larger nominally than they are now.  The various levels of means tests have not increased in line with variations in income.  The result is that widows with young families <Col N="591" /> who, some years ago, might have gone out on one or two days' work without impairing their pension are unable to go out and do that work now without having a severe cut in their pension if they claim wages at existing wage rates.</P>
    <P>We think this is a serious error and a serious reflection on the inability and disinclination of the Minister for Social Welfare to annually revise all means tests.  The situation is, Sir, that while one-ninth of our people are in receipt of social welfare contributions of one kind or another they receive only one-thirtieth of the wealth and resources of this nation.  That does not seem just.  It is not just.  It is grossly unfair. That it is in existence is something which this country should be ashamed of; that one-ninth of our people are by deliberate decision of the Government kept to a low level and receive only one-thirtieth of the total resources of this country.  That is not a redistribution of the wealth of a country that we should be proud of.  That is not using the art and skill of transfer payments in the way in which any modern democracy should use them.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael say that the old age pension should not be less than £4 a week.  That will not make any old age pensioner well-to-do or give him a degree of comfort which is not available to anybody else; £4 a week will give only an adequate diet and over and above that a paltry sum to meet whatever requirements arise as they do from time to time.  We also believe that there should be one year after another a very definite trend towards the introduction of old age pensions at 65 years of age.  This must come. Even with the Fianna Fáil Party unwilling to accept it, it must come. It is inevitable and if there is a change of Government it certainly will come about.  It may well be that one is disturbed by the magnitude of the burden that might be imposed in any one year if we were to move from 70 to 65 in one step.  The solution is to move year by year so that over a five-year period you would reduce the old age pension from 70 to 65.  That is the least we can achieve. <Col N="592" /> It should be possible to do more but with the Government disinclined to make this move, I would urge on them, if they are serious about entering into closer association with the EEC, that they must accept as a minimum requirement, what the Minister has on other occasions tried to make light of, the social obligations in the Treaty of Rome.  One hears about the onus, the obligations and restrictions on one's economy which are imposed by the Treaty of Rome and they are very real impositions but there is another imposition which one need have no fear of and that is the obligation of raising our social standards to a level compatible with those in other European countries.  There is no room for manoeuvring or misleading on the issue of the old age pension at 65.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessors have, from time to time, made light of other figures we have produced to show that, in Ireland, we are paying only about two-thirds of the amounts paid in roughly equivalent countries such as Austria and Italy for the social welfare classes.  On such occasions, the Minister has suggested there are different criteria in relation to social welfare benefit and that we cannot compare like with like because like does not exist.  The interesting thing, in relation to the Minister's comments, is that one of the most significant variations lies in the fact that Ireland is the only European country which includes the cost of institutionalised care for welfare recipients within the percentage of the gross national product which is set out as donated to the under-privileged.  As I said earlier, the high cost of institutional care is something we ought to look at.  It completely throws out of proper perspective any figures this country produces to suggest the picture is not as bad as might otherwise be argued.</P>
    <P>We are very sorry also that the widows in Ireland continue to be a forgotten section of the community.  We have some 120,000 widows and families and we ought to be ashamed of the manner in which we treat them.  Not only do we not give them benefits which would enable the mothers to discharge their primary duty of being at <Col N="593" /> home to rear young children but, if they go out to work, we punish them by giving them benefits lower than those available to other sections of the community.  I strongly urge on the Minister and appeal to him to have a special consideration for the widows&mdash; those on whom life has been hard, those upon whom fall the dual obligations of fatherhood and motherhood. We think these people have a first claim upon our resources and upon our care.  We are very disappointed indeed that special consideration has not been given to widows at this juncture.</P>
    <P>May we also express our grave disappointment that nothing has been done about the worst children's allowances in the world?  In some cases, they run at only one-sixth of the rates paid in other countries.  We should be particularly ashamed of the fact that we attempt to scale down, rather than to improve, children's allowances in cases of young families.  At long, long last, there is an awareness, apparently, on the part of the Government of the need to give better children's allowances to those in need and, if necessary, to do this by withdrawing children's allowances from those who do not need the small monetary payments at present made under the heading of &ldquo;Children's Allowances&rdquo;.  Apart from the fact that they are better off, they also receive various concessions in income tax.  Whatever else may be said about income tax, it is a fair indication of a person's capacity to pay because it is charged only against those who have the income upon which the tax is levied.</P>
    <P>However, we ought to be thoroughly ashamed of our children's allowances as they are paid at the moment.  We think it is not satisfactory enough to hear from the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;as we have been hearing for some time past&mdash;that he is studying the matter.  Fianna Fáil appear to forget that they have been continuously in office for the past 11 years and it is no answer to the multitude of problems besetting this country to say that they are studying the matter in depth or are closely examining the matter. Phrases of that kind are merely a device to achieve further and further procrastination. <Col N="594" /> The surest way of killing anything is to have it &ldquo;under active consideration&rdquo; by a Minister.  We are not at all encouraged by the assurance of the Minister that he has the matter of children's allowances under examination.</P>
    <P>We welcome the section of the Bill which provides for a pension of £2 5s a week where a family relative of a pensioner is giving attention to a disabled pensioner.  We would urge upon the Minister, however, not to prescribe a daughter under the regulations as the only person entitled to collect this benefit.  To say that, if found desirable and feasible to do so, ultimately the regulations may be amended to allow other relatives to get this benefit is not giving us much hope that, in our own time, the necessary improvement will be made.  There are very many family associations, of which the Minister must be aware, in which nieces, grand-daughters, cousins and other close associates of the family give up work in order to look after elderly relatives.  Whether or not it is in expectation of being remembered in the will, one does not know.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  If we bring in this much-needed supplementary benefit to the old age pensioner&mdash;that is really what it is because the person is living in the old age pensioner's house&mdash;we ought to do it without this rather unfortunate discrimination between a daughter and any other female relative.  The test should be whether or not care is being given.  If we apply the question whether or not employment is being given up, then these tests ought to be adequate enough rather than looking for birth certificates, and so on, to establish parenthood.  I would ask the Minister to take another look at this so that it would be feasible to provide for a wider range of relative than that of daughter alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Hilliard, in reply to a Parliamentary Question of mine on 1st February last, said it was not feasible to estimate the cost of providing free travel facilities for veterans <Col N="595" /> of the War of Independence and, on that account, the Minister said he was not prepared to grant free transport facilities to veterans of the War of Independence.  &ldquo;Feasible&rdquo; is a very dangerous word for the Minister to use. When he says a thing is not &ldquo;feasible&rdquo;, we suspect a day will come when he will find it quite feasible to do it&mdash;and he will then claim the political credit for it.  Let the Minister be aware that we shall hang around his neck that, on this day in July, 1968, he said he does not at present consider it feasible to have relatives other than daughters getting the benefit of £2 5s per week when they are looking after an old age pensioner&mdash;a person who would not be classified as such unless he were entitled to the old age pension under the very strict and stringent means test which we apply at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are delighted the Bill has been used to provide a single stamp for the redundancy and other social insurance contributions operated by the Minister's Department.  It is a reform we strongly advocated a couple of years ago and have continued to advocate ever since. I have not had time to check the records. I suspect the word &ldquo;non-feasibility&rdquo; was used around that time in relation to that simple reform.  We are glad it has now been found possible to do it.  Even though we have to wait until January, 1969, for its coming into operation, we are glad this simple thing is being done.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party also welcome the fact that a superannuation scheme will be introduced by the Minister for Health to cover nurses and other personnel employed in voluntary hospitals and by various district nursing associations.  This is something which we have been advocating for a long time and we welcome the scheme and the fact that the Minister is now taking the necessary power in this Bill to adjust the insurance contributions payable in respect of such people.  However, might I express the hope that the changes now being made in the conditions of service and employment of the nurses will not prejudice married nurses from returning to the nursing <Col N="596" /> profession if they want to, after marriage, at rates of pay equivalent to what they would be receiving if they had not married?</P>
    <P>At present we are beginning to suffer from something which has been afflicting nations all over the world, a shortage of qualified nurses.  The shortage of nurses in other parts of the world has caused people to look to Ireland for supplies of nurses and more and more intensive drives are being put into advertising and recruiting campaigns to attract nurses from our hospitals and public nursing services.  This already is having a damaging effect on our nursing, medical and hospital services and the Minister should take care that anything he does now by way of amending the terms of employment will not dig a further spadeful of trouble for the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>I should like to express the disappointment of the Fine Gael Party that the Minister has not taken steps to amend the outdated regulation which provides that where old age pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries have savings, a certain notional value of the savings must be taken into account in assessing means.  For many years past the first £25 of such savings may be disregarded in calculating means.  My information is and I think it is reasonable to accept this as being valid, that the £25 was fixed at a time when the cost of a funeral and burial was in or about £25.  Nowadays a decent funeral and burial costs about £75 and can cost more.  Our people with their natural respect for the dead and having a natural and proper horror of a pauper's grave like to provide a reasonable sum to meet their funeral expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the Bill is not confined to what is in the Budget and the Minister has made a number of provisions in the Bill for matters which were not in the Budget. The Chair will concede that I have deliberately avoided dealing with the administration of the Department with which we dealt last week.  However, I have no wish to trespass on your kindness or on the time of the House more than is necessary.  I would just ask the Minister to take a look at this way of assessing means where a pensioner has savings, because £25 has no relation to the cost of funerals or burials today. Having regard to the time-lag which appears to be inevitable in regard to any social welfare legislation, I would ask the Minister to provide that the first £100 be disregarded when assessing means on savings.</P>
      <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to amend the ridiculous law which assesses the remainder of the pensioner's means at ten per cent.  There are very few old age pensioners who are receiving as much as ten per cent or anything like it on their savings and to assume this notional value of their income is quite ridiculous and has no justification in finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases there are only a couple of hundred pounds left and there are very few elderly people with sufficient sophistication to understand what the purchase of a life annuity means.  However, all this is in the realm of high finance and the time has come for a very careful reappraisal of the whole basis of assessing means based on the savings of pensioners if they have been providing a little for the rainy day or for the many emergencies for which State welfare schemes do not cope.  They should be treated more leniently than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should just like to reiterate <Col N="598" /> that the Fine Gael Party are disappointed that this Bill is not achieving more, and that we are not doing sufficient for the many people who have given a great deal to the country who ask for very little and in many cases get a great deal less and in most cases nothing at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will certainly give this measure speedy and favourable passage through the Dáil. In the main, it provides for the social welfare proposals announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget. The Minister has given us an accurate estimate of the cost of these improvements in social insurance and social assistance.  I suppose, like Deputy Ryan, we could all say that we are disappointed that they are not more. There could be more but the entire responsibility lies not with the Minister but with the community as a whole and our attitude towards the people who have been so eloquently described by Deputy Ryan as the people who are dependent completely on the £3 a week, those in receipt of unemployment assistance, non-contributory widows' pensions and those dependent on the miserable home assistance that county councils dole out to them.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party have the right attitude and we have displayed it every time there have been proposals for improving the welfare benefits by voting in Dáil Éireann for the taxes that the various Ministers for Finance proposed in order to finance many of the increases.  Last year, and the year before and the year before that, we had no hesitation, once the Minister made his proposals known, in announcing that we proposed to support the tax proposals in order that social welfare could be improved.  On this occasion we approved of an increase of 2d per packet of 20 cigarettes, an increase in the price of petrol and an increase in the prices of certain types of drink.  This we gladly did and if the Minister had proposed double these increases, we would have found it difficult, if not impossible, to vote against his proposals. If the taxes I have mentioned give us these increases, they are to be welcomed, certainly by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> I think we should be prepared to make a breakthrough as far as old age pensioners, widows, those who are sick or on the dole are concerned.  If we looked in other directions, we could get money by way of taxation in order to ensure that they will have a standard even better than that demanded by the Fine Gael Party of £4 a week.  I do not think that £4 a week would be at all sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good start but we have never had established a proper financial standard for the people about whom we are talking.  I do not think that in 1968 the sum of £4 would be sufficient.  In the past few years we have had consistent increases, the maximum being last year when it was 10s per week.</P>
      <P>Mark you, this is 1968 and still the non-contributory old age pensioner has only £3 5s per week.  Sixty years ago he had 10/-.  All we have done, therefore, is to multiply by six.  If we have regard to prices, wages and salaries, we have not done a great deal for the old age pensioner.  I know the Minister is bursting to get up and remind me of the time when I was Minister for Social Welfare.  Fair enough: I am not here to score political points.  All I am trying to show is that, whilst the initiative lies with the Minister for Social Welfare, he has not the full responsibility. The full responsibility for these people lies with the community itself and there should be an acceptance by those who are comfortable, or relatively well off, that they will have to give more if these people are to have a proper standard and if they are to live as ordinary, decent human beings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many more people who could be covered by social welfare.  I made a plea here by way of Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking for some scheme of social welfare for spinsters, those women who have always stayed at home looking after parents.  At the age of 45, 50 or 55, they find themselves without any resources whatsoever. <Col N="600" /> They are not eligible for sickness benefit, unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  The only establishments they can approach are the boards of assistance.  From our experience we know what these boards can afford.  We know the small amounts they give.  The Minister should, through his Department, formalise some sort of scheme to provide for these people.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of ourselves as far as our system of home assistance is concerned.  Home assistance is given to people who have no resources and who are not eligible for any of the social welfare benefits.  As far as I am aware, the average payment is about 25/- to 30/- a week.  That is a scandal. The responsibility for home assistance was put on the county councils by the Public Assistance Act of 1939.  I suggest to the Minister that he should seriously consider the establishment of some form of national assistance, which would be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare, in order to ensure there would be a sufficient sum given to these people and in order to ensure uniformity in payments.  I suggest each local authority should contribute annually to the Minister some sum in accordance with a prescribed scale.  The Minister's Department could then distribute the money. As it is, the least thought of money is that in the field of home assistance. The Minister would be well advised to evolve some sort of scheme of national assistance such as that which operates in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made other improvements, more in the nature of tidying up than anything else.  He referred to the contributions and he said that the financial arrangements were such that the three parties involved&mdash;the Minister, the employer and the employee&mdash;paid roughly one-third. It is fair that the State should pay one-third but I do not think it is fair that the employer should get away with one-third.  We have always maintained on these benches that the employer has a greater responsibility towards his employees than he has appreciated up to the present.  I have cited instances of inanimate objects towards which employers exercise a greater responsibility <Col N="601" /> than they do towards their employees.  If a machine is not in use, it has to be cleaned and oiled.  If premises are not in use, they have to be repainted and kept in repair.  There is no similar provision in relation to employees.  When they are sick, they get £2 17s 6d a week.  If they are unemployed, they also get £2 17s 6d.  I believe these rates could be stepped up if we got more from the employer.  That would not be unusual because in most European countries the employer pays a far bigger share into the fund than does the State or the employee.  I do not think we should be afraid to tackle the proper financing of the Social Insurance Fund by requiring more from the employer, who should have a greater financial responsibility for his employees.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has given consideration to a proposal by the Labour Party over the last five or six years.  It was, indeed, one of the planks in our election platform as far as social welfare is concerned.  Have we ever thought in terms of graded contributions and graded benefits?  At the moment the man with £10 a week pays 11/6 or 12/- as his share.  The insured person with £20 a week pays the same amount.  Both get the same benefit. This £2 17s 6d is a big come-down for the man with £10 a week, but it is an even bigger come-down for the man with £20 a week.  There should be some grading in respect of contributions and benefits.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to have another look at the excellent provision he has made for those who look after old age pensioners.  This provision is welcomed by the Labour Party.  However, like Deputy Ryan, I do not know why it should be confined to daughters.  It can be established who looks after an old age pensioner in the circumstances described by the Minister, and a sister or a relative should not be debarred from obtaining this allowance of 45/-a week.  Neither do I know why it should be confined to a female relative. I know cases in which brothers of old age pensioners have this particular task and they have no incomes or pensions of any kind.  But they look after old age pensioners and look after them <Col N="602" /> very well.  I do not know why these people should not qualify.  I do not think the Minister is bound by the section; he can determine the type of person by way of regulation.  He should examine the matter a little further; if he does, he will discover that this should not be confined to daughters of old age pensioners.  Other relatives perform this task and, in many cases, neighbours do it.</P>
    <P>The total cost is £4½ million.  That is fairly easily got when one remembers the proposals of the Minister for Finance and the way in which the country accepted the increased taxes when they knew exactly where the money was going.  In this case the bulk of the taxes in this year's Budget was devoted to social welfare.  As I said in the beginning, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, if taxes similar to those proposed in the last Budget were proposed it would Se impossible for us in the Labour Party to resist them knowing that they were going to deserving people such as are catered for in this measure.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the passage of this measure.  Comments have been made on the Bill by previous speakers, some of them favourable and some critical.  Naturally, it is easy to criticise.  I think there are some good points in this measure but there is one point in particular that I want to make before the debate concludes.  As the Minister appreciates, in rural areas such as the congested counties there is the situation, which has existed for a long number of years, where old people are living alone.  They may be old age pensioners or persons in receipt of widows' pensions.  In many cases their dwellings are situated along boreens or two or three miles up a side-road. When the investigation officer discovers that an applicant for a pension has, perhaps, £1,000, £1,500 or £2,000 in the bank or post office, he comes to the conclusion that the applicant is extremely wealthy and not entitled to the social welfare pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be very familiar with the type of case I have in mind. The Minister comes from a rural constituency <Col N="603" /> similar to mine.  He is aware that the money that the investigation officer is told about, on inquiry, has been sent by members of the family, mainly from England or, as would apply in the Minister's constituency more than in mine, from Scotland. Seven or eight members of a family may emigrate and may like to help the people at home.  Subsequently, some member of the family may return to the old home and try to eke out an existence there on the smallholding and perhaps go occasionally to England or take work with the county council in order to supplement his income. The fact that members of families go away and send home sums of money for the father or mother to lodge in the bank or post office until such time as they return to Ireland has the effect of depriving applicants of pensions.  It is regrettable that applicants should have to undergo the humiliation of cross-examination by these investigation officers when one thinks of the hardships and difficulties that confront these people all their lives.</P>

      <P>I shall not ramble on. I want to make one point to the Minister, if you will allow me, in about two minutes.  In these congested areas it would be cheaper to grant the maximum amount of pension on application rather than have investigation officers investigating the means of the applicants. We all know that the people are fleeing the land fast enough.  There would be some incentive for these old people and their families to remain in these congested districts if maximum pension were granted without a means test.  No additional expenditure would be involved.  The saving in the salaries and travelling expenses of investigation officers would be sufficient to offset the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Ryan, the Fine Gael spokesman <Col N="604" /> on social welfare, has dealt with this measure in its general terms and, indeed, very fully.  I rise merely to deal with two points that need attention.  I do not propose to take up very much time.</P>
      <P>The first point that I want to make and which I regret has not been dealt with in the Bill, is the question of emigrants.  Emigration has been a problem in this country for a great many years, indeed, I suppose, since the Famine.  Emigration is likely to continue to be necessary for a certain percentage of our people in the foreseeable future.  Emigration has a twofold disadvantage: it affects the people who emigrate and the people who remain at home.  Appeals have been made on a number of occasions in this House to the Minister and to the Minister for External Affairs to help societies or organisations such as those who run the Irish Centre in London.  The Minister has pointed out the difficulties that lie in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration affects the people who remain at home and, in particular, the old people who remain at home.  They are stricken with the disease which I may call loneliness.  Old persons who are left at home by sons or daughters who have to emigrate find themselves with no immediate relative to look after them or to console them or to provide them with family comforts.  I come immediately to the point.  At the present time if the recipient of a non-contributory old age pension decides to go to England to join a married son or daughter he forfeits his right to receive the non-contributory pension.  I appealed to the Minister last year and have appealed to him since I became a Member of this House to change that regulation and to provide by legislation that a person who attains the age of 70 years and who goes across the water to enjoy the company, and to have the benefit and care, of a son and daughter there will be entitled to continue to draw the old age pension which he or she is qualified to receive as long as they remain at home.  There may be administrative difficulties in doing this but I do not think they are real.  I concede that there is a means test in respect of the non-contributory old age <Col N="605" /> pension but nobody in this country qualifies for the non-contributory old age pension until he or she has reached the age of 70 years.  Before he receives that pension, he is subjected to a means test.  It is ascertained that he is not in possession of any wealth or any property. The only way in which his means could vary would be if he were to inherit a legacy or some wealth.</P>
    <P>I am speaking of the old person receiving a non-contributory old age pension at home who is living alone in very lonely circumstances, maybe in an out-of-the-way place such as described by other Deputies, particularly Deputy O'Hara.  In order to retain his pension, that old person has three courses open to him: (1) to remain in this isolated loneliness in the back of beyond and perhaps ultimately be found dead; (2) to go into a local institution commonly known even yet as the county home&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>You would want a lot of &ldquo;pull&rdquo; to get in there now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and thereupon become a burden on the ratepayers and taxpayers and have it cost the community in general much more than the old age pension to maintain him there; and (3) to go across to a son or daughter in Great Britain, perhaps a daughter married to a person who has never been in this country, and become a person with no means absolutely dependent on the generosity of the British husband who married his daughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this measure leaves this House, we should decide here and now to pay a non-contributory old age pension to a person qualified for it even if that person emigrates to Great Britain or elsewhere, but particularly Great Britain because that is where the problem mostly arises, provided that person emigrates to Britain to join a son or daughter.  If there are any difficulties or if we fear that these old people who go to Great Britain may suddenly become wealthy and enjoy incomes which would exclude them from the benefits of the Old Age Pension Acts if they remained at home, <Col N="606" /> then I have no hesitation in saying we should have a couple of social welfare officers stationed in Great Britain who would go around and check up on these people's means as they do at home.</P>
    <P>There is no use closing our eyes to emigration and its problems.  Down through the years it has created difficulties in family life and so on.  But it is a cruel state of affairs that an old person should be consigned to utter loneliness at home or to the coldness of a country home when the person could go across to Great Britain and join a son or daughter.  I do not consider it any answer for the Minister to say there is nothing to prevent him going across and joining a son or daughter but he will not get the old age pension.  We know, human nature being as it is, these old people are not prepared to forgo their old age pension. They regard it as something they have earned and something to which they are entitled.  Even with the penalty of being deprived of the company, companionship and care of their own kith and kin, they are not prepared to forgo the pension.</P>
    <P>As recently as this week&mdash;may be this is what has prompted me to raise this question again&mdash;I had a query from one of my constituents who proposed going over to join a daughter in England.  Before she went over, she wanted to ensure she would be entitled to the old age pension.  I do not know how much it would take to keep one or two social welfare officers in Great Britain, but it would be money reasonably well spent.  I want to emphasise that we have this problem of emigration. We are not prepared to face up to it by appointing welfare officers to Great Britain.  We are not prepared to face up to it by continuing to pay the old age pension to people who are in receipt of it here but who are forced by family circumstances to join sons and daughters in Great Britain who were themselves forced by economic circumstances here to emigrate in order to earn a living.  It is as simple as that. I make a sincere appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  I am sure that if he does, he will find he has the <Col N="607" /> House behind him, even if it does entail some small expenditure to implement my suggestion.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is in reference to the difficult problem of the final 5s in old age pensions, that is, the 5s only payable to people who have no means whatever.  This is giving a lot of trouble.  I do not know what it would cost to pay this 5s to every old age pensioner, irrespective of whether he has any means or not.  Maybe this final 5s, as I will call it, was meant to catch the pensioner who transfers his farm to a son or daughter and reserves the right of residence, support and maintenance, but I want to tell the Minister it does not catch that person. There are ways and means of getting around that.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that a person who has accumulated a couple of hundred pounds for an emergency should be deprived of this final 5s.  As the Minister knows, the income from that couple of hundred pounds is negligible.  The person who transfers his farm to his son is entitled to take the precaution of retaining a right of residence, support and maintenance in the deed of transfer if he cannot think of any better or more effective way of securing that he will be supported and maintained during the rest of his life.  There is of course an equally effective way but that is beside the point.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that a person may transfer his farm to his son and protect himself but on the other hand an old person living in lodgings, perhaps, who has accumulated a couple of hundred pounds or even £50 &mdash;I shall not come to the marginal figure of £25 or whatever it is&mdash;and wants to keep that between himself and destitution in order to provide a decent burial is deprived of the final 5/-.  It is an objectionable provision in the social welfare code and I think it should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Those are the only points I want to make.  I feel equally strongly on both of them.  The Minister should give greater consideration to the position of emigrants and also to the position of the person with a small amount of money in the bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is anxious to get in as there are a number of other matters to be completed tonight.  First, I think the increase in the contribution, while we welcome the increase in benefit, is pretty steep.  The amount being paid for a stamp now is substantial.  Employees have been complaining to me that at present they do not believe they are getting value for their money.  Perhaps if they live to be 70, they may.  When wages are being negotiated, the employer nearly always mentions, along with wages, what it costs to stamp a card. The employee is doing the same.  While the Minister wants to make it a three-way arrangement, one-third each for the employer, employee and the State, it is a bit rough to increase the stamp by a further 3/4d a week.  I suppose it is no use hoping that anything can be done about it at this stage.</P>
      <P>While the Minister talks about a new superannuation scheme which is being introduced by the Minister for Health to cover nurses and others in voluntary hospitals, is he aware of the rather peculiar situation which has built up in local authority employment in respect of what are known as minor officers, ambulance drivers, wards-maids and so on who might be stamping cards for many years before being created minor officers and then ceasing to stamp cards?  When these people come to retire at 65, they retire with nothing except whatever gratuity or pension&mdash;if they qualify for it&mdash;the local authority gives them.  Can the Minister do anything to allow these people, by voluntary contributions or otherwise, to qualify for a pension?  I know some of them who have not been officers long enough to qualify for a sizeable gratuity or for a pension and have been too long officers to enable them to qualify for the old age pension and are completely out so far as unemployment benefit is concerned between 65 and 70.  It is too bad that this should be so and I am sure that if there is any way in which the Minister can help he will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He referred in his introductory remarks to something that is a good idea.  He proposes to introduce a new payment for somebody who has a <Col N="609" /> dependent relative or an adult living with a pensioner.  For instance, a female relative living with a pensioner who is so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention would get a payment of £45 a year.  There is a rather peculiar phrase used here.  Has the Minister given attention to it?  It says: &ldquo;It will be necessary for the prescribed female relative to have a reasonably good employment record and to have specifically given up employment in order to look after the pensioner.&rdquo;  What is &ldquo;a reasonably good employment record&rdquo;? Is this another ten year sentence?  If so, the Minister should say so.  We had this before with a domestic servant and the female farm worker who were going to get unemployment benefit and suddenly we discovered they had to have ten years stamps before they could draw the benefit.  If that is the situation here, the Minister should say ten years; otherwise, there will be complaints at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of switching from the contributory widow's pension to the non-contributory widow's pension, if the latter is greater.  There is a problem here which the Minister mentioned.  It is that if for a temporary period the non-contributory pension is greater, it is not proposed to allow that switch to happen.  Some provision should be made.  I do not think a contributory pension should at any time fall under a non-contributory pension. There should be some way of supplementing the contributory pension to bring it over the other, rather than the reverse.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate was going through, I referred to the fact that there was too much delay in dealing with old age pensions and I mentioned a case of somebody who applied 15 months ago and had not received payment, that there was a hold-up because there was a transfer of some property he had.  He transferred that property last November. After the Estimate discussion, I telephoned the Minister's Department and found that on 30th November last, with effect from that date, the man was granted a pension of 47s 6d a week. The man who did not hear one word about it of course was the old age pensioner himself.  The Department <Col N="610" /> officials knew about it and knew he should get a book and that there was money due to him but nobody thought it was his job to tell the person concerned about it.  Neither did they tell me, although they had numberous letters on the files from me asking about this pension.  This is the sort of thing that gets a good Department a bad name.  I raised the matter last week and since then it has been satisfactorily dealt with.  If somebody is entitled to something, he should get it immediately and should not have to wait.</P>
    <P>I do not believe sufficient information is given to applicants for social welfare benefits, particularly disability benefit.  If for any reason somebody's claim has been held up or a reduction is made, instead of the lengthy forms which the Department issue covering every eventuality, I think there should be a series of small forms dealing specifically with one or two matters.  If such forms were sent out, the ordinary person would know what they meant but if they get a form over a foot long, littered with clauses and subclauses, suggesting they are disqualified for a, b, c, or d, it is very difficult to explain what has happened and why they have not got their money.  This is only a matter of detail but it seems that forms are being used which were invented at the foundation of the State, or worse still, were borrowed from the British when they left.</P>
    <P>When applications are being sought for a type of benefit, would it be possible to have a simplified form asking the person's name, address and, if necessary, age and insurance number and whether or not he has dependants and whatever particulars are needed after that.  It is shocking that somebody seriously ill should get a form over a foot long asking dozens of questions which do not appear to be relevant.  I see no reason for this&mdash;perhaps there is.  These are matters which the Minister could bring up to date.  If he sets somebody in his Department the job of going through the forms being issued for these benefits and if he has to spend six months in bringing them up to date, it would be very much appreciated later.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the debate. <Col N="611" /> While we appreciate that an effort is being made to bring benefits up to more reasonable figures, we regret that an out-of-date system is used not alone by this Government but by previous governments, to pay benefit from a date forward rather than immediately after the Budget.  That is a mistake. We are told a lot of detail has to be gone through making it impossible to have the benefits paid any sooner, but to pay the social assistance people from 1st August and the benefit people from 1st January causes a certain amount of confusion.  Many old people, and indeed many young people, will want to know why so-and-so who did not stamp a card can have an increase in benefit now while they are stamping cards and have not got it.  This is a matter of detail.  Eventually some Minister will have to get around to fixing an earlier date for paying benefit which is agreed to in the Budget, and I think the present Minister is the right man to start.</P>

Consequently, while I shall endeavour to deal with most of the points raised, I will not be unduly long in my windingup speech.  Deputy Ryan decried the fact that more is not given.

      <P>It brings me to the same point I am always making: we will never arrive at a figure which everybody will agree is sufficient.  Perhaps this question of how the public are coming to look on these payments has a considerable influence on the whole question.  As Deputies know, originally the pension was looked on as a means of contributing towards the upkeep of old people at the time of life when they were entirely dependent on their relatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the original concept of the pension.  It was originally intended as a supplement to the upkeep of people who were dependent on their relatives at a time when their relatives looked on it, perhaps more than they do today, as a responsibility to the old people in their declining years to give them the maximum comforts of life which they themselves got from their parents when they were children and being reared.  As I said here before, I will always strive to bring these amounts up as far as possible, as far as resources will permit.  I would never hope to create a situation where relatives will say to their old people: &ldquo;You are on your own now. You are being paid by the State.&rdquo;  I would always hope that the affection which must necessarily bind children and their parents to the grave will always exist.  I would not like that any callousness would be engendered as the result of social welfare payments which would put old people in a position where they would be looked at as no longer requiring the assistance, attention and affection of their relatives, which is much greater than anything I as Minister for Social Welfare could give them.  Nevertheless, I do not dispute with those who say that these benefits should continue to increase.</P>
      <P>No matter how any person may try to belittle the increase in the expenditure under the heading of social welfare, he cannot ignore the plain fact that the figures show an astronomical increase.  I was looking at the percentage reduction in expenditure <i>vis-à-vis</i> tax revenue.  In 1954-55 it was 22.5 per cent of tax revenue, and today it is 17.3 per cent of £282 million, which is a great deal more than 22.5 per cent of £89 million.  Therefore the comparison is by no means relevant.</P>

      <P>Turning again to the percentage of the national income, <Col N="613" /> we find that whereas in 1955-56 it was 5.6 of £159 million approximately, it is 7.1 per cent of £902 million today, which again is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a most favourable comparison.  The remarkable progress made in regard to expenditure going to the weaker classes should be evident even to those who sometimes use percentages as comparisons to show we are not devoting enough of the national income, enough of the GNP, enough of the tax revenue, towards social welfare.  The same applies to the gross national product; the proportion there is 4.7 per cent.  I am not quoting particular years.  I am taking the figures as far back as I have them, and they show an increase all the way up.  While the percentage <i>vis-à-vis</i> gross national product has increased, the gross national product itself has increased out of all recognition of what it was ten years ago.  Therefore the figures are most favourable in every respect.</P>

      <P>The new feature in the Bill, which is not covered in the Budget and relates to the case of female relatives, is a cautious beginning to the solution of an important problem.  Deputy Ryan said I said it was not feasible. I did not say that.  I said I had made provision in the Bill to extend this if I thought it feasible in my experience of its working.  What I actually said was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to prescribe a daughter under the regulations to be made, as a daughter is most likely to be concerned in such cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was not feasible.  Deputy Tully asked what record would be required for insurance. First of all, I would prefer if there were no insurance record.  As I say, this is a cautious beginning to a problem which has been crying out for solution for some time like a number of other things in the social welfare field.  In doing this I am meeting two problems at the same time: first of all, there is the question of those who have to give up their employment to look after their old people and find they cannot draw unemployment benefit because they are not available for work, and who cannot, for the same reason, draw unemployment assistance.  It covers that case to some extent and also makes provision for the people who have to be taken care of, and, as many Deputies pointed out, are being prevented from being sent to an institution for care.  I can actually say that the contribution requirement will be 156 contributions over the preceding five years.  That is done obviously for the same purpose as it was done in the other Bill to which Deputy Tully referred. We must lean towards those with continuous and long records of insurance rather than towards those who have not got uninterrupted employment.  I think that is a very reasonable ground on which to base this.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take into consideration those people who have such a record, or a better record, but who for a number of years have been looking after their aged parents and therefore would be out of benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that would be a very feasible point.  I do not want to say too much about it because under the regulations it may not work out that way.  The Deputy knows that is so.  Deputy Ryan referred to my assurance about children's allowances. I want to reassure him that <Col N="615" /> I am seriously considering bringing in selective children's allowances which would make more generous provision for the needy section of the community. I am engaged on that now. Deputy Corish referred to the question of pay related contributions.  That is one of the things which I have in a memo currently before the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the question of home assistance payments is the weakest link in the whole welfare field.  They are not administered by my Department.  They are administered by the various local authorities to which we contribute. There is not any standard uniformity of means test and the payments are not very generous.  This is something on which I have also submitted some particulars, and about which I shall have more to say later.</P>
      <P>The question of the assessment of savings was raised by Deputy Ryan. The £25 which is disregarded in an old person's savings is referred to as being for funeral expenses.  I do not think that was the original concept, which was to allow them to have some savings which would not be calculated as means.  I pointed out to Deputy Ryan in answer to a question before this, that this £25 which is supposed to be for burial expenses would be inadequate today for that purpose.  Let me remind the House that if £100 is put aside by some old person for that purpose, £25 is disregarded and the other £75 is assessed at five per cent. This will not prevent them from getting the full old age pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not operate to prevent them from getting the maximum without taking into consideration the question of means.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the nil means section.  He suggested that we should extend the 5s. to the nil means class <Col N="616" /> but this brings us back to square one. The 5s. given by my predecessor to the nil means section was in response to the pleadings of many people, and Deputies also, that there is a marked difference between the categories of old age pension recipients, which is true. There is definitely a category which is set apart: those who live alone, those who have no property and no means, as compared with those living with reasonably comfortable and well off relatives.  They are in better circumstances generally.  Pleas have been made time and again for doing something towards the betterment of the lives of the worst off section, the nil means section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To operate that nil means section which every Deputy must recognise definitely sets out a category requiring more attention than others, the line had to be drawn somewhere. If £10 were being disregarded, I would be asked about someone who had £10 2s 6d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing that was not factual.  The 5s. increase granted this year goes to every old age pensioner, and there are the other &ldquo;perks&rdquo; which we have been able to bring in such as the cheaper electricity. They apply to these categories more than to the better off sections.  We are continuously trying to improve the lot of the worst off sections.  It is a recognition of the fact that there are many old age pensioners in a much worse position than others, and requiring a good deal more attention, that we implemented these things at all.  We must draw the line somewhere and the <Col N="617" /> marginal cases will always be taken up as an example of victimisation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the provision to prevent people shuttling in and out of the non-contributory pension. From August to January the contributory pension will in few cases be less than the non-contributory pension.  I do not think Deputy Tully adverted to the fact that not many would be involved in this category.  It refers only to those who are not getting the full contributory old age pension.  Many of those who are not would not satisfy the means test, so the number involved would not be great, and the amount of work involved would be tremendous if we did not take this precaution to ensure that it did not happen.</P>
      <P>No one adverted to the fact that in the case of the occupational injuries payments I have taken the liberty of giving the 5/- as well as the 7/6d as from January next to them to bring them up to parity with what was intended when the Occupational Injuries Bill was before the House.  Deputies will find in the Bill that 12/6d is payable to that category from next January.  They did not get the 5/-because the Bill came in before the 5/-increase became operative.  The 5/- increase became operative in January and did not apply to them.  I am proud of the fact that I have done this, but no one paid the slightest tribute to me for granting the full amount of 12/6d to that category.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a plea for the granting of pensions outside the jurisdiction of the State.  This has come up time and again.  I am afraid quite a lot would be involved.  Deputy Fitzpatrick admitted that while we have a means test, this would not be easy, and would not justify appointing social welfare officers to operate in England for the purpose of pursuing old people who go over to live there.  Indeed, I would much prefer to see them taking advantage of the provision, which we have here, for people taking care of them and somebody coming home to look after them.</P>

      <Col N="620" /> Go léifear an Bille an Dara Uair anois.</P>
    <P>I move:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <P>Is é cuspóir an Bhille seo cumhachtaí a tugadh do Ghaeltarra Éireann trí bliana ó shin a leathnú.  Baineann ceann de na cumhachtaí sin le tionscail ina nglacann Gaeltarra páirt i gcomhar le daoine eile agus baineann an dara ceann le deontais a thugann Gaeltarra do dhaoine gan dul i bpáirtíocht leo.</P>
    <P>Tá uasteorainn £2,000 leis na deontais a thugann Gaeltarra chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.  Táimid sásta anois gur ceart an uasteorainn sin a ardú go £5,000 agus tá leasú dá réir sa Bhille.  Chomh maith leis sin má bhímid sásta amach anseo gur ceart deontais níos airde fós a thabhairt, beidh cumhacht agamsa faoin mBille, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, uasteorainn nua a údarú gan dul thar £10,000.</P>
    <P>Is leis an nGaeltacht amháin a bhaineann an chumhacht atá ag Gaeltarra páirt a ghlacadh le daoine eile i reachtáil tionscal.  Tá áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, áfach, ina bhfuil tionscail faoi chúram Ghaeltarra &mdash; Ard an Rátha agus An Bhroclais i gCo.  Dhún na nGall agus Cloch na Rón i gCo.  na Gaillimhe &mdash; agus, ar ndóigh, tig le Gaeltarra, as a stuaim féin, na tionscail sin a fhorbairt sna hionaid ina bhfuil siad.  Seachas dul ar aghaidh mar sin b'fhéidir go dtarlódh go n-oirfeadh sé do Ghaeltarra dul i gcomhar le daoine eile agus, chuige sin, tá an chumhacht a luaigh mé á leathnú go dtí na hionaid áirithe sin fosta.</P>
    <P>Níl ach an dá leasú sin sa Bhille ach b'fhéidir gur mhaith leis na Teachtaí roinnt eolais a fháil faoin dul chun cinn atá déanta ag Gaeltarra leis na cumhachtaí atá á leathnú.  Do na cásanna ina dtugtar deontais suas go £2,000, bhí £50,000 san iomlán ceadaithe go dtí 31 Márta, 1968, agus táthar ag súil le fostaíocht do níos mó ná 100 duine breise dá thoradh sin.</P>
    <P>As na tionscail ina nglacfaidh Gaeltarra páirt i gcomhar le daoine eile is <Col N="621" /> cásanna iad seo ina bhfuil obair thógála ar siúl:</P>
    <P>Ambler of Donegal Ltd. a sníomhfaidh snáthanna i nGaoth Dobhair don tionscal fíodóireachta,</P>
    <P>Connemarble Ltd. a dhéanfaidh próiseáil ar mharmar Chonamara in aice leis an Spidéal,</P>
    <P>Westsea Ltd. a bheidh ag stóráil gliomach agus ag próiseáil portán i Ros an Mhíl agus ag iascaireacht chomh maith, agus</P>
    <P>Óstáin na hÉireann Teo. a bheidh ag reachtáil óstáin nua in aice leis an Daingean.</P>
    <P>Meastar go mbeidh fostaíocht do suas le 100 fear agus 80 cailín sna tionscail sin.  Níl ansin ach an tús: tá idirbheartaíocht ar siúl fosta do thionscail eile ach ní thig liom eolas ina dtaobh a scaoileadh go fóill.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur leor a bhfuil ráite agam chun a léiriú go bhfuil feidhm éifeachtach á baint ag Gaeltarra as na cumhachtaí atá i gceist agus gur ceart iad a leathnú faoi mar atá beartaithe sa Bhille.  Dá réir sin iarraim ar an Dáil glacadh leis an Dara Céim den Bhille.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, paragraph (e), lines 32 and 33, to delete all words after &ldquo;section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall be displayed by the presiding officer in and in the precincts of polling stations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) of section 1 proposes that copies of the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of section 1 may be displayed in or in the precincts of polling stations.  The statement referred to in paragraph (a) is a statement set out in the Appendix to section 1, and that statement is a statement which purports to explain to the electors the Third and Fourth Amendment Bills of the Constitution.  In my opinion, as paragraph (e) of section 1 stands, it would be open to any political Party or anybody entitled to enter the polling booth to display the statement referred to in the Bill in the polling booth and at the entrance to the polling booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of us who have any experience of elections know that nothing gives rise to more heat on election day and to more trouble than the display of Party election literature in and about polling booths.  The Minister must be aware that even the wearing of Party emblems of personation agents, sub-agents and others entitled to enter the polling booths, gives rise to heat and bad feeling and not infrequently calls <Col N="624" /> for the intervention of the garda on duty.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to the display of what I describe as the official explanation card in the booth or in the precincts of the booth.  As a matter of fact, I think it is desirable that such information should be available in case anybody at that late hour has not discovered what the referendum is all about but I am apprehensive lest in putting this provision in the Bill we confer on Party agents the right to post up Party literature in the polling booths because, as surely as one Party posts up literature in the booths, so surely will the opposite Parties claim the right to do likewise.  This amendment cannot, I think, be regarded as in any way controversial.  It merely proposes that the statement referred to in the section shall be displayed by the presiding officer only and if the statement explaining the Bills is to be displayed by the presiding officer only, then we can rest assured that it will not be Party literature.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as arguing that the section has been drafted in this particular way to enable Fianna Fáil Party literature to be posted up in the booths.  Indeed, it might be a member of either of the other two Parties who would get a brainstorm and avail of this paragraph as it is drafted and who would first post up Party literature in the booth.  If that happened, surely the Minister's Party would not be behind the door in posting up their literature and, in the heel of the hunt, you could have chaos and a brawl.  On the other hand, if a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, reading the Bill carefully, decided he was entitled to put up a huge placard which commenced with the words &ldquo;Vote `Yes' &rdquo; in the referendum. &ldquo;See the explanation hereunder&rdquo;&mdash; and then, in small print, have the words set out in the appendix to the section, I am perfectly satisfied that the members of the Fine Gael Party and the members of the Labour Party would feel entitled to post up literature within the booths, too.  I really thought the Minister would have intervened before now to tell me he was accepting the amendment but perhaps he has the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I said &ldquo;intervened&rdquo;, not &ldquo;interrupted&rdquo;, to tell me he was accepting the amendment.  Perhaps the Minister intends to accept it or perhaps he has some very good argument to put forward to show me that only the presiding officer can post up this notice.  I await the Minister's explanation before saying anything further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, with regard to the question of substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;, it is, of course, the intention that the statement will be displayed in all polling stations and instructions to presiding officers will make this clear.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used merely to guard against the possibility that, if some presiding officer does not do it, through neglect or through forgetfulness, the result of the referendum could not be questioned because of the failure to comply with what was the law.  If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;, there would have to be a further subsection safeguarding this position, making it clear that the referendum would not be invalidated by reason of any failure to display it in any particular polling station.</P>
      <P>There is a precedent for this in the law on polling cards in section 64 (1) of the Electoral Act, 1963.  Section 64 (1) of that Act requires that the local returning officer shall send a polling card to every elector.  However, section 64 (5) says that no referendum shall be invalidated by reason of any failure to send, non-delivery of, or error or misstatement in, a polling card.  Therefore, it must be obvious that the insertion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; could not be accepted without also the insertion of a clause such as this providing that the referendum would not be invalidated if some presiding officer failed to display the notice.  The intention is that every presiding officer will do this and the instructions to presiding officers will make this clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, to accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's proposition that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; would obviously involve another subsection making it clear that the <Col N="626" /> referendum would not be invalidated if this was not done in some particular case.  The resultant position would, in fact, be no different from what it is under the Bill as it stands at present.  There does not seem to be any point in making this change.</P>
    <P>With regard to the insertion of the words &ldquo;by the presiding officer&rdquo; it is, of course, the intention, again, that the display of the summary shall only be by the presiding officer.  I see no objection to the principle of Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion except, again, that it is not necessary.  I am advised that sub-paragraph (e) does not, in fact, confer any right on political Parties to display a copy of the prescribed statement in any form that would draw particular attention to the course recommended by a political Party.  I am advised that any marked copy of the statement could not be held to be the statement set out in the Appendix to section 1 even if it differed from the statement in Appendix 1 only by having the words in heavier print or anything of that nature &mdash; particular attention drawn to any part of it in any way such as that.  I am advised that such a notice which in any way emphasises any part of the proposal or indicated which way any particular Party wanted people to vote can be removed by the presiding officer who is responsible for ensuring that polling stations are kept free of election literature.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 of the Referendum Act, the presiding officer is required to keep order at his polling station and, under this, all polling stations are to be kept free of election literature.  Any copy of a statement containing any indication that any particular Party desires voters to vote in a particular way would not be a copy of the statement and, therefore, would be removed by the presiding officer.  However, I have no objection to making this clear in the Bill, if Deputy Fitzpatrick insists on it, but his amendment would have to be altered.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Fitzpatrick insists &mdash; I do not think it is necessary but if he does insist &mdash; I have an alternative amendment here which I could hand to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> In page 2, paragraph (e), lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;in or in the precincts of polling stations&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;by a presiding officer in or in the precincts of his polling station.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not see any point in inserting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; because we would have to introduce the other subsection to ensure that the referendum would not be invalidated and this would leave the position substantially the same as it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I see a lot of point in substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I do not suppose there is any one of us in the House who has not had experience, at some time or another, of being appealed to by Party supporters to try to stop what was considered an abuse taking place within a polling station by the display of what might be considered to be propaganda of one kind or another in favour of a particular Party.  Of course, let us face it, presiding officers themselves are not devoid of all political feeling either.  In fact a lot of them come to the happy position of being presiding officers by virtue of their intense political emotion. This is very natural and there is nothing wrong with it.  In the course of by-elections, not in Dublin, with which I have been concerned in recent years, I have seen examples of over-enthusiastic backwoodsmen, or whatever is the equivalent for the female species, in polling booths displaying Party labels and so on without being upbraided for so doing by a presiding officer.  It seems to me that we ought to be very careful that the people who will be going to decide these two vital issues in the referendum will not be subjected to any kind of partisan persuasion, once they enter the polling booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a kind of voter who becomes slightly hysterical when he or she finds himself or herself the cynosure of all eyes in a polling station and who is liable to be swayed by what he or she may see in or about the polling station.  They have the experience of being made a great deal of by politicos of various denominations, of <Col N="628" /> being asked about their relatives and friends by people whom heretofore they regarded as total strangers and of having concern expressed about the state of their health as they are being ushered in.  All this leads to a situation in which they can be easily influenced and it is not a matter in which we can permit anybody to be easily influenced. We must take every possible step to ensure that the voter approaches the polling station, enters it and proceeds to register his vote without any attempt being made under the guise of officialdom to sway his mind one way or the other or to affect his actions.  Therefore it is essential that we should establish that the people who will be running the polling stations, the presiding officer and his staff, will understand clearly that they are not at liberty to permit the display of the statement referred to herein in any form other than the cold official form, that they are not permitted, and that it will be illegal for them and most definitely illegal for them, to allow Party workers to make use of the polling booths to sway the opinions of people.</P>
    <P>How are we going to ensure that? The Minister suggested that it would be some trouble to meet Deputy Fitzpatrick's point, where he seeks to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;, but I think the trouble would be worthwhile.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; has a definite peremptory ring about it while the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is a permissive soft expression. Not every presiding officer or official worker in polling booths will understand the finer legal nuances so far as these words are concerned; he will take what he sees at face value and say that the Act says that you may do this and that that does not mean that you have to do it.  However, if the Act lays down specifically that you shall follow a certain line, then that is the law saying that you must.  That is the argument for Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  It is a very vital one because as he truly remarked, and I am sure the Minister knows this, never an election goes by but we get these instances of disagreements and very often near-brawls as has been said near polling stations as to the interpretation <Col N="629" /> of the rights of Parties in regard to the display of propaganda.</P>
    <P>For instance, in a recent by-election I was called into the polling station where there was an enthusiastic lady who had stuck a Party badge on her handbag and placed in such a position that everybody coming in would see that badge.  I have no doubt that there were people who saw that Party badge with &ldquo;Vote so-and-so&rdquo; on it and that there were people of a certain kind who were influenced by that fact, by the whole atmosphere of the place, the excitement, tension and so on, and were influenced by the fact that this piece of propaganda was staring them in the face in the polling station.  When I remonstrated with the presiding officer and directed his attention to this, he directed that this should not be done. Of course the lady turned her handbag over and laid it flat on the table and then as soon as I was gone, she turned it up again for the next client to see. This goes on all the time and there is no way of measuring the extent to which it influences voters.  Even if it only influences a handful of voters, it is wrong and should be stopped.  I suggest that the Minister might go further than he has to meet this amendment which is a very useful one and which would put the position beyond argument when this matter comes for decision before the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to go some way to meet the point raised in this amendment.  I would prefer that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was substituted for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because then it would be clear that there was an obligation on the presiding officer to display these instructions.  I see quite clearly the force of the point made by the Minister and that there would have to be a safety valve provided in order to avoid an annulment of the entire referendum just because one presiding officer failed to carry out the direction contained in the section. I would prefer the safety clause referred to by the Minister which has already been provided in relation to polling cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is <Col N="630" /> substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; everybody from the Minister and the general returning officer in the Custom House down to the constituency returning officers and the presiding officers will regard it as their duty to display the explanation contained in the appendix to this section and will regard themselves as failing in their duty if they do not display the explanation and will then have to fall back on a way out through the safety subsection of the section &mdash; that is that failure to comply with this particular subsection, or paragraph, will not invalidate or annul the referendum.</P>
    <P>I certainly press the second part of my amendment, that is, that it should be made clear that this information can be posted up by the presiding officer and only by the presiding officer.  I know from personal experience that all presiding officers are not infallible.  I know from personal experience that not all presiding officers find it easy to interpret what appear to be simple enough instructions.  They find themselves in the position of trying to adjudicate on a point raised and argued by the agent of one Party in one way and the agent of another Party in another way.  We should do all we can to make clear to presiding officers what the position is.  The Minister says he is advised that any variation, no matter how slight, from the wording of the appendix or, indeed, in the dimensions of the letters in the appendix, would be a violation of paragraph (e) of section 1.  I must say, if I were a presiding officer, it is quite possible I would not put that interpretation on it.  It is quite possible I would not hold myself bound as closely as the Minister's advisers think a presiding officer would be bound, and a presiding officer might well argue that, because a publication or a poster contained the words in the appendix, he could not prohibit its display in the polling booth.  At any rate, it is not necessary for me to waste the time of the House on this any further because the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to meet me on the point.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Dunne's argument about the display of emblems of one sort or another within <Col N="631" /> the booths.  I know that is against the rules.  If I might make one point, I think an effort should be made to avoid having too much informality in polling stations.  This may not be entirely relevant, but I have been in polling stations which consisted of a small room in a private house where everybody was cooped up together. The political affiliations of the owner of the house were obvious.  The whole thing led to a sort of hail-fellow-well-met attitude.  I should not like to think what might happen in the dying moments of the poll when everybody has got to know everybody else pretty well and has, perhaps, had a little refreshment, and that sort of thing. Polling stations should not be sited in private houses, if that can be avoided. There may be occasions on which it cannot be avoided but, while one does not want the barrack square or courtroom atmosphere, one can go too far to the other extreme.  By and large, I am satisfied with the Minister's proposal to meet me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick. Some of these small polling stations have outlived their usefulness.  Whatever may be said for having small polling stations in rural areas, where the element of distance enters into the picture, there is no excuse or justification whatever for having them in urban areas.  I cannot see why they should not be sited in schools and public buildings where better supervision can be exercised and better arrangements made.  I have had experience, too, of the kind of polling station to which the Deputy referred&mdash; the ordinary furnished room in a private house.  The result was just what Deputy Fitzpatrick described.  I thought the situation wide open to abuse and certainly the arrangements made it virtually impossible for a voter to vote in secret.  There is something to be said for rationalising polling arrangements generally.  However, this is not really relevant.</P>
      <P>To meet Deputy Fitzpatrick I am prepared to move the following amendment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> In page 2, paragraph (e), lines 32 and 33, to delete all words after &ldquo;section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall be displayed by a presiding officer in and in the precincts of his polling station: provided that no referendum shall be invalidated by reason of any failure to display such copies in or in the precincts of any polling station,&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;vary by more than one-sixth from the national average&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be greater or less than the national average by more than one-sixth&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the part of the appendix dealing with the white ballot paper, that is, the ballot paper purporting to explain the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968.  As the Bill stands at the moment, the explanation on the white ballot paper reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, proposes that in forming Dáil constituencies, the population per deputy in any case may not vary by more than one-sixth from the national average and that regard must be had to the extent and accessibility of constituencies, <Col N="633" /> the need for having convenient areas of representation and the desirability of avoiding the overlapping of county boundaries.</P>
    <P>That purports to be a brief synopsis or explanation of Part II of the Schedule to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968 and the only purpose in putting it there is to explain to the voter in a few words what exactly the effect of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1968 would be, if passed.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the House and to the Minister that he can use clearer language to explain the effect of the Third Amendment and, indeed, I want to put it to the Minister that the clearest possible language he can use is the language contained in Part II of the Third Amendment Bill because it says that none of the quotients shall be greater or less than the average obtained by dividing the population as ascertained at the immediately preceding census by the total number of members of Dáil Éireann by more than one-sixth of that average.  The effective words there are &ldquo;shall be greater or less&rdquo;.  The proposed explanation says &ldquo;shall not vary by more than one-sixth from the national average&rdquo;.  If those words were used in the Bill itself they would be held to be vague, would be held to be uncertain. I fail to see why the Minister or his advisers did not use the exact words of Part II of the Schedule, particularly when they are clear.  It says that none of the quotients shall be greater or less than the national average by more than one-sixth.  That is what it means. It means that you may go one-sixth below the national average or one-sixth above it.  Maybe that is what &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means and I am not going to have any stand-up argument with the Minister on that.  Maybe that is what &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means but I say that the other words are clearer because they make it absolutely clear that you can go one-sixth above the national average and one-sixth below it and when you have those clear words there it is misleading to go around looking for other words which, instead of clarifying, tend to confuse.</P>
    <P>I say that the words in Part II of the <Col N="634" /> Schedule to the Bill are absolutely clear; everybody knows what they mean and they are clearer than the words which are given as an explanation. I urge on the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on the Second Stage of this Bill, &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means exactly the same thing as &ldquo;greater or less&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Vary from the national average&rdquo; means exactly the same thing as to be greater or less than the national average.  It is, in my opinion, somewhat clearer.  It uses less words.  It may be that there will be some people who will not know what the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means but, if there are such people, they will not know what &ldquo;national average&rdquo; is, either.  Anyone who understands what &ldquo;national average&rdquo; means will also understand what &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means.  I say that the only reason why we did not use the exact words of the Bill was that what we were doing was summarising the Bill.  I think &ldquo;vary from the national average&rdquo; is clearer and, also, since two proposals have to be summarised on one small voting card, there was the point of economising in words.</P>
      <P>However, the wording that is proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick means exactly the same thing and if it will make Deputy Fitzpatrick any happier, I am prepared to accept it but I do not think it is necessary.  I think &ldquo;vary from the national average&rdquo; means the same thing as to be greater or less than the national average.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, Sir.  One would not make much sense without the other.  The two are so closely related that it would be desirable to take the two together.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 37, before &ldquo;system&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I regard amendments No. 3 and No. 4 together as very important amendments because what we are doing here is trying to explain to the people in simple language what the proposal is upon which they are being asked to vote. It would be far better to give them a misleading explanation than to give no explanation at all.</P>
      <P>The heart of the matter, so to speak, in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is the abolition of proportional representation and the substitution for the present system of proportional representation the system known as the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote.  If I am asked where I got that language or where I got that explanation, I refer the House to Part II of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, Part II of the Schedule, in short.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of Part II states:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies and one member only shall be returned for each constituency.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>The members shall be elected on the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that should be brought home to the electorate if we set out to instruct them, to clarify their minds and to tell them what the proposal is.  The first and biggest proposal here is to abolish the system of election known as the proportional <Col N="636" /> representation system, the system that has been in operation here since the foundation of the State.  It is known as the proportional representation system, election by proportional representation. But there is not one word in the explanation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill about proportional representation.  One would think that these were nasty words.  One can remember the newspapers of some time ago referring to &ldquo;an illegal organisation&rdquo;.  It was illegal to mention the name of the illegal organisation. The explanation reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, proposes &mdash; (1) To substitute for the present system of voting at Dáil elections the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system in single member constituencies;</P>
    <P>I say that is misleading for two reasons. I say it would be much clearer to the people if they were told &ldquo;To substitue for the present proportional representation system&rdquo;&mdash; proportional representation being the operative words, because that is what the Government are setting out to destroy and to replace.  Those two words should be written in black and white &mdash; that we are abolishing the system of proportional representation. That is the only system under which the vast majority of the present electorate ever voted.</P>
    <P>If you are going to execute a citizen he at least should be named.  Here we are going to execute, or attempt to execute, and destroy a system.  That system should not be led into the dock without a name.  It should be led into the dock and put before the jury bearing its full and proper name, and that is the system of proportional representation. I cannot see any good reason why all these notices, which will go into the hands of every elector through the post, which will be posted up outside every polling booth and presumably posted up inside as well, and which will be advertised in the public press, should not bear the accurate and well-known description of the system we are proposing to abolish &mdash; the proportional representation system.  That is the argument &mdash; I think the unanswerable argument &mdash; in support of amendment No. 3 which I am moving.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The explanation says we are to substitute for the present system of voting at Dáil elections the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system.  I want to ask the Minister seriously where he got that description for the system which is described in Part II of the Schedule as &ldquo;the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote&rdquo;; and which is described at page 24, paragraph (q) of the Report of the Committee on the Constitution, December, 1967, as &ldquo;the first-past-the-post system&rdquo;; and which is described at page 115 of the same Report, paragraph (4), as &ldquo;the spot system&rdquo;?  I cannot find anywhere in that Report this proposed system described as the straight vote.</P>
    <P>We have here something fundamental. We have here a principle at stake.  The Minister cannot deny that the system he proposes to the country is a highly controversial system, to say the least of it.  It is so controversial that a similar proposal put forward by his Party when in Government in 1959 was rejected by the people as unacceptable to them, as an undesirable system, as a system which they did not regard as providing a fair system of election.  The Minister seeks to describe that system, which as far as we know is not regarded by the people as fair or as acceptable to them, as the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;.  It is anything but straight.  It is as crooked as a ram's horn.  It is a system which does not regard majority rule.  It is a system under which in certain circumstances as little as 30 per cent of the people voting at an election can claim to represent more than 50 per cent of the people who actually voted.  It is a system under which a candidate who only gets something like 30 per cent of the votes cast in an election can claim to speak on behalf of the majority of the people who voted.  That, to say the least of it, is a highly controversial system.</P>
    <P>It cannot be described as a straight system especially when in Irish minds the word &ldquo;straight&rdquo; is synonymous with the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and with the word &ldquo;honest&rdquo;.  It cannot be denied that any honest-to-God Irishman frequently runs the words &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair&rdquo;<Col N="638" /> and &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and &ldquo;honest&rdquo; together. It is not a mere accident that the Minister called this child of his, the relative majority non-transferable vote, the straight system.  He may think that it is straight but that is not sufficient. It is a dishonest description of it, a description calculated to mislead. No doubt between now and the date of the Referendum the Minister will campaign on the basis that this system is a straight system but that does not entitle him to use the official literature provided by this House and by funds voted by this House as Party electioneering material.  That is what he is doing if he does not accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to find this description, &ldquo;the straight vote system&rdquo; used elsewhere for this first-past-the-post or spot vote system.  The Minister officially concedes that he has taken over the British system and says it is a good British system.  If that is so he should call it what the British call it, the spot vote.  I do not know how anybody can describe a system as &ldquo;straight&rdquo; which can and probably will, if the people are foolish enough to accept it, hand over 65 per cent of the seats in this assembly to 35 per cent of the people voting.  That is not straight or honest and above all, it is not fair.  Irish people couple the words &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and &ldquo;honest&rdquo; together.  For that reason I say that this description, which it is proposed to send by post at public expense to each elector, is calculated to deceive, mislead and confuse rather than to secure what it is supposed to seek to secure, clarification.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment so as to make clear that it is his intention to kill, abolish, do away with the proportional representation system and that he proposes to substitute for it the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote because the words &ldquo;relative majority&rdquo; mean something other than an absolute majority.  It will be clear to the people that they are departing from a system which requires a majority of votes to elect a person to a system which requires only <Col N="639" /> a relative majority, less than a majority and, as will be more easily explained to them then, much less than a majority.  Why does the Minister shun, in this explanation to the people, the words &ldquo;on the one hand proportional representation and on the other relative majority&rdquo; which are well known to the people, the first two, &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo;, having been household words at election times since 1922 and the second pair of words &ldquo;relative majority&rdquo; being solemnly written into the Constitution if the Minister gets his way?  I await the Minister's comments on the arguments I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody here knows that on the occasion of the last proposal to amend the Constitution there was considerable complaint that the explanation of the question that was being asked was confusing to the voters.  As far as I can see the sole purpose of these two amendments that Deputy Fitzpatrick has put down is to ensure that there will be the maximum possible confusion on this occasion. The complaints in regard to confusion on the last occasion could only have been due to the fact that in the summary of the proposals two systems of representation and two systems of voting were described with the result that a number of people, it was alleged, did not know whether &ldquo;yes&rdquo; was voting for the present system or the proposed system.  Mark you, this was when there was only one proposal to be described on the ballot paper and only one ballot paper to be filled up. Now, on this occasion as a result of the representations of the Opposition Parties that they were confused by this whole proposition being put into one proposal we have two separate ballots being conducted and therefore two separate questions to be described in summarised form on the polling card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on the Second Stage of the Bill the question to be put must be in the form: Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution which is contained in the Third Amendment of the Constitution <Col N="640" /> Bill?  and, on the other ballot paper, the green ballot paper: Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution which is contained in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill?</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Fourth Amendment Bill is in fact to substitute this new proposed system of representation and election for the present system. The effect of this proposal will be to substitute this proposed new system for the present system.  Obviously, the summary should describe exactly what it is proposed to do.  That is what this summary does &mdash; to substitute for the present system the straight vote system and single-member constituencies.  I think it is obvious that if we in the summary describe also the system which is there at present and which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, has been in operation since the foundation of the State and which he claims is well known, it is quite obvious that the only result can be to cause confusion and to cause some people to believe that they are being asked to vote for or against the present system while, in fact, they are being asked to vote &mdash; and can only be asked to vote &mdash; for or against the proposed system.  This proposed summary makes it absolutely clear, or as clear as it is possible to make it, that the proposal is to substitute for the present system, which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, is well known, this proposed system of which the people in general have not had experience and which therefore needs to be described.</P>
    <P>If we describe the present system as is requested it will lead some people to think that they are being asked to vote for or against proportional representation, whereas they are being asked to vote for or against the straight vote and single member constituencies. The description of the proposed system, as Deputy Fitzpatrick and everybody else knows, is the description by which the proposed system is known in this country.  It is not a description that was invented by the present Government.  I have a book here <i>Free Elections</i> by W. J. M. McKenzie, and on page 53 this passage occurs:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> What elections should do is to face the elector with a choice, which he has to make in a particular set of circumstances between alternatives which are real and present; responsibility must be thrust upon the electorate for facing real issues, making the best of available alternatives, and abiding by the decision taken.  This can only be achieved completely (it is said) by &ldquo;straight&rdquo; voting in single-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>This is a term which has been used outside of this country &mdash; and before this present proposal was made &mdash; to describe this system and it is, as Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, the name by which the system is known here.  I can give numerous examples to show that that is so right from the time the proposal was first made.  For instance, the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 22nd February, 1968, in a leading article in a number of cases refers to the proposed system as the straight vote:</P>
    <P>From now on the term &ldquo;Third Amendment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fourth Amendment&rdquo; will become familiar in our political terminology, the former relating to the ratio of Deputies to population and the latter to the straight vote issue.</P>
    <P>And further on:</P>
    <P>The real bone of contention, of course, is the Fourth Amendment which is to be presented as a simple choice between the existing system and the straight vote in single-seat constituencies.  This is a question which admits of no misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>They did not deem it necessary to describe the existing system and they considered that the clearest way in which they could describe the proposed system was &ldquo;the straight vote in single-seat constituencies&rdquo;.  Again the same paper on the 5th April referred to the Constitutional Amendments in a leading article in which this passage occurs:</P>
    <P>All this aside, the most intriguing suggestion that came up while the Second Reading was in progress was that the Government might depart <Col N="642" /> from their proposition of the straight vote and opt for the Norton amendment...</P>
    <P>Again it was considered that the simplest way in which to describe the system we are proposing was to describe it as the straight vote, the way in which it would be understood by people and containing the least words. Again the <i>Irish Times</i> in a leading article on the 9th March says:</P>
    <P>In spite of this clear direction from their members, the Fianna Fáil Government decided to go for the straight vote,</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">

      <P>I am only showing that even these people who are so bitterly opposed to this electoral reform refer to it as the straight vote because they know that this is a term by which it is known by the people.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> on 1st February, 1968, described the system as the straight vote, not that they support the straight vote, I may say, but &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo; is the term used.  Again the <i>Irish Times</i> of 11th January, 1968 says:</P>
      <P>Still some members of the Fine Gael Party see definite danger in the straight vote.</P>
      <P>The political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 5th March, 1968, starts off his article:</P>
      <P>The Great Debate on PR versus the straight vote is expected to be resumed in the Dáil today.</P>
      <P>On a number of other occasions in the same article it is referred to in the same way, for example:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The titles, for instance, could be changed to read &ldquo;Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill (Tolerance) 1968&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fourth Amendment to the Constitution Bill (Straight Vote) 1968&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Obviously the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> visualised the words &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; being incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think any of them are in favour of the straight vote or are trying to influence people to vote for it, but in giving this description of it they are not so concerned with creating confusion, apparently, as Deputy Fitzpatrick is. They consider that the clearest way of referring to the proposal so that it will be understood is to describe it as the straight vote.  The article goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Another method would be to have different coloured ballot papers and to print clearly on one &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and on the other &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> in a leading article on the 20th June, 1968, starts off:</P>
      <P>So we are stuck with this &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; proposal after all.</P>
      <P>After that they say:</P>
      <P>But they have been told that the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system will produce greater stability.</P>
      <P>On 1st February, 1968, the <i>Irish Independent</i> political correspondent starts off again by describing this as the straight vote system.  Deputy Corish, the Leader of the Labour Party, is quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st February, 1968, as saying:</P>
      <P>It is hypocritical of a Party which has controlled the fate of this country for as long as the Fianna Fáil Party has to argue that the straight vote is needed to stabilise Government.</P>
      <P>The political correspondent of the <i>Irish Press</i> of 31st January, 1968, again describes it as &ldquo;the straight vote in the single seat constituencies&rdquo;.  The political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the same date, 31st January, 1968, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some observers feel that there will be no hard decision from today's Fianna Fáil meeting, but even if there is not, Ministers will get sufficient indication of the predominant line of thought to enable them to <Col N="644" /> speak at the Cabinet table for the straight vote,...</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> of 1st January, 1968, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The majority of Ministers in the Government is now believed to favour the complete abolition of the present system of proportional representation and its replacement by the straight vote in single seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> of 25th November last again refers to &ldquo;the straight vote to replace the PR system&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>No, they do not have to economise in words as we have, and the need to avoid the charge of confusing the people does not apply to newspaper articles as much as to polling cards.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 3rd February, 1968, says:</P>
      <P>This aspect will probably be watched very carefully on this occasion, when, as seems likely, the Government will combine the two referendum proposals in one question. Roughly this would read: Abolish PR, adopt the straight vote-single seat system....</P>
      <P>The political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times,</i> 18th June, 1968, again uses the words &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; and says:</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes the straight vote while Norton proposes the alternative voting system.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 5th June the political correspondent uses &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;.  The <i>Irish Times</i> of 10th May, 1968, had a heading &ldquo;Only 50 at meeting to defend PR.&rdquo;  In that article no less a personage than Senator Garret FitzGerald is quoted as having said that the straight vote system would prove extremely unstable under Irish conditions.  He does not seem to agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that it will lead to the perpetuation for all time of Fianna Fáil in office.  He does agree that the most convenient and easily understood way of describing the system is to call it the straight vote system.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Tables I, II and III: Fianna Fáil 97, 93, 77&rdquo;.  The alternative to our present electoral system was being discussed as the straight vote in single-member constituencies.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They used it to describe the system and to express what they wanted to express so that the people listening to them or reading them would know what they were talking about.  The natural way to describe it is the straight vote system. Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that the proposed system is known by that title but because he wants to create confusion he wants the system to be disguised by describing it in a way in which people in general will not recognise it.  He also wants confusion to be caused by describing two systems rather than one.  The present system which he wants to maintain is well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obvious determination <Col N="647" /> on the part of the Opposition Parties to create as much confusion as possible.  If the wording put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick were adopted, obviously it would be likely to lead the less careful and perceptive voter to think that he was being asked to vote for or against the only system he would recognise from the description Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to have on the voter's card, whereas in fact the question will be whether he is in favour or not in favour of the proposed system.  This is another indication that Deputy Fitzpatrick recognises that the trend of opinion in the Fine Gael Party is towards the point of view of the leader of that Party and that to create confusion in the public mind is his only hope.</P>
    <P>When I was quoting all those eminent authorities who, when they wanted to describe the proposed system, used the term &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo; I should also have included the description given by a prominent member of the Fine Gael front bench, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, who said when he was questioned about this matter on television: &ldquo;I am in favour of the single-seat constituency and the straight vote&rdquo;, because he knew that was the way he recognised it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of it. I can assure the Deputy I have no great respect for Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  I am just showing that when members of the Fine Gael front bench want to refer to this system, and do not want to go to the trouble of describing it in detail they refer to it as the straight vote because that is the title by which this system is known in the country.  The proposal to insert any other description is made purely and simply for the purpose of disguising what exactly the proposals are, particularly when allied to this completely unnecessary proposal to describe the present system which even Deputy Fitzpatrick himself says is well known. I presume what he means is that the <Col N="648" /> method of voting is well known, because obviously there are comparatively few people in this country &mdash; and, indeed, I think there are very few on the Fine Gael front bench &mdash; who know the system to the extent of knowing how it operates.  During the debate it was clear that a number of people on the Fine Gael front bench have not got the foggiest idea as to the mechanics of the system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick availed of the opportunity to make the point that &ldquo;relative majority&rdquo; means something other than &ldquo;absolute majority&rdquo;, apparently yet another attempt to put forward the ridiculous and fraudulent view that the operation of transferring some votes in accordance with the unjustifiable rules of the present system could establish that there is a majority in favour of one candidate after the people have said clearly in the ballot boxes that there is not.  I have made it clear on a number of occasions that it is not possible to do this.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that as well as everybody else.  He knows that the operation of the system which applies in by-elections here does not establish that there is a majority in favour of one particular candidate unless the people have already said so themselves.  The recent Wicklow by-election makes that perfectly clear.  As a result of according discriminatory treatment to certain arbitrarily selected voters a candidate who received 30 per cent, not even 35 per cent of the votes was deemed to be elected.  Deputy Fitzpatrick pretends to believe that it was established by this process that there was a majority of the people in favour of the candidate, when he knows it is a fact the people made it clear there were only 8,035 out of 26,223 in favour of the particular candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to other by-elections at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It does but in all others the candidate whom the greatest number of people in the constituency voted for was elected.  The argument certainly does apply to every election in which this fraudulent system operates. Of course it does.  I pointed out that there is no justification at all for <Col N="649" /> this, although the manipulation of the votes after the election did result in the crediting of 51.1 per cent of the final votes to the candidate who came second, and 48.9 per cent to the candidate who came first.  I pointed out that there is no reason whatever to believe that 51.1 per cent were in favour of the candidate who came second.  If there was any attempt to treat all the voters alike, if the voters who voted for the other candidate who was not deemed to be elected, that is the Fianna Fáil candidate in this case, were given the same treatment as the others, it is quite obvious it would be established that there was not a majority in favour of the other candidate because in the fourth count the position was that the Labour candidate in the Wicklow by-election had 6,797 votes credited to him and the Fine Gael candidate had 8,728 votes credited to him, a difference of 1,931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage there were 10,343 votes credited to the Fianna Fáil candidate but in accordance with the discriminatory rules of this system, under which Deputy Fitzpatrick pretends to believe that there was a majority in favour of the Fine Gael candidate, those 10,343 voters were not given the same consideration as the remainder.  It is obvious if they were, and if their preferences were taken into account in the same way as the preferences of the other voters who voted for candidates not deemed to be elected it would have been established as well as there being an absolute majority in favour of the Fine Gael candidate there was an absolute majority in favour of the Labour candidate.  Of course, I think that even Deputy Fitzpatrick will agree that there could not be an absolute majority in favour of more than one candidate.  To suggest, as Deputy Fitzpatrick did, that the present system of transferring votes to establish that there was a majority in favour of a candidate, after the people had said there was not, is absolute nonsense.  What Deputy Fitzpatrick is proposing, apart from the obvious attempt to confuse the people by disguising the facts, is that we should describe in the summary of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill the present system and also the <Col N="650" /> system it is proposed to substitute.  I say that would create confusion but even if it was done, to be consistent we obviously must do the same thing with regard to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, that is, describe the present position and also describe what it is proposed to substitute for that.  I would ask Deputy Fitzpatrick could he get agreement in his Front Bench as to the description of the present situation with regard to the ratio of population per Deputy in each individual constituency. Certainly during the debate it was not possible to do this.</P>

      <P>If we want to be consistent, and if in the summary of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill we are to describe both the present position and the change that is proposed, obviously in the summary of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill we must do the same thing.  It would be extremely difficult to get an agreed description of the present position.  Deputy Ryan and Deputy Fitzpatrick, two people sitting on the same Front Bench, have diametrically different views of what the position is. Deputy Fitzpatrick maintains that the position at present is exactly the position we are proposing to establish in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  He maintained that here in this House and still he is bitterly opposing its being made clear that this is the position.  Deputy Ryan disagrees fundamentally with him.  When two lawyers of the standing of Deputy Ryan and Deputy Fitzpatrick cannot agree as to what the present position is I cannot see how we could hope to get agreement on a short summary of the position to be put on the polling card.  It is quite clear that to make the position as clear as possible to voters, the best thing to do is to describe the proposal to them and make it clear that what they are being asked to do is to say whether or not they agree that this system should be substituted for the present system which, even Deputy Fitzpatrick admits, is something that they know.  To do otherwise would only result in confusing the voters but as I said it is quite obvious that Deputy Fitzpatrick's whole objective is creating as much confusion as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While speaking for about three-quarters of an hour, all the Minister succeeded in doing was <Col N="652" /> in proving that he himself, the politicians in the House, the political correspondents and a couple of editors of newspapers are agreed that the straight vote was a description of what he is trying to do.  He did not try to tell us because we would not believe him that everybody in the country understands that description.</P>
      <P>I am interested to know a few things. Suppose his proposal is carried, how will the Minister have it written into the Constitution?  Will he put &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;?  Will that be the term used? He must put into the Constitution the new system of voting and straight vote in inverted commas in the Bill is not what people will see drafted in the Constitution.  Perhaps the Minister before 10.30 tonight, or indeed some time tomorrow, might let us know how this will be described.  The Minister knows quite well that the description &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; is simply a slang expression and is used by the Fianna Fáil Party to describe the proposed change on the ballot paper or in the Bill simply for the purpose of giving an air of respectability to something which is terribly crooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that even at this stage the Minister should try a hoary old one about confusing people.  The biggest attempt to confuse was made by the Government, and the present Minister for Justice, now Minister for Education&mdash;they move so often it is hard to keep track of them.  Deputy B. Lenihan flew a kite to clarify, and in a television programme released the information that it was proposed to put the whole lot into one ballot paper and attempt to get across something which would succeed in confusing everybody.  Following this disclosure, there was such a storm of protest that the Government decided to change tactics and said that they would have two ballot papers.  Would somebody tell me how on earth we are to expect ordinary voters down the country who, the Minister says, are confused and find it difficult, to decide out of five or six names whom they want to vote for?  How are they to vote if they get a paper that asks: &ldquo;Do you approve the amendment of the Constitution contained in the under-mentioned Bill? If you do approve, mark X in this <Col N="653" /> square and if you do not approve, mark X in this square.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says he does not want to confuse.  The one thing he cannot get away from is that in both the ballot papers the Minister will get &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  No matter how confusing he makes it and he is the person who is trying to confuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He is talking about this terrible system which should never be allowed, a system which should never have been considered in any society.  But for it, the Minister would not be here.  The Minister forgets Deputy P.J. Burke's No. 2's brought him in here first.  I am not belittling him in this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government, and it has to go to the Seanad yet and they may decide to do something with it when it goes in there, that as it stands <Col N="654" /> they do not mention proportional representation anywhere in connection with this and they do that because of the fact that they are afraid of the description &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo;. They know, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that the people accept that proportional representation means the proportional strength of the various Parties and it has proved itself here.  What the Minister suggests now should be put down is this idea that without being given any chance at all of understanding people might put down what he describes, and he rightly puts it in inverted commas, as the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;, and he asks the people of the country whether or not they want the straight vote.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick described this as the British system of voting.  I would not describe it as the British system but the system in Northern Ireland, the system that has ensured that 27 constituencies have not been contested for the past 30 years.  They have been gerrymandered and manoeuvred so that the people get elected by adopting this so-called straight vote; nobody could put them out and, if there is no danger of being put out, the Minister knows the old trick which Fianna Fáil were good at, that of, even under proportional representation, putting in the outsider to split the vote of the third candidate and prevent him getting elected.</P>
      <P>The Minister thinks this is the system the Irish people will accept.  I told Deputy B. Lenihan the first night this was discussed on television that this was a crooked system attempted by Fianna Fáil and the sooner it goes through the sooner it goes to the people and the sooner the result will be shown that the people do not want it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thing boils down to the fact that Fianna Fáil <Col N="655" /> accepted advice from the Minister for Local Government and now they have left him holding the reins.  Now it has got out of control and they are leaving him clear to try to make something of it and his best effort is to give it an air of respectability by calling it a &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;, hoping that will get it through and he will get a straight answer when it goes to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in all courtesy I should reply.  Since Deputy Tully is still not convinced, I will try to explain. First of all, with regard to the description of the straight vote, the references I gave were only a random selection which showed clearly that the name by which the proposed system is known to political commentators and to Deputies, including the Leader of the Labour section of the Coalition, is the straight vote.  When they want to describe the proposed system in the clearest possible way and in the least number of words, they use the term &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;&mdash; Deputy Corish, the political correspondents of all the papers and other Deputies, including Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, all have described the proposed system as the straight vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was obviously known in those circles also as the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;.  I think I made it clear why we did not have to describe also the present system.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also made it clear.  He says the present system is well known.  Therefore, it is not necessary to describe it. It is quite true that, in the summary of the proposals and in the voter's card, the words &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo; will not appear.  The reason for that is that when they did appear the last time &mdash; when the two systems were described&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At this stage, after the Bill to amend the Constitution has been discussed I think rather adequately in the Dáil on the Second Stage, on the Committee Stage, on the Report Stage and on the Final Stage, Deputy Tully still wants to know how the amendment will be made in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>No, it will not.  The Bill specifies how the Constitution is to be amended.  What we are providing for here is a summary of the Bill.  Deputy Tully apparently wants <Col N="657" /> the summary to be the whole Bill. Voters will be told that the Bill is available for 6d.  Deputy S. D. Barrett is afraid that if the voter were not told it would be available for 6d he might think it would take an exorbitant sum of money to buy the Bill. I propose to accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment in relation to the 6d.  For the huge sum of 6d, the voter will be able to read through the legal language of the actual Bill and see exactly how it will be described in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I have to deal with several other matters which Deputy Tully raised.  First of all, he raised what he called &ldquo;the kite&rdquo; flown by the present Minister for Education.  The present Minister for Education did not fly any kite.  It was the intention of the Government to put forward their proposals for electoral reform in the form of one proposal &mdash; just the same as in 1959.  In fact, the only real difference between what is proposed now and what was proposed in 1959 is that, in 1959, it was not specified that there should be a definite limit to the amount of divergence to be allowed from the national average of population per Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Are we going to have another referendum to amend Article 18?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to be included in the proposal that it should be permissible to take account of the very same factors as we are proposing to take account of now &mdash; only, now, we are specifying that the maximum divergence shall be one-sixth and, in 1959, no such provision was made.  But, in 1959, the Opposition apparently were able to understand that proposal.  They did not cry that, by putting this whole complicated proposal into one Bill, they would be confused.  We had no reason to believe their level of understanding had so deteriorated since 1959 that now they would not be able to understand this proposal and would be confused, as it was being put forward as one proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in order not to confuse the people, we intended just to ask them to vote for or against the proposed reform.  We discovered that the Opposition could not understand it at all this time.  They claimed they were being confused.  They claimed they could not understand it.  In order to try, if possible, to dispel the confusion in the minds of the Opposition, we agreed to put this proposal forward as two separate proposals. That is how that happened.  Of course, we might have realised we would not succeed in dispelling the confusion. For the Second Stage we had to put them together.  For the subsequent <Col N="659" /> stages we had to separate them.  By that time, the Opposition were not able to separate them in their own minds and insisted on discussing both Bills together.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Having proposed these amendments, I think I am entitled to say a few words in reply.  I put down five amendments to this Bill, some of them in my own name and some of them in my own name and in that of Deputy Barrett.  It is significant that the Minister has intimated that three of those five amendments are reasonable amendments and that they are acceptable to him and that the Bill will be amended accordingly.  Some of them were put down in order to clarify the position and to ensure that these dangerous measures which are being forced on the country will be made as clear as possible to the electorate.  The only amendments the Minister will not accept are these two amendments which propose to make it clear to the people that we are abolishing PR and substituting for it the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote.  If there is one thing we should not do when giving an explanation it is to confuse the people. The explanation which the Minister proposes in the Appendix of the Bill is calculated to confuse and can only confuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new system which the Minister proposes to introduce is a highly controversial system: that cannot be denied.  So controversial is it that when it went to the country less than ten years ago it was defeated by a majority of 30,000 people.  Some 30,000 people did not think it a fair system and they did not think it a straight system, they thought it was a crooked system.  Throughout this debate I have never described the system as the straight vote.  I described it as the spot vote system as it is described in the Report of the Committee.  This <Col N="662" /> is a crooked system but the Minister prefers to call it a straight system. My amendment does not ask him to describe it as a crooked system, that would be prejudging, but it asks him to describe it in the words in which it will be written in the Constitution if the Minister's Bill is accepted by the people, that is the relative majority system.  That is what it will be called in the Constitution and as Deputy Tully said if &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; was written into the Constitution nobody would be able to interpret it.  The Minister must have been advised that if he wrote &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; into the Constitution it would mean absolutely nothing.  It is obvious that the Minister knows his Party is slipping, over the the various national contests over the past few years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;showed that his vote was going down and, therefore, he wants to change the system of election.  However, it does not stop there.  The Minister knows that when he put the issue clearly to the people the last time and in his explanation described the present system as the proportional representation system and the new system as the relative majority system, he lost and now he wants to change the rules again.  First of all, he wants to change the rules for electing people to Dáil Éireann and then he wants to change the rules for holding referenda in order to try to make sure he will succeed.</P>
      <P>The Minister loves quoting what other people said at various times.  I want to put on record now what the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the President, said on 1st June, 1927, at column 1343, volume 67 of the Dáil Debates.  He said this:</P>
      <P>The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of proportional representation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> He did not say &ldquo;the present system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>My view is that it is better, when dealing with fundamental law, with the right to vote and how the vote shall be exercised to define, and to take away from Parties the temptation to manoeuvre with systems so as to get Party advantage.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what the Minister is doing here:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In so far as the Minister has any explanation it is this: that the man who said it was being dishonest with the people; that the man who said it was saying something he did not believe; that the man who said it was trying to put something over on the people in order to try to get them to do something else.  If the Minister's explanation means anything, it means that.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke earlier on about this system of proportional representation not carrying out the will of the majority of the people.  Of course, it does carry out the will of the majority of the people and it is utter nonsense for the Minister to start talking about the 10,000 votes, or whatever it was the Fianna Fáil candidate finished up with in Wicklow, and say they should be counted again.  Those votes were effective.  It is only when such votes cease to be effective that second preferences are counted.  The 10,000 votes were in the front line until the election was over.  That is why they were not counted again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> These referenda will cost something in the region of £150,000 and, in putting them before the people, we should be very clear and we should do everything to ensure that we put the issue fairly and squarely and that is why I am putting forward these amendments in an effort to clarify the position.  Does the Minister intend holding another referendum next year to regularise the position in the Seanad and in the universities from the constitutional point of view because, so far as I know, another referendum will be necessary if the present proposal is carried?  It is a wonder the Minister did not include that proposal in this Bill?</P>

The fact that the Minister has <Col N="665" /> accepted three out of five of my amendments is, I think, evidence of my bona fides, evidence that my amendments are well-intentioned, and the Minister refuses to accept these amendments because he wants to confuse the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick maintains that the proposal in the Bill is calculated to confuse the people, but he has not put forward a single argument to support that contention. He has himself admitted that the people know what the present system is.  Therefore, describing the present system as the present system surely does nothing to confuse the people. I do not think that even Deputy Fitzpatrick could deny that the proposed system of election is known to the people as the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;. That is the way in which political commentators and even university professors have described it in the newspapers. That is the way in which numbers of Deputies in the Fine Gael Party have described it, including Deputy Oliver Flanagan when he was expressing his support for it; and that is the way in which the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, has described it.  It is obvious then, I think, that the people generally know what the present system is and know that the term &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; describes the proposed system.  There can, therefore, be no confusion in the proposed summary of the proposals in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendments were accepted, the summary would be much more confusing because the two systems would have to be described and, on a casual reading of the summary then, a less than normally perceptive voter would not see clearly that what he is being asked to do is, in effect, to vote for or against the proposed system and he might think he was voting for or against the present system.  Obviously, if Deputy Fitzpatrick's proposed description is accepted, if his proposed description of the proposal is accepted, <Col N="666" /> and also if his proposal to describe the present system is accepted, then, to be consistent, since we are describing the proposed system by reference to the system of election and the system of representation, we would have also to describe the present system by reference to the system of election and the system of representation.  That would not be done by using the terms &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo;; we would have to describe the system of voting, which is the system of selective multiple voting, and the system of representation, which is the system of multiple seat constituencies. We would then have a situation in which neither of the systems would, in fact, be described in the way in which they are generally recognised by the people.</P>
      <P>I will, I think, resist the temptation and the challenge to go into the by-elections and the Presidential election, although I must admit I would dearly love to go into them because it gives me considerable pleasure to contemplate the fact that we have won six out of seven successive by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I reminded Deputies opposite of the fact that the enactment of that Constitution was the culminating step in the first stage of the existence of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the determination with which the Opposition tried to hang on to the then existing position of the Irish Free State.</P>
      <P>It is true that at that time the Fine Gael Party had not changed their minds about the electoral system and that they were still at that time in favour of changing from the system of proportional representation.  But, not everybody in the country was.  The determination to hang on to the status of a British dominion was so strong that even the concession of changing the electoral system at that time would not have been sufficient to in any way abate the Fine Gael opposition to the enactment of the Constitution of 1937. Every opportunity was taken by them to avail of every possible section of the Constitution to arouse some opposition to it in the hope that the ultimate result would be that we would remain the Irish Free State.</P>
