      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power when it is expected that the Loo Bridge to Morley's Bridge area of County Kerry will be served with electricity; and whether the ESB will give special consideration to a proposal to give priority to this area having regard to its tourist potential.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that, under the present programme for post development, the re-canvass of the Loo Bridge to Morley's Bridge area, County Kerry, should commence in about two months time and it is expected that construction work will commence before the end of the year.  The electricity supply will then be extended to all applicants who accept the terms quoted and have their houses wired.</P>
      <P>Tourist potential may be argued with equal strength for most other areas in the ESB Tralee District and for this reason and in the absence of a pressing case for exceptional consideration on an individual basis it is felt that the Board's programme for the district should not be disrupted.  Any disruption of the Board's plans would mean displacing others to whom commitments have already been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Foxford area, County Mayo, is one of a number of areas in the country where the quality of television reception is below the normal standard.  The Authority hopes to complete its surveys of these areas within the next few months.  It will then be in a position to decide on the further action to be taken to improve reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a letter box at the place in question is not warranted.  A letter box which was sited there formerly was withdrawn in 1964 because very few letters were posted in it.</P>

Only one flock is affected in each area.  The prescribed control measures covering restriction of movement of sheep on or off the farms concerned and dipping of the entire flocks are being taken by Cork County Council which is the appropriate authority for the purpose.</P>

      <P>Under Article 4 (1) (e) of the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967, made by me on the 13th April, 1967, the payment of housing subsidy to a local authority is conditional on lettings of new dwellings by the local authority, being in accordance with a rent scheme approved by me which takes account of the financial circumstances of the household and the standard of accommodation and amenity of the dwellings.  Under these regulations, subsidy will not be paid for any new houses let on fixed rents.</P>
      <P>The regulations also provide that the payment of housing subsidy by me is conditional on all existing dwellings being let at income-related rents &ldquo;as soon as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;. The decision as to when or how it is &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; to adopt such rent schemes is a matter in the first instance for the authority concerned, subject to review by me in connection with subsidy payments to the authority.</P>
      <P>Since these regulations apply equally to all local authorities, it will be seen that the question of a recommendation by me to Kerry County Council to adopt differential or graded rents did not arise.  I did, however, inform the council on the 21st February, 1967, that I would not be prepared to approve a scheme of fixed rents for eight new houses at Ballybunion.  On 22nd May, 1967, the council submitted a graded rent scheme applicable to single rural cottages provided by them after 1st April, 1967, for my approval and on the 2nd October, 1967, they also submitted a graded rent scheme applicable to the eight houses at Ballybunion.  I approved of these schemes, subject to certain conditions, on 26th May and 24th November, respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The factory inspectorate of my Department carries out inspections of building sites to ensure that the facilities mentioned by the Deputy are provided.  The inspectors report that while there is a general improvement in the position there are still some building sites in which conditions are unsatisfactory and in which employers are being pressed to provide better facilities.  If the Deputy wishes to furnish particulars of any sites where facilities are unsatisfactory they will be investigated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I promised during the passage of <Col N="416" /> the Redundancy Payments Bill, the promotion of legislation to provide for notice of termination of employment is being considered in my Department, but a minimum period of service is likely to be required under any legislation introduced.  The amount of travelling allowances and tool money is normally regarded as a matter for negotiation and collective bargaining between the parties concerned.  Where the rates give rise to disputes the conciliation and other services of the Labour Court are available to assist in reaching agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an underlying principle of the Social Welfare schemes dealing with disability, unemployment and widowhood that only one of the benefits should be payable to a person at any time.  There is provision in the Social Welfare Acts to make regulations for this purpose.  In certain circumstances, however, a person while under the qualifying age for old age pension may receive two forms of social welfare payment simultaneously because, in making the regulations, a generous approach was adopted permitting dual payments in certain cases.  However, after the age of 70, title to benefit other than old age (contributory) pension, widows' (contributory) pension or non-contributory old age pension ceases and only one or other of these pensions may be paid.  It is not proposed to alter this position.</P>
      <P>There is also the case of a widow receiving non-contributory widows' pension who has capital.  When she attains the age of 70, her means for non-contributory old age pension may be assessed at a higher level because of a difference between the methods of calculating means from capital for the two pensions.  The difference is due to a change made in 1963 which was designed to help widows with young families to support.</P>

Does he not consider that he should be operating a policy which will ensure that in no circumstances will the income of those people, when it is derived from social welfare benefits of one kind or another, be permitted to fall below that which they are receiving when they reach 70 years of age?

      <P>It applies only in the case of a widow with capital.  The same means test was applied heretofore as in the case of the old age pension&mdash;the first £25 was ignored; the next £375 was assessed at five per cent and anything over £400 at ten per cent.  In 1963, in order to improve the position of widows and children, my predecessor in office arranged that the first £100 of capital in respect of a widow would be ignored and that the balance would be assessed at five per cent.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both (a) and (b) of the question is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory provisions governing voluntary contributions are sections 4, 6 and 37 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and sections 3, 11 and 17 of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960. These provisions are designed to enable persons who cease to be insured compulsorily under the Social Welfare Acts <Col N="424" /> to preserve, if they wish, such title to pension as they may already have acquired by having not less than 156 contributions paid while compulsorily insured.  Thus a person compulsorily insured for widows' pensions purposes may, on ceasing to be so insured, only pay voluntary contributions for that pension and a person whose compulsory insurance covered, <i>inter alia,</i> widows' pensions and old age contributory pensions may only pay voluntary contributions for those pensions.</P>
    <P>Voluntary insurance under the Acts is not designed to enable a person to establish title to any pension for which he was not already covered when compulsorily insured.  In the context of the present Social Insurance Scheme I consider this position to be reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>That is a very big question and one which, in the context of a wider scheme, is under examination at the present time.  As the existing system of contributions applies it would not be fair to permit a person to contribute to a scheme of which he had not compulsorily the benefit.  Usually, it applies only to State employees&mdash;civil servants, local government employees, persons already covered by other pension schemes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that a female employed contributor whose usual employment is mainly in private domestic service does not satisfy the conditions for unemployment benefit until a period of ten years has elapsed since the date of her entry into insurance; whether he will give the reasons for this; and whether he will be prepared to introduce amending legislation, if necessary, to improve the position of such workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="425" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position as outlined in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Females employed in private domestic employment were excluded from cover for unemployment benefit under the former unemployment insurance scheme and that position was continued under the comprehensive scheme of social insurance established by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  The reason for excluding these employees in 1952 was that there was practically no unemployment amongst private domestics and, in the circumstances, it was considered to be unnecessary and unfair to seek contributions from these women for unemployment insurance when it was known that few could qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In 1965, the question of extending insurance cover for unemployment benefit to female private domestics was reviewed by my predecessor.  It emerged that the absence of such cover was a hardship in the case of older private domestic workers of long service who, once they became unemployed, could find it difficult, for age and other reasons, to obtain further suitable employment.  Accordingly, provision was made in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966, and relevant Regulations extending cover for unemployment benefit to female private domestics at a special reduced rate of contribution and limiting title to payment of benefit to women who had a substantial record of employment as evidenced by the contributions paid over a ten-year period.  I should mention that female domestics of 65 years and over are not subject to this test and they, therefore, can qualify for unemployment benefit in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>I consider that the 1966 legislation constitutes a considerable advance on the previous position by giving cover for unemployment benefit to those older domestics who are most likely to need it, in return for a modest increase in the contribution rate.  In the circumstances I do not propose to alter the existing position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact <Col N="426" /> that the reason the regulation was continued was to ensure a supply of domestics and to prevent people from seeking other jobs and staying out of domestic service for a reasonably long time?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

There has been considerable evidence of increased consumer demand for Irish made goods since the campaign was initiated and several manufacturers have attributed this very largely to the campaign.  Of course, it is not possible to ascertain with any degree of precision the extent to which the increased demand is attributable to the campaign itself or to other factors such as improved products and more intensive marketing by manufacturers or to a greater purchasing power in the community.</P>

      <P>I will not be much longer. I had almost concluded dealing with this question of the allegations made with regard to the fact that the amount of allocations from the Road Fund this year was not as high as last year.  I want to point out that the fact that, in the circumstances of imminent local elections we dealt responsibly with this matter of the Road Fund and took the necessary measures to maintain its solvency, indicates our belief in the intelligence of the electorate, our sincere commitment to the work of improving the roads and our recognition of the fact that this is necessarily a long term project and that it is on us will fall the task of implementing it.  We were advised, as I said, during the debate on this Estimate to learn the lessons of the past, and this is another aspect of local government from which I agree the people should learn the lesson of the past.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out to Deputy Fitzpatrick, I would have concluded <Col N="442" /> long ago but Deputy Fitzpatrick would not let me.  He is unable to listen to what I have to say but keeps on interrupting.  I want to go on to this question of the importance of learning the lesson from the past.  I want to show that the fact that, in these circumstances, we behaved responsibly and did not purport to allocate more money than it was advisable to do in relation to the volume of the commitments of the Road Fund and the amount of revenue available, is an indication that we learned our lesson from the malpractice of the Coalition Government in this regard in the year 1956-57.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick will remember that in that year Deputy Sweetman had the task of introducing the Budget and Deputy O'Donnell had the responsibility of administering the Road Fund.  In 1956-57, the income of the Road Fund was £4,762,000, the administrative expenses were £462,000, and as well as that necessary deduction from the income of the Road Fund, Deputy Sweetman abstracted, for the purpose of his Budget, a further £500,000, so that a total of £962,000 had to be deducted from the total income of £4,762,000.  This left a total of £3,800,000 available for work on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is objecting to my talking so long and now I have to stop to explain to him that there was no money taken from the Road Fund last year, or the year before or in any year, by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It was decided by the Government that certain improvements in social welfare and other things should be granted and, unlike <Col N="443" /> the Coalition Government, when we decided to grant these things, we also decided to raise the money with which to provide them.</P>
      <P>One of the measures the Government decided upon in order to raise the revenue to give the necessary increases to social welfare classes and to farmers mainly was to increase the amount of road taxation.  There was no question of taking any money from the Road Fund.  It was never in the Road Fund. The taxation for the purpose of making these improvements was imposed in the Budget.</P>
      <P>At 31st March, 1956, when Deputy O'Donnell had available to him a total of £3,800,000 from the Road Fund, the commitments in connection with road grants which had been allocated in previous years amounted to £2,800,000, so that with these commitments of £2,800,000 and with a total of £3,800,000 available, Deputy O'Donnell allocated, or purported to allocate, £5,177,000; in other words, he allocated £1,377,000 more than his income without taking any account at all of the outstanding commitments at the time. It is no wonder that the result of this was that when we took over in 1957 we found that every county council in the country was howling for money, not to embark on any new road projects but to honour the commitments that they had entered into to pay for work that was already done and to keep schemes that were in progress in operation, and the money was not there to do it.  The first thing the Fianna Fáil Government had to do in 1957 was to allocate a sum of £900,000 from the Exchequer to meet the most pressing demands on the Road Fund which could not be met because of the irresponsible way in which the Government dealt with the Road Fund in 1956-57.  I think we would have dealt with the Road Fund on this occasion just as we have done, even if we had not got the lesson of what resulted from the Road Fund being handled in this irresponsible way by the Coalition Government.  As Deputy Dillon said, we were lucky that we had this example before us and we were able to learn a lesson from the past in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> In this year these cuts in the Road Fund grant allocations were necessary for two reasons.  First of all, there was a substantial shortfall in revenue from motor taxation for 1966-67.  It amounted to £550,000, and this at a time when commitments were high.  The commitments at 31st March, 1967, were £6.5 million as compared with £5.2 million at 31st March, 1966.  It is clear that the corrective action we took this year, with local elections imminent, was necessary, and that the only course open was a reduction in the allocations for 1967-68.  This deduction was mainly effected by a reduction in the allocations for main road improvement.</P>
    <P>As I said, the fact that this was done is an indication that we are not prepared to act irresponsibly, and the reason is that we intend to stay here in the future.  We are not running out as the Opposition did in 1957.  We shall be operating the Road Fund next year and the year after and for many years after that.  I have to think not just of this year's allocation but also of the programme that we will be operating well into the 1970s.</P>
    <P>There have, unfortunately, been a number of serious and tragic accidents on the newly-constructed Nass Road, and these have naturally aroused a great deal of comment and discussion both here and elsewhere.  I appreciate that there is a genuine desire to do anything that is possible to avoid similar accidents in the future, and any worthwhile suggestions for improvements that may emerge will, I am sure, be implemented.  I am quite confident in saying that these accidents that have taken place cannot reasonably be ascribed to any fault in design or construction of the road.  It may be discovered that it would be possible to make improved regulations in regard to such things as entering on to or crossing the road, but the Naas Road itself has definitely been designed and constructed to the best standards for a road of its kind.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that it is designed as an all-purpose dual carriageway. I am quite definite in saying that it is a first-class example of modern road engineering.  The final section of the dual carriageway, that between <Col N="445" /> Rathcoole and the Kildare border at Blackchurch was opened to traffic just before Christmas.  Special informative signs have been erected by Dublin County Council on this section of the road.  I want to point out that there is no problem of excessive traffic on the road.  At present the route is, in fact, carrying less than half the volume of traffic for which it was designed.  The road was not designed as a motorway and because of that, access to it is available from adjoining lands and there are a number of intersections at one grade.</P>
    <P>I travel this road myself a number of times every day.  I feel absolutely confident in saying that this road is in fact the safest road in Ireland.  There is no accident-causing factor arising from the construction and alignment of the road.  A road safety propaganda film issued by my Department has as its theme that accidents do not happen, they are caused.  I think it is quite clear from the history of this road that even with the highest possible engineering standards of design and construction, these are not sufficient of themselves to prevent accidents happening. The full and continuous co-operation of road users is equally essential.  This has been the experience in all modern countries.  No matter how high the standard of roads is, accidents will occur as long as there are people who do not continuously bear in mind while they are in control of motor vehicles, that their own lives and the lives of other people depend on their exercising continuous concentration, vigilance and care in the handling of their vehicles while they are driving.</P>
    <P>The cost of converting this road to motorway standards, including the provision of flyovers, underpasses and so on, is being examined.  I may say that the preliminary indications are that the cost would be very substantial and, taking into consideration the amount of road work throughout the country as a whole that is urgently required to be done, it is unlikely that the cost of raising this road to motorway standards will be undertaken in the near future.  I may say I am satisfied that excessive speed has been a factor <Col N="446" /> in the accidents on the dual carriageway, and I have no doubt that the speed limits which are now imposed will contribute towards safety on the roads.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that a speed limit is not in itself a guarantee of safety, but it makes a very definite contribution towards safety and in particular it will lessen the incidence of fatal accidents.  In this respect I might point out that the Road Safety Bill which is before the Dáil, and which got bogged down due to the implacable attitude of the opposition to the introduction of a statutory blood alcohol content level as a disqualification from driving includes a provision enabling the imposition of an overall speed limit if that is decided upon.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a statement issued by me on the 19th October last, I have arranged that a number of urgent studies will be brought to completion as quickly as possible by the relevant authorities, where appropriate in consultation with An Foras Forbartha. These will include among other things an examination of the junctions, including the feasibility, costs, etc., of schemes designed to improve them, including schemes for traffic lights, lighting and so on, and an examination of other access points.  An Foras Forbartha are carrying out a survey of accidents on the road, that is a survey of the manoeuvres and so on of the vehicles involving 203 accidents during the year 1966-67 for which details are available.  When these studies are completed whatever measures are necessary will be taken without delay.  At the same time, I want to repeat my belief that without a universal appreciation of the responsibility that rests on drivers of motor vehicles any improvement that may be made will be of little avail.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the general approach to driving tests before the issue of driving licences.  I do not claim that the system is perfect or foolproof.  I realise that some people may not produce their normal standard performance when they are being tested and that the most experienced and competent drivers make mistakes.  I accept also that the fact that a driver <Col N="447" /> is thoroughly competent does not necessarily mean that he will behave responsibly at all times while he is driving. Even if some people may be unlucky, the system of insisting on driving tests, that people reach a reasonable standard of competence and have a knowledge of the rules of the road is justified if it raises the overall standard of driving even by a little bit.</P>
    <P>There is no inherent right to drive on the roads.  Incompetent driving constitutes a danger to the public and the people have a right to the maximum possible protection.  They are entitled to insist on the highest standard of competence, sobriety and the mechanical perfection of the vehicles themselves.  It is not an argument in favour of the granting of a driving licence to say that a person needs a driving licence to earn his livelihood.  The only consideration is whether the applicant has the required degree of competence and the required knowledge of the rules of the road.  I am quite satisfied that everything feasible is done to ensure that people undergoing these tests get a fair chance.  If an occasional mistake is made, it is much more important that the public should have this protection.</P>
    <P>The question of amenities generally was raised during this debate.  I can assure the House that the allocation of money to my Department every year, in my experience, is made on the basis of the maximum amount it is believed possible to provide.  The only way in which the Exchequer can provide money is from the pockets of the people.  In addition to such essential things as housing, water, sewerage and roads, my Department through the local authorities, are responsible for the provision of amenities.  When a housing scheme, whether it is a local authority scheme or a private scheme, is built and occupied, there is an immediate and understandable pressure for the provision of amenities, such as public parks, swimming pools and so on.  I agree that every effort should be made to provide them as rapidly as possible but, as in everything else, we cannot get away from the fact that the provision of these things also costs money and it <Col N="448" /> may be that their provision will be in competition with the needs of those who have not yet got houses.  Here again, I think the demands made might be more reasonable.  There should be an appreciation of the fact that progress in the provision of these things must, of necessity, be gradual but instead of that we have the same approach here, that since nobody objects to the provision of these things they should be provided and if they are not provided immediately the only explanation is that the Minister and the local authorities take some fiendish satisfaction in depriving the people of these things.</P>
    <P>The Opposition attitude was to say that this Government are not giving sufficient money for these things whereas in fact they know the position is that the Government have only found it feasible to obtain from the community the amount of money which is being expended on all the different services coming within the ambit of the Vote of Local Government. I do not think it unreasonable to expect people to accept that, taking account of the limited capacity of the community to provide finance, the provision of such things as public parks and swimming pools, community centres and so on, essential though they may be for reasonable living conditions in modern circumstances, is, to a certain extent, in competition with more basic needs such as the provision of houses, water, sewerage, road improvements, fire brigades and many other things and that therefore some delay in the provision of these amenities may be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>However, I agree that people are quite right to press for these things but I think it should be understood that the Minister would naturally consider it more important still that people at present inadequately housed, without facilities of water and sewerage, should have these deficiencies remedied.  Also there are still, of course, people in many parts of the country who are served by really deplorable roads, at the same time, despite the demands on capital money available to my Department it was found possible to make some progress <Col N="449" /> this year in the provision of swimming pools in different places throughout the country.  In June last, five local authorities were notified that finance would be made available during the current year to enable them to start building swimming pools.  The five areas were: Ennis, Enniscorthy, Tipperary, Tuam and Dublin City, but in addition I have recently informed three other local authorities, Carlow UDC, Ballinasloe UDC and Kildare County Council, that I am prepared to consider making capital allocations available to them in the coming financial year to enable construction of pools to start in their areas.</P>
    <P>Progress in regard to the areas which have already been authorised to start is at different stages in the different areas and I do not think it necessary to go into that, but there are 33 other proposals before the Department which are estimated to cost in all over £1.2 million.  It is hoped that progress will be made with these gradually over the years.  I do not undertake to be able to allow them all to proceed at the one time.  I have indicated certain things that I shall take into consideration in regard to deciding priority.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the Estimate I intimated that one of the considerations I would take into account when deciding on the individual pools which would be given prior claim to available capital would be the amount of local voluntary subscriptions available.  As I said, in view of the urgency of other things such as housing, water and sewerage, it is not unreasonable to expect a certain amount of self-help in regard to these things.  Another consideration would be the length of time a firm proposal is before the Department, in other words, other things being equal the oldest proposal should receive priority.  Still another consideration would be the question of geographical distribution of swimming pools.  For instance, Kildare County Council have five proposals for swimming pools before the Department and it would obviously be difficult to justify providing capital for all these towns in preference to areas which are still awaiting their first pool.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Another consideration will, of course, be&mdash;I think this is a reasonable one also&mdash;the securing of the best value from the capital available, that is, the more modest projects should be encouraged in our particular circumstances. In view of the many demands on the amount of capital it is possible to provide for local government purposes generally I think a reasonable allocation has been made for swimming pools this year.</P>
    <P>The Government have always been conscious of the desirability of assisting farmers to undertake the improvement of jointly used accommodation and bog roads and minor drainage works.  They introduced the Rural Improvements Scheme for this purpose as long ago as 1943 and supported that scheme financially in the intervening years to the maximum extent consistent with the need to provide for other essential services such as the provision of aids to agriculture, education, health, social welfare and so on, while keeping taxation within acceptable limits.</P>
    <P>In the five-year period to 31st March, 1967, total expenditure on the Rural Improvements Scheme amounts to approximately £1,250,000, which was an increase of over one-third over the preceding five-year period.  This problem of the repair of accommodation roads has to be dealt with on a long term basis.  It cannot be solved overnight and despite this increased expenditure in recent years arrears of applications have accumulated and it was for that reason that it was decided in August, 1965, to put a stay on new applications until the old ones were cleared up.  The arrears of applications received prior to August, 1965 have now been dealt with.  It is obvious from this debate that there is considerable misunderstanding in regard to the decision to replace the minor employment, bog development and rural improvements schemes which were formerly administered by the Special Employments Schemes Office by the new local improvements scheme. County councils were asked by circular letter from my Department on 14th August, 1967 to administer this scheme which it is proposed to introduce from 1st April, 1968.</P>
    <P>The main features of this new scheme <Col N="451" /> are, first, that it will cover the repair and improvement of roads, other than public roads, used jointly by two or more landholders for the purpose of access to agricultural land or turbary and the repair and improvement of minor drainage serving the property of two or more land holders.  All grants will be conditional on the payment in advance by the beneficiaries of both kinds of a contribution in accordance with the approved scale.  Administrative expenses within a limit of ten per cent may be added to the cost of wages, materials and plant.  The allocation of each council out of the annual provision voted by the Dáil will be based on the total of the minor employment schemes, the bog development scheme and the rural improvements schemes grants over a period of years.  The design and selection of the schemes to be carried out each year will rest with the councils.  Grants under this scheme need not be limited to areas of high unemployment but priority in employment will be given to suitable workmen registered at the employment exchanges. In the recruitment of gangers and other supervisory workers priority should be given to persons formerly employed by the Office of Public Works, where such persons are available and suitable.</P>
    <P>The carrying out of work under this scheme will not involve any responsibility for the council for future maintenance. Legislation will be necessary in order to introduce this new scheme and a draft Bill empowering county councils to carry out these minor schemes is almost ready.  It will contain enabling provisions for minor drainage schemes as well as roads.  There are a number of advantages in amalgamating these three schemes, minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and rural improvements schemes, into a single scheme.  For instance, the three former schemes dealt basically with the same types of work, accommodation and bog roads and drains, and the pooling of the schemes ensures that grants will be allocated impartially for the most necessary work.  The local contribution is a test <Col N="452" /> of the real need for a work.  The distribution of minor employment schemes grants on an employment basis took no account of the real volume of urgent work in each area and in the electoral divisions where unemployment was high; saturation point in regard to work requiring to be done was reached and there was a shortage of suitable work on which to expend the money, while in other areas the employment allocation was too small to do worthwhile improvements. Now, while employment will still be through the employment exchanges the work can be done where it is most needed.  Lastly, the unified scheme is more economical to administer.</P>
    <P>To compensate for the fact that there will be no full cost grants which were available for the minor employment and bog development schemes, a new scale of contributions has been approved by the Government giving very low rates for landowners with low average valuations.  The new scale for the lower valuations compares favourably with the old scale.  For valuations under £5 the old scale was ten per cent contribution, the new scale is 2½ per cent.  For valuations of £5 and over and under £7, the old scale was 12½ per cent whereas the new scale is five per cent.  For valuations of £7 and over and under £10 the old contribution was 15 per cent and the new one is ten per cent.  For valuations of £10 and over and under £15 the old contribution was 20 per cent and the new one is 15 per cent.  For valuations of £15 and over and under £25 the old contribution was 25 per cent and the new contribution will be 20 per cent. For valuations of £25 and over and under £50 there is no change, the contribution is 30 per cent.  For valuations of £50 and over and under £75 the old contribution was 40 per cent and the new contribution is also 40 per cent.  For valuations of £75 and over and under £100 the new contribution will be 50 per cent as against 40 per cent under the old contribution.  For valuations of £100 and over, the new contribution will be 60 per cent as against 50 per cent formerly.  The position is that contributions in respect of valuations up to £25 will be less than <Col N="453" /> formerly, whereas contributions in respect of valuations between £25 and £75 will be the same, and for valuations over £75 the contributions will now be higher.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions that the payment of local contributions should be made compulsory.  I want to say that it is not proposed that this should be done.  Apart from other objections this idea is not practicable.  Compulsory powers could not be enforced without detailed investigations of individual circumstances, without considering a person's objections and so on, and there would have to be the right of appeal.  Such a procedure would be unworkable in relation to these minor schemes.  In any event, experience does not show that such powers are necessary. The ratio of contributions which I have read out is moderate for landholders with medium and low valuations and it is a joint contribution and there is nothing to prevent other beneficiaries making up the deficiencies caused either by the unwillingness or the inability of a particular landowner to pay.  Therefore it is not proposed to make these contributions compulsory and in fact I do not see how it could be done.</P>
    <P>As I said, county councils have received a circular letter from my Department regarding this.  So far, 19 councils have agreed to operate the scheme; five counties have not decided; two counties have referred it back to the Department, mainly on the question of the amount allowed for administrative costs; and there is one county which indicated that they are not prepared to operate the scheme.  In regard to this question of the amount allocated for administrative costs, which is ten per cent, one of the main reasons for the transfer of the schemes was the high overheads involved in maintaining a separate organisation engaged exclusively on the operation of these schemes and the expectation of substantial economies by using the existing county council administrative and engineering machine.  I think that was a reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that extra engineers might have <Col N="454" /> to be appointed in order to operate these schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputies and councillors should co-operate in trying to keep administrative costs as low as possible and we should not be too ready to assume that extra staff will be needed for this.  Certainly in many cases extra staff will not be required, there may be some in which there will be, but we should all have the same interest in regard to trying to keep the administrative costs as low as possible so that the maximum amount of money available will go into new work.  To facilitate councils they are being allowed the maximum degree of freedom in regard to their organisational arrangements.  As I said, the funds available to the scheme are necessarily-limited and it is undesirable to divert too large a proportion of them to administrative expenses.  It would be desirable that it should be accepted on the basis suggested for at least a trial period.</P>
      <P>I would suggest then that Deputies and Councillors should co-operate in trying to get the optimum results from this new scheme and from the amount of money available and that they should wait and see how the scheme operates at least before pressing for any increased allowance for administrative expenses.  Obviously the more money that can be utilised for actual improvement the better it will be so that it is desirable to keep the administrative expenses to a minimum.</P>

      <P>We hope that every county will agree to operate this and that they will co-operate with us and that they will not press for an increase in the allocation for administrative expenses until at least it can be shown beyond doubt that this is necessary; that they will try to utilise as much as possible of this money for the purpose of getting this very essential work in rural areas done.</P>
      <P>I should say also that the Parliamentary Secretary has received a deputation mainly in connection with engineers fees and the case that was put forward to him is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the fact that the Rural Improvement Scheme had been operating very much in arrears and that the provisional allocation based on the current year's provision of £350,000 does not adequately allow for this.  As I pointed out today this is a provisional allocation only and each county's share was based on the amount of grant allocated in the five years up to and including 1965-66.  I have no doubt that there will be difficulty in dealing with the backlog of applications within this allocation and as I said the total amount that will be available for the purpose has not yet been decided.  Therefore, there is still a possibility that these provisional amounts notified may be increased when this total amount available is known.  This problem of arrears of applications derives to a certain extent from the cut in the provision for the three schemes which it was necessary to impose in 1966-67.  The allocation for 1965-66 was £576,000 but in the financial circumstances that existed at the time it was necessary to cut this to £256,000 in 1966-67 and this obviously accounted for a certain amount of the arrears.  The outstanding application forms are being passed to the county councils according as each council confirms their intention to operate the scheme and at the same time the persons who have asked for application forms are being told to apply to the councils if they will wish to pursue their applications.  It has been agreed that an excess of £20,000 on this year's provision of £250,000 for the Rural Improvement Scheme may be incurred <Col N="456" /> in order to complete schemes for which contributions have been paid.  Persons to whom offers of grants have been made but who have not yet paid contributions have been informed that our time limit for the acceptance of contributions has now expired and that if they want to have the offer re-opened next year they should apply to the county council.  The number of live offers still outstanding is not very great.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputies to co-operate in getting this scheme going which I think will result in having this work done more expeditiously, more satisfactorily and in having a more intelligent selection of the works to be done made.</P>
    <P>This year then once again I think we are able to show considerable progress in every aspect of local government but as I pointed out not without a considerable increase in cost and that is how it will be in future.  Our programme for the conduct of the nation's affairs can be very simply stated.  It is, first of all, to increase the national income so as to make it possible for the Government to improve social conditions and it is only because we realise that social improvements can only be made if there is economic growth that we have been able to maintain a continuous improvement over the years. Our interest in economic expansion is to increase the scope for re-distribution of income and for the improvement of living standards all round.  My own opinion is that the Opposition would be well advised to approach the matter of local government services in a more responsible manner, to abandon the attitude that they have shown here of demanding more in every possible service and at the same time demanding lower rents, lower rates and lower taxes.  The people have sufficient intelligence to know that this is not possible and that is why we continue as Government. I would suggest to the Opposition that this fatuous approach of ignoring the inconvenient and inescapable problem of finance is not appropriate to public representatives who have undertaken to try to remedy problems such as the housing situation. It is, I suppose, not quite so incongruous coming from a person who has <Col N="457" /> already taken the precaution of precluding himself from ever playing a practical part in the provision of houses especially if he is a member of a religious order that is not noted for its commitment to the principle of holy poverty and who is therefore well insulated from the necessity of having to consider such worldly matters as money but who, because&mdash;unlike housing, education is within the sphere of activity of his order, might be expected to have more interesting views on the question of whether or not the standard of education available to children should be related to the capacity of the children's parents to pay for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The total provision in the seven Votes for which I am responsible, is £38,325,400.  This represents an increase of £4,547,150 in the provision for the <Col N="458" /> previous financial year.  A further sum of £3,000,000 is being provided under Vote 8&mdash;Public Works and Buildings &mdash;for the building of new schools and the enlargement and improvement of existing schools.  The large amount of our resources that we are now devoting to education can be gauged from the fact that in 1957-58 the total expenditure was less than £16,000,000.</P>
    <P>I shall now proceed to various Votes and give some facts and figures.</P>
    <P>Vote 27 comprises (a) the administration costs of the Department, and (b) the provision for the services which formerly appeared in what was a separate Science and Art Vote.</P>
    <P>At £1,408,000 this year's estimate shows an increase of £135,050 in the amount for last year.</P>
    <P>The following items account for the main portion of that increase: (i) provision for the additional staff necessitated by the extension of educational services and the normal incremental progression; (ii) the provision of a new subhead relating to Educational Research. A sum of £10,000 is being made available under this subhead for applied socio-economic, psychological and other basic educational research most of which will be undertaken by research workers in academic institutions; (iii) an increase of £10,500 in the provision for language research; (iv) the provision for Scientific Research Grants to students has been increased this year by £12,900.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the language research already undertaken experimental courses in Irish for junior standards were in operation in 200 national schools during the school year 1966-67. The experience gained in these pilot courses was applied to the permanent courses for junior standards which have recently been issued to the schools. Courses for the middle and senior standards in national schools are also being prepared: these will similarly be tried on an experimental basis before being issued to all schools.</P>
    <P>On the post-primary side, a remedial course in Irish conversation for new entrants to post-primary schools has been prepared and tested experimentally and has been made available to the <Col N="459" /> schools.  A full conversation course for the junior standards in post-primary schools is also being prepared and will be tried out in a number of schools during the 1967-68 school year before being recommended generally.</P>
    <P>Up to 1964 the scheme of scientific research grants was confined to research in Science and the awards were normally tenable for one year only.  In 1965, however, the Scheme was extended and revised so that the engineering sciences were included in the scheme and awards were made for a maximum of three years.  Due to the extension of the Scheme on this basis and the increase in student numbers the number of awards has increased considerably&mdash; from 23 in 1962-63 to 82 in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>The net amount which is being provided for primary education in the present financial year is £19,844,000, which is an increase of almost one million pounds over the sum voted last year.</P>
    <P>It is customary, when dealing with this Estimate, to give some outline statistics relating to primary education for the previous school year.  I propose to continue this practice as I feel that it helps to illustrate the overall picture.  For the school year ended 30th June, 1966, there were 505,225 pupils on rolls in national schools, which shows a marginal decrease&mdash; 1,327 pupils&mdash;on the figure for the previous year.  This decrease would be accounted for by the larger numbers moving into post-primary education at an earlier age.  The number of teachers employed in the schools was 14,614, an increase of 145 as against the previous year.  The actual number of schools decreased by 50 to 4,797.  This is an indication of the effect of the implementation of the policy of discontinuing where possible small schools and bringing the children concerned to larger school units where better educational facilities can be provided.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to note that, if we divide the number of pupils on rolls by the number of teachers employed we get a figure of slightly under 35 pupils per teacher.  But, of course, this does not give a true picture of conditions <Col N="460" /> as they are in the schools.  In the smaller schools there may be as few as 14 pupils per teacher, while classes of over 40 children are still, alas, too common in large city schools.  As Deputies will know, however, a policy of steadily reducing the pupil-teacher ratio has been operated over recent years, and I am happy to say that we are making a further reduction this year in the number required for the appointment of additional teachers in schools having enrolments of between 80 and 320 pupils.  This means that a third teacher may now be appointed when an average enrolment of 80 pupils has been established (as against a requirement of 90 pupils formerly).  The intention is to continue improving the pupil/teacher ratio until the position will be reached when no teacher will have more than 35 pupils in his class.  To achieve this two things, in the main, will be necessary: more effective use of the teaching personnel and an increase in the number of trained teachers coming into the service.</P>
    <P>As to the first of these, I am heartened by the evidence that there is a developing appreciation of the educational advantages of the policy of securing larger schools.  The amalgamation of smaller schools is now proceeding in a reasonably smooth way. A teacher who, through serving in a one-teacher school, has to teach all classes from infants to sixth is far less effective than a teacher who, though in charge of a larger number of pupils, has only two at most different classes to deal with.  Therefore, larger schools, while ensuring a more rational use of the teaching personnel, also ensure better education.  In the matter of training additional teachers the position is that over the past seven years the output of the Training Colleges has been steadily increased.  The recent extension of St. Patrick's Training College for men teachers will add very considerably to the number of trained teachers being turned out annually.  The total number of persons who successfully completed training as national teachers in June, 1967, was 585.</P>
    <P>One thing which continues to be a <Col N="461" /> source of worry and dissatisfaction is the number of national school buildings which are in need of replacement. Last year I was pleased to inform the House that a record had been achieved in primary school building in the year 1965-66.  In 1966-67 we concentrated to a large extent in endeavouring to have running water and proper sanitation in schools where these facilities were not heretofore available.  Notwithstanding this, over 19,500 pupil places were provided through new schools and extensions during that year.  I will not rest content, however, until all our school children are housed in decent buildings with reasonable standards of hygiene, heating and general comfort.  One step I have recently taken is to give authority to school managers to have the heating and sanitary systems in schools brought up to suitable standard, where this is necessary; and I have given an undertaking that, where a manager has such work done satisfactorily, a grant will be paid towards its cost.  I have heard it said that some managers have interpreted this decision as imposing further responsibility on them.  That certainly was not the intention.  The decision was taken in full agreement with the Catholic Clerical Managers Association and the aim was to reduce official procedure to a minimum and thereby cut out delay in having urgently required improvements attended to.  I understand that, in fact, quite a number of school managers have readily availed themselves of the freedom of action which is now offered to them in effecting necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall position in the matter of school building, improvement and expansion, I think that in view of recent events it is necessary to put matters in their proper perspective. The pupil population in our national schools continues to be about 500,000. If we take the life of a national school to be 80 years&mdash;a conservative enough figure in the case of a school which is reasonably maintained &mdash; then we require to provide about 6,000 school places per annum in order to meet ordinary replacements.  Anything we <Col N="462" /> provide over and above that number is eating into the back-log of old and unsuitable schools.  Now let us see how we have been faring in that respect. Over the past four years we have by way of new schools and major schemes of improvement and extension provided 87,000 school places.  Thus we have been clearing the arrears at the rate of over 15,000 places each year.  This by any standard is a very big programme. A major factor contributing to it is the large number of school managers who are fully alive to their responsibilities. I notice incidentally that great play was made by some people on the fact that in authorising managers to proceed on their own towards the provision of satisfactory heating and sanitary systems in schools we told them not to proceed without prior consultation with the Department in any case where due to amalgamation or replacement the life expectancy of the school was less than five years.  This meant in effect that major works should not be carried out in the case of such a school.  As school managers know, however, my Department has never refused a grant for urgent works needed to keep a school going for a few years until the arrangements for replacing it were completed.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of primary education to which I feel I should make reference here.  It is the education of mentally handicapped children. Since the commencement of the financial year 1966-67, new primary schools for mentally handicapped pupils have been established at Kilkenny, An Uaimh, Drumcar, Waterford city, Ennis, Enniscorthy and Castlebar, and the near future will see two more such schools opened, at Cashel and Cootehill.  At the same time, facilities in Dublin for the education of mentally handicapped children are being extended.</P>
    <P>In almost all these instances the arrangements at local level for the establishment of the schools and for the organisation of transport of the children to and from school, as well as for the provision of school meals, have been undertaken by voluntary committees.  The men and women who form these committees have displayed <Col N="463" /> an energy and efficiency to match the charity and high idealism which inspires them and I want to avail myself of this opportunity to thank them most sincerely.</P>
    <P>The problem of the retarded or slow-learning child in the primary schools is another matter that demands attention.  I expect to have before me shortly the report of a Special Committee established in October, 1965, to advise on this problem and I have no doubt that their recommendations will assist me in my endeavours to improve the educational facilities for such children.</P>
    <P>Among the first things about which I expressed myself as being unhappy when I assumed responsibility for the Department of Education was the primary school certificate examination. It is something to which I gave considerable thought, and on which I sounded the views of many people. When I announced recently, therefore, that this annual examination would be discontinued and that a system of record cards would be introduced, showing the progress through the primary school of each individual child, I was satisfied that I was doing the right thing.  Such public comment as has since been made on that decision, and the many private opinions that have been offered to me, encourage me in the hope that the new system will be no mean contribution towards the general advance in education.</P>
    <P>The net total amount proposed for secondary education is £8,295,000. This is an increase of about £1,545,000 on the amount provided last year in the original and Supplementary Estimates. The principal headings under which the increase occurs are supplemental grants to schools in lieu of tuition fees, transport services, grants towards the cost of free school books, science and equipment grants, teachers' salaries, building grants to secondary schools, capitation grants and courses for secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimate, I gave details of my plans for the provision of free education at post-primary level.  The implementation <Col N="464" /> of these plans in so far as secondary schools are concerned is reflected in the three new provisions in the Estimates for the current financial year totalling £739,000 for supplemental grants in lieu of tuition fees, transport services and grants towards the cost of free school books.</P>
    <P>One-third, approximately, of the supplemental grants to be paid in respect of the school-year 1967-68 will fall for payment in the current financial year.  As members of the House are no doubt already aware, the success of the scheme has been very great indeed. Participation by schools in the scheme has so far exceeded expectations that 92 per cent of day pupils will now benefit as compared with the 75 per cent on which the estimate was based. The higher participation of pupils and the great increase in enrolments means that the numbers qualifying for grants towards the cost of free school books will also be higher than provided for. Accordingly, the amount required for payment of the supplemental grants and the grants towards the cost of free school books in the current year may be expected to exceed the provision in the Estimate by more than £150,000. I will refer again to this matter in connection with the Supplementary Estimate which is being introduced to meet the increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>The number of pupils on the rolls of secondary schools increased by approximately 5,000 to 103,558 in 1966-67 as compared with 1965-66. There are more than 118,000 pupils on the rolls of secondary schools in the present school year&mdash;an increase of about 15,000 compared with 1966-67 or approximately three times greater than the previous annual increase.</P>
    <P>In order to afford further assistance to the authorities of secondary schools towards providing the additional accommodation required by the growth in pupil numbers, I have made some special arrangements.  First, the State contribution towards the cost has been increased from 60 per cent to 70 per cent and secondly the annual amount of capital being made available is being very substantially increased.  This capital is being channelled through my <Col N="465" /> Department.  The money will be made available to schools by way of a direct grant of 70 per cent, and the remaining 30 per cent by way of loan repayable over 15 years.  I have, also, made arrangements for making available to school authorities, where necessary to meet urgent requirements, pre-fabricated classrooms, on which the 70 per cent grant is payable.  These measures together with the increased accommodation being provided in the vocational schools are ensuring that the school accommodation is adequate for the demand.</P>
    <P>Further assistance to schools, for which provision is included in the estimates, takes the form of grants towards the cost of furnishing and equipping special subject rooms. Hitherto, such grants have been provided in two ways, namely, grants on a capitation basis in respect of classes following approved courses in experimental science, domestic science and manual instruction (woodwork) and, more recently, grants in respect of the furnishing and equipping of science laboratories.</P>
    <P>In view of the great expansion in the teaching of science, the increased costs of furnishing and equipping science laboratories, the revision and enlargement of the science syllabuses and the fact that the existing grant arrangements for the subject were not regarded as adequate to meet demands, I decided to introduce as from the school-year 1967-68 an amended scheme of grants for science in lieu of all existing arrangements.  Under the amended scheme, payments, subject to maximum figures, may be made on the basis of 75 per cent of vouched approved expenditure for the equipping and/or the furnishing of science laboratories and for the renewal or replacement of science equipment or material.</P>
    <P>Similar schemes on the basis of 70 per cent of vouched approved expenditure are being introduced as from 1967-68 for domestic science, woodwork, metalwork, arts and crafts, geography and physical education.  The total estimate for these grants for the <Col N="466" /> current financial year is £280,000 as against an estimate of £150,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The number of registered teachers in receipt of incremental salary in 1966-67 was 4,461 as against 4,253 in 1965-66.  In addition, 434 teachers were in receipt of the special supplementary allowance for probationer teachers in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the need to ensure the continuance of adequate growth in the number of qualified teaching personnel.  I am very pleased, therefore, to be able to say that as from 1st August last the supplementary allowance of £200 per annum payable to probationer teachers which has not changed since its introduction during the school-year 1961-62 has been raised to £360 per annum.  In addition, the £52 per annum in the case of married men and the £39 per annum in the case of women and unmarried men awarded to teachers in receipt of incremental salary with effect from 1st June, 1966, is also payable to probationer teachers.</P>
    <P>In recent years, increasing provision has been made in the Estimates for refresher and training courses for teachers.  In the current year's Estimates, this provision has been extended still further.  Apart from the increase in the number of courses, there is, for the first time, a provision for the payment of maintenance and travelling allowances in respect of the attendance of recognised secondary teachers at summer courses.  These allowances are in line with those already payable in the case of vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants towards the provision of modern language teaching aids introduced with effect from 1st August, 1964, hitherto has been confined to modern continental languages. Suitable courses in Irish involving such aids are now in operation and, therefore, the scheme has been extended to enable grants to be made in respect of these courses.  The provision in the subhead has been increased for this purpose.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimates, I expressed my gratitude to the secondary and vocational school associations <Col N="467" /> for their co-operation generally and in particular for their wholehearted co-operation in the framing of new syllabuses in all subjects of the intermediate certificate course.  It is my pleasure again to express my deep appreciation of their continued co-operation and also on this occasion to voice my gratitude to the authorities of the National University of Ireland, who with the school associations have so generously given of their assistance and co-operation during the past year with the detailed investigation that has been carried out in relation to the structure of the leaving certificate courses and examination.  A committee comprising representatives of the National University, the various school and teacher associations and my Department have furnished recommendations on this matter and I hope that after the university and the associations will have had an opportunity of giving detailed consideration to these recommendations and of the furnishing of their views on them, to be in a position to have the work of framing new syllabuses in all subjects at post-intermediate certificate level put in train.</P>
    <P>At Estimate time last year, I announced my intention of bringing into operation as from 1st April, 1967, a scheme of free transport to post-primary schools.  The object of the scheme is to make post-primary education available to children who hitherto were denied it because they lived too far away from the nearest post-primary school.  The basic requirement in providing free transport is that the child lives three miles or more from a post-primary school.</P>
    <P>Because of the amount of expertise in transport matters required to launch a scheme of this magnitude, I assigned the administration of the scheme to CIE.  Wherever possible CIE will use their own vehicles, but they will also enter into contracts with private transport operators.  The scheme is being implemented in two ways:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Where eligible children already use or are within reach of public scheduled services, my Department are paying the cost of <Col N="468" /> transport to the nearest post-primary centre;</P>
    <P>(ii)  In districts where no public transport services are available special school services are being organised.</P>
    <P>A pupil will normally be entitled to free transport only to the nearest suitable post-primary centre to his home, but I have made certain transitional arrangements for existing pupils eligible for free transport who are not attending the nearest suitable centre.</P>
    <P>I originally anticipated that it would take two or three years to implement the scheme in full and that it would be possible to provide only a limited number of services in the first year.</P>
    <P>Thanks, however, to the hard work and enthusiasm of all those entrusted with the organisation of the scheme, progress on providing free transport has surpassed all expectations.  Of the 55,000 children who are eligible, service has now been provided for 52,500, using every available bus in CIE's fleet and every suitable bus in private ownership&mdash;724 vehicles in all.</P>
    <P>To provide for the remaining pupils and to improve the standards of service, the Government are making capital of the order of £1m. available to CIE for a further 230 specially designed school buses which will be built in their works at Inchicore and by three private firms in Dundalk. Pending delivery of these vehicles, CIE are hiring a sufficient number of buses from Ulsterbus Ltd., to enable them to give service to all eligible pupils before the end of this month. The scheme will be fully implemented, therefore, in less than a year from the date of its initiation.</P>
    <P>The progress made means that the original estimate of £300,000 is now inadequate.  The cost in the current financial year will amount to £840,000 and a supplementary to cover the additional cost is being introduced.  On the basis of the present number of eligible children the cost of the scheme in a full year is estimated at £1,370,000.</P>
    <P>The net sum being provided for the vocational education service is £4,735,000.  This is an increase of <Col N="469" /> £1,211,040.  The main reason for seeking this increase is to enable the vocational education committee to meet the additional cost arising out of the provision of free whole-time day courses of vocational education for all pupils who were eligible for enrolment in post-primary schools and who elected to enrol in vocational schools.  The scheme for the provision of free education in vocational schools has been inaugurated since the commencement of the present school year.  It has necessitated the provision of very considerable extra classroom accommodation and teaching equipment and the recruitment of a large number of additional teachers.  I am happy to inform the House that the inauguration of the scheme and its continued operation have been entirely successful and I should like to take this opportunity of making a sincere expression of gratitude to the vocational education committees and all their staffs for the great enthusiasm and efficiency with which they made all the arrangements which enabled the scheme to be launched so successfully.</P>
    <P>I am also happy to be able to say that the bulk purchase of a large number of prefabricated classroom units arranged by my Department enabled the very urgently required additional classroom accommodation to be provided early in the present session at a very economic cost.</P>
    <P>I referred in the House last year to my intention to have the machinery for the appointment of vocational teachers overhauled with a view to its improvement. In the meantime, a new procedure for the appointment of permanent whole-time vocational teachers has been introduced and has already been adopted on a trial basis.  I am glad to say that it has been working very satisfactorily and has up to the present dealt with the appointment of the great majority of the new teachers recruited from the commencement of the present session as well as the large number of appointments which resulted from the transfer of existing teachers from one committee's area to another's.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> The total number of candidates who presented themselves in 1967 for my Department's day group certificate examinations was 19,444 as compared with 16,767 in 1966.  The increased number of candidates is a gratifying reflection of the growing appreciation of the valuable benefits of vocational education.  On the topic of examinations, I may mention that the new course leading to the common intermediate certificate was introduced in vocational schools last year and that pupils of these schools will shortly be presenting themselves for that examination too as well as for the group certificate.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this Estimate to which I should like to refer is the increased provision for teacher-training courses conducted by the Department. As a result of this provision an increased number of trainee-teachers will on the successful completion of their training courses, become available for employment in the vocational education service whose needs in the matter of additional teachers will be increasing because of the growth in the enrolment of pupils.</P>
    <P>I would now like to bring the House up to date in relation to the position in regard to the regional technical colleges. At first it was decided to provide eight colleges which would be sited in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Carlow, Dundalk, Athlone and Sligo.  As recently announced it has now been decided to provide a ninth college which will be erected in Letterkenny.  The intention is that these nine colleges with the existing colleges in Dublin will provide a complex of such colleges covering the entire country.</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed to make £7,000,000 available to meet the cost of building these colleges and has also decided that this sum will be met direct from State funds, i.e., the local rates will not have to bear any part of the building costs.</P>
    <P>Each of the nine colleges will be run by a regional board on which local interests, including local industrial interests and the Vocational Education Committees, and the Minister for <Col N="471" /> Education will have representation. The intention is, of course, to emphasise the regional character of the colleges. By the establishment of these colleges the Government wishes to emphasise its commitment to a policy of promoting technical education and technician training in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>The main long-term function of the colleges will be to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional level, notably in engineering and science but also in commercial, linguistic, catering, art and design and other specialities.  They will be more immediately concerned with providing courses aimed at filling gaps in the industrial manpower structure particularly in the technician area. They will also provide senior cycle post-primary courses leading to the leaving certificate with a bias towards scientific, technical and commercial studies.  It is also the intention that the colleges will play a major role in a policy of adult training and retraining which will be a vital need in the years to come.</P>
    <P>A final fixed pattern of courses in these colleges is not envisaged.  If they are to make their most effective contribution to the needs of society and the economy they must be capable of continuing adaptation to social, economic and technological changes.  Initiative at regional and national levels will largely determine how far this vital characteristic is developed.</P>
    <P>There are some other general considerations in regard to the establishment of the colleges which I feel I might mention now.  The availability and demand for technical education are essential to our future industrial progress. It is not a matter, however, of merely meeting the existing demand for such education but of creating and stimulating a swing towards technical education and technician training.  This requires local effort harnessed into a regional effort.  The college must be an integral part of the region, serving in every way possible the educational and industrial needs of the area in which it is situated.  But more than that is at <Col N="472" /> stake.  The supply of facilities will create its own demand for technical training.  In turn the supply of skilled manpower will help to accelerate the industrial and economic growth of the region and this in essence is the why of regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>In formulating proposals for the Government with regard to the colleges I have had the benefit of a very thorough report prepared by an independent steering committee working in conjunction with officers of my Department.  I propose to make the report of the committee available generally in due course but suffice it to say at this stage that what has been decided with regard to the colleges follows closely the recommendations of the committee.  I should like here to place on record my appreciation of the very great contribution which the committee have made in this important field of technical education.</P>
    <P>A final word about the colleges themselves. Studies based on a building brief prepared by the steering committee are already far advanced on the design of teaching areas, communal and administrative facilities and other ancillary accommodation.  These studies are being carried out in consultation with my Department by a consortium of architects, quantity surveyors and engineers with the assistance of other specialised staff.</P>
    <P>Building work on six of the colleges is scheduled to commence next spring and it is hoped to have them in operation by September, 1969.  Work on the remaining three colleges&mdash;Cork, Limerick and Galway&mdash;will commence somewhat later.</P>
    <P>The amount sought under Vote 31 for the financial year 1967-68 is £219,500&mdash;a decrease of £43,000 on that for the year 1966-67.  This decrease is due to the decline in the numbers of children detained in the schools.  At the end of 1966 there were 118 boys and 27 girls in the reformatories as compared with 100 boys and 20 girls at the end of 1965.  In the industrial schools the numbers were 1,120 boys and 1,089 girls at the end of 1966 as compared with 1,256 boys and 1,264 girls at the end of 1965.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Thirteen of the industrial schools have their own primary schools and in the case of the 25 remaining schools the children attend local national schools.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, a committee has recently been established to survey the reformatory and industrial schools system and to make a report and recommendations to me. I am hoping to have the result of their labours in twelve to eighteen months time.</P>
    <P>The provision in 1967-68 for Universities and Colleges, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and Grants-in-Aid to the College of Surgeons, the Dublin Dental Hospital, the Cork Hospitals' Board and the College of Pharmacy shows a net increase of £609,800 over the provision in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>The total increase over 1966-67 in the case of the recurrent grant to the three colleges of the National University and Trinity College is £300,000. This increase is related to the necessary expansion in staff to cater for the greater number of students attending the colleges.  The total number of full-time students in 1966-67 was approximately 15,600, an increase of 1,436 over the previous year.</P>
    <P>On the capital side £300,000 is being provided for University College, Dublin in connection with the erection of a new arts and administration building. It is anticipated that the building which will provide accommodation for 5,000 to 6,000 arts students and which is estimated to cost £2,300,000 will be completed in time for the opening of the college session commencing in October, 1969.  Plans are being drawn up for library and restaurant buildings to be available for students at the same time as the arts building is opened.  The cost of these two projects is estimated at £950,000.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on a new building for physics, chemistry, mathematical science and a science library in University College, Cork.  The total estimated cost of the project is £1,600,000 and it is expected to be completed by September, 1969.  Sanction has recently been given for the <Col N="474" /> provision of a new science block at University College, Galway at a cost of £1,750,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of Trinity College the estimate includes a capital sum of £47,000, this being the final instalment of the State's share of the cost of the library project.  In all the State contributed £368,000 to the project of which £271,000 was paid in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>The grant to the College of Surgeons is being increased by £12,000; that to the College of Pharmacy by £7,000 and that to the Institute for Advanced Studies by £11,460.</P>
    <P>The amount being provided in Vote 33, £31,300 shows an increase of £5,310 in the sum for 1966-67.  While on the subject of the Gallery, I would like to pay tribute again to the manner in which the public are now being made aware of it and of the treasures which it contains.</P>
    <P>During the year, the Development Branch of my Department prepared and published reports on post-primary educational facilities in each county. Apart from providing a large amount of basic data which was not previously readily available, the reports gave an estimate of the additional facilities which would be required in each centre to cater for the introduction of the free post-primary education scheme and the raising of the school leaving age by 1970.  The reports also made suggestions in regard to the rationalisation of post-primary facilities in each area.  They highlighted the need for co-operation between the two post-primary school systems in order to provide comprehensive facilities in each area and made practical suggestions as to how such co-operation might be introduced and developed.</P>
    <P>These county reports were issued to all the interests concerned and were also made available to the press. Meetings to discuss the reports were held in each county and provided the educational authorities, parents, teachers and others with an opportunity of making their views known before final plans were made.  This whole process of debate and discussion proved most useful to me and my <Col N="475" /> Department and was, I hope, also greatly appreciated by school authorities, teachers' organisations and the general public.  I was particularly heartened by the great public interest taken in these discussions.  The presence of representatives from the secondary schools and the vocational schools helped in promoting active co-operation between them.  We still have, however, a long way to go in getting complete co-operation between our two post-primary systems but a start has been made.</P>
    <P>If these local meetings did nothing else, I am sure that they brought home forcefully the need for larger post-primary school units capable of providing facilities and courses which will cater for the interests and aptitudes of all the pupils.  The greater awareness in the public generally of the value of education and the need for adequate facilities also helps this process as parents are no longer prepared to send their children to centres which cannot provide adequate facilities.</P>
    <P>In the Greater Dublin Area the Advisory Council established in 1966 has carried out an intensive survey into the whole position.  It is estimated that by 1975 some 30,000 additional post-primary places will be needed in that area.  Already 13 new schools and 28 major extensions to existing post-primary schools have been sanctioned by me.  These will provide accommodation for 16,000 pupils and consideration is at present being given to the provision of the remaining places which will be required.  In passing, I should like to thank most sincerely those representatives on the council who have given so freely and generously of their time in the examination of the problem of school accommodation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, comprehensive schools have already been established in Cootehill, Carraroe and Shannon.  A fourth comprehensive school is at present being erected in Glenties, County Donegal.  It is also proposed to erect a comprehensive school for Protestant pupils at Raphoe.  Accommodation will be provided for 350-400 pupils and the cost <Col N="476" /> will be of the order of £225,000.  It is proposed to erect two comprehensive schools in Dublin, both in Ballymun, one for boys and and one for girls. Each of these schools will accommodate about 750 pupils and the cost of both schools is estimated at £750,000. Ballymun should provide an ideal centre for testing a variety of comprehensive courses.</P>
    <P>Educational research has not heretofore received here the encouragement which it warrants though it is an indispensable element in efforts aimed at improvement or development.  I have, therefore, been considering ways and means of encouraging research in the field of education in Ireland.  Apart from the Investment in Education survey and the practical results which flowed from it, we have also recently had a fairly extensive programme of language research carried out at Gormanston.  Another important development has been the setting up of an Educational Research Centre in Saint Patrick's Teacher Training College which is involved in research work of a fundamental nature on the various aspects of education and the learning process.  The Development Branch in my own Department is of its nature orientated towards research activity and will take the lead in developing new techniques in various fields.  The provision of £10,000 for Educational Research in my Department's Vote is being utilised to support suitable research projects which are being carried out by University Departments and other bodies.  This is an important development and will provide financial support for students who are engaged in post-graduate research in education.</P>
    <P>The Schools' Psychological Service in the Department which was started with an initial complement of three psychologists is being expanded and it is hoped to recruit a further five psychologists very shortly.  The intention is to add to that number each year as suitably qualified people become available.  Achievement tests suitable to Irish conditions have been developed and are being tested in the comprehensive schools.  With the aid of additional psychologists and specially <Col N="477" /> trained career masters in the schools, it is hoped to extend the educational guidance service to an increasing number of schools until eventually such a service will be available generally.</P>
    <P>The provision of audio-visual aids in our schools, primary and post-primary, is most essential.  For too long, we have ignored the help which audio-visual aids can provide in improving the quality of teaching and enriching the learning process.  During the year, the nucleus of an audio-visual aid section was established in my Department and at present I have under consideration a scheme of grants to schools which would enable them to make good their deficiencies in this respect.  I shall make a further announcement in the matter in due course.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of the free education scheme as it affects boarding schools to which I would like to refer.  There are in the Diocesan Colleges and Juniorates pupils who because of the vocation they have set before themselves must attend as boarders.  In recognition of that fact, I decided, as announced a short time ago, that the tuition element of the fee of the pupils in these colleges should be paid under the scheme of free education with effect as from the current school year.  I have also given serious thought to the many representations made to me on behalf of the other lower fee boarding schools which felt that the tuition element of their fee should be covered in the free education scheme.  I am happy to repeat that the Government have agreed that, with effect from 1969-70, the supplemental grant of £25 in lieu of tuition fees may be paid in respect of pupils in boarding schools charging £120 per annum or less.  Because of the special problem of Protestant boarding schools, the Government has agreed that with effect from the current school year a lump sum payment will be made to the Commission for Protestant Secondary Schools to enable them to come to the assistance particularly of pupils who have not suitable post-primary school facilities available to them in the locality in which they <Col N="478" /> reside.  The lump sum will be based on the maximum amount of the tuition grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The first comment I want to make is that I believe the most urgent problem facing the Minister and his Department at the present time is the speeding-up of the repair of the very large number of national schools throughout the country which are in a deplorably bad state.  There is little need for me to comment on the situation as it has come into focus in a very dramatic way in recent weeks.  I am glad the Minister dealt with this problem.  He has been conspicuous by his silence since the controversy recently arose regarding the condition of primary schools and particularly since the Irish National Teachers' Organisation were compelled to take drastic action to focus attention on the situation.</P>
      <P>Despite all the talk about amalgamation of universities and about new developments in secondary and technical education, the plain fact still remains that primary education is the most important part of our entire educational system.  It is a sad reflection on us after 40 years of native Government that hundreds of primary school pupils are compelled to pursue their studies in buildings that are anti-quated, outdated, insanitary, and one can hardly exaggerate the appalling conditions under which pupils and teachers have to work.</P>
      <P>In page 6 of his speech the Minister stated that one thing which continues to be a source of worry and dissatisfaction to him is the number of national school buildings which are in need of replacement.  It is good to note that the Minister is worried about this particular problem and I sincerely hope that the plans which he has outlined here to clear the backlog of repairs and replacements will succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he will not rest content until all schoolchildren are housed in clean buildings with reasonable standards of hygiene and comfort.  I think every Deputy in the <Col N="479" /> House, no matter to what Party he belongs, will agree with these sentiments and we will look forward with particular interest over the next year to see to what extent this programme of replacement and repair of national school buildings will be accelerated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details or arguments that have been put forward in recent weeks.  Indeed, the position has received perhaps more publicity in the press, and so on, than may have been justified.  But, the plain fact remains that we cannot rest satisfied with progress in the national field until we reach a stage where at least our primary schoolchildren can pursue their studies in buildings&mdash;as the Minister has said when he expresses his hopes&mdash;with reasonable standards of hygiene, heating and comfort.</P>
    <P>On primary education, there is one development since we had the opportunity of discussing education a year ago with which I wholeheartedly agree. The Minister on page 9 adverted to the question of the primary school certificate examination.  He states that here is one of the first things about which he expressed himself as being unhappy when he assumed his responsibility for the Department of Education&mdash;the primary school certificate examination.  I am glad the Minister has reviewed this particular problem and that he has decided on a new approach.  It was generally agreed by all and sundry that the primary school certificate examination had outlived its usefulness, if, in fact, it ever had any usefulness.  It was generally recognised and agreed that the primary school certificate in this modern age was due for either total abolition or for some change.  The Minister has decided to do away with the primary school certificate and substitute a system of record cards which would show the progress in the primary school of each individual child.</P>
    <P>This method of assessment of progress is in line with developments in other countries.  This method of assessment of progress by record cards, whereby the progress of the pupil can be recorded over a period of time, is, I think, a much better method of <Col N="480" /> assessment than the actual examination at the end of the primary school stage.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have had experience of teaching know full well that the primary school certificate was not really a test of the pupil's progress through the primary school.  Therefore, I welcome the change and I sincerely hope that the new method will work out satisfactorily.  I have not had the opportunity of actually seeing the new system functioning.  I do not even know whether the system of record cards has, in fact, been introduced in the schools but I certainly look forward with interest to the working of this system in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>Another important point referred to by the Minister in his brief in relation to primary education is the very important question of teacher/pupil ratio.  This is second, I suppose, to the problem of bad school buildings and inadequate accommodation.  The problem of overcrowding of classes has perhaps been one of the most serious problems in the field of primary education. The Minister states that the present figure is slightly under 35 pupils per teacher.  Of course, this figure of 35 pupils per teacher as an average is, in fact, the total number of pupils divided by the total number of teachers and does not naturally&mdash;and I think the Minister referred to that&mdash;give the true figure because it is a well-known fact that there is gross overcrowding in many places.</P>
    <P>You have on the other end of the scale the smaller one-teacher schools in the depopulated areas.  It is quite common, as far as I am aware, to find in city schools teachers having to deal with classes of 40 pupils or more.  I have had experience of that particular job and I think that every effort should be made, and no expense should be spared, to try to achieve the optimum pupil/teacher ratio in our national schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that a policy of steadily reducing the pupil/teacher ratio has been operated over recent years and he said that a further reduction can be expected this year.  This question of pupil/teacher ratio is tied up with two important factors.  The first is the provision of adequate <Col N="481" /> accommodation and the second is the training of primary school teachers.</P>
    <P>What has been said already in relation to the condition of many of our school buildings is closely tied up with this question of pupil/teacher ratio.  I understand that arrangements have been made and steps taken to increase the output of national school teachers. I believe, from the limited experience which I have had of teaching in primary schools, that the optimum maximum figure should be one teacher to 30 pupils.  I believe this is the desirable figure.  It certainly is the maximum figure which is compatible with efficient teaching.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the important question of the education of the mentally handicapped.  This is a subject dear to the heart of Deputies and of everybody in the country.  It is a welcome sign of the times that people are beginning to take a greater interest in the education of the mentally handicapped.  The amount of voluntary effort put into this problem by people in many walks of life is, as the Minister rightly commented, worthy of the greatest praise.  The Minister stated in his speech:</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the financial year 1966-67 new primary schools for mentally handicapped pupils have been established at Kilkenny, An Uaimh, Drumcar, Waterford city, Ennis, Enniscorthy and Castlebar.</P>
    <P>He also pointed out that the facilities in Dublin are being extended.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be confident of having the full support of all sides of the House in any steps he may take to deal with this problem.  As I said, people are now becoming interested in the welfare of the handicapped and are prepared not merely to show pity &mdash;which is ineffective anyway&mdash;but to contribute both in cash and kind towards helping this unfortunate section of our community.</P>
    <P>The question of mentally handicapped children covers a wide field. There are several degrees of handicap. The Minister referred to one particular kind&mdash;the problem of mentally retarded pupils in our primary schools. <Col N="482" /> Special consideration is being given to the introduction of plans to deal with these children.  There is no doubt at all that the backward or retarded child in large overcrowded classes in the primary schools presents a very serious problem and a difficult one for the teacher to deal with.  It is high time we got down to tackling it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which the problem can be approached. In some centres special schools have been provided to cater for these children.  Such schools could be provided in each locality drawing their pupils from a certain radius.  Experiments of that nature are working in certain parts of the country.  In Limerick St. Gabriel's is doing excellent work for the mentally handicapped children.  This is a day school drawing pupils from a radius of about 20 miles. This is the sort of effort that would go a long way towards solving the problem.</P>
    <P>I come now to secondary education. The past year has seen the introduction of what has come to be known as free post-primary education.  The figures in the Minister's speech are impressive. He states that 92 per cent of the pupils are now covered by the scheme.  When we were discussing the Estimate last year and when the Minister announced the details of the scheme I remember expressing doubt about its coming into operation as quickly as was forecast. As we in Fine Gael have advocated free post-primary education, we can now legitimately welcome the fact that such a high proportion of our secondary school pupils are being catered for and also the fact that their parents appreciate the value of education and are prepared to make the sacrifice to send them to secondary school.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the fact that, even though this has now come to be known as free post-primary education, that much play might be made of the fact that pupils do not have to pay fees and that certain categories qualify for free books it must be remembered it entails a great sacrifice for many families to send their children to secondary schools.  This is especially so in the case of the larger and poorer <Col N="483" /> families where the loss of the earnings of the older members of the family during the time they are at secondary school can be a great problem.  It is a good thing that, on the whole, the parents are education-minded and that the necessary sacrifice is being made.</P>
    <P>On this question of free books, it appears certain problems have arisen in the implementation of the scheme. I have come across complaints from parents who felt their children were entitled to free books but did not get them.  When the Minister announced this scheme he stated in a broad way the categories of children deemed to be qualified, but the decision in this regard was left to the headmasters and headmistresses of the schools.  I have been told that certain schools did not receive any grant as yet in respect of free books supplied to pupils and that a certain amount of confusion has arisen.  I would like the Minister to clarify the situation in the light of the experience gained in his Department.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that it is in the field of vocational education that we need to concentrate, perhaps, the greatest effort in the immediate future. There is no doubt whatsoever that the vocational schools can play a very important role in the development of this country.  I note in the Minister's speech that he has referred in more detail than normal in this annual Estimate to the question of vocational education.  He has referred in particular to the regional colleges of technology.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a proposal were made in this country to have our courts conduct their business in private, if a proposal were made that all decisions affecting a person's property and reputation should be conducted in private, <Col N="484" /> if we announced that in future the State and the organs of the State would not be called upon to state their reasons for certain decisions, there would, quite rightly, be a public outcry.  At present we have matters concerning small issues decided by independent courts in public.  The essence of a free society is a free judicial system in which not only is justice done but justice is seen to be done.  What we in this Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill are seeking to do is to have this cardinal principle of conducting judicial affairs in public recognised in relation to property matters.</P>
      <P>It surely is somewhat incongruous that we have free, independent courts conducting their affairs in public with the doors open to any person who wants to enter the court, deciding matters of only a few pounds, deciding very trivial matters, deciding matters in which no injustice might be done if the proceedings were conducted in private. The reasons we do not conduct them in private is that we recognise the importance of allowing society to see what is going on and to be convinced that each side in a dispute is given an ample opportunity of being heard, and so that the public may know that the presiding judge, the person who is making the decision, before making it, hears all parties.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary society that we live in when we maintain free, independent courts to deal with trivial matters, but when millions of pounds are concerned, when the lives and surroundings of thousands of people may be involved, we have established a system which prevents those issues being discussed and being debated in public, which prevents the people having confidence in the impartiality of the people who make the decisions, which prevents the people having an opportunity of ensuring that all views in relation to the issues are heard.  At the present time, under the 1963 Local Government Planning Bill, which we in Fine Gael so relentlessly opposed, one man, a political person, has the sole power of deciding in secret matters which affect in some cases thousands of people and matters which in many cases can be valued, in monetary terms, in millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> We in Fine Gael tabled numerous amendments to the Local Government Planning and Development Bill of 1963 in the hope that the Government would acknowledge the necessity of preserving public confidence in planning matters. Our efforts were in vain.  The Government refused to accept our amendments, and the result is that the Government have brought about their own head immense accusations of corruption, of partiality, of bribery, and of misconduct.  The fact is that the Government, by refusing to have planning appeals decided by independent tribunals, have created that situation, and it is no answer to say that those who are making these accusations are not able to prove them.  As long as you operate and tolerate a system which allows people to make these accusations and to have these suspicions, these accusations will be made.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that most of the accusations that have been made about bribery and corruption have not been directed at persons; they have been directed at the party which for the time being is in government.  Until we have a system in operation in this country which obliges political parties to disclose the names of the persons who are contributing funds to that party, there is, I suppose, no certain way of proving whether or not the accusations are correct.  However, it is not without some significance that the income of the Fianna Fáil Party has increased beyond all bounds in recent years, not because its small collections of sixpences and shillings have increased, because, in fact, the reverse has been the trend; it is, I think, fair to say that people are justified in suspecting that money has been passed into the coffers of the Fianna Fáil Party in consideration of receiving benefit from the Minister for Local Government in planning matters.</P>
    <P>If the Government are genuine in wanting to keep their reputation unsullied there is a simple way to ensure that now, that is, by accepting the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill, 1967, which would ensure that monetary contributions to any political Party are of no assistance whatever in the processing <Col N="486" /> of planning appeals.  Until such time as we have an independent tribunal such as Fine Gael suggest in this Bill brought into existence and into operation, the community in which we live will continue to be disturbed by suspicions that donations of money to the Fianna Fáil Party can be of benefit in planning matters.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has challenged some members of the Fine Gael Party to support their publicly expressed concern about the passing of money to obtain favours from political persons. Of course, the passing of money to obtain political favours is very much like murder, or rape, or theft, or burglary. Actions of that kind are invariably done in private, and it is exceedingly difficult, without the most extensive police force, to prove guilt in many cases.  The Scottish judicial system knows a judgment of not proven which amounts to a declaration that a suspicion reasonably exists but that guilt has not been proved beyond all doubt.  We do not know such a judgement in our criminal law, but if we are to tolerate a system foisted on us in recent times in which political individuals make decisions which are worth thousands and millions of pounds to the people who are seeking favours, it is fair to say that accusations of corruption and bribery, if not proven, are certainly sound enough and reasonable enough to show that there is reason to suspect the guilt of the people who continue to operate a system which can quite clearly be of substantial benefit to them.</P>
    <P>It would be undesirable, I suppose, because it would unduly prolong this debate, to deal with the innumerable planning applications of which we have knowledge but there was one planning matter in recent times which was so debated in public that it can properly be debated here as an instance of the kind of thing which is worrying the public mind.  Not too far distant from this House, in my own constituency, there is a beautiful parkland which has existed for many years and is surrounded by a not unattractive crescent of nineteenth century houses.  It has no remarkable piece of architecture <Col N="487" /> but it was recommended, and very properly so, that it should be preserved because of its inherent beauty and line.  Dublin Corporation, in the preparation of their draft town plan, were of the same opinion and it was proposed to preserve the park in question as an open space.</P>
    <P>For some years past a number of different petrol and oil companies received options to purchase the land provided they could obtain planning permission for the erection of a petrol filling station.  All their efforts to get planning permission were in vain because Dublin Corporation, and I believe successive Ministers, all held a view which coincided with the recommendation that this park should be preserved as open parkland.  Therefore, it must give rise to considerable well-founded concern when, within the past year, another individual could come along and, against the history of which I have spoken, and despite a renewed rejection by Dublin Corporation, go to the Minister for Local Government and obtain planning approval for something which had been rejected for years and years past, and which we know it was proposed never to allow in the future according to the Dublin town plan.</P>
    <P>When we are aware that the applicant in question had three motor cars in operation for the Fianna Fáil candidate in the by-election in Cork city last year, we are well justified in referring to the suspicion which people have that planning matters are being used to establish in this country a corrupt system of government&mdash;we are justified in expressing those thoughts. We are justified in repeating that if the Government are embarrassed by this kind of thing they have an easy way to avoid these things being said or these thoughts being thought.  They can simply adopt a system which will remove from the Minister for Local Government or any political person decisions which can be of such immense benefit to applicants.  It is fair to say it must tempt people seeking favours to ensure their success by making subscriptions to the political Party which happen to be the Government at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> Contrary to what some people believe we do not say these things lightly.  We do not say them because we are anxious to besmirch our political opponents.  We are aware that the Fianna Fáil Party are utterly indifferent about their reputation.  They have no desire to be known as a Party with integrity, a Party which is untouchable, a Party which has no passion for strict and straight dealing.  We know they would much prefer at any price to remain in office.  If the price is that they will lose their reputation for decency and for incorruptibility they are indifferent to the price they have to pay.</P>
    <P>The Bill which we propose is a very simple one.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Fine Gael shadow Minister for Local Government, delivered a speech to justify this Bill and explain it last week, which a Member of the Government, the Minister for Health, praised.  The Minister acknowledged that a good case had been made for the Bill.  It is not often that across the floor of the House tributes of this kind are paid.  The Minister said that Deputy Fitzpatrick had given voice to praiseworthy sentiments and that he agreed with many of the things Deputy Fitzpatrick had said in regard to the present appeal system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not actually quoting but the reference to the speech of the Minister for Health is at columns 109-112, volume 232, 31st January, 1968. It is important that we should not lose sight of the matters which the Minister may now decide in secret and without giving reasons for his decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may make decisions on appeals related to permission to develop property or to retain a structure in respect of which planning permission was not obtained; in relation to unauthorised use of property or he may make decisions on appeals against decisions by a planning authority taking the form of notices served by an authority on a property owner.  He may make decisions in relation to preservation of amenities such as trees and other natural growths, or the creation of amenities such as rights of way.  The Minister may make decisions on <Col N="489" /> appeals relating to decisions as to the payment of compensation by a planning authority and he may listen to appeals and decide them concerning the relaxation of building regulations and a host of other matters.</P>
    <P>One particularly obnoxious provision of the present measure is that people who object to the decision of the local authority or to the prosecution of an appeal if they are not the party involved may not be heard and it seems quite ludicrous that in planning matters where the consequences may be very much greater than the giving of a publichouse licence, people in the adjoining area may not be heard.  I think all Members of the House and the public in general are well aware that when a person seeks to convert a non-licensed premises into a licensed one or seeks to transfer the licence to another property, all objectors may be heard and, in fact, must be heard, and no matter how thin the objection or how apparently shallow it may appear to be to some people, the courts must hear the objectors before a decision is taken.</P>
    <P>The objectors have the right to cross-examine the people who are making the application for the transfer of licence and the people who are objecting may, of course, also be cross-examined by those who are seeking to have a licensed premises set up.  I think it is true that the number of people who could possibly be affected by any publichouse is in many cases much less than the number affected by many of the decisions which have already been taken by the Minister for Local Government under the Planning Act not to speak of the decisions which he may yet be called upon to make.  To say that it is quite right and proper that objectors should be heard to applications for licensed premises and at the same time that objectors may not be heard to applications to demolish large numbers of houses and to say that objectors may not be heard to applications to building plans and to say that objectors will not be heard to applications to establish noissome industries is to be at least lacking in consistency.  I think we can go further and say it is positively dishonest to provide that objectors may not be <Col N="490" /> heard in relation to planning matters. That is why we are providing in section 7 of this Bill that such objectors may be heard.</P>
    <P>The Volume of work which the Minister has been called upon to do has been so great that he personally could not have handled all those decisions. We know, that he is responsible for all decisions taken in his name.  It may be that he has indicated a certain pattern to be followed by the people who are processing the planning appeals.  I think there are indications that in some cases common principles are applied, but where you have a system which operates in secret you are bound to have departures from the lines of policy which are set.  When you have reason to believe that those departures are made in return for political favours we have every reason to be very concerned about the present system.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Fitzpatrick has already given figures of the volume of appeals that have been submitted to the Minister but if the House will bear with me for the sake of tidying up the loose ends of my comments I shall repeat them.  In the year ended 30th September, 1965 there were 979 appeals; in the year ending 30th September, 1966 1,125; in the year ending 30th September, 1967, 1,322.  It is rather alarming to discover that only a small proportion of those appeals have yet been determined.  We find that in the first year when 979 appeals were submitted only 437 were decided by the Minister.  If you take the second year and add to the number of appeals in that year&mdash;which is 1,125&mdash;the other 540 appeals which were left undecided at the end of the year, you see that only 862 decisions were made by the Minister and that there is still a colossal backlog of undecided appeals. The situation is worse in the year ending 30th September last when 1,322 were submitted and only 999 were decided, remembering that you had a backlog of well over 1,000 from the previous two years.  This indicates that the machinery which is provided under the 1963 Act is utterly inadequate. If any person seeking justice for a £5 debt, or a £50 debt, or a £500 debt, <Col N="491" /> had to wait that length of time for a decision there would be a public outcry and the Minister for Justice would be under strong pressure to increase the number of judges so as to ensure that the delays in the processing of people's affairs would be wiped out in the future.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, then, the present system is crumbling; it is not capable of being efficiently operated, and certainly the individual who is empowered by this Dáil, and by the Seanad, to make the decisions is not making them because he is incapable of handling all that work himself and his underlings are also incapable of handling the volume of work they have had submitted, notwithstanding the fact that, as we said earlier, many people who quite properly should be heard in relation to these appeals are being silenced and are not being given the opportunity of being heard.  That is why we return to the fundamental principle which we think must be recognised, that justice must not only be done but it must seem to be done and must be seen to be done.  These things are not happening at present.</P>
    <P>The decisions which a Minister can make under our planning laws can add greatly to the value of property or they can detract enormously from the value of property.  It is a well-known principle of law that if the value of a person's property is threatened by the conduct or omissions of another person, that the person whose property is threatened may apply to the court for an injunction so as to obtain an immediate remedy and to ensure that pending a decision on the matter in dispute, the value of the property may be maintained.  We have no such safeguard under our planning legislation and it was never envisaged, certainly and it was never envisaged by the Government because they rebutted any suggestion we made on these lines, that people should be uncertain as to the value of their property.  It was never thought that people would be so restricted or so uneasy, as they are at present, by reason of the many handicaps under which the present system is obliged to operate.</P>
    <P>It is because of an anxiety to ensure <Col N="492" /> that these tribulations would be brought to an end that we wish to see established a proper appeals tribunal, or tribunals, we do not care how many different tribunals have to be established; if the demand is there, then we should answer the demand by providing the proper system of adjudication on appeals and not leave the present situation which is allowing a greater and greater backlog to build up every year.  I am conscious of a case which I have brought on a number of occasions to the notice of the Minister's Department in which an application was made to a county council for permission to build by a person who had signed a contract for the purchase of a piece of land subject to getting planning permission.  Planning permission was refused by the local authority and the would-be purchaser of the land made an appeal to the Minister for Local Government against the refusal of the local authority. Simultaneously, the vendor of the property made an appeal to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Some time later the vendor of the property apparently had second thoughts about this matter and notified the Minister, of whom he is a personal friend, that he did not wish to proceed with his appeal and it was not until more than a year after when the would-be purchaser made an inquiry, that the purchaser found out that the Minister for Local Government had marked the appeal as &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo;. The result was that this person who wanted to buy the land to build a house for himself, his wife and family, was left in suspense for over a year because of some arrangement which suited the vendor of the property. Although the better part of two years. has passed since the would-be purchaser of the property made an appeal no decisions has yet been taken.  I will acknowledge that when it was pointed out to the Minister that the withdrawal by the vendor of his application had no bearing upon the application by the purchaser, the purchaser was informed that the matter was being reopened and that a decision would be given in due course.  However, that was many, many months ago and at present the <Col N="493" /> would-be purchaser, who put down a deposit as an earnest on the contract, is unable to get from the vendor, who clearly engaged in some sharp practice, a return of his deposit, and is unable, on that account, to acquire other plots of land because his assets are tied up in the original application.</P>
    <P>Here we have the position that a man, with his wife and family, is obliged to rent accommodation at a rack rent for a very lengthy period all because of the incompetence of the Department of Local Government, or perhaps, incompetence is too severe a word, he is unable because of the utter inability of the Department of Local Government to process his application. If it is not inability through pressure of work it is downright corruption, so the Minister may choose between one or the other.  Certainly there is no other explanation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have not got in this country an ombudsman, some impartial person who would have the right of protecting the individual against the almighty State, some person who would have the right of examining the conduct of the State and of rectifying this conduct where such was found necessary.  I am glad to say that the Ard-Fheis of the Fine Gael Party has recommended the introduction of a system on a parallel with the ombudsman which operates in the Scandinavian countries and we hope the day is not too long distant when some such establishment will be provided here. Indeed, in a number of the countries in the European Community, with which it is thought by some people we may one day be joined, there are systems which allow the private citizen to have recourse to an independent authority to assess the fairness or correctness of Government action.</P>
    <P>We have not got such a system and in the absence of such a system the only alternative which can provide fair play for the individual and be seen to provide it is to set up some independent trubunal.  In the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 we of the Fine Gael Party pressed all along for the establishment of an independent tribunal to hear appeals on ministerial and administrative action.  We were glad <Col N="494" /> that the Minister for Labour accepted the Fine Gael amendment to establish an independent appeals tribunal.  It may not be all we would wish it to be but it is something that can only be tried out in the light of experience and it gives, I think, a fair hope that the individual who feels aggrieved by an administrative decision will have his grievance heard and properly heard by people who will be in a position to assess the fairness or otherwise of the decision and to hear all sides.</P>
    <P>At present we have not got such a system in relation to planning matters and planning matters can be just as important for any one individual and every bit as important for the community as any matter affecting any worker under the Redundancy Payments scheme.  On that account we think that it is vitally necessary that an independent tribunal should be established.  The one which we suggest is I feel an extremely fair one.  Indeed, I think the Minister for Health speaking from the Government benches gave an indication that he considered the tribunal which we had in mind to be a fair one.  It could be argued I suppose that the personnel should be drawn from some other source.  It could be suggested that it could be increased in size and various alterations might be put forward but basically the structure of the board which we would establish is a fair one and is the kind of thing which we would recommend the Government to establish. We would provide that the board be composed of a judge, of a person nominated by the Minister for Local Government and of another qualified person to be drawn from a panel set up by the Local Appointments Commission. The persons to be drawn from the panel would have to have relevant qualifications: those of civil engineering, architecture or qualified town planning.</P>
    <P>The case was made during the 1963 Act debate that the State had a very great responsibility, particularly where public money might be involved and particularly where the public interest was involved to vest in a Minister of State who would be answerable to this Dáil, the power to make decisions in <Col N="495" /> planning matters.  That is an argument which one would not lightly dismiss but we feel that it is fair to say that the public interest would be provided for by allowing the Minister for Local Government to nominate a qualified person in whom he had confidence to the board of experts which we would set up independent of direct ministerial influence.  To suggest that the interest of the State, that the interest of the community, that the common welfare would not be protected if a board were to be chaired by a judge is to suggest that our judiciary is incompetent or is not concerned with the public interest. I know of no action in the whole history of our judiciary which would give the least justification to such an allegation and, therefore, with a member of the judiciary and a nominee of the Minister's on a board it is certain that the public interest would be safeguarded. We in Fine Gael believe that it would be safeguarded to a much greater extent than under the existing system in which the public interest, in which the community welfare becomes subordinated to political partisan advantage to the party of the Minister of the day.  It is on that account that we commend to the Dáil for serious consideration the Bill which we are putting before the people.</P>
    <P>We are aware of and we are encouraged by the numerous responsible associations which have complained about the present system and which have called for an amendment.  We are grateful for the support which has been given to the idea which we seek to enshrine in this legislation to have an independent board established. Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> referred to the unanimous call of the Association of Municipal Authorities for the transfer of planning appeals from the Minister to an appeals board.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that the Architects Institute and the Engineers Institute have expressed similar views and at least a number of chambers of commerce, including the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, have expressed their anxiety about what is occurring under the present legislation and have called <Col N="496" /> for, as we are now calling for, the setting up of an independent tribunal which will command the respect of everybody in the community and which will ensure that planning&mdash;town planning, property planning, is as it ought to be, something conducted only with concern for the betterment of the community, meeting that concern with an equal anxiety that no individual would be unfairly treated and that no individual would receive exceptionally favourable treatment simply because of his actual or pretended allegiance to the party of the person making the decision.</P>
    <P>These are the principles which underlie the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill and, as I said earlier, we defy the Government to refuse to accept the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill.  If they refuse to accept it they will only help to crystallise the tremendous suspicion that exists, something more than a suspicion, that they wish to retain the present system because of the monetary benefit which flows to the political party which, for the time being, is in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill and to comment on some of the speeches that have been made.  I did not intend to speak on this Bill because I do not think it contains a lot of merit.  However, certain Deputies of this House took it on themselves to allege that I personally corrupted a Minister.  I am sorry that the Chair did not ask that Deputy to withdraw that remark or apologise.  A Cheann Comhairle, if you think that my interpretation is too strong I shall quote from the Official Report&mdash;volume 232, No. 1.  At column 103 Deputy Cluskey said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of cases I personally know where a local authority has refused permission for the erection of a certain type of structure or have reserved land for the building of local authority houses and the Minister has reversed the decisions and by doing so has made the property concerned very, very valuable indeed.  In order that the Minister may be at no disadvantage when he comes to reply.  I will cite <Col N="497" /> just two cases that I personally know and in connection with which I find it very difficult not to agree with my constituents who cry &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under town planning, an area consisting of approximately 330 acres in the Kilbarrack area had been designated by Dublin Corporation for local authority housing for quite some time.  Then a gentleman named Gallagher acquired some of this property and appealed to the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, for the exclusion of portion of this land for private housing.  The Minister granted Mr. Gallagher's appeal and the result of that was that instead of the corporation having 330 acres for local authority housing, approximately one-third of it&mdash;I think somewhere in the region of 129 acres approximately&mdash;was excluded and handed over to Mr. Gallagher for the building of private houses.  This, of course, enhanced the value of the land quite considerably and now we find that Mr. Gallagher and his group is in a position to offer back to the corporation something in the region of 700 or 800 houses, at his price.  Mr. Gallagher, who is no stranger to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>At that stage you interjected:</P>
    <P>Can the Deputy not make his case without mentioning individuals who have no way of replying to the charges he is making?</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan said:</P>
    <P>I think he probably has a way to reply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey continued, according to the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I will say, Deputy Gallagher.  That gives him ample opportunity to come into this House and reply.  He was able to offer back to the corporation these houses and stated quite openly, publicly&mdash;he was quoted in the newspapers as saying&mdash;that naturally he was only interested in profit.  Had this land been left to the corporation they would have been able to develop their own houses on it.  There is one case which gives rise&mdash;and very justifiably so unless there is an acceptable explanation as to why the <Col N="498" /> decision was made&mdash;to this charge of corruption.</P>
    <P>That is a statement made by Deputy Cluskey in this House.  I want to say now, in simple terms, for the benefit of the House, that statement is untrue and there is no foundation for it, good, bad or indifferent, in so far as I am concerned.  I have no association with that company and as to whether it bought or did not buy land or the land mentioned, I have no knowledge. Yes, I saw the report where the Gallagher Group Limited offered to Dublin Corporation to build 700 or 800 houses.  Again, I want to emphasise that I have no connection, share interest or otherwise, in that company.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I would invite the gentleman who made that statement to make that statement outside this House where I can take the proper action in the courts to ask him to prove it. Otherwise, I would ask him to be gentleman enough to come in here and apologise.</P>
    <P>As to the Bill before the House, I do not see a great deal of merit in it. I see on the part of the local authorities who first deal with planning applications a reluctance to deal with anything that they can pass over to some other authority for adjudication.  The allegation that there are approximately 1,600 appeals reflects no great credit on the integrity, sometimes, of the local planners at county council and corporation level.  Where a strong decision was called for there would appear to be an anxiety on their part to let the Minister decide rather than make a decision.  I have no doubt that in due course this type of thing will disappear and that the accumulation of appeals will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The charges of improper conduct which have been made against the Minister are unfounded and untrue. The case made here this evening by Deputy Ryan is that if the Minister gives away his rights here he can be free of these allegations.  I have been in this House for six years and I have heard many Members complaining that the House has lost too many of its powers and too much of its authority to boards of one description or another.  Here, coming from the <Col N="499" /> Fine Gael Party, who cry loudest about this, is a Bill to amend the Town Planning Act and to make provision for the appointment of a board that will hear appeals.  The proposal is that a judge of the High Court be appointed and that he may not be removed except on retirement or death.  If there is all this alleged graft, these hundreds of thousands of pounds pouring into Party funds and if it is alleged that that can corrupt the Government, the Minister and other people, surely there is nobody who cannot be corrupted by it.  An American will say that everybody has his price.  Can it be said that this proposed chairman cannot have his price?  Can it be said that he is a man of greater integrity than a Minister of State?</P>
    <P>The other members of the proposed board would be architects and others who can adequately advise the chairman. Are these men of integrity? Can we be sure that they will be? Are the officers of the Minister's Department men of integrity or must we accuse them?  This is precisely what we are trying to do here.  Can we say that if this Bill were to become law there would not be the same accusations? The only difference would be that it would not be a political person and they would be far too nice to allege that a judge acting as chairman was putting money in his pocket. Would it not still be the case that every person who lost an appeal would say that if he had paid he would not have lost his appeal?  That is said now.  Anyone who loses an appeal says that if he had paid money to somebody or had paid money to Taca he would not have lost his appeal.</P>
    <P>If one were to examine all the appeals decided by the Minister, it could be said that the decisions made by the Minister had considerable merit. I have personal experience of many appeals that have failed in cases which I as a Deputy acting for constituents would like to have seen succeed but they did not succeed because the proposals were contrary to good planning.</P>
    <P>The existing Act is a relatively new planning Act.  The old system also included appeal to the Minister.  It is a <Col N="500" /> remarkable fact that during the years since the 1934 Act became law there was very little complaint about planning appeals.  I can only assume that the Fine Gael Party will go to any lengths and make allegations against Members of this House or against the Government of every kind of corruption in the hope that they will undermine and destroy the confidence of the people in this Government. Deputy Ryan said this afternoon that we had no regard for reputation.  He said we had no reputation; we did not care what we said.  If Deputy Ryan thinks we have no regard for the people, then the people apparently have a regard for us, a regard they have not got for his Party, and they have indicated that regard for us down through the years.</P>
    <P>It can be said that we are a Party who have always acted above board. We are a Party who have the confidence of the people.  This has been demonstrated.  If there is a Party well versed in graft and underhand work and improper methods that Party must be Fine Gael because they are the only Party who originate all these allegations of improper conduct, graft and everything that goes with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a Bill coming before this House designed to speed up appeals.  I do not think the present measure is that Bill.  I do not think it will solve the problems it is alleged to solve.  I believe the Minister should hold on to whatever little authority is left to him.  We have enough boards. We have far too many boards.  Leave whatever power there is here with the elected Government of the people.  Let us keep the power here and not hive it off to others.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that this House has any say, good, bad or indifferent, in the Planning Act.  A question can be addressed to the Minister and the Minister can answer, refuse to answer, or dodge it, as the Minister usually does.  To suggest that we are giving away something in this Bill is a little foolish.  However, I doubt if the suggestion will fool anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy is aware that things <Col N="501" /> happen under the Planning Act which appear to be rather peculiar.  We know that permission to plan certain things is given.  We know that there is sometimes a planning appeal.  We know that sometimes there is an appeal when permission has been refused.  There are two ways of hearing that appeal.  Either the Minister decides or an oral hearing is requested.  Usually an oral hearing can be given in a reasonably short time.  The Minister's decision usually takes a quite a long time.  In view of the number of appeals I can understand that it will take a long time to deal with all the appeals going before the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor told me that a written appeal takes six months but an oral appeal can be dealt with relatively quickly.  Because more people are now asking for oral appeals I assume that position may have changed.  Now I am not making any charges.  All I say is that it is rather peculiar.  When one looks at the decisions given one wonders how on earth such decisions can be given.  I will cite an example.  An application was made by a number of people to erect dwellinghouses along a main road.  They were refused permission on two or three grounds.  One ground was that water and sewerage were not available.  Another ground was that such houses would form a traffic hazard since the road was narrow and the volume of traffic was fairly high.  In one or two cases this decision was accepted.  Others appealed.  In each case the council's decision was upheld and no planning permission was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then an advertisement appeared for the erection of a motel, a shop and a filling station on the narrowest portion of that same road.  The application came before the local authority and permission was granted except that the filling station was taken out.  Some local residents appealed.  An oral appeal was held and a decision was given by an officer from the Department who came down to the local town and took <Col N="502" /> evidence.  One of the people vitally interested asked that that evidence should be taken on oath, for a very obvious reason, and the official refused to allow this to be done.  The portion of the road where the motel was to be built is the narrowest portion; there is just room for two vehicles to pass. There is no room for widening the road unless one takes away portion of the dwellinghouse of one of the people who objected.  There is a dwellinghouse on the town side of the entrance to the motel which will blind that entrance.</P>

      <P>The appeal was heard and a decision was eventually given by the Minister.  Because I was an interested party I was given a copy of the decision.  Now here is the extraordinary thing about it: when the decision was given by the Minister the Minister gave a decision on one thing which was not before him at all.  He gave a decision on the petrol pump, the filling station which had been ruled out by the County Council.  It was not an appeal at all, but the Minister gave a decision that it should not be allowed. When the decision was given, it was found that the person who published the application for permission was not the person who eventually got the permission. When I was notified I informed the Minister of what I regarded as an error.  I know the Department are busy, but it is nearly a month now and no reply has issued to me.  This is the kind of thing those of us who are members of local authorities find somewhat peculiar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The petrol station did not come into it at all.  It had been ruled out by the local authority.  My complaint is that the appeal by the local people against the motel should have been allowed for half a dozen good reasons.  The motel should not have been built.  I believe it to be a danger.  But this is the way in which the darned thing was handled. Possibly the explanation is that the Department of Local Government, like so many other institutions, is overloaded with appeals.  They are not able to give the time and care to a proper examination of appeals.</P>
      <P>There is one rather peculiar thing in all this.  Most of us have accepted that there are two things one can do. One can apply to the local authority and get permission.  If permission is refused one can appeal to the Minister. That is an end of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One can.  Some of us have been looking at the Act and something rather peculiar has emanated as a result of our research.  I use the word &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; with deliberation because I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, to give me a ruling on this when he comes to speak.  The final decision which an individual disputes may be in the hands of the elected members.  Section 30 of the 1963 Planning Act enables the elected members by ordinary resolution to revoke or modify any permission granted under Part III of the Act.  If the words &ldquo;any permission&rdquo; mean anything they mean permission granted by a local authority, by a manager or by a Minister.  It is implied in Part III that any person may appeal to the Minister and that the Minister may annul any decision of the local authority.  It is also clearly implied that permission granted by a Minister, on appeal, may be modified or revoked by ordinary resolution by members of the planning authority, something which has not come up so far or been tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to get the official Department view on this.  If this is so <Col N="504" /> it may mean that there is a way of dealing with a lot of things which may occur.  It is clear that permission granted by a manager or Minister may not be modified or revoked by executive order unless a fresh application is made, but the decision may be modified or revoked by the elected members of the planning authority.  It would be interesting to have a case stated on this.  It may happen that a person might appeal to the members against a decision of the manager or the Minister and that the elected members could reverse the decision.  Thank God I have good ears: I heard the suggestion that it has nothing to do with the Bill. Of course, it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy has not got the point.  Not alone is the manager's decision involved but the Minister's decision is also involved. This should be clarified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to clarify it tonight when I sit down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the necessity so far but I will have no hesitation in doing it if and when the necessity arises.  It is something likely to affect decisions all over the country and it should be dealt with at national level.  If the Department have left this in intentionally or if they have some reason for it they should do something about it.  The way in which this affects the Bill before the House is that if the interpretation which I have given is correct it means there is a type of appeal in which the Minister has not got the last word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is something which should be clarified because if it is not somebody will eventually test it.  If it is so, apart from the fact that it can go backward and forward between the manager and the Minister, backward and forward to the local authority members and again <Col N="505" /> backward and forward between the manager and the Minister, it could drag along for months.  Deputy Molloy is shaking his head but I suggest he will find it is possible under this section that this will happen.  If it can, the position should be clarified now so that there will be no ambiguity about it.  Outline permission could go the whole round and subsequently final permission could go the whole round and it could take a long time to have it settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to outline permission or planning permission or is it his interpretation of both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It can affect either.  Outline permission could be granted and the appeal could lie against the final permission and there is not a darn thing anybody could do about it but let it go the rounds.  When the Planning Act was being passed, and we had long debates on it, it was thought that this would be the final thing; and the sponsors of the Bill have pointed out that it has now reached the stage when, if somebody is held up on appeal, it is almost impossible to get the matter cleared by the Department in six months or longer and there are cases in which this does not suit.  There may be cases where people who wish to build houses are kept waiting to purchase land: it has become fairly common for people to apply for planning permission before sites are purchased.  This seems a sensible thing to do.  In such cases it often happens that people may be left waiting six or eight months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, when a decision is given by the Minister, on appeal, sometimes it happens that a local authority allow houses to be built on a lot where a water scheme has been installed but no sewerage scheme, and the people building the houses are allowed to put in septic tanks.  Then, when half a dozen houses have been built it is discovered the land may not be suitable to have further septic tanks installed&mdash; the existing tanks may have begun to overflow after 12 months&mdash;and the local authority decide that until something <Col N="506" /> has been done about a sewerage scheme they will not allow further houses to be built.  Then the people who have negotiated for the sites and have made application for permission are told the council cannot give permission to build more houses on the site.  The people accept that decision and decide to wait, possibly during a number of years, until something is done about a sewerage scheme or until they can get sites elsewhere.  The next thing that happens is that somebody else comes along, buys two or three of the sites, applies for permission and on refusal applies to the Minister and the next thing anyone knows about it is that the houses are being erected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first case the people did not appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They accepted the decision of the local authority&mdash; actually the recommendation of the county medical officer of health that it was unsafe to allow further houses until there was a sewerage scheme in the area.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say how a Minister, or somebody acting on his behalf, can give a decision contrary to advice given by the county MOH?  How can permission be given in cases in which the county MOH has stated it is a health hazard if further septic tanks are installed? It is a simple question and it shows that the whole situation under the Planning Act is a bit screwy.</P>
      <P>I know of decisions given by local authorities under the Planning Act while the county plans were being prepared. At a certain period the planning officers were sticking to the rules and subsequently the decisions which they wanted to make were relaxed by the council.  It is almost impossible to get uniform interpretation of the rules.  In one set of circumstances somebody may have applied for permission and been refused and a few months afterwards somebody else gets permission in the same circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have knowledge of a road where two or three people applied for permission to erect houses and were turned down.  They appealed and the appeal was refused.  Then there was application to build a road-house on the same <Col N="507" /> lot, almost on the same site where the individuals I have mentioned had previously sought to erect houses.  As I say, I am not accusing the Department or I am not accusing the Minister of any trickery in this.  It is just simply an interpretation of the Act which in my opinion is wrong.  It appears rather peculiar that this sort of thing should be allowed and as far as I am concerned I am prepared to support the Bill introduced by Fine Gael.  While it will not go the whole way towards what I want to see done I believe it will introduce some alleviation of the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words on this.  I object very strongly to what is being proposed in the Bill and I feel as a public representative that it is my duty to express my objection to it and state my reasons.  Those of us who have to deal with a large number of planning applications with local planning officers know how difficult it can be to deal with officials on this question and the different manner in which most of them will interpret what the councillors agree in their draft plans at the present time.  I do not think any county council has adopted a plan yet.  The very suggestion of handing over planning appeals to a judge of the High Court would seem to me to be a disastrous step.  The method of appeal suggested in this Private Bill is leaving these matters completely in the hands of bureaucrats, which to my mind is a step in the wrong direction as we suffer enough at their hands as it is without adding further to it.</P>
      <P>Though there are delays in deciding appeals those delays are not as long now as they were say twelve months ago.  There is a substantial reduction in recent times in the length of time taken by the Department in deciding appeals and I expect the position will continue to improve.  I believe this is a panic measure that has been introduced by Fine Gael.  It has been put down before all the local authorities have actually adopted plans for their areas. I think if it was felt necessary to introduce a measure like this after the plans were adopted there might be some reason for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There might then have been some reason for suggesting a change.  I do not know how many county councils have adopted their plans.  We certainly have not in Galway and I know there are not many county councils who have.  When the plans are adopted in the particular county the Minister is then obliged to decide on appeals made to him along the lines of the policy laid down in their plans.  In the case of Galway nobody knows what the planning officer will decide.  I consider it is premature to propose a change in the Planning Act at this stage when so few councils have adopted their plans.  There are many in the embryo stage.</P>
      <P>They are still trying to decide on what to exclude and what to include. No matter who is in government the elected representatives should have a say in the appeals and they should not be left to bureaucrats.  You are dealing with officials when you make the initial application.  If you fail to agree with their decision, then you have the option of appealing against it.  We should ensure that some public representative elected by the people should have a say in deciding appeals and who better than the Minister of the Department concerned.  Instead of losing the power we have at the moment we should be trying to hold on to it.  Maybe Fine Gael and Labour think there is some political gain to be got out of this Bill but in the interests of the public we should resist very strongly handing over the power we have at the moment to officials.</P>
      <P>I believe Fine Gael and Labour are running from their duties.  After all, if they have any ambition in politics they should be striving for the day they themselves would be in government and who can say but they may find themselves some day&mdash;in my estimation I do not think they will&mdash;in the position the Minister is in and they might not then agree with this Bill.  They seem to feel that this is some power which Fianna Fáil want for themselves and that seems to be what they are objecting to but, in fact, it is there for the protection of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> I was informed some months ago that in Galway County Council out of the total number of applications received ten per cent were refused permission and of those who went to appeal 50 per cent were granted by the Minister.  That is a fifty-fifty chance of the Minister granting an appeal.  In most cases he puts in conditions which the local authority were not prepared to put in because they were not prepared to go far enough to try to help the applicant.  A man may make an application and send in his plan and he will have to sit tight for two months or more pending a request for further information.  After that time he can get a letter saying that his application is turned down.  We have been striving to get this work speeded up between the applicant and the planning officer so that discussions could take place before decisions are given.  This has not happened very often up to this.  A man finds himself in an awkward position if he is just turned down.  He goes to the planning officer and asks why he was turned down.  He is told that he will have to appeal to the Minister.  In many cases if the planning officer discussed the matter with the applicant it could be cleared up.  Many of the planning officers are afraid to make any decision themselves.  The Minister is being put in an awkward position. A lot of those appeals could be decided locally if the planning officers only consulted with the applicants and if they had the courage to make favourable decisions on borderline cases.</P>
    <P>I feel the thinking in the planning office is to block.  They will not go to the applicant who is having difficulty and ask if he could meet their requirements in respect of future development. As I say, a lot of those cases could be decided on the spot if the applicant got the opportunity of discussing it.  He goes into the planning office on his own but thanks be to God he has the opportunity of appealing to a person who is spending his life as a public representative.  There is nobody better able to decide such things than people in public life.  Public representatives are continually dealing with officials and the general public and better able to understand both points of view and <Col N="510" /> in my opinion better qualified to give a balanced decision.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister is not influenced.  I have been up to the Minister on several occasions regarding planning appeals and have seen applications I supported turned down time out of hand.  The idea has been put forward by Fine Gael and Labour that there is some dishonesty in this matter. They must know themselves from the continuous results of elections that they are not codding anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress, I had just started to deal with vocational education.  I think it is now generally recognised that vocational education can play a major role in the economic development of this country.  The Minister informed the House that provision has now been made for the erection of nine regional technical colleges one of which is to be sited in Limerick.</P>
      <P>At page 17 of his brief, the Minister stated, in relation to these colleges:</P>
      <P>They will be more immediately concerned with providing courses aimed at filling gaps in the industrial manpower structure particularly in the technician area.  They will also provide senior cycle post-primary courses leading to the Leaving Certificate with a bias towards scientific, technical and commercial studies.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, generally recognised nowadays that one of the more serious deficiencies in our manpower requirements is the lack of an adequate pool of technicians.  The Minister hopes he will be able to fill the gap by means of these regional technical colleges.  He points out that these colleges will provide senior cycle post-primary courses leading to the Leaving Certificate with a bias towards scientific, technical and commercial studies.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable amount of confusion regarding the exact meaning of &ldquo;technical college&rdquo;.  We have a vocational school, a technical college and, higher up, a college of technology. These regional technical colleges, as far as I can gather from the Minister's speech, will not be colleges of higher technology.  They will provide &ldquo;senior cycle post-primary courses leading to the Leaving Certificate&rdquo;. There is probably a difference of opinion with regard to the aims and objectives of these types of colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to argument as to whether or not the proposed nine colleges will <Col N="512" /> in fact fulfil and meet the manpower requirements in the fields of technology, business, and so on.  In relation to the provision of higher technological education, I would point out, that there is a divergence of viewpoint as between the Minister's views, as expressed in his speech, and our educational policy as contained in the Fine Gael policy document.  Paragraph 101 of the Fine Gael policy document states:</P>
    <P>It seems clear that our requirements are for two- to three-year whole-time, post-Leaving Certificate courses for technicians.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Minister to the Lichfield Report relating to the Limerick region in which colleges of technology are referred to.  At IV. 45. that Report says:</P>
    <P>It is now clear that our objective would have been better defined if we had used the term Regional College of Technology.</P>
    <P>Take note that the Lichfield Report states:</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;technical college&rdquo; proposed for Limerick by the Government will not offer the level of training in management, professional or technical subjects that we had in mind; and it is at levels of management, in administration and production and business that the shortages exist which could threaten the expansion of industry and commerce in the Region.</P>
    <P>Therefore, according to the Lichfield Report, that particular relation of the manpower requirements of the Limerick region with the technical college to be provided there will not meet the requirements.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the Minister, when replying to this debate, should endeavour to define clearly and unmistakably the actual function of a vocational school, a technical college and a college of higher technology.  It is also vitally essential that there should be co-ordination and integration in respect of these three categories and a proper continuity from one to the other.  In general discussion with people, particularly in my constituency of Limerick where this is a very topical <Col N="513" /> subject at the moment in view of the fact that we have been awaiting this college for some time, it is apparent that there is considerable confusion as to what the Minister means by a &ldquo;technical college&rdquo;.  If it has the objective which the Minister sets out then, according to the Lichfield Report &mdash;which has found general acceptance &mdash;it will not fill our requirements.  I should like the Minister clearly to define the functions, aims and objectives of these technical colleges with particular reference to their relation to vocational schools on the one hand and colleges of higher technology on the other hand.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that the lack of suitable and adequate training facilities for technicians and for other categories of industrial workers is a matter of extreme urgency.  The industrial development of this country, its future economic expansion, will depend to a large extent on, and certainly is closely bound up with, technical and technological education.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question of vocational schools, as I stated last year and in previous years on this Estimate, I welcome the change in the method of appointing permanent teachers to the vocational service.  In previous debates, I have condemned the former method of appointment of canvassing members of the committee.  I am glad a change has been introduced.  I sincerely trust that future appointments will be made purely on merit and will be based on the qualities and qualifications of the individual candidates.  I always felt it was degrading and humiliating for qualified teachers to have to canvass the members of the committee to get votes for an appointment.</P>

      <P>That is a different context.  I trust the Minister will give us some idea of his intentions regarding the future of the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee and will tell the House whether he intends to reconstitute this Committee and the steps he proposes to <Col N="514" /> take.  In reply to questions here recently by Deputy Coughlan, the Minister stated that legislation would have to be introduced to reconstitute the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee. It was abolished some months ago following an inquiry.  It is vitally essential and a matter of urgency for the future technical vocational needs of Limerick city that this vocational education committee should be reconstituted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Coming to university education, I remember last year the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;who is sitting opposite me now, and he and I were sitting in the same position a year ago&mdash;made a courageous speech condemning the delay in the issue of the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  I was in entire agreement with him on that occasion and there were a few strong words between the Parliamentary Secretary and me.  Perhaps we might take credit from that and the fact that the report was issued not too long afterwards.  The report is a comprehensive, detailed document which deals with all the aspects of higher education. I do not intend, and, indeed, I do not deem myself qualified, to go into detail regarding the various recommendations in this report.  Various Deputies will deal with different aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is urgent need for a new approach to the whole question of university education.  Let us be frank and blunt about it.  University education in this year of 1968 is largely the prerogative of the rich and the well-to-do. The possibility of a boy or girl pursuing a university course is determined by the ability of the parents to pay for that course.  We have to look at this realistically.  We have to bear in mind the appalling and considerable wastage of talent of highly qualified young boys and girls who leave our secondary schools year after year, having attained a high standard in the leaving certificate.  I have come across them year after year and, in my honest opinion, it is one of the greatest tragedies of Irish education today that the brilliant boy or girl, with three or four honours, or more, in the leaving certificate <Col N="515" /> is precluded from pursuing university studies because of the fact that their parents are not able to bear the burden of paying for them.</P>
    <P>They are also precluded because they are not in the top two or three per cent for scholarships.  The number of scholarships we provide to the universities is probably the lowest in Western Europe.  I am relying on memory but I can certainly say without contradiction that there is no country in Europe which offers fewer university scholarships than we do.  Our number per thousand students as compared with the figure in Britain is very low.</P>
    <P>We talk about the problems of amalgamating the two universities in Dublin and the problems of providing additional accommodation in our provincial universities.  The first and most urgent problem the Minister has to make provision for at the present time is additional scholarships or financial assistance of some description so that a greater number of the best of our boys and girls, when they attain a high standard in the leaving certificate, will not be forced to take jobs in offices, with no prospects of promotion or anything else, which leads to frustration and a wastage of talent.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why it should not be possible and practicable immediately, in time for the coming university year, to increase considerably the number of scholarships available to boys and girls who because of the financial status of their parents, are unable to proceed to university education.  When I speak of scholarships, I believe that this whole question, the whole dimension and meaning of scholarships to university education, needs to be revised.  Nowadays university education is a costly business.  It is costly even for students whose parents live adjacent to the university city but it is almost prohibitive for students whose parents or whose homes are more than 30 or 40 miles away.  Accommodation, tuition fees and all the other ancillary costs have reached the stage where they are becoming prohibitive for the vast majority of our students.</P>
    <P>The second observation I should like <Col N="516" /> to make is in relation to the report of the Commission on Higher Education. The most revolutionary recommendation made in that report is that regarding the setting up of New Colleges. This is a new type of university and it has been recommended that we in Limerick would get one of these colleges and that this New College would be adequate to our requirements.  I want to state here, emphatically and quite clearly, that I do not agree with this idea of a New College.  Certainly I do not accept that this type of New College will be adequate to meet the higher educational requirements of Limerick and its surrounding area.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that these New Colleges are inferior types of university institutions.  They will have power to grant pass degrees and it is stated that a student who graduates in one of these New Colleges will be able to proceed to a higher degree elsewhere. I want to make it quite clear that we in Limerick will not accept this New College.  We believe, and it is my opinion, that the Commission on Higher Education, when they arrived at this idea of a New College, arrived at it because they were in a fix.  They did not concede the merits of the Limerick claim to a constituent college of the National University of Ireland but they did concede in a haphazard way that there was a need for facilities for higher education in our city and they offered us this sort of a new College.</P>
    <P>Nobody will tell me that a student graduating with a degree from one of these New Colleges will be held in the same standing as a student who graduates with a degree from University College, Dublin, or from Galway, or from any of the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland. This idea of a New College is a bad idea.  Furthermore, I have yet to be convinced of what, in fact, is the advantage of this New College.  As far as I can gather, the cost of erecting this New College recommended by the Commission for Higher Education would be just as high as the cost of providing a full-blown constituent college of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> Therefore, there seems to be no saving. It certainly will limit the unfortunate students in Limerick and its surrounding areas who want to pursue a university course in the number of courses they can pursue because these New Colleges provide courses only in a limited number of faculties.  Secondly, they are only going to grant a pass degree.  These colleges will cost as much to erect and equip as a constituent college of the NUI.  I cannot see what sense there is in establishing this new institution; I cannot see the argument for it.  Certainly, as far as Limerick is concerned, it is completely out.  We have looked for, and we believe we have a cast-iron case for, a constituent college of the NUI.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from the same constituency and consequently is interested in the problem.  I do not know what his views are in relation to these New Colleges, but I want to let him know my views on them.  I would refer him again to the Lichfield Report, chapter 4, paragraph 46, section 2, in which the question of university facilities for Limerick are dealt with.  It states:</P>
    <P>The lack of university education in Limerick has a detrimental effect on the business-professional community in Limerick, and tends to cause them to move to university towns, especially Dublin, where their children have a much better chance of getting to a university.</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>That a university college with faculties in agriculture, medicine and engineering would be a stimulus to the development of all these industries and would attract research facilities to the City and Region.</P>
    <P>This is different from the so-called university institution which has been recommended by the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    <P>In Chapter 13 Lichfield, referring again to the higher educational needs of the Limerick region, states:</P>
    <P>The new Limerick Region as we conceive it will not be complete in character nor function adequately as an economic or social unit unless it <Col N="518" /> has amongst its central functions a university college.  This is not a question of seeking a &lsquo;status symbol&rsquo;; it is simply a matter of enabling young people from the Region to study near their homes and to offer facilities which attract persons who have it in their power to bring new employment to the area.</P>
    <P>The Region needs locally the research facilities and the exchange of ideas between faculties and skills which only a university can provide. Medicine and some aspects of Agricultural Sciences and Economics could be basic faculties together with Engineering of all kinds and the Physical Sciences.</P>
    <P>Now comes a very important part which ties up with what I have been saying earlier about a college of technology, its function and scope and relationship to a university.  Lichfield sums it up by saying:</P>
    <P>For this last reason we would recommend that the Regional College of Technology and the Regional University College should be on the same &ldquo;campus&rdquo; so that they could share many facilities such as laboratories and workshops, hostels and student facilities and sports grounds, and also a Regional Reference Library.</P>
    <P>I will be looking forward eagerly to the Minister's reply to this debate.  I sincerely hope that his views regarding a university for Limerick and mine coincide.  I cannot accept this idea of a New College which was recommended by the Commission.  The only way the requirements of the Limerick region can be met is in the manner outlined in the Lichfield Report.  In dealing with Limerick, I might be accused of being parochial on this matter of higher education.  I make no apology for pleading Limerick's case as I have pleaded it on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>There are some further general remarks I wish to make on the whole question of university education.  I have already advocated a vast increase in the number of scholarships, but there is another approach, which as an interim measure, might help to provide <Col N="519" /> university facilities for some of those who seek them now but cannot afford to pursue them.  I could never understand why the National University of Ireland will not grant external degrees as London University does.  It is possible for any student, provided he has the subjects and standards which meet the requirements of the matriculation examination in London University, to pursue a course leading to a degree from that university without having to attend lectures.  The course can be pursued by means of correspondence, tutorials or various other ways.  I did a course in London University.  Studying in one's own home for a degree, in one's own time and without any on-the-spot guidance, is a difficult undertaking.  The syllabus for some of the courses is complicated. For example, if one wants to do the B.Econ.Sc. the economics course would not be related to the Irish national economic sphere and the student would be at a disadvantage in that respect.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why the NUI will not allow students to pursue a course of studies leading to an external degree even in arts and commerce. In 1952 or 1953, UCD did introduce a new type of evening course whereby it was possible for students to proceed to a B.A. or B.Comm. while being asked to attend only one lecture per week in each subject.  It should be possible, particularly in a B.A. course embracing literature and history, which mainly entails reading, for the NUI to provide external courses and to grant external degrees just as London University does.  I would recommend this as a possible way of easing the problem of providing university facilities for many of our students.</P>
    <P>There is one notable omission from the Minister's speech.  I do not know what the explanation for it is.  In the Estimate for the past four or five years, there was a subvention for adult education. If I recall correctly, there was a precise grant for the Catholic Workers' College in Dublin and a grant for Muintir na Tíre for rural education. There was no reference to these in the <Col N="520" /> Minister's speech.  If it is a fact that the subvention to the Catholic Workers' College, Muintir na Tíre and other organisations providing adult education courses has been dropped, it is a retrograde step.  We are all aware or should be, of the tremendous work in the field of adult education carried out by the Catholic Workers' College in Dublin, by University College, Cork, by Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and some of our other rural organisations.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state, when he is replying to this debate, what his views are regarding this whole question of adult education.  I recall last year, when speaking in this debate, the Minister expressed extraordinary views regarding this whole question of adult education.  He stated that he did not agree with the wisdom of providing diploma courses in sociology and economics, because his experience was that these courses had a bad effect on certain people.  I presume he was speaking in a humorous manner and only meant that it made them very awkward members of political cumainn because they were too much inclined to ask questions.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister is not dropping the assistance to adult education and particularly the courses being provided at UCC, the diploma courses in sociology and economics.  I am sure Deputy Mrs. Desmond is very familiar with these courses and is aware of their value in rural towns throughout the south of Ireland, how stimulating they are and how much more interesting they make life for the students.  I would ask the Minister to state specifically what his views are in relation to adult education and particularly in relation to the courses being provided by the Catholic Workers' College, by Muintir na Tíre, and by University College, Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject which we are now debating is, I suppose, the most debated subject in this country over the last two years.  At symposiums, open houses, teach-ins and what have you, the various aspects of education have been debated very thoroughly. This enormous public interest in the <Col N="521" /> subject of education has, I think, been aroused by the presentation of factual evidence of the social injustices built into our educational system down through the years and of the inadequacy of our system to meet the changing requirements of the 1960's and the 1970's.  The result of this public awareness, arising out of this enormous amount of discussion on the subject of education, is that a very suitable climate has now been created for any Minister for Education to embark on progressive schemes to improve our educational system.</P>
      <P>We welcome the advances the Minister has made, and we do not hesitate to say the Minister has made great advances in the field of education.  We welcome, in the first instance, the provision of additional money for the purpose of educational research.  It is important, if we are to keep up our standards, if we are to keep abreast of the changing complexity of the problem of education, that a great deal of time and money be devoted to the subject of research.  Indeed, the lack of research down through the years, under native government in particular, has resulted in the adult population leaving Ireland today very ill-equipped to meet the foreigner in this age of mechanisation, in this age of broader horizons and keener competition with our neighbours in other countries.</P>
      <P>Our standards are set and, possibly, maintained at university level, but it is at primary level that the foundation of our educational system is laid.  Our national school education as such is now found to be no longer adequate to meet the demands of the future. National education will not meet these demands, but it is at that level that the stage is set for further education; it is at that level that the student becomes either well-disposed or ill-disposed to continue within the educational system, that interest in the pursuit of knowledge is aroused and the basic attitude towards education is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that the teacher may perform this function satisfactorily, it is important that education at the primary level be provided, first of all, in congenial surroundings and in classes of manageable size.  These are the two <Col N="522" /> fundamental shortcomings in the primary education system today.  The Minister, in the course of his address to us this afternoon referred to the fact that continued efforts were being made to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools, the aim being a figure of 35 pupils per teacher.  I agree wholeheartedly with the opinion expressed by the previous speaker, Deputy O'Donnell, that 35 children per teacher was not an adequate ratio, that it should be 30 or less.  I agree with his views.  Many of our teachers are doing magnificent work in the present situation, fostering critical faculties in our children, arousing their interest in education generally, and for such teachers the work, though arduous, must be very rewarding indeed.  However, there are others condemned to teach classes to which the Minister referred today, classes of 40 and well over 40, particularly in our city schools.</P>
    <P>I know from speaking to such teachers that all they can hope to achieve for the first year or two of a child's life at school is to get that child, in union with his classmates, to walk properly in a straight line.  Is that not a very frustrating situation for a teacher trained and equipped to impart knowledge, to educate children?  This is the situation that still obtains, and this is a very vital reason why our primary schools are not performing the functions to which I referred at the outset, that of providing a basic education and of arousing in children an interest in further educational pursuits.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the structure in which the education is provided.  The Minister referred to this matter in his speech here today.  A lot of publicity has been given of late to the conditions in our national schools. This is something to which all of us who have been talking on this subject of education have referred repeatedly when the occasion presented itself on this Estimate.  It is tragic, and it just should not happen, that children of tender years and, indeed, our teachers are condemned to spend the larger part of their day in surroundings which are a positive hazard to their health.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the present <Col N="523" /> dispute concerning the conditions obtaining in these schools.  On the whole, he has laid the blame on the school managers.  I have not seen the circular which was issued to the school managers but I am a member of a local authority and I am familiar with departmental circulars, and because I am a member of a local authority and familiar with departmental circulars, I would need to see this circular to be convinced that all the blame rests with the school managers.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are managers, be they few or numerous, who may not be living up to their responsibilities. In every profession there are people&mdash;we are all human beings &mdash;who will not live up to their responsibilities. In his statement, speaking about schools with a life expectancy of less than five years, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>... we told them not to proceed without prior consultation with the Department in any case where due to amalgamation or replacement the life expectancy of the school was less than five years.</P>
    <P>He was referring to the satisfactory heating and sanitary systems in schools.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>...my Department has never refused a grant for urgent works...</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must concede that heating and the provision of toilet facilities are urgent works.  When we consider that five years represents more than half of a child's primary school life, we must surely concede that there is absolutely no point in holding up the provision of toilet facilities and proper heating because of the fact that the school might be amalgamated or replaced by another school in five years time.  Five years is a long period of time.  It occurs to me that there is some confusion&mdash;or perhaps it is a lack of communication between the Department and the school managers &mdash;on this issue.  The Minister should hold himself responsible for this and ensure that even where a school is to be closed within five years, such urgent works as the provision of toilet facilities and proper heating for the benefit of those who are confined in these <Col N="524" /> schools for several hours are put in hand regardless of the fact that the school is scheduled for closing in a short period of time.</P>
    <P>There should be more inspections of primary schools by qualified people from the Department.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that the number of unfit and insanitary primary schools throughout the country is drastically reduced, not over a period of years but forthwith if possible. These works should be put in hand forthwith and the Minister should ensure that, in the shortest possible time, through his efforts no child is condemned to study and no teacher is condemned to teach in these insanitary hovels&mdash;which is the only way I can think of to describe some of the schools we know to be in existence in this country today.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the annual increase in primary teachers.  We all welcome this increase but there are other teachers who might be considered for absorption into the primary schools system.  There is the question of the untrained teachers.  We were all glad to hear recently that there is a proposal to train these teachers.  Some of them are rather concerned at the long time it will take before they are trained.  There is an intake of something in the nature of 50 teachers a year.  These teachers, realising the space there is in the training colleges, cannot understand why something like four years must elapse before they are all trained.  Those who are told they must wait four years cannot understand why they cannot be accommodated in the training colleges in one or two years.  I should like to hear from the Minister if there is some reason why all these teachers cannot be trained forthwith.  If there is no reason, I suggest that this should be put in hand.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of our Montessori and Froebel teachers.  They are recognised only for the purpose of teaching mentally handicapped children. We heartily welcome the efforts made by the Minister to provide improved facilities for the teaching of mentally handicapped children.  I join with Deputy O'Donnell in saying on <Col N="525" /> behalf of my Party that any effort made to improve the lot of these, the neediest section of our community, will receive our wholehearted support. There are other teachers trained in these methods who have not got a vocation for teaching mentally handicapped children.  I have met some of them and talked with them.  They are now teaching in private primary schools and receiving appallingly low wages.  They contend that they have no vocation for teaching mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many, but a number of them are contemplating emigrating as a last resort.  Whether their numbers are small&mdash;and I believe they are&mdash;these teachers could be utilised in our larger primary schools for the purpose of reducing the pupil/teacher ratio and also because their more practical methods would be advantageous in the teaching of children with less than average intelligence, emotionally disturbed children, and the doubting Thomases, the children who will not grasp that four fives make 20 unless they see it and who will not grasp that Dublin is the capital of Ireland unless they see Dublin on a map of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The methods of these teachers could be utilised for teaching such problem children, if you like to call them that. Their numbers may be small but they would serve to improve the pupil/ teacher ratio which is so drastically inadequate in our larger city schools. Before I leave the question of mentally handicapped children I should like to join with the Minister in congratulating those voluntary organisations who have done so much for mentally handicapped children.  They have done magnificent work and they certainly deserve the compliments and gratitude of all of us, and particularly those of us in public life.</P>
    <P>There is in our primary schools also a drastic lack of audio and visual aids. The use of these methods of imparting knowledge is best exemplified by the recent success of Buntús Cainte.  It may be said that not all of those who watch Buntús Cainte listen to the Irish. They may be looking at the girls or at their mode of attire but to some extent <Col N="526" /> they are absorbing Irish which is the purpose of the programme.  Audio and visual aids are vitally important in national schools where we are dealing with little children for whom education has to compete with so many other interesting things in the world today.  In the other levels of education something is done about the provision of these aids.  Where the lack is most keenly felt is at the primary level where they could be of benefit in the teaching of little children.</P>
    <P>Last year speaking on this Estimate I referred to the subject of the teaching of Irish and to the over-emphasis on grammar, reading and writing of Irish at an early age.  Irish is an essential subject and, as our national language, must be fostered and helped in every way possible.  I concur with those who contend that too much of the school day is devoted to the teaching of Irish without achieving the desired effect, which is proficiency in a spoken language. I do not want to repeat what I said last year on this subject but to emphasise again the need to continue removing the emphasis from reading and writing of Irish in the case of very young children and the placing of emphasis on the speaking of the language.</P>
    <P>Involvement of parents in the education of children is vital.  Unfortunately, we have a situation brought about in this country in which parents have tended to become involved in the education process only in times of crisis.  A committee of parents set up only in times of crisis is not the best thing possible to deal with the crisis. If such committees were set up in normal times when everything was running smoothly then whatever form of crisis did come the committee would be better able to cope with it and find an amicable solution to it.  Indeed, this question of involvement of parents in the process of the education of children is an enormous problem.  We need only read the booklet by Father Ryan on &ldquo;Social Dynamite&rdquo; to realise that the situation to which he refers can be found in every large town and certainly in every city in the country. Parents are victims of the educational system provided down through the <Col N="527" /> years, but they are victims also of policies applied by other departments. Their plight is not exclusively in the province of education.  We might include the Department of Local Government, the local authorities, the Department of Social Welfare, and so on, but I think a great deal of field work must be done in the particular area and a great deal of effort must be made to involve parents in the education of their children.  Not just when the child reaches the age of leaving the primary school to embark on a secondary or vocational career, but from the moment the child goes to school, there must be involvement of the parents in the child's progress at school.</P>
    <P>When referring to the children in the built-up areas and the large housing estates where all incentive to higher education is removed I should refer also to the question of career guidance.  We have placed a great deal of emphasis on career guidance at secondary level or, say, at the mid-secondary or mid-vocational level, but I believe that at this stage it comes too late because many parents need assistance when the child is at an earlier age.  I believe that career guidance is needed generally at that earlier age and my views are strengthened by the statement made by the Minister on page 23 of his report when he speaks about the fact that comprehensive schools will be few in the future and that an effort will be made to get co-operation between secondary and vocational schools.  He says that we still have a long way to go to get complete co-operation between the two post-primary forms of education but that a start has been made.  Until we get that co-operation and until we have a fully comprehensive system of post-primary education available to all children the need to have career guidance will arise at an earlier age.  That is why the Labour Party always emphasises the need for career guidance at the point when the child leaves the national school and embarks, as most children have to do, on a secondary or vocational school career.  If comprehensive education were provided <Col N="528" /> in all areas possibly this need would not arise until the child had reached perhaps the junior level of post-primary education, but until this comprehensive system obtains very many parents will need guidance as to which type of post-primary education is suitable for their children.</P>
    <P>We have cynics in regard to education who put forward as the reason for their cynicism the large number of leaving certificate pass holders who cannot secure employment in this country.  They point to the child who left school earlier and got a job as against the leaving certificate holder who cannot secure employment of any kind.  That leaving certificate holder would not be there if career guidance were available for him before he began his post-primary career.  He would probably be directed&mdash;I do not say forced&mdash;or advised to follow a more technical kind of education which would probably suit his particular talents much better.  That is why I think career guidance at that level is of vital importance.  In view of what the Minister has to say as regards co-operation between the two forms of post-primary education, I think it will be necessary to provide career guidance for some time to come.  I sincerely hope this type of co-operation will be forthcoming in the future and that as time passes the two types of education will be more closely interlinked.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and we are all very happy to hear it, that 92 per cent of our children are now participating in the free secondary education scheme introduced last September. This has been more than equal to our expectations and we are all very happy that such a large number of schools have opted into the free scheme.  There is, of course, still the eight per cent. The Minister may know better than I what are the motives they have for remaining outside the scheme.  I suppose there will always be those who wish to remain exclusive but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something which I hope is very isolated but which I suspect might be happening within the free scheme.  This <Col N="529" /> concerns the devious means which can be used, and which I suspect may be used, in isolated cases, by schools within the scheme, to remain socially exclusive.  I have heard of a case of one school&mdash;I do not wish to generalise if this is not warranted&mdash;where places are reserved for sisters or daughters of past pupils thus ensuring that children from all walks of life are not able to come within the scope of the education that school provides.  I should like the Minister to ensure that such practices do not continue in a scheme which is State financed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's provision in regard to building grants for secondary schools.  Attention was drawn during the year to the practice of secondary schools which acquire money from parents for the purpose of paying for building costs.  This practice is best avoided and it can result in very great embarrasment for pupils and for parents who are unable to meet the sum requested.  Any effort which the Minister makes to increase these grants is certainly welcome and any effort he makes to ensure that this practice of requesting contributions from parents, who perhaps are unable to pay them, is eliminated will be welcomed by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the free transport scheme.  Last year when speaking on this estimate I wholeheartedly welcomed the Minister's scheme for free transport and I stated that I thought that it would work very well particularly in areas where parents had already organised transport for children and perhaps were unable to afford that transport.  I hope it will work equally well generally.  The Minister has made two statements in the course of a week on free transport.  On Thursday last, when replying to a question by Deputy Donegan at column 346, volume 232, of the Official Report he stated that:</P>
    <P>The transport scheme being operated under aegis of my Department ensures that every eligible child living three miles or more from the nearest post-primary centre is provided with free transport to that centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Today the Minister states that there are 2,500 children for whom free transport has not so far been made available. I accept the Minister's statement today.  I was rather surprised at his previous statement because I know that there are children living in rather isolated areas for whom free transport has not yet been introduced and for whom I envisage a great deal of difficulty in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have cases of families living perhaps seven or eight miles from the centre of their catchment area, there may perhaps be two families with a total of five, six or seven children attending the secondary school and it has not been found possible to provide transport for them.  They may have transport for three miles of that seven or eight miles but they are so isolated that they are still three or four miles distant from the bus service which is operating to that centre.  I know of cases of children who, so that they may avail of post-primary education, have to leave school at 12 o'clock each day to avail of a drive home in a local car, otherwise they would have to walk five miles having left the bus. For children of 12 or 13 years of age to do that in winter time is absolutely impossible and something which the parents could not allow.  I am told by their teachers that these are very bright children and certainly they are not getting justice under our system when they have to leave school at 12 o'clock each day and so lose a great deal of the subjects which are necessary for them if they are to succeed in their educational pursuits.</P>
    <P>Earlier I spoke about the great social problems in some large cities and towns and about the people who are victims of very confused and certainly unchristian thinking and who because they come from certain backgrounds and localities find on the completion of their post-primary education, that they cannot secure posts on equal terms with those people in our society who are luckier.  This is a great problem. It is something which does not altogether come within the province of this Department.  There is, however, an injustice, or at least there was up to last year, in regard to the operation of <Col N="531" /> something else which is within the Department's province.  I refer to the system operated by the Cork City Vocational Education Committee. This committee receives a greater subsidy from the State than does the Cork County Vocational Education Committee by virtue of the fact that on a regional system it takes in children from outside its area.</P>
    <P>There was a system obtaining within the committee up to last year whereby a post-leaving certificate secretarial course for girls was, and still is, in operation for the city and county.  The method adopted for selection for that course was a rather extraordinary one. Pupils are selected for this course before the leaving certificate results become known.  I could understand that this might be necessary but no emphasis was placed on their achievements in the leaving certificate; emphasis seemed to be placed on the replies to questions such as where their fathers worked, or their sisters or their brothers worked.  I have every reason to believe this.  It would appear extraordinary that those who need help most were the ones who, as a result of that interview, did not get it.  Those who would be in a position to pay for this education are the ones who get this education which is subsidised by the State.  Those who could not pursue it unless it was subsidised by the State were the ones who were not selected at the interview which I thought placed a lot of stress on the family background of the candidate, although I do not see why it should. If this system is still in operation I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that some more just method of selecting candidates for this course will be adopted in future.  Many of the unjust practices operating against people in certain strata of society are outside the Minister's province but if this practice still persists it is within the field of education and I would ask the Minister to ensure that it is discontinued forthwith.</P>
    <P>In regard to the free transport scheme which has operated well and which, as the Minister states, has catered for all but 2,500 children outside <Col N="532" /> the three mile limit, I would point out that it is also creating a great deal of confusion.  I can understand when I am approached by a parent, who happens to be a widow, in regard to a child who is living just within the three mile limit and, therefore, must pay these greatly increased bus fares, while a child who lives across the road comes from a family whose income must be in the region of £3,000 and because that child attended a school which just happens to be over three miles from his home, the child of the relatively well-off parents has his transport free while the child of the person who cannot afford transport must pay the cost.  I know there must be some guideline laid down but it is very difficult to get people to understand that there is no emphasis whatsoever on ability to pay with regard to this free transport scheme.  The ideal, of course, is that means tests should not be tolerated at all within the educational system but here we have a geographical means test which seems to operate very unfavourably when we come to thinking in financial terms. The Minister should strive, as soon as it is possible for him to do so, to remove this barrier with regard to transport and to enable children who must avail of a bus service to get to school and who are within the three mile limit to travel free on the bus because as it stands at the moment a great deal of understandable confusion exists in the minds of the people.  Those who have to pay feel wronged when they find their better-off neighbours, by virtue of the fact that their children attend a school which is a little further away, qualify.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year about the Minister's scheme for free books.  This is a part of the Minister's scheme with which I totally disagree.  I stated last year that I thought the sum involved was not worth the introduction of a means test at this level.  Now that the free books scheme has been in operation I am more convinced than ever that this means test should never have been introduced.  Last year the Minister stated that he wanted to avoid a means test.  Of course, he has not avoided a means test.  In fact, he has <Col N="533" /> made not the headmasters but I would say the social welfare officers the officers to decide whether or not a child is eligible for free books.  What is happening in our schools is that headmasters, quite understandably not aware of the financial circumstances of the parents of every child in their schools, are asking those children to bring their medical cards to school to try to ascertain whether or not they are entitled to the supply of free books from the Department.  Any means test &mdash;if there must be one&mdash;should be operated with a certain amount of dignity and discretion.  There is no dignity or discretion in this system.  It is embarrassing for the headmasters, it is very embarrassing for the parents and, worse than all, it is embarrassing for the children, those children who must produce their medical cards.  We all know how children talk at school and what an embarrassment this must be for the children who must avail of this free books scheme.</P>
    <P>We have our own problem with regard to this scheme on the County Cork Vocational Education Committee. Having got the Minister's proposals for the operation of the scheme, we foresaw the problem that would arise, the injustice that would arise and we referred the scheme back to the Minister's Department and asked them to reconsider the allocation of free books for all the children within the vocational education system.  Some time elapsed and finally we were told that this would not be possible.  We now have a situation where some children have been given free books. Some headmasters have given these books freely in anticipation of being recouped.  Others have not done so.  I hope that will resolve itself but I would once again appeal to the Minister not to persist in applying this means test to the supply of school books.  The amount of money involved is, by comparison with the total sum expended on education, generally very small.  I feel the price of allowing free books to all children would be a small price to pay for the elimination of this unrest and this class distinction that is being caused.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated last year that <Col N="534" /> when his scheme was in operation he would look into the feasibility of providing maintenance grants for some children attending post-primary schools.  We know, as Deputy O'Donnell has stated, that there are parents who, with the abolition of fees, with the provision of free transport and free books, are still not financially capable of forgoing the earning power of their children beyond the age of 14 years.  We have parents of large families growing up and costing naturally more than they cost the previous year, placed in a position where they are existing until their eldest child can go out and earn a living and subsidise the family income. These people, and there are many of them, cannot avail of any scheme of free education without the advantage of maintenance grants.  Since the publication of our document on education this has been a basic issue with us. Knowing that so many of our people are not capable of availing of the incentives to education that are available without some compensation being made to them to enable them to forgo the earning power of their families, we believe that maintenance grants are essential if education beyond the primary level is to be available to all our children.  Last year the Minister acknowledged that this need existed and he promised that when this scheme was in operation he would examine this particular aspect of the matter. I hope that the Minister has kept that promise.  To date he has not announced that he intends to do anything about the provision of maintenance grants but I hope that at least the matter is still being pursued and that it is something that will come in the next school year; that the provision of maintenance grants will be introduced to enable the children of very many of our parents who could not otherwise do so to avail of this otherwise free scheme of post-primary education.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister&mdash;and this is something I feel rather strongly about&mdash;to include elocution in the subjects covered.  Schools which employ teachers for the purpose of teaching elocution must bear the full cost of the salary of those teachers.  I feel <Col N="535" /> elocution should be included as a subject in all our secondary schools. It is a great leveller.  It is something which, I think, children are entitled to avail of and it is something which at present can only be availed of by those who can afford to pay for it. I feel strongly about this question and I would ask the Minister to have teachers of elocution in the schools which have opted for his scheme recognised for incremental purposes by the Department.</P>
    <P>We are all happy to hear of the proposal to erect colleges of technology. Like Deputy O'Donnell, we are all confused to an extent about the actual purposes these colleges will serve.  The Minister explained today that these colleges will remain adaptable for particular purposes so as to cater for such emergencies as may arise and that their purpose is that they be adaptable and so constituted that they would constantly meet the economic need of the community.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, with regard to these regional technical colleges, has he any doubt about their staffing. In recent weeks I have seen a large number of advertisements for staff for the College of Technology in Dublin and I wondered why there was such a big demand for staff.  Perhaps it is due to an expansion of the number of students availing of this type of education but having regard to the appearance of these advertisements at this time of the year, I wondered if difficulty was being experienced in procuring staff for the colleges.  I hope that my fears in this respect are not well founded and that no problem will arise.</P>
    <P>I concur with the views of the previous speaker with regard to the setting up of new colleges.  We in the Labour Party have condemned the introduction of a two-tier system of higher education and particularly the suggestion that teacher-training should be allied to these new colleges.  Candidates who qualify for teacher-training have a very high standard of education and persons of that standard would be an asset to a university.  I cannot understand the suggestion that teacher-training <Col N="536" /> would be allied to the new colleges.</P>
    <P>In the whole field of higher education there is an enormous problem principally with regard to under-financing. We have discovered very recently how bereft of funds our universities are.  Without making any reference to proposed mergers or any matter which might be <i>sub judice</i> at the moment, we cannot leave this Estimate without referring to the gross lack of funds within the universities.  In Britain, the investment per pupil in university education is at least three times the investment in this country. Of course, in Britain, most university students are scholarship holders and have maintenance grants.  There is an enormous gap between the endowment per pupil in Britain, our nearest neighbour, and the endowment here.</P>
    <P>There is the very big problem highlighted by the Report of the Commission on Higher Education of the staff-student ratio in our universities.  The Commission recommended a staff-student ratio of 12 to one while it is over 20 to one at the moment.  Documentation which we have received either today or yesterday from Galway University indicates that that university has only one-third of the staff required to achieve the ratio recommended by the Commission.  They would need an increase of 125 in staff to reach the recommended ratio and they estimate the cost at £325,000 per annum which is almost as much again as the total current endowment to Galway University.  These figures indicate the enormous problems that exist with regard to university education.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly university education is a very expensive type of education and the Commission have rightly recommended that it is a system in which standards must be maintained. We must ensure that the best students enter the universities.  Down through the years that has not been the case. As the previous speaker has said, the criterion has been ability to pay rather than ability to benefit.  An extension of scholarships will ensure a higher entrance level.  This will mean that in future the emphasis will be on ability to benefit rather than ability to <Col N="537" /> pay.  Maintenance grants are a very vital matter at this level.  The money available should be utilised to the best advantage of the nation and that can be done only by ensuring that the pupils receiving university education are those best equipped to benefit by it, regardless of family finances.</P>
    <P>We have been hoping for some announcement with regard to making university education available to a wider section of the community.  So far no such announcement has been made.  It is something to which we look forward.  The system which did obtain with regard to post-primary education still obtains with regard to higher education, that is, a system which gives privilege on the basis of ability to pay rather than ability to benefit.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  Our concepts of social justice in 1968 would dictate that this situation cannot continue.  Our survival as a nation depends on its immediate removal and the opening up of all avenues of higher education to children from every stratum of society who can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Minister has done a great deal for education&mdash; we concede him that&mdash;but a great deal remains to be done.  The two big issues at post-primary level are the elimination of the means test in regard to the provision of free books and the provision of maintenance grants for the needier sections of the community.  The important issue at post-secondary level is the opening up of university education to all who can benefit from it. These are two aspects to which we hope the Minister will give his attention in the months ahead.  We shall welcome wholeheartedly any proposal to implement these very vital aspects of our policy.  Any proposal that the Minister introduces will have our wholehearted support.  We look forward to hearing the Minister announce &mdash;perhaps in his reply to this debate but certainly within a very short space of time&mdash;some concrete and useful proposals to eliminate the injustices that still prevail in our system of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach cogháirdeachas a <Col N="538" /> dhéanamh leis an Aire agus le hoifigí a Roinne ar a bhfuil déanta acu le deireannas le feabhas a chur ar chóras oideachais na tíre seo.  Tá sé cinnte go bhfágfaidh an tAire a mharc ar chúrsaí oideachais na tíre seo agus ar a bhfuil déanta aige is cosúil nach ligfear a ainm i ndearmad.</P>
      <P>The most significant feature of this Estimate is the statement of the Minister that the amount spent on primary education in the present financial year was roughly £20 million, £4 million more than was spent ten years ago in the total provision for education.  The total expenditure then was less than £16 million.  Now close on £20 million is being spent in primary education alone, or more than 50 per cent of the total amount allocated to education. That is a most creditable performance and it represents a financial and material expansion in education that those of us here associated in different capacities with education scarcely anticipated.</P>
      <P>The statistics in relation to primary education are very revealing, particularly those in relation to the building of new schools, the replacement of old schools, the teacher-pupil ratio, and other matters vitally affecting education. The improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio is something that all of us welcome.  I remember having classes of close on 70 when I was teaching here in Dublin.  That was invariably the position at the commencement of a new school year when children arrived for enrolment.  The ratio has now fallen to one to 35.  That is a step in the right direction.  I support Deputy Mrs. Desmond in her commendation of that reduction and I hope that the ratio will improve further in the not too distant future. That reduction has been brought about by the policy of the Minister and his predecessors during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that this ratio of one to 35 does not really represent conditions.  He has taken the overall picture to arrive at that ratio. It is deplorable that there should be classes of 40 or more.  It is difficult enough to control classes of that size, <Col N="539" /> never mind teaching the children.  We all hope that a further reduction will be brought about in the ratio by the appointment of additional teachers in the new financial year.  The aim should be one to 25 or one to 30 at the outside.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is heartened by the evidence of developing appreciation of the educational advantages of the policy of securing larger schools. Some years ago, when a number of small schools were closed with the object of implementing this policy, there was an uproar.  Now, thank God, we hear very little about the closing of smaller schools and the creation of a central parish school.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the extension of St. Patrick's Training College. The teachers in training now have much better conditions than those we enjoyed in our time.  Who is responsible for St.Patrick's practising schools?  I was under the impression that a teacher in training should get an opportunity of teaching in a school in which everything possible was done to show that student teacher the very best conditions, the best type of surroundings, and so on, in order to enable him to aspire to that desirable objective when he went to teach down the country.  Passing by Drumcondra, as I do on my way here, I cannot notice any external improvement in St. Patrick's. It has not changed, as far as I can see, from the time I was there.  I do not know who is responsible, whether it is the Department or those in charge, but something should be done to improve the external appearance of the college.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for me to comment on the recent controversy about the conditions of so many schools.  Certain it is that many of them need replacement. Apparently the action of the INTO was justified.  Throughout the country there are many fine national schools, many beautiful buildings, the cost of the erection of which imposed a burden on school managers.</P>
    <P>By and large, the managers have been very good.  In some places they may not have done everything expected <Col N="540" /> of them but that should not be taken as meaning that all school managers were deficient in their duties, not alive to their responsibilities.  I know a parish near me&mdash;the parish in which I taught &mdash;where three new schools have been erected during the past 15 years. That was no small burden on the school manager at the time, now dead: it involved the collection of the local contribution in a short period in a small parish.  We should remember that more than 90 per cent of the reverend managers are prepared to shoulder the burden and are doing so manfully.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to mentally handicapped children.  I must take this opportunity to compliment and, indeed, to thank the Minister and his officials for the help they have given to us in County Galway in arranging for the provision of transport for those children to the schools in Galway city that cater for their needs.  I wish to compliment also the highmindedness and idealism of the people who helped to organise local committees to raise funds to provide transport at a time when the Department of Education were not in a position to do so.  It is something that has to be seen and experienced before it can be believed.</P>
    <P>I know of a town now far from me where the people organised and took turns to drive cars to Galway every day, and back, bringing a number of those children to school.  When the matter was brought to the notice of the Department they gave us a full cost grant to enable the children to be brought to school and home by CIE.  The fortitude of the parents and the goodness of the people in the area not primarily concerned with the problem&mdash;not having it in their families&mdash;deserve the highest praise. New schools are being provided in many centres and the facilities for the education of those children are being extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>For too long the Department of Education, and, indeed, the inspectors, disregarded the existence of children slow to learn and possibly mentally retarded.  Too much was expected of them.  People are becoming more enlightened. <Col N="541" /> Inspectors are realising the magnitude of the trouble, that it is not one to be laid at the doors, as it often was, of the teachers&mdash;that the teachers were not working hard enough to bring those children up to scratch&mdash;but a natural problem due to the physical condition of the children.  It is a pity the present view did not obtain long ago when children, and, indeed, their teachers, were blamed because the children were backward.  It is a problem that even more thought could be given to.  There is a percentage of children in every class who are slow learners, slow to develop, and more cognisance should be taken of that problem.</P>
    <P>On post-primary education I am delighted to see that Deputies of different Parties have hastened, through television even, to praise the Minister for Education for the steps he has taken to provide this service.  When the Minister announced the scheme would begin last September there were many doubters&mdash;there were many people with other schemes who naturally thought their schemes were better than the Minister's and possibly that they might be better vote-catchers.  The fact that the scheme is working satisfactorily, that children are being brought to school, that tuition is being paid for, that everything is working as well as can be expected, is the proof of the pudding.</P>
    <P>The whole face of rural Ireland, in particular, has been changed by the appearance of school buses morning and evening.  I have heard them referred to as &ldquo;Mr. O'Malley's buses&rdquo; though I feel sure CIE might not take too kindly to that description.  There is one thing the Minister has done: he has changed the whole appearance of the countryside morning and evening.  That is no mean achievement. We are all happy to see so many children being brought to school, getting their education free and being brought home in the evening.  If sacrifices have to be made now they must be made by the parents in sending their children to school, in not relying on their services to work their farms or to look after their shops or what have you.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> I hope that in time to come it may be possible, if the resources of the country so warrant it, to provide for university and other higher education for children who are suited for that advancement.  As Deputy Mrs. Desmond said, I hope the criterion will be the ability of the children to derive benefit from university and other higher education&mdash;that the criterion will not be the pocketbook of the parents but the brains of the children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond pointed out that no streaming seems to be evident. I think she is wrong in that.  My understanding is that there will be a period leading up to, shall we say, intermediate and group certificate standards by which time the aptitudes of the children will be determined so that a child can stream off into whichever course or curriculum is deemed best suited to his or her capability.  That is a very big step and that work, as Deputy Mrs. Desmond said, presupposes some form of career guidance which was lacking a long time in our educational system.  I do not know what steps are being taken or will be taken by the Department of Education to provide earlier in vocational and secondary schools for that type of guidance.  Children often hit on whichever profession or walk of life they wish to follow purely by chance.  They never got advice or help from somebody qualified to give it.  It is something the Department must deal with.</P>
    <P>We all got from University College, Galway a summary of the findings and the speeches made at the teach-in last September.  We were interested to learn about the amount of money spent in this country on the education of university students.  Now that the position has drastically changed by virtue of the fact that the Minister has announced increased grants to the different universities&mdash;I think about £2 million has been granted to University College Galway for the science block; and there is to be a merger of the two universities in this city&mdash;the deficiency will be remedied.  It is true that we are under-staffed in University College, Galway.  I happen to be a member of the governing body for some time and <Col N="543" /> I know of this.  We have often been criticised in Galway because of our failure to provide evening lectures and all the rest of it leading to the B.A. degree or the B.Comm. degree.  When we told people interested in those courses that we had not staff adequate enough to cater for the ordinary university students I believe those people thought we were sidetracking the issue.</P>
    <P>The facts are different.  We have not adequate staffing for the ordinary requirements of the university.  Indeed, we were far below ordinary staffing requirements.  It has been possible for us recently to take steps for the requirement of additional staff and that is being done at present.  We have also outlined our intention in Galway to provide evening courses next September for students of 21 years of age who wish to study for the B.A. degree. I feel sure, with the improvement in staffing, that we will be in a position to make other courses available.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell, I often wonder why our universities do not provide for extra degrees.  Would it be necessary to change the charters, to adjust them somewhat?  I do not know but it is not possible to provide those extra degrees at the moment.  Indeed, many people in different parts of the country take advantage of the facilities offered by University College, London. The staff of our national university might be increased to cater for this. It might be that we would have to provide more tutorials and all the rest of it but the provision of extern degrees, especially in arts and commerce, is something which universities should be in a position to do. They should relate themselves more closely to the majority of our people, whether they work in shops, schools, business or on farms.  If people want to advance themselves, and they live too far from a university, then why not bring the university to them through those correspondence courses, extern degrees and what have you?  Maybe we have been failing in that in the past.  Now that the Minister proposes to introduce legislation recasting the universities and providing for new <Col N="544" /> conditions for universities he might address himself to that problem.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused to see some months ago when the merger of UCD and Trinity College was announced and when the Minister stated that he proposed to reconstitute University College in Cork and in Galway as autonomous bodies we had a rush of university people to Radio Éireann and other places expressing their views on those matters.  The most extraordinary statement of all was made by an academic in Galway who stated that he hoped a majority of the governing body of the proposed new universities would be academic men.  I hope, when the Minister is setting about the formation of those new ruling bodies, that he will have a majority of non-academic people on the governing bodies.</P>

      <P>The implication was that if you were not an academic you were an omadhaun.  I think many of those academic people are omadhauns, with all due respect to them.  I will not go further into that.  Finally, let me say to the Minister that whatever money he spends on the extension of educational facilities in this country is money well spent.  I think Irish people by and large take cognisance of the fact that education was so long in the doldrums in this country and that at last steps are being taken, and will be taken, to cater for the needs of our people in a much awakened society alive to the possibilities of education and what it has to offer, particularly to our people&mdash;that whatever money is spent, whether it has to be raised by taxation or not&mdash;I feel sure it will be mostly by taxation&mdash;the Minister will be forgiven and the Government will be forgiven for any extra money they have to raise.  I say that in all sincerity because I believe the Irish people as a whole&mdash;they have that record&mdash; respect education, respect people who <Col N="545" /> have it and respect people who make it possible for men to have it.</P>

      <P>The few words I have to say will be said by a non-academic man.  Most of the things I intended to say have already been said better than I could say them by Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy Mrs. Desmond and also by Deputy Carty, although anybody listening to Deputy Carty would think that as far as education was concerned we were completely out of the wood and that as and from now the inertia of former years would be completely overcome by the dynamic personality of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not want to take any credit away from the Minister because he has done a marvellous amount of work, or at least he has laid a good foundation for a lot of work, in a short space of time considering the length of time the State is established. The burden the Minister has to carry and the problems he has to solve are a legacy of neglect by possibly various Governments but, as Fianna Fáil were longer in office than anybody else, they are certainly a legacy of neglect by Fianna Fáil Governments of the past. Indeed, the problems are far from solved at the moment.</P>
      <P>We know that new primary schools are being built.  We also know that hundreds of unfit, insanitary and dangerous hovels throughout the country are being used today for the education of young, impressionable and tender pupils who have to suffer cold and wet and insanitary conditions, without the heated meal or anything else, in their tenderest years.  There are hundreds of that type of school in our country still and they are definitely a blot on our civilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, lots of new schools are being built. So long as a body such as the INTO is taking drastic action to get better conditions in the schools, the problem is serious.  We know it is historical and traditional.  The dual system of Departmental and managerial supervision in education had many defects.  The Parliamentary Secretary said 90 per cent of the managers had been good managers and had carried out their functions.  That being so, I just wonder <Col N="546" /> how the 700 or 800 odd schools have come to be in the condition in which they are at the moment.  <i>Á propos</i> that, I would ask the Minister, whatever kind of crash programme it would involve, to get those insanitary schools into some kind of proper condition as soon as possible.  He would thus do as great a service to the primary pupils as he is doing to post-primary pupils because it will be years before new schools can be built in all the areas throughout our country where we have these shocking monuments of inefficiency.</P>
    <P>The problem is big but it must be tackled.  When the building of a school is first mooted, it is a very long time before the foundation-stone of the school is laid.  Such delay must be short-circuited.  The time taken in building a new school and staffing and making it habitable must be shortened if we are to make any headway in overcoming our legacy of inertia.</P>
    <P>As I have said, most of the ground has been covered by previous speakers.  I should like however to mention post-primary education from the point of view of vocational schools.  Being a member of a vocational education committee for a long time, I know more about that subject, probably, than I do about primary education.  First and foremost, there are problems in relation to transport that I think can be solved.  There are always growing-pains in any new system devised and put into operation by a Department.  There are always growing-pains in something attempted to be brought into operation in a short space of time.  I am not sure that to hand over complete control in this connection to CIE&mdash;and not alone control but also planning of the transport system&mdash;was wise.</P>
    <P>CIE buses cannot go into every country road.  In Mayo there are 1,600 miles of county road which have not yet been black-topped.  This creates a problem for the many pupils who have to be carried to school.  No bus driver will chance his bus on such roads.  The result is that many pupils have to walk miles to reach the bus and miles home again from the bus in the evening.  There is no shelter at <Col N="547" /> the point of pick-up.  If they leave bicycles, they leave them to the mercy of the wind, the weather and any delinquent who might come along and break or injure them.  These matters might be termed minor details with which the Minister is not expected to deal but they are important to the pupils and to their parents.</P>
    <P>A minibus system should be integrated with the present CIE large bus system in order to give a better service to the pupils.  I do not see any insurmountable difficulty in that suggestion. I trust the Department will examine it.  In counties like Mayo, where a large amount of the road system is unfit for bus traffic, one meets that problem.  I do not think it is one that cannot be solved and I should like the Department to look into it.</P>
    <P>In Mayo as far as vocational education is concerned, we have a problem and this problem is before the Department: there was a minute after a meeting in November.  I suppose other counties have this problem as well.  In outlaying areas such as the Erris Peninsula, Geesala, Belmullet and Achill we have difficulty in getting staff to stay in the schools, the reason being, I suppose, that the areas are isolated and have not the facilities or amenities for recreation which other larger areas possess.  Consequently, it is difficult to get teachers for these areas.  The Department of Health decided to pay dispensary doctors higher salaries for working in outlaying areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education will have to face the fact that if we provide schools at great expense we cannot leave them lying there as white elephants.  There is no means of solving the problem other than by giving increased salaries, or gratuities on top of salaries, or some other means of remuneration, to make it attractive for teachers to work in outlaying areas such as the ones I have mentioned. The Department should give this matter immediate consideration.  I understand that a negative reply has been given to the request of the Mayo committee for sanction for increased remuneration for that type of teacher, but I would <Col N="548" /> like the Department to have another look at it and see if there are any other means by which they could ensure that the schools will be staffed and that post-primary education is brought to outlying areas, particularly when it is impossible to take them out of there by any transport system to a school 60 or 70 miles away.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should not bring in specific cases but there is a case in point in regard to certain teachers. Some building construction and woodwork teachers were recruited last year. Some of them had employment&mdash;one in particular&mdash;with An Foras Talúntais and his salary was higher then than the salary he now gets as a teacher under the vocational education committee, the reason being that he did not pass the Ceard Teastas.</P>
    <P>This man was asked to go on the course by the inspectors of the Department because he is an excellent man at his job, a wonderful teacher, and it was intimated to him that a lower standard examination would be used in his case.  There were several others involved but when the course was over and he became a teacher, he found out that he had been misled, that the lower standard was not accepted and this prevents him from getting increments and any increase in salary.  He is a married man with a family and it is completely unfair that he now has to work for less than he did in his former employment.  This must be looked into in justice to the man.  The other people were placed in non-Gaeltacht areas and there is no bother about their increments or salaries.  This is a case in point.  I do not think that this man should be victimised and I think the Department should take all steps possible to ensure that he does not lose financially.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say because, as I have said, other speakers have covered the ground.  The question that poses itself is: what happens after? People will be getting more and more education, thanks to be God, and of course, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, thanks to the Minister, but what will happen after?  What provisions are the Government making; what <Col N="549" /> plans have they, looking ahead, to ensure that the vast numbers of pupils who will have better basic education, follow-up education and higher education, will get remunerative jobs in their own country?  Will all this be wasted?  Will we make a present of our explosion of education to foreign countries, to Britain, to Europe or to America, as the case may be?  If so, God help us.  All Departments of State must now be examining the situation as a whole in order to ensure that the young people who will have this wide education will have a living in their own land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this Estimate will not unduly delay the House in its business.  A lot of my reference will be on the question of scholarships.  As we are aware, the Minister's action in regard to post-primary education, which in its own way can be described as a revolutionary change and one long overdue, has rendered unnecessary the provision of scholarships in the manner of other years.  We in the City Council of Dublin have taken thought of this matter and have decided to apply such moneys as would formerly be used for post-primary scholarship education in former days to the encouragement and award of students seeking university instruction and degrees.</P>
      <P>I suppose most local authorities who have been similarly active will take much the same lines in so far as their moneys are concerned.  It is to be hoped, at any rate, that no local authorities will drop the idea of making contributions, where they do make contributions or where they have made them in the past, or that they will avail of this opportunity to effect a reduction in expenditure because any such move would represent not an economy but, on the contrary, would represent a squandering of the most basic wealth of the community which is the natural talent of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House to know that the Corporation of Dublin in considering this matter also decided that the scholarships which it is now prepared to provide for students seeking university education <Col N="550" /> will be tenable, on the recommendation of the members at least, at any university in the Thirty-Two Counties of Ireland.  We feel that in making this step we are doing no more than moving with the times.  At the meeting of the committee of the corporation that dealt with this particular question, it was suggested by one of the members that we might well consider, and indeed we shall and will consider possibly next year, the desirability of making such scholarships tenable outside this country.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the facilities which are provided by London University, which are availed of, in fact, by many Irish students who go there and follow courses not available to them here.  Education is an international commodity.  While one sympathises with what Deputy Lyons has to say about the disappointment of seeing students who are educated here going to other countries and giving other countries the benefit of their skills and knowledge, it is not something we can control very well except to the extent that we can provide here within our own economy opportunities for such students to apply at a reasonable remuneration the knowledge and skill they acquire by means of higher education.</P>
    <P>It is useless crying about these things unless we get down to the fundamental task of making it possible and attractive, to use Deputy Lyons' words, for such people to remain here and earn a good living.  Unfortunately, that is not so.  In the past, it has been all too plainly seen that those who benefited from higher education were in the main those whose parents were able to afford to send them to the sources of such education.  That has been the tale and the story.  Hitherto, education has been the preserve of privilege and to a great extent, at least at its higher levels, it still remains within that description.  These people when educated have not found it possible to obtain employment here in their various professions on anything like as good terms as those readily available across the water or in other more distant lands.  That points to a much larger and more <Col N="551" /> fundamental problem, which is that of the economic position generally.</P>
    <P>We in the City Council of Dublin are also anxious that we should be enabled to make scholarships available to promising students from the technical schools who would benefit by courses in the proposed regional technical colleges or the higher technical colleges, such as Kevin Street, but it would appear from what the city manager says that we have not the legal power to do this.  I avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister to indicate when we may expect legislation, which I know he will be ready to prepare&mdash;if it is not already prepared&mdash;and implement, to make it possible for local authorities to divert moneys they have been raising in other years to the provision of university education and education in technological colleges for at least 50 per cent of the students, those who show talent in that direction.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the regional technical colleges represent perhaps the most significant educational advance made in this country, apart from the provision of free education at lower levels made by the Minister.  It always appeared that we suffered from a superabundance of members in certain professions.  One does not want to name the professions.  They are readily observable to anybody who looks about.  They are not always the most productive of professions, either.  In one case it could well be described as the most obstructive profession.  We have suffered, by reason of the shortcomings imposed on us by our history and our youth as an independent country, from lack of the opportunity of developing instruction in technology.</P>
    <P>It is practically a cliché now to say that the future will be technological. In the advance which we appear to be making towards participation in some kind of eventual European unity, a great deal will depend upon the number of people we have qualified technologically to develop our industry and upon our ability here to compete with countries which have had the advantage of this specialised knowledge for many years&mdash;indeed from the time of <Col N="552" /> the industrial revolution.  The industrial revolution passed us by.  There are some who would argue that this was a beneficence.  It is an academic question now whether such is true or not. But in passing us by, it left a million Irish corpses lying in the ditches from starvation just over a century ago.  In passing us by, it created in other countries, in Britain and on the Continent, the vast complex of capital, equipment, tradition and skills which is what we will be facing when the day eventually dawns&mdash;if it ever does whether by grace of le grand Charles or any other set of circumstances&mdash; that we are competing in a united Europe.  These people will be armed with a knowledge 100 years ahead of us.</P>
    <P>We can lose no time.  It seems to me that in practically all matters the steps we take here are minimal steps. It seems to be part and parcel of parliamentary procedure to make haste with a deadly slowness.  We are living in an age when that kind of speed will not do.  We have got to move rapidly.  Matters which might have been quite easily postponed for decision next week now demand action this day.  Education is at the very top of that pile of files so far as we as a nation are concerned.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister if he would kindly state the position in regard to the legal rights of a local authority such as Dublin City Council in the provision of scholarships from money formerly provided for scholarships in the post-primary field the diversion of such money to university scholarships and to scholarships for higher technical education of one kind or another.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> I do not want to delay the House, but I feel that Deputies from all Parties can safely stand up here or outside and say that at least we have one Minister for Education who since he took office has done a magnificient job for our youth, for the sons and daughters of the people of this country. I have been asked by the people of my constituency to thank him most sincerely for what he has done.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport for our children who are availing of post-primary education, as the Minister has said, this scheme will have teething troubles. There are vast areas in country districts at the moment where, as Deputy Lyons said, children have been picked up by CIE buses at crossroads.  Some of these children have to walk three miles each way, which is six miles a day, to attend school; other have to travel six miles each way in order to be picked up by the school bus.  The simple reason is that the roads leading to these villages are unfit to carry the heavy buses which would have to travel over them.  I hope that by this time next year a survey will have been made and that, with the co-operation of CIE, mini-buses or something of that nature will convey the children to the crossroads to meet the larger bus taking them to school.  I have in mind two or three places to which attention should be given.  There is an area where 21 children have to come to the crossroads at Tiernee to meet the CIE bus which proceeds to the new comprehensive school built at Carraroe.  I want to be quite fair to the children, to the Minister and even to CIE.  Some of these children are walking six miles a day; perhaps they have bicycles, but at the same time it is too hard on them.</P>

      <P>Knock Lettermullen. Some provision should be made for them.  I have got some letters of criticism over the last two or three months in connection with the transport of children to and from some of the schools.  The Minister may say to me that it is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power, but I think it is his duty at least to have it <Col N="554" /> looked into immediately.  I have had letters complaining that some of the cars on the road taking the children to the schools have been just selected at random and that no advertisement was inserted in the papers looking for either taxi or mini-bus people to tender. That is the one thing that the people in my area have against the transport service.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter with the Minister for Transport and Power so that the owner of a car or a mini-bus will have the opportunity of tendering; then let the best horse jump the ditch and get the contract.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons said that we should make preparations so that when these children are finished school there will be jobs awaiting them.  Any Minister of State will agree with Deputy Lyons, as I do, that it is important to provide employment.  However, there is one thing we can be sure of, that if they have to emigrate they will be in a better position to take up jobs in other countries.</P>
      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to have some arrangement made for the children who have to travel to Tiernee cross to be picked up by the bus there; and also the children of Collinamuch and Tollykyne.  Before the Department of Education and CIE took over the service, there was a private bus service which travelled in the direction of Galway City where some of the children completed two or three years in the vocational school. There is a bus on it at the moment not taking in that part of the area to which I have referred.  I feel the bus should continue from the crossroads to Collinamuch via Tollykyne to Galway.</P>
      <P>The only reason I stood up was to compliment the Minister on the great advances he has made in regard to post-primary education, and by the end of his present term of office I know we shall be proud of his achievements in the field of education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Minister for Education for the forward steps he has taken to take education out of the doldrums in which it has been for so many years.  He has shown courage, initiative and foresight in his <Col N="555" /> approach to the educational system and to educational matters.  At the same time, we must realise that he did steal a lot of that policy from the Fine Gael document &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo;.  Nevertheless he is to be complimented for so doing.</P>
      <P>I want to refer mostly to the effects on national schools about which I know most.  It is a shame that after so many years of national government so many of our schools today are in a substandard condition.  Quite a lot has been done in recent times but nevertheless many schools are still overcrowded, badly lighted, badly heated and insanitary.  It must be admitted that there has been a certain amount of acceleration in remedying those matters.  There are remedies in the line of the provision of new school buildings.  There is a praiseworthy effort but due to the accumulation of neglect over many years, the Minister found himself with a big backlog of jobs necessary to be done in the line of new buildings, reconstruction and so on.  The problem is a very big one indeed.</P>
      <P>The position is being tackled in a realistic way but more acceleration is required.  It must be remembered that children attend the national school at a very impressionable age.  It is not conductive to good education or to making a good impression on their tender minds if they have to go into the sordid squalor of some of our school buildings.  The outward appearance is very poor indeed, especially in the rural areas, and the inside also leaves a lot to be desired.  If children at a tender age attend school in such surroundings, it will not lead to happiness or to making the brightest impression on their youthful minds. Those impressions will be carried into later years.  It is difficult to teach children to love beauty and to love the best things in life if they are brought up in such surroundings, and if we condemn them to many years in the midst of ugliness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One suggestion I should like to make to the Minister is that in the planning of new school buildings, the <Col N="556" /> opinions of the teachers should be sought since they are the people who have to teach in the schools and to use the equipment and the accommodation provided day after day in carrying out their duties.  Teachers know from their day-to-day experience what type of layout is best suited for maximum efficiency in teaching and in pupil control.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I am very keen on in connection with national schools and, indeed, with vocational and secondary schools.  This is something which apparently has escaped the Minister's attention.  I have not heard it mentioned in this debate so far, that is, the provision of suitable playgrounds in the planning of new schools, especially national schools in the rural areas.  Sufficient land should be bought or acquired to provide for a football pitch.  It does not matter very much what type of football they play, but it is essential in the training of children's minds to have suitable accommodation for games.  This helps to train their eye.  Football helps to develop a child's power to think and it also develops the idea of co-operation. He knows he cannot &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; and has to depend on other children. If those facilities are not provided, we are missing out something in the development of the child's character at school.  I should like the Minister to think over this aspect of education when he is planning for the erection of national and other schools.  I also think, rightly or wrongly, that the development of games in the national schools would be a deterrent to juvenile delinquency later.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention the introduction of visual aids.  The days when talk and chalk operated in national schools are gone and I recommend the introduction of visual aids in all schools as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Much has been said, written and read about sub-standard schools, many of which we still have, but we cannot blame the present Minister for that state of affairs.  He has done wonderful work in the short time he has been Minister for Education.  Some of the <Col N="557" /> difficulty appears to me to have arisen from insufficient grants for heating and cleaning.  In the light of present-day costs, those grants should be increased.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister, as I said last year, on the closing of one-teacher schools for which there was no future whatever.  They were unfair to the teacher and the children. The teacher found it impossible to divide his time between the children from infant to senior grades.  The children were bound to suffer in their educational attainments and the teacher also suffered in trying to impart knowledge in a short time. I was not too sure of the wisdom of closing two-teacher schools because, as I pointed out, in my county of Sligo down the years, more scholarship winners came out of two-teacher schools than out of much bigger schools.  A fine job has been done in two-teacher schools.</P>
    <P>In the closing of schools and the transfer of pupils to other schools, I have found a few snags which I should like to put before the Minister. Before the transfer of pupils takes place, it should be ensured that there are sufficient teachers to man the other school.  Perhaps the instances I have in mind are isolated&mdash;I think they are &mdash;but I know one case where children were transferred from a school that was closed down to a two-teacher school and the numbers were sufficient for a three-teacher school.  That school has been operating for about six months with two teachers.  When a matter like this is reported to the Minister, as is intended, I think he <Col N="558" /> will look into the case favourably.</P>
    <P>Another point with which, as a national teacher, I am very concerned is the pupil-teacher ratio.  Where you have large classes, there is little time for individual attention and this is a great injustice to the individual child. It has very serious consequences for the backward child.  Keeping of order in a large class takes up quite a bit of the teacher's time, time that could be more profitably used in teaching the children.  The Minister spoke of 35 as, I think, a maximum number of pupils to a teacher.  I suggest that is a bit high and where you have retarded or backward children in the class, I think 25 should be the maximum. We are backward in this country in regard to retarded children who need special attention, individual attention. They cannot get that in a national school.  Perhaps some time it may happen that with the closing down of one-teacher schools or even two-teacher schools, one might be found to be in good structural repair and the ideal solution would be to have a teacher in each parish specially trained to look after retarded children. All retarded or slow-learning children in the parish could then be sent to that school.  If the slow-learning children were taken out of the national school, much more progress would be made with the remainder.</P>
