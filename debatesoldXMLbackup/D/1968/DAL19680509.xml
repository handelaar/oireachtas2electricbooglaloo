    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage of this Bill in the Seanad yesterday, <Col N="1202" /> it is a short Bill which requires very little explanation.  As Members of the House are aware, the world-renowned library at Shrewsbury Road, Dublin was built and endowed for the nation by the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty as but one of the benefactions&mdash;all of outstanding value and importance&mdash;which the Irish people owe to this most generous and public-spirited friend of our country.  To give effect to his intention that the Library should be maintained for the use of the public, Sir Chester Beatty by his will, bequeathed it to certain named Trustees and made provision for the appointment of additional Trustees, including one to be appointed by the President.  In view of the terms of Article 12, section 1, and Article 13, section 10, of the Constitution, which relate to the powers and functions of the President, the Attorney General has advised that it is necessary to provide, by legislation, for the conferring upon the President of this power of appointment, which would, under the will, be a continuing function in regard to one particular Trusteeship.  The President has indicated his agreement to the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I take this opportunity, not merely of supporting the Bill but of expressing, on our behalf, our appreciation of the munificence of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty. It is not generally known, but it is nevertheless a fact, that in 1955, when we were considering certain possibilities of offering inducements in order to have our minerals developed, we got the very greatest help and assistance from Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.  He arranged to have all the resources of Selection Trust Limited placed at our disposal to enable us to examine mining incentives in every part of the world.  That unique opportunity of getting such an assessment of the position in every other country, even in countries in which we had no diplomatic representatives, was of very great value to us and helped considerably in the development of our mining resources. That examination was made available solely through the public spirit of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> So far as I am concerned, one of the memories I shall cherish most in regard to the period in which I was Minister for Finance is the memory of the opportunity that gave me to get to know Sir Alfred Chester Beatty better; that came about through his making these facilities available to Ireland, the country of his adoption.  The manner in which he has so munificently endowed the nation with his Library is something of which no words could adequately express our appreciation. We support the Bill and we take this opportunity to pay tribute to a very great and noble-minded man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, also support this Bill.  Whilst this is a very valuable Library and a worthwhile addition to the other libraries in Dublin, we should, if possible, ensure that the manuscripts in the Library are readily available; we should co-operate with the countries of origin of these precious manuscripts. We ourselves suffered in the past in having some of our treasures and heirlooms removed from the country. Undoubtedly, in the years ahead, the countries of origin of these manuscripts will look towards Dublin where their national manuscripts are stored.  To avoid any possible ill-feeling in the future, I suggest that, whenever any of these countries which originally had these manuscripts, seek loans of the manuscripts for a period, we should co-operate in every possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know ourselves from our experience of the past what it is like to be a poor country culturally.  When rich purchasers come to buy national manuscripts the traffic is one way.  We know how annoyed we would feel had someone bought the <i>Book of Kells</i> and we now had to travel to Teheran to examine it in some library there.  This may seem an exaggeration, but it does sum up the feeling of the inhabitants in many of these countries which have been, to some extent, despoiled of their treasures.  We know the chief culprit in this; it is the United States of America.  It should be possible for us to co-operate with the countries of origin of these manuscripts; it should be possible to arrange for lending the <Col N="1204" /> manuscripts for an extended period, if necessary.</P>
    <P>This is an addition to the number of libraries we have in Dublin.  It is a unique library and our Party have pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The tributes paid here are somewhat similar to those which were paid in the Seanad yesterday. I should like to acknowledge them on behalf of the Trustees, if I have the right to do so.  I should like to bring a little stage further what Deputy Sweetman said about Sir Chester Beatty's assistance in the development of our mineral resources.  After I became Minister for Industry and Commerce, when the mineral development in Avoca had got into certain difficulties, Sir Alfred came forward again and placed his experience and advice at my disposal and at the disposal of the officers of my Department. It was, indeed, very helpful at the time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Leary, I do not know to what extent the trusteeship would allow of the lending of manuscripts to other countries.  That would, of course, be a matter for the Trustees.  It is not something in which we could interfere because it is dependent entirely on either the terms of the will or on the terms of the trust deed.  It should be known that already scholars are coming from all over the world, including from the countries of origin of some of these manuscripts, and they are given every facility.  We shall, I think, have to spend some money ourselves on the full development of the Library in order to ensure the continuation of certain cataloguing, which has not been done, and to ensure as well the availability of expert advice which we would not have in our own resources.  This may involve some expenditure on the Library in the near future for both current and capital purposes and that may come before the Dáil in the form of a Vote, or otherwise, in the next year or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that this Library has been valued at a very, very substantial figure.  There is provision in the various Finance Acts by virtue of which a library of this sort, bestowed on the nation, is exempt from death duties.  So far as I know, there is no provision by virtue of which such a library is exempt from probate fees. The probate fees which arose because of the value of this Library must have been very substantial indeed.  It would not be right that I should mention the figures here but I have heard that the sum is a very large one.  Quite honestly, I think it is niggardly of the State to exact probate fees on a munificent gift of this sort.  While the State may require the money, at the same time, this exacting of probate fees is a little too niggardly from our point of view. I would ask the Taoiseach to have this examined.  It may be a matter he could consider, if necessary, at a later stage.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 36, to delete lines 32 to 52 and in page 37, to delete lines 1 to 7.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan):</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Before reporting progress on Tuesday night, I had moved this amendment, the effect of which is to delete section 64 of the Bill.  The object of section 64 is to amend section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, by conferring on lay persons, to be known as authorised <Col N="1206" /> officers, the powers conferred on members of the Garda Síochána by section 103 of the Principal Act.  It is therefore no harm, very briefly, to point out what, in fact, section 103 of the Principal Act does.</P>
      <P>Section 103 is the section which confers on members of the Garda the right to impose on-the-spot fines.  As we know, to date, on-the-spot-fines have been imposed only in respect of parking offences.  We must not lose sight of the fact that section 103 of the Principal Act may be applied to such offences as the Minister by order directs because subsection (1) of that section reads:</P>
      <P>This section applies to such offences under this Act as may be declared by the Minister by regulations to be offences to which this section applies.</P>
      <P>I am against the proposal contained in section 64 of the Bill with which we are now dealing, to extend the powers contained in section 103 to authorised officers who are to be recruited by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in an informal way, who will not have any police training.  I say they are being recruited in an informal way for the reason that section 64 of the Bill, which my amendment proposes to delete, specifically says that neither the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, nor the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956, shall apply to the situation of an authorised officer for the purposes of section 103 of the Principal Act.  I consider that highly undesirable.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 64 says <i>inter alia,</i></P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; means a person appointed by the Commissioner to be an authorised person for the purposes of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know, members of the Garda Síochána are recruited as a result of open competitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners; they are subject to an interview and to medical examination and they undergo a course of training before being entrusted with police duties.  Here we are going to depart from that procedure which has given such satisfaction down the years and are going to let loose on the city of <Col N="1207" /> Dublin, and presumably on the rest of Ireland, a number of persons to be known as authorised officers and who are to be recruited in the informal way which I have described, a way which will not be subject to the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956. That is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about this.  The people we are thinking of appointing now are not traffic wardens whose duty it is to assist schoolchildren on their way to school.  There seemed to be some confusion about that on Committee Stage.  That is not the type of authorised officer we are dealing with. We are going to hand over to these people such regulations as may be entrusted to them by the Minister under the powers vested in him by section 103 of the Principal Act.  The Minister's explanation on Committee Stage for the informality proposed in relation to these appointments was that these would be part-time appointees.  I think he went on to say that they would be part-time persons paid a small salary or small wage.  I said then, and I say now, that I do not think it desirable to entrust police duties to persons employed on a part-time temporary basis.  It is police duties we are entrusting them with here.  It may very well be that these people will consider that they will have to render a good account of themselves, that they will have to make a good number of detections, and that they will have rigidly and maybe ruthlessly to discharge the duties entrusted to them so that they will be retained in their positions.  That is highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is considering the delegation of police duties to people other than properly recruited and adequately trained policemen, then the least he should do is to see that these people are properly recruited and that they have some fixity of tenure.  I can see this leading to a most undesirable state of affairs.  I think the Minister on Committee Stage said also that these people could not direct a prosecution, but the fact of the matter is that they will be prosecution witnesses <Col N="1208" /> and, having reported a person for a breach of the Road Traffic Acts, will be very anxious to sustain a conviction. Human nature being what it is, they will be all the more anxious to sustain a conviction because they will be purely part-time, temporary officers and at the whim of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the Minister for Justice and may be hired and sacked at will.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we are following a precedent established elsewhere.  If we are, it is a bad one.  If we are not following a cross-Channel precedent, we are creating a very bad precedent here.  I do not know what the Minister will say at this stage in justification of his proposal, but I affirm that section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, extends much further than the provision of traffic wardens.  If the Minister intends to confine the duties of these authorised officers to a limited category of offences, then he should alter section 103 accordingly and state that specifically.  But I will go further and say that to entrust to these part-time people, employed in this highly undesirable way, any form of police duties, even the duties of regulating parking, is going too far, is departing from the well-established practice here down through the years whereby these functions were discharged only by members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am opposed violently to the proposal because it is wrong and I think that the method of recruitment is highly undesirable.  If we are to get people to work for small wages, I think the result will be we shall not get good service and that we shall have abuses.  For that reason, I propose the deletion of section 64 which, in effect, means that section 103 of the 1961 Act stands as it is and that the system of spot fines will remain, but that the people who will operate under section 103 will continue to be trained and respected members of the Garda, subject to the provision for recruiting them which now exists and subject to the fixity of tenure which they now enjoy and to the strict code of discipline operated within that force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us appreciate the difficult position the Garda <Col N="1209" /> are in at present when, though they happen to be very much under strength, the Department of Justice have to devote the time of trained personnel to routine traffic duties.  For that reason, many of us agree that a change should be made.  However, I fear that the Minister has gone completely across to the other side.  The position now is that the cure will turn out to be worse than the disease.</P>
      <P>Nearly all of us, from time to time, have had experience of the untrained, part-time person who has been put in charge of a small group of people as, say, a steward at a sports meeting, a car park attendant or what have you, and, having got a little bit of authority for a few short hours, proceeds to throw his weight around and make things unpleasant for everybody.  Many of us fear that a bad mistake will be made if the Minister goes the whole way with this proposal.</P>
      <P>I had a question down last week about traffic wardens.  The Minister had made a very strong case on Committee Stage that this proposal we are now discussing involved a type of glorified traffic warden.  Traffic wardens have their own troubles.  They are not insured persons; the only job they have is the position of traffic wardens and, because insurance cards are not stamped for them, when they have to give up their position, they have no right to social welfare or other benefits accruing from their job.  Here we are to have a group of people who according to the Minister&mdash;he did not say it in so many words&mdash;will be typical examples of people working a small number of hours for bad wages. In my question last week I tried to find out the wages and hours of traffic wardens and how one would relate one to the other but the Minister would not give me information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Fitzpatrick's interpretation of the section is correct&mdash;and having studied it with a number of people who claim to know the law, I am prepared to go along with Deputy Fitzpatrick on this point&mdash;it appears that these people, who will be purely parttimers, not appointed under any regulations but at the whim of the Garda Commissioner, can in fact carry out <Col N="1210" /> police duties in a much wider sense than traffic wardens can do.</P>
    <P>Do not let anybody say that the things which Deputy Fitzpatrick said might occur will not happen.  I had experience of even a garda on spot fine duty.  I had sold a car and possibly I was careless because I did not change the ownership of the car in writing with the local authority.  Some months afterwards a garda found the car parked illegally, as he termed it, in Galway.  He spoke to the person parking the car and after a discussion proceeded to have a summons issued against me if I did not pay a fine of £1.  It would have cost me a lot more than £1 had I been prepared to go to Galway to defend the case.</P>
    <P>If this can be done under the present regulations by a garda who should know the regulations better, what could happen under the regulation where a civilian, an untrained, part-time, badly-paid civilian, is given the authority to take action such as this against any citizen of the country or of any other country who happens to be here?  I think if the Minister goes fully into the matter he will agree that it is highly dangerous.  We do not want to see given into the hands of people who will have no police training and very little responsibility to anybody the right to carry out the duties of a policeman.  It does appear that this is what the new Bill will empower certain individuals to do.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the fact that they are selected by the Garda Commissioner means that they will all be supporters of the present Government but it could happen.  Worse still the Garda Commissioner, being a very busy man, could decide, and almost certainly would decide, to allow, in each area where these people were to be employed, somebody to make the appointments for him.  God knows who would make the appointments&mdash;possibly people who might be about to retire from the Force and felt that some of the people they knew could do with a part-time job.  The whole thing is fraught with difficulties and dangers and I feel that there has not been enough attention given to it by the Minister's Department.  If he goes fully into it, he will find that a proposal such <Col N="1211" /> as that in the Bill is not one which is likely to work out as we would wish it to work out.</P>
    <P>I am not accusing the Minister of attempting to put one across on the House but I think this was a hastily thought out solution to something which is worrying us all.  We all know the difficulties the Garda have at present because there are not enough of them to do the police duties which they should be doing, but simply to find a solution to this by appointing in a haphazard sort of way a group of people who would be badly trained and need not have any special recommendation because it is not laid down in the Bill that they should have, but will have powers which should, in my opinion, not be given to a civilian who is not subject to the authority of the Department of Justice is not right.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would ask the Minister to have another look at this particular section before it goes any further.  I am quite sure that if he does so, he will agree.  If he has an explanation to all this&mdash;and he may say he has an answer to the statements made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself&mdash;I would like to hear it, but I would remind him that during the Committee Stage any rebuttal of the cases which we made which he attempted to make was not very convincing, and unless he has some new evidence, I will be forced to support Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present system parking regulations can only be enforced by the Garda who, as it is generally admitted, are hardly sufficient in numbers to carry out their other duties, both in relation to the Road Traffic Act and other measures, and I would have thought it would have been agreed that it was necessary for routine jobs such as this that other people should be employed because these duties do not require the same level of training in police duties as is necessary for the Garda. As far as I could gather, Deputy Fitzpatrick is opposed to the creation of these new posts of parking wardens <Col N="1212" /> primarily because it is, in his opinion, being done in what he describes as an off-hand way.</P>
      <P>Apparently it is the method of recruitment of these officers which worries the Deputy most, the provision under subsection (4) of section 64 that neither the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 nor the Civil Service (Regulations) Act, 1956 shall apply to these posts.  The reason for this provision is to bring the recruitment of these parking wardens more in line with the recruitment of members of the Garda Síochána than that of civil servants. Members of the Garda Síochána are not recruited under the Civil Service Acts.  Initially it is proposed to recruit a small number of parking wardens on a temporary, non-pensionable and part-time basis but provision must be made in the Bill for their recruitment on a full-time basis, if and when this becomes necessary, and it may not become necessary.  I think it reasonable to expect Deputies to accept that they will not be appointed in a haphazard way.  The Garda Commissioner has the function of enforcing the parking regulations and surely it is reasonable to expect it to be accepted that for the purpose of carrying out this function, he will make sure to recruit people who will be suitable for the particular job which he wants performed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like once again to emphasise that these authorised officers or parking wardens will be engaged solely on duties in connection with illegal parking.  The enforcement of road traffic regulations generally is becoming more and more important and it is making more and more demands on the time of the Garda.  If the enforcement of all these traffic regulations, which are increasing almost year by year, is to be tackled and if the other important duties of the Garda are not to be neglected in consequence, it is necessary that functions not requiring full Garda training should not take up their time. The aim in this section is to relieve the Garda of this kind of work, which is of a purely routine nature and which does not require all the training and qualifications that are held by the <Col N="1213" /> Garda and provided at some expense by the State.</P>
    <P>Section 103 of the 1961 Act as amended by this section merely permits a member of the Garda Síochána or an authorised officer to deliver to a person or attach to a vehicle a notice stating that an offence has been committed under the section and Deputy Fitzpatrick's fears that the powers of these authorised officers would be extended are completely without foundation. It is completely wrong to say that either these proposed traffic wardens or the present members of the Garda Síochána can impose on-the-spot fines. They can only serve notice which the person concerned is perfectly free to ignore.  I think it is quite clear that by its nature this section is applicable only to offences the committing of which is absolutely clear from the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does agree that if the traffic warden or the garda serves a notice on somebody who is 200 miles away, they have no option.  They either pay the fine or it costs them ten times as much to answer the charge, particularly when they are too darn lazy to summon the person they find parking the car.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that these people and the Garda themselves cannot in fact impose on-the-spot fines.  I suppose there will be difficulty in some cases in not accepting the fine all right if the person happens to be some distance away but the type of case Deputy Tully mentioned, where the ownership of a car <Col N="1214" /> had not been notified, would be an exceptional one.  Generally speaking, it is quite clear and beyond any doubt that a car is parked illegally and there is no dispute.  In fact, even in Deputy Tully's case, the car was parked illegally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he was looking for who originally owned the car.  He was looking for the owner of the car and, as far as the licensing authorities were concerned, Deputy Tully was the owner of the car.  I think he admits there was a certain amount of negligence on his own part.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for Deputy Tully to refer to the people who will be recruited as untrained civilians.  It will be the responsibility of the Commissioner to see that his parking wardens are properly instructed and properly trained. There is no reason to feel that he will fail to exercise this duty properly because the only reason for recruiting those people will be to try to have the parking regulations properly enforced. As far as I know, such people are used in every other country.  If they were not, it would be impossible to enforce these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to make parking regulations unenforceable. <Col N="1215" /> In view of the other onerous duties of the Garda, both in relation to road traffic and the prevention and detection of crime, I could not accept it.  If all the other provisions with regard to the regulation of road traffic are to be reasonably well enforced, this section is absolutely necessary.  Most people look on it as extremely wasteful of the time of highly-trained personnel like the Garda to have them carrying out those parking duties.  Most people feel that this is the obvious thing to do and I think it is of very great importance, if we are to have the other improvements in road traffic regulations which we are making in this Bill reasonably well enforced. This is of fundamental importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Anyone listening to the case made by the Minister against this amendment could not but be convinced, if he did not know any better, that we were providing in this amendment for the provision of parking attendants or parking wardens.  There is not one word about parking wardens in section 103, as it originally stands, and there will not be a word about parking wardens in section 103, when it is amended. What we are doing here is handing over to those untrained and informally employed people, I repeat, such functions as the Minister may decide to entrust to them under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the proposal is to entrust them with the duties of car parking wardens.  Ordinarily, when we get such an assurance from a Minister in charge of a Bill, the Minister can speak for himself, but he cannot speak for his successors, and in this particular instance, the Minister cannot speak even for himself because he is not the Minister who will delegate these authorities&mdash;it is his colleague, the Minister for Justice.  In the extraordinary situation we have here, the Minister for Local Government is responsible for the making of the laws and then ceases to have any further jurisdiction over the laws.  They are enforced by his colleague, the Minister for Justice.  Here is another case of a blank cheque.  We are handing over to these <Col N="1216" /> untrained people, these untrained civilians, who will be keen on holding on to their jobs, badly paid as they will be, such duties under the Road Traffic Act as the Minister for Justice decides to delegate to them.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister saying here that the only function of the authorised officer under this section will be to put a sticker on a car, or to hand a notice to the owner of a car, or, as in Deputy Tully's case, somebody who is not the owner of the car.  Really what we are doing here is saying: &ldquo;You have been guilty of an offence, whatever it is, under the Road Traffic Act.  You can either pay a fine of £1 or may be £50&rdquo;.  Let us not run away with the idea that it is a fine of £1 because it is such fine as may be specified and such fine as the section which creates the offence specifies.  The person is given the option of paying the fine or going to court.  If he says: &ldquo;I am not guilty of any offence&rdquo;, the witness against him in court will surely be the warden under this section, the person who detected the offence.  That is what I am against.</P>
    <P>I want to know what training these people are to have?  The Garda Síochána have six months training in the Depot.  Indeed an argument could be made that six months training is not sufficient but if six months training is considered adequate for the Garda Síochána, who have to perform a multiplicity of these duties, I shudder to think what length of training the people the Minister has in mind will have.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the object of subsection (4) is to bring the recruitment of these people more into line with the method adopted for recruiting members of the Garda Síochána.  He says these requirements do not apply to the recruitment of the Garda Síochána. Surely the Garda Síochána are recruited following an open competitive examination held by the Civil Service Commission?  That is my understanding of the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 37, after line 22, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever a vehicle has been involved in an accident in a public place, an authorised person may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  investigate the circumstances in which the accident occurred,</P>
      <P>(b)  enter (on production of his authority if so demanded by the owner or person in charge of the premises hereinafter mentioned) at any reasonable time any premises where there is a vehicle which was involved in the accident,</P>
      <P>(c)  carry out such inspection and examination (including a test) and, subject to regulations, make any requirement and do all things which appear to him to be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the investigation, and</P>
      <P>(d)  report to the Minister concerning the causes of, and all the circumstances surrounding, the accident and make recommendations in connection therewith.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister considers it necessary, he may direct that an inquiry be held into the cause of an accident in which a vehicle was involved and, where he thinks fit, such inquiry may be held in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> (3)  For the purposes of holding an inquiry under this section, the Minister or the person authorised by him to hold the inquiry may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  require any person to attend as a witness to give evidence or to produce any documents relating to the subject matter of the inquiry;</P>
    <P>(b)  administer or cause to be administrated on oath and take evidence under oath.</P>
    <P>(4)  (a)  The Minister may by order make provision for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the payment of costs incurred by him in connection with an inquiry under this section,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the recovery from any person of costs arising from an inquiry under this section,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the payment by the Minister of the expenses reasonably incurred by a person giving evidence or producing documents at an inquiry under this section.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any person who contravenes a requirement made by an authorised person under subsection (1) of this section or who obstructs an authorised person in the performance of his duties under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(6)  If any person (hereinafter referred to as the witness)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on being duly summoned as a witness before an inquiry under this section makes default in attending, or</P>
    <P>(b)  being in attendance as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required to be taken by the person holding an inquiry under this section or to produce any document in his power or control legally required by the person holding an inquiry under this section to be produced by him, or to answer any questions to which the person holding an inquiry under this section may legally require an answer, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> (c)  does any other thing which would, if the person holding an inquiry under this section were a court of law having power to commit for contempt of court, be contempt of such court,</P>
    <P>the person holding an inquiry under this section may certify the offence of the witness to the High Court and the High Court may, after such inquiry as it thinks proper to make, punish or take steps for the punishment of the witness in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the High Court.</P>
    <P>(7)  A report made under this section shall not be used as evidence in any legal proceedings arising out of the accident in question.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister may make regulations for giving effect to this section.</P>
    <P>(9)  In this section &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; means a person duly authorised in writing by the Minister for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>With the growth in volume of road traffic, the possibility develops of accidents occuring which are more serious than the normal in their effects possibly involving a considerable number of casualties, or which are more important in their implications, for instance, for those such as myself charged with the responsibility of making road traffic regulations.  It is desirable, therefore, to ascertain the causative and other factors involved in such accidents, and this amendment proposes to give the necessary powers. Similar powers are available here in regard to accidents arising through the use of other forms of transport and are available in regard to road traffic accidents in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The section proposed by this amendment is very far-reaching and is obviously an afterthought.  I think we should have considerable information about it.  I have an open mind on it at the moment.  Under the road traffic code at the moment, the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána have all necessary powers to investigate accidents, to inspect vehicles that have <Col N="1221" /> been involved in an accident and to enter premises where vehicles are stored.  I think they clearly have that power if they believe a vehicle has been involved in an accident.</P>
      <P>I said a few moments ago that, normally speaking, the Minister for Local Government is not the person to investigate accidents or to enforce the law relating to road traffic.  That is the function of the Minister for Justice but here the Minister is asking for authority to appoint an officer to hold an inquiry whenever a vehicle has been involved in an accident in a public place.  We do not specify the type of vehicle.  It may be a Mini-Minor: that is a vehicle.  It may be a 40-seater bus.  We are in Committee now and I am sure the Minister will give us more information.  He has said that provisions are made under other codes for investigations like this, into accidents arising out of other means of transport.  I suspect that the Minister has in mind inquiries ordered by the Minister for Transport and Power under the Airlines Acts, or similar inquiries which I think the Minister for Transport and Power can order in the case of a train accident under the Railway Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really do not know what the Minister has in mind here.  If I correctly interpret his reference to inquiries into accidents which occur in other forms of transport, I can only think of the airlines and the railways.  I know we have provision under Acts for holding inquiries into such accidents.  I think that is right.  The only other case the Minister must have in mind is the case of an accident involving CIE or other large operators.  If that is so, there is certain merit in the amendment, because we may take it that, by and large, road transport in this country is operated by a semi-State body. Very frequently some of these semi-State bodies think they are above the law and should not be subject to the law.  Worse still, members of the Garda Síochána seem to feel from time to time that where a semi-State body is concerned they should soft-pedal a bit.  They seem to think that bodies like CIE and the ESB occupy a certain privileged position and that, <Col N="1222" /> if they break the law, it is really a mistake or an accident and that it is not a wilful breach of the law such as might be committed by John Citizen.  I have a feeling that the Garda through no fault of their own&mdash;because this atmosphere is generally abroad in official circles&mdash;are inclined to take things easier with these semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>This amendment might not be necessary at all if a strict instruction were issued to members of the Garda that, as far as the law is concerned, CIE, the ESB and all other boards enjoy the same rights as and no more than any ordinary citizen of the State.  I have a feeling that is the reason this is being introduced.  If it is to deal with public transport&mdash;the Minister mentioned accidents which might involve many people&mdash;this amendment should be altered&mdash;if it is agreed to when we hear more about it from the Minister.  I think the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; is too wide and that the case would be met if before the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; were inserted the words &ldquo;a large public service&rdquo;. I think that is the sort of thing the Minister has in mind, but I would like him to tell us more about what is behind this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has sown a doubt in my mind when he refers to large public service vehicles.  I think the right to have an investigation into an accident should be there, no matter what vehicle is involved.  Very small cars have been known to cause grave damage and loss of life when they have gone out of control.  There is the right to hold an inquiry when an aircraft crashes and the right to hold an inquiry here should be given to the Minister in charge. However, there are a few things I want to comment on.  I do not like the use of the expression &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the definition does not satisfy me&mdash;a person duly authorised in writing by the Minister for the purposes of this section. Surely the Minister could have found another expression?  We have been arguing earlier about an authorised <Col N="1223" /> person who was not the same type of person at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the expression that is used generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Call the other people &ldquo;traffic wardens&rdquo; and I will be satisfied.  Subsection (4) (a) (ii) proposes the recovery from any person of costs arising from an inquiry under the section.  That is a rather serious thing.  It could mean that somebody might be found responsible for an accident and might not be in a position to pay heavy costs.  The Minister should re-word that.  In addition to the fines imposed by the courts, there would be this additional penalty put on him.  That is wrong.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
      <P>Any person who contravenes a requirement made by an authorised person under subsection (1) of this section or who obstructs an authorised person in the performance of his duties under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) states:</P>
      <P>If any person (hereinafter referred to as the witness)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on being duly summoned as a witness before an inquiry under this section makes default in attending, or</P>
      <P>(b)  being in attendance as a witness refused to take an oath legally required to be taken ....</P>
      <P>Should that not be re-worded?  After all, there are people who do not take an oath but may affirm in a particular way.  Religious beliefs should be taken into consideration in that case.</P>
      <P>I would object also to subsection (7) which states:</P>
      <P>A report made under this section shall not be used as evidence in any legal proceedings arising out of the accident in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not? If there is a costly inquiry, which proves some wealthy person is responsible for an accident, why should not the aggrieved person be allowed <Col N="1224" /> to use the evidence in that report&mdash; which cannot be got in any other way &mdash;if a case is being taken for damages?  It is a good idea to have the inquiry and I would not like to see it confined to large public service vehicles or to semi-State concerns. Would the Minister say if State vehicles are envisaged in this?  We all know that when a State vehicle is involved in an accident, it is extremely difficult to get any redress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that is so.  I would like to hear the Minister.  There was arrogance on the part of the State when an Army lorry knocked down a boy and injured him and the State would not pay even the medical expenses.  Subsequently in reply to a question here the Minister said he was satisfied from the information he got from the driver that it was not the responsibility or the fault of the Army.  No one else was allowed to give evidence.  No questions were asked of the person who was knocked down.  That sort of thing should be covered by the section.  The right to have an inquiry, if demanded, should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, it is to obtain similar powers to those already there in regard to marine, rail and air transport, that this section is introduced.  Deputy Fitzpatrick thought it was desirable that the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; should be qualified to make it clear that it was only large public service vehicles to which this should apply.  He said that on this wording it might be a Mini Minor or a 40-seat bus.  Any accident occuring even with the smallest type of car could be one which would involve a large number of people, because if an accident occurred which appeared to indicate some defect in the design of the car, or in a particular component of the car, then the more of those vehicles there were on the roads the more people could conceivably be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have, in fact, been cases in which defects in some component of a <Col N="1225" /> particular car have been discovered at a time when a large number of those models were already on the roads.  In all those cases the company have taken steps to call in all the cars and replace the parts in question.  If an accident gives reason for suspicion that something like that might be involved, it would be desirable to have power to have an inquiry.  The normal inquiries into the causes of and the factors in an accident are carried out by the Garda as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, but in a case like this, the Garda might not be technically competent to investigate the matters that appeared to require investigation.  For that reason it is desirable that an engineer of my Department should make an investigation and, if it seems to him that it is called for, an inquiry should be held.  So it is definitely essential, in my opinion, that this should be so provided as to apply to any type of vehicle.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of costs, I think Deputies will see that it is possible that quite a large manufacturing company may be involved, and it is in those cases only that it would be proposed to recover costs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to subsection (7) which ensures that a report made under this section will not be used as evidence in any legal proceedings arising out of the accident in question.  This is considered necessary in order that witnesses will not be inhibited from giving information at an inquiry which is for a completely different purpose.  It is not for the purpose of establishing blame in relation to a particular accident.  It is to get to the root cause of the occurrence.  It is particularly important that people should not be inhibited at an inquiry from giving full information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are supposed to be on oath.  Surely it is a question of telling the truth?  Surely it is wrong that a person might be prevented from winning a case which he could win, because evidence was not available?</P>

      <P>This type of inquiry is carried out in a different manner from <Col N="1226" /> the investigation of an offence against the law.  It is described as inquisitorial. It is completely at variance with the manner of obtaining information from witnesses in a court of law, where the obtaining of information is prescribed by certain very well-defined rules which Deputy Fitzpatrick will know better than I.  Obviously it would be wrong to use a report which was obtained from the type of inquiry envisaged here as evidence in legal proceedings. In any case I think the admissibility of such evidence would be questioned in court.  That is why it is being laid down here that it should not and will not be used for the purpose of legal proceedings.  There is no intention of suppressing facts.  This report concerns the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Having heard the Minister, I am now clear in my mind as to exactly what is intended by the section.  It is intended to carry out an investigation where there is reason to believe that a vehicle involved in an accident was in some way defective, and that defect was the cause of the accident.  By and large, I agree with that.</P>
      <P>Here again I think the Minister should clarify the position in the Seanad because, under the section as drafted, it would be open to the Minister to order an inquiry into any accident, into a case of careless driving, drunken driving or dangerous driving. I do not know whether or not the Minister wants to get that power.  I do not know whether he wants to be able to hold an inquiry following an accident in which a large bus is involved with a view to ascertaining whether or not the driver of the bus was guilty of negligence.  The section as it stands is wide enough for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought the existing provisions are wide enough to enable that sort of investigation to be carried out.  Therefore, I think some amendment should be written into this which would read something like &ldquo;Whenever a vehicle has been involved in an accident in a public place and there is reason to believe that the vehicle was defective ....&rdquo;.  I think that that would make it clear that this section is to be used by the Minister only in the exercise of his functions, as the Minister responsible for ensuring that road traffic vehicles comply with a <Col N="1228" /> certain standard.  I think that that is really what the Minister has in mind here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

The only case that could be made for entrusting it to the Minister for Local Government is that he is the Minister responsible for ensuring that vehicles are up to a certain standard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yesterday, we could have introduced a Bill saying: &ldquo;We shall hand over everything to the Minister.  We know he will not do anything that is not proper.&rdquo;  I am not prepared to do that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters here.  Subsection (2) says that the Minister may, if he thinks fit, direct that such inquiry may be held in public.  It follows from that that the inquiry might be held <i>in camera</i> or privately.  I think something <Col N="1229" /> should be written into this section which would entitle any person having an interest in the outcome of the inquiry&mdash;such as an injured person &mdash;to a right of audience, a right to be represented there.  If that is not written into it, I think, as it stands, it would be open to the Minister to direct that the inquiry be held in private.  It could happen that a person who was very badly injured, or a number of people who were very badly injured, in the accident would not be entitled to be present themselves or to be represented and to take a note of the evidence and to see what was going on.  I think that would be a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also raised a point in relation to the provision in subsection (4) (ii) dealing with the recovery of costs.  This seems to be one-way traffic because the Minister may make provision for the recovery from any person of costs arising from an inquiry under this section.  I think that that envisages that the Minister may recover his costs from somebody else. But supposing that some individual or firm, large or small, becomes involved &mdash;innocently involved&mdash;in a lengthy inquiry lasting several days or maybe weeks and costing a lot of money, is there any provision in the proposed section whereby he may be indemnified against costs?  Under other statutes authorising the setting-up of tribunals, the Minister has power to award costs where he thinks the justice of the case demands it.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should have a look&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Subsection (4) (iii) of section 3 of this amendment by the Minister for Local Government reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order make provision for the payment by the Minister of the expenses reasonably incurred by a person giving evidence or producing documents at an inquiry under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" />&ldquo;Expenses&rdquo; is a neat word.  It would appear to me to cover witnesses' expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister draws a very neat distinction between subparagraphs (4) (a) (ii) and (4) (a) (iii).  When he is protecting himself, he talks about &ldquo;costs&rdquo;. In (4) (a) (ii) he says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order make provision for the recovery from any person of costs arising from an inquiry under this section.</P>
      <P>In (4) (a) (iii) he says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order make provision for the payment by the Minister of the expenses reasonably incurred by a person giving evidence&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;witnesses' expenses surely&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;or producing documents at an inquiry under this section.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister intended that that should cover legal expenses.  I am not satisfied that it does.  I suggest that the ordinary provisions which apply to the holding of inquiries, and which enable the Minister or a tribunal to award costs, should apply here because otherwise an injustice may be done. The owner of the vehicle might be a mighty corporation but it could happen that he might be the owner of a little Mini Minor, as the Minister agreed.  Provision, I think, should be made there for the payment of costs to meet the justice of the case.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest, and it might get over Deputy Tully's objection, that where subsection (7) says:</P>
      <P>A report made under this section shall not be used as evidence in any legal proceedings arising out of the accident in question ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the report should be made available to a person having an interest. I do not think it would be evidence in court any more than the report of a district court prosecution is evidence on the hearing of a civil case in the Circuit Court or in the High <Col N="1231" /> Court.  But it would be, or might be, extremely useful to a person who suffered frightful injuries to have the report available because he could then perhaps contact expert witnesses or get expert witnesses from the information available to him.  That is not an unreasonable request.  I think the report would not be evidence even if this subsection were never there and it might be&mdash;it is&mdash;most necessary that the report should be available to a person having an interest, in view of the fact that the concern involved might very well be a State or semi-State concern and a person might think, if deprived of the report, that he was unfairly deprived of it and that there was some sort of collusion between one section of the State and another.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily I would put down these amendments on the lines I suggested but this far-reaching suggestion has been presented to us for the first time now.  It was not in the Bill as originally drafted; it was not introduced on Committee Stage.  I understand that the Seanad is thirsty for work and desires that this Bill should go to it fairly soon. I do not want to hold it up unnecessarily, although I would be justified, I think, in asking time to put down an amendment to this, but I suggest that the Minister consider carefully the points that have been raised by Deputy Tully and myself and that he make provision to implement them in the section when the Bill is before the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a very brief comment on subsection (7)? While I understand that what Deputy Fitzpatrick has mentioned covers the point, I would remind him and the House that this will not be the report of district court proceedings; this will be a full-scale Government investigation into a serious accident and as such the report will be a very important document.  The fact that the inquiry can be held in public means, of course, that the report will normally be available, but if it is not held in public I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that any person interested should have the report made available to him.  This would <Col N="1232" /> serve two purposes.  It could convenience some legal people, who might be asked to take on the case, that in fact a case existed.  Often, as we know, they are not anxious to proceed with a case if they feel there is grave doubt that the person bringing the case or the action for damages has a good case. They are perfectly right in that because there might be no way of recovering costs and people who have no case at all might be inclined to make such a case.  For that reason the report should be made available.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it would be a handy reference for people who should be interviewed or asked questions, or people who should be asked to give evidence, even if they could not be forced to do so.  For that reason I think the report should at least be made available.  It serves a useful purpose.  Even if, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests, the ordinary rules of court would rule it out of evidence, it should not be against the law&mdash;as it will be if this subsection is passed&mdash;for a witness or counsel to refer to the fact that in the inquiry a certain fact became clear.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think subsection (7) means nothing. I do not think it would be evidence anyway and it only restates what is almost certainly the law.  Instead of that, I think provision should be put in that the report should be made available.</P>

      <P>In regard to a person who is involved in one way or another in an accident, or in the effects of an accident, having the right to attend an inquiry such as this or to be represented at it, it seems to me that is desirable, and if it is necessary to prescribe that specifically, I shall look into it and have it done.  Similarly, in regard to the question of costs, I agree that the ordinary provisions regarding inquiries such as this should apply and I assume that subsection (4) does that but I shall have it examined and if it does not, I shall move to have it amended in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to subsection (7), I agree that the report should normally, at any rate, be made available to any interested <Col N="1233" /> party and I think that normally this would be done.  I am told, however, that it might not be desirable in certain cases and that to do so might adversely affect the effectiveness of this type of inquiry.  If that is so, I am sure it would only be in very exceptional cases and that the normal thing would be to have it made available as the whole purpose of such an inquiry would be that the result of the inquiry would be made as widely known as possible so that any action or any precaution that appeared necessary as a result of the inquiry could be taken. I am told that to prescribe definitely that the report should be made widely available would not be a wise thing.</P>

The situation seems to be that the insurance companies are getting away with claiming that the accident occurred in the course of employment to an insured person and if such persons are entitled to medical treatment under the State, they should get that treatment and the State or local authority must pay for it.  They will not pay any expenses except those which are excluded by the previous Acts.  I suppose the Minister cannot do very much about it now, but maybe he would have a look at it and see if he can.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to make reference to an allegation made by the Minister for Local Government in this House recently that the Bill was being delayed or obstructed by the Fine Gael Party.  I want to go on record as refuting that suggestion completely. This is a very far-reaching Bill, which was introduced here as recently as 22nd February, 1968.  As the Fine Gael spokesman on Local Government, I consider it my duty to go through such a Bill carefully, to object to any provisions of the Bill with which I disagree, and to seek to amend the <Col N="1236" /> Bill where I think an amendment would improve it.</P>
      <P>Those are my views on legislation in general.  Those are my concepts of the duty of a Parliamentary Opposition. I say that a Parliamentary Opposition should, now more than ever before, finecomb Bills of this sort.  There is a trend at the present time and for some time past to take away from this House its authority and to hand over to the Executive blank cheques <i>ad lib</i>.  This Bill is a classic example of very considerable authority being taken away from the House and handed over to the Minister. On several occasions during the debate on Committee Stage we have been told by the Minister: &ldquo;What the Deputy says could happen but it will not happen.  The Minister or the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or, indeed, the ordinary garda will see to it that abuses will not take place.&rdquo; We have far too much blank cheque legislation being put through this House by the Government, and I for one am not prepared to stand by idly and be a party to that.  I do not think I would be discharging my parliamentary duty if I were to do so.</P>
      <P>That does not mean that I do not think a Bill of this sort is necessary.  I fully appreciate the problem which is being presented by the huge increase in the volume of road traffic, especially the volume of road traffic on city and country roads which are unable to carry it.  It is necessary to take all reasonable precautions to rid the road of people who impair their judgement by the consumption of alcohol or drugs and, as a result, are not capable of exercising proper control over motor vehicles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not seek to do that.  I fully appreciate that at this stage I may comment only on what is in the Bill.  However, I did avail of the opportunity&mdash;and I <Col N="1237" /> know you have had patience with me &mdash;to deal with the allegation made by the Minister that this Bill was delayed or obstructed.  I will conclude on that aspect of the matter by saying in regard to the allegation that the Bill was obstructed or delayed, that the Minister, as a result of the discussion on the Bill, has accepted or introduced a number of amendments.  I think that is desirable, and is something that justifies the parliamentary procedure we have here.</P>
      <P>Regarding what is contained in the Bill, there are too many provisions for regulations in the Bill.  There are various matters which could have been dealt with specifically but which have been left to the Minister to deal with by regulations, such as the restriction on the import of vehicle parts, and more particularly, the sale of vehicle parts within the country.  The qualifications of the Director of the Bureau should have been written into the Bill. The Minister stated that he will consider that later and I hope he will.  As the Bill stands, the qualifications of the Director of the Bureau are not in it.</P>
      <P>The main bone of contention in the Bill has been the amendment of section 49 of the 1961 Act by providing that a concentration of alcohol in the blood, 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres, is an absolute offence, whether the person is capable of driving or not, whether his judgment is impaired or not.  The Minister and I disagree on this and only time will tell which of us is correct.  The Bill has gone too far in that respect; it has gone further than necessary to achieve its object, further than necessary to ensure road safety and it has gone further than was recommended by the Report on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug.  I have made the position clear on that and I want to repeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of other provisions I can only hope that the breathalyser section will be used with discretion and that the Garda will be instructed to use discretion in exercising these powers. By discretion, I mean nothing more or less than that they should not be used unreasonably.  It remains to be seen whether the breathalyser tests in <Col N="1238" /> England have really been effective or whether they have not.  As yet the time has been too short.  I wish to register a final protest against the amendment of section 103 of the 1961 Act by section 64 of the present Bill.  This refers to the extension of police duties to untrained civilians who are not subject to a proper disciplinary code and who will be there on a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Surely I can discuss what is in the Bill?  I understood those were my rights in this matter.  I want to say that it is wrong to hand over police duties to untrained, part-time civilians and I am convinced that time will prove that that is so.  I can only hope that the other abuses which this amendment of section 103 could lead to, in relation <Col N="1239" /> to the recruitment of these people, will not occur.  I can only hope also that they will be remunerated properly and that this is not merely a device for getting cheap policemen.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that in so far as the Minister has met the amendments put down by me, or my suggestions, I am obliged to him. While the Minister may consider that the discussion here was a waste of time, I do not and I feel that reading the debates here will prove that the Minister has, as a result, accepted a number of amendments.  For example, a lorry driver will not now automatically lose his licence for the second offence of careless driving; he is going to get a third chance.  Before this he was only to get a second chance. Another example is that the workman will not now be deprived of his common law right in regard to negligence against the owner of the vehicle, or against his employer.  If those two things only resulted from this debate, it was well worthwhile, but many others did too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House and other people know, our Party had a number of different views on certain sections of the Bill, and while I supported particularly the breathalyser and the blood and urine tests, some of my colleagues did not agree with them and the right to have a free vote, if that was required, was given to them.  I supported all sections of the Bill, with the exception of two, one of which was referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the appointment of these officers who would be glorified traffic wardens.  I was not in agreement with that.  The other one to which I was opposed was the question of a check on a man three hours after he had been seen driving a car.  It is wrong that somebody should go into his home and check after he had a few drinks following a day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point which I should like clarified is this: a number of people outside the House tried to give the impression that the test of whether a man or woman was under the influence is the breathalyser. It cannot be repeated often enough that that is not so and that in <Col N="1240" /> fact the breathalyser is only a method of finding out if a person is suspect. That is the big point.  I should also like to ask the Minister if the State has procured an instrument which will accurately check 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood? Has the State got such an instrument or does such an instrument exist?  My information is that it does not.  If it does not, then whether the Bill is right or wrong, we will not have it in operation for a long time.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to enforce a section of the road traffic law which apparently is not being enforced.  This is in regard to diesel fumes which will, according to Deputy Lemass, make people who are driving behind some of these lorries which are belching dirty black smoke for hours, not only in the country but in the towns and cities, react in such a way that if they are tested, the breathalyser will turn green.  Already the fumes make the drivers turn green.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's complaint that I&mdash;I think it was at Question Time one day&mdash; alleged that this Bill had been delayed or obstructed, I do not think this could be taken as a complaint on my part.  It was, as far as I can remember, in reply to an unfounded allegation by a member of Deputy Fitzpatrick's Party that it was Government proposals which were causing the delay in the enactment of this measure.  At no stage did I suggest that the discussion here was a waste of time; it is a fact that this Bill could not be taken on many occasions and there were considerable delays in that respect.</P>

      <P>It is not.  While I have no objection to every point the Opposition consider it necessary to put being put, and being put effectively, there is no doubt that there was quite an amount of unnecessary repetition on Committee Stage.  Deputy Fitzpatrick did not merely finecomb the Bill, which is the function of an Opposition, but he raised the same points in the same detail on every Stage of the Bill, and I think the Official Report will show that.  For example, when efforts to prevent the institution of this new offence had failed, in regard to the section in which we were creating this new offence of driving, or attempting to drive, a mechanically propelled vehicle when the blood-alcohol content had reached the level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, the same arguments were repeated over and over again on every section consequential on that section and at a point of time when acceptance of the views expressed would involve the wiping out of the offence for which the House had already made provision.  I did not make any formal objection and it was only when a Deputy on the Fine Gael Front Bench stated that this Bill was being held up by other Government proposals that I pointed out that it was not being held up because of any action on the part of the Government.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said today that this Bill was introduced in February, 1968.  The Bill was introduced on 21st June, 1966.</P>

      <P>The Bill was circulated in either November or December, 1966.  The Second Stage commenced on 7th March, 1967, and the Committee Stage commenced on 10th May, 1967, but there was a gap between the Committee Stage in that session and February, 1968, and that gap was not due to any action on the part of the Government.  The Committee Stage was in full swing but it was found impossible to continue until February of 1968 and, then, as I have said, we had all the arguments repeated all over again.  So far as the particular section to which I have referred was concerned, it was the same as if we had had <Col N="1242" /> no discussion at all on this matter in the earlier period.  I quite agree that the Opposition were entitled to adopt that attitude, if they liked, but I do not agree I made any complaint about it.  What I did say was that the non-enactment of the Bill was not due to any action on the part of anybody on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Tully's question about the existence of an instrument to measure the concentration of alcohol in the blood at the level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, it is true that the instrument in Britain is calibrated to measure only the level they have adopted there.  It is merely a question of calibration.  There is no difficulty in having an instrument calibrated to the figures we are adopting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits on investment contained in the current legislation.  The Bill provides for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  An increase from £6,000,000 to £8,000,000 in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company;</P>
    <P>(2)  An increase from £3,000,000 to £6,000,000 in the aggregate amount of grants, voted annually, which may be made to the company, and</P>
    <P>(3)  An increase from £3,000,000 to £7,000,000 in the existing statutory limit on repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for the provision of houses and community services.</P>
    <P>The Development Company was set up to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes.  It has been recognised that the greatest scope for the company's energies lies in developing the Industrial Estate and in using the existing advantages at the airport to promote industry.  In addition the company has promoted the establishment at Shannon of warehousing and commercial and service activities.  It has also engaged very successfully in the promotion of passenger traffic at the airport mainly through the encouragement of tourism in the surrounding area.  All these activities contribute markedly to the maintenance and development of Shannon Airport which is a very important national investment and asset and a focal point for economic growth.</P>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for the provision of factory buildings.  These are normally rented to the occupiers but factory bays may also be purchased outright or may be built on sites leased from the company.  Repayable advances are used for the provision of dwellings and community services for the purposes of the Industrial Estate.  The houses are provided by the company <Col N="1244" /> to rent or to purchase and developed sites are also made available for persons wishing to build their own houses and for speculative building.  The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and the training of workers.</P>
    <P>The finances provided to the company under existing legislation (SFADCO Ltd. Acts 1959 to 1965) up to 31st March, 1968 were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The balance available in the case of grant-in-aid is not sufficient to meet requirements for the current financial year while the balance of share capital is barely sufficient for the year.  The existing limit of £3,000,000 on repayable advances has already been reached and it is necessary to finance repayable advances temporarily from share capital pending enactment of the present legislation.  Interest on the amounts temporarily issued as share capital will be payable from the date of issue.  The introduction of new legislation at this stage is in accordance with the intention when the 1965 Act was under consideration.  It was decided then that the limits settled should cover the company's operations up to about the present time.</P>
    <P>The company has been making steady progress in attracting new industries to Shannon.  At 31st March, 1968, there were 27 manufacturing concerns in operation at the airport compared with 14 at 31st March, 1965. Of the 27 concerns, one had built their own factory, two had purchased their factories and the rest occupied factories on a rental basis.  Proposals for the establishment of four further manufacturing concerns are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing activities cover <Col N="1245" /> a wide range of products including electronic equipment, yarn, fabric, finished garments, pianos, industrial diamonds, precision tools, floor maintenance equipment and many other items. Practically all the output is exported.</P>
    <P>The company promotes the establishment of warehousing activities with a view to stimulating air freight traffic through the airport.  At 31st March, 1968, seven warehousing concerns were in operation and proposals from another concern were being considered. In addition, 13 commercial and service concerns were operating at 31st March, 1968, with a proposal for a further concern under consideration.  The commercial activities included data processing and consultancy and trading business.</P>
    <P>A total of 60 factories and ten warehouses were occupied at 31st March, 1968, compared with 40 factories and three warehouses occupied at 31st March, 1965.  Twelve more factories and two warehouses were under construction and a further 31 sites had been reserved by existing firms with a view to expansion of their activities.</P>
    <P>In the calendar year 1967 exports from the Industrial Estate amounted to £32.6 million and imports were valued at £22.5 million, leaving a net balance of £10.1 million.  This balance gives an idea of the volume of work being carried out at the Industrial Estate and its contribution to the country's balance of payments.  The percentage of total national exports of manufactured goods represented by exports from Shannon increased from 21 per cent in 1964 to 29 per cent in 1967.  In relation to total national trade in 1967, Shannon exported 1½ per cent of total exports and imported four per cent of total imports.  Air freight generated by the Industrial Estate in 1967 was 3,301 tonnes compared with 876 tonnes in 1964.</P>
    <P>The company promotes tourism through Shannon in conjunction with other promoting bodies including Bord Fáilte, the air companies and CIE.  This promotion is reflected in the growth of terminal passenger traffic at Shannon. Terminal traffic in the year ended March, 1968 exceeded 320,000, the highest figure in the airport's history. The tours, banquets and other tourist <Col N="1246" /> activities promoted by the company catered for over 100,000 people in 1967.</P>
    <P>At 31st March, 1968, 3,942 people&mdash; 2,238 males and 1,704 females&mdash;were employed in the Industrial Estate as compared with 2,927&mdash;1,538 males and 1,389 females&mdash;at 31st March, 1965. The total employment in the whole Shannon complex at 31st March, 1968 was over 6,000 people and their total annual income has been conservatively estimated as being in the region of £4 million.  The number of people resident in the Shannon community was over 2,100; 443 houses and 137 flats had been constructed by the company for rent or sale and almost all of these were occupied or allocated.  A further 130 houses were under construction.  In addition to the company-built houses, 25 houses had been constructed by private builders on developed sites provided by the company and 18 such houses were in course of construction. Consideration was being given to arrangements with a speculative builder who proposes to build further houses for sale.  Clare County Council also plans to construct houses in the new town.  However, the bulk of the housing requirements at Shannon will have to be provided by the company for a number of years to come.  In addition to housing development, certain community services have been provided by the community, the company or by other authorities.  These include two churches, a comprehensive school, a community hall, two primary schools, shops and recreational and library facilities.</P>
    <P>The majority of the workers at Shannon live outside the community and commute to the factories at Shannon.  The development of the new community is becoming the biggest single element of the company's work, in terms of the finances involved, of its complexity and of its vital importance to the attraction of industry and to stabilising future industrial growth in the region.  It is clear to the company that industrial development and community development are interdependent whether in planning or in building, in working or in social living. Having regard to these factors and to <Col N="1247" /> the relevant observations in the report of Dr. Lichfield, the planning consultant for the region, the company are fully satisfied that the minimum viable community which must be aimed at in Shannon's particular geographic environment is one of not less than 6,000 people.  Based on the rate of progress necessary to attain this end, it is proposed that provision should be made in the new legislation for the necessary funds for the three years to 31st March, 1971, by raising the limits in existing legislation to the figures which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>In regard to grants-in-aid, these grants provide for the running expenses of the company and also enable the company to pay grants to industrialists for buildings, machinery and the training of workers.  Grants paid to the company to 29th February, 1968 amounted to £2,687,500.  In addition, the company received £1,201,567 by way of rents and other income; £2,327,376 was used by the company for promotion and administrative expenses and grants totalling £1,463,314 were made to industrialists.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the confidence which I expressed in the continued progress of the company when recommending the 1965 legislation for the approval of the House has been fully justified and I consider that it is necessary that the company should be provided with the financial resources up to the limits now proposed to enable them to consolidate the progress already made and to provide for further orderly progress in the future. The outline which I have given of the progress made by the company to date affords ample proof of the continuing value to the national economy of the Shannon enterprise and I am convinced that the additional finances now sought will prove to be a prudent investment in the national interest.  For my own part, I wish to congratulate the board, management and staff of the company and all those who are contributing to the success of the Shannon project.</P>
    <P>As has already been announced, it is the Government's view that it would be clearly beneficial to make use of the successful experience of the Shannon <Col N="1248" /> Free Airport Development Company Limited within the Limerick/Clare/ North Tipperary region.  Accordingly, it has been decided that the company will function as an organ of industrial development within this region and will be responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for industrial estate development and possibly the building of advance factories within the region.</P>
    <P>The company will report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on all industrial and related matters, including those at the Shannon Industrial Estate, but will continue to report to me on its tourism and aviation activities.  This Bill is without prejudice in any way to what may be done under the new arrangements and is related to requirements under the existing arrangements.  Any additional financial arrangements for developments in the company's extended area of operations will be announced separately as will the details of any legislative action necessary.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Towards the end of his speech, the Minister offered congratulations to the board, management and staff of the company and to all those who are contributing to the success of the Shannon project.  I should like to join in those congratulations. These people deserve the nation's thanks for the magnificent work they are doing, but I may be pardoned if I strike one discordant note.  Recently it was brought to my notice that a certain amount of political discrimination is beginning to creep in down there, particularly since we had a by-election in Clare and again since the Limerick by-election became imminent.  It would be a tragedy if political discrimination crept in.  It would be a tragedy if men were laid off simply because of their political affiliations.  I sincerely hope that the Minister, in conveying to the board our congratulations, will remind them of what I have said and request them to ensure that this company will be kept above parochial politics&mdash;that it will be a national concern of which we shall remain proud and of which we are all proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> In opening his speech, the Minister said that it was proposed to extend the limits of investment.  I thought he was about to say, on the eve of the Limerick by-election, that it was intended to extend the limits of the Shannon Free Airport Area to include Limerick city, because I have heard on many occasions that it was proposed to extend the limits to include Limerick. Under the 1959 Act, the limits within which the airport must operate were clearly laid down.  We accept that and we further accept the fact that there can be no extension without legislation by this House.</P>
    <P>The much admired and much lamented former Minister for Education indicated on many occasions that the Government intended to extend the airport area to include the city of Limerick.  It is as well that the people of Limerick should know that an amending Bill is now before the House and no harm to let them know that though it is intended to extend the financial limits, there is no intention to extend the area limits.  It is as well to have that clear now in the event of any suggestion to the contrary during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that Shannon is doing a considerable amount for tourism not only in the West and South but for Ireland generally, but I have often wondered what will happen when transatlantic planes overfly Shannon, with Dublin as a possible terminus, or even if Dublin is barred to them and they extend the limits of their flights to British and continental airports.  Some encouragement must be given to foreign companies to make Shannon one of their intermediate stops on transatlantic flights, and even, if necessary, give them even limited facilities to land at Dublin.  Otherwise, we may miss this tourism potential to which the Minister referred and with which we all agree.</P>
    <P>Now that Shannon has been established, as the Minister has pointed out, I think it is a pity that it is not a focal point for the distribution of tourists throughout the State by means of small charter flights from Shannon to various other parts&mdash;either in small planes or helicopters, if, that is, helicopters are <Col N="1250" /> a commercial proposition for the transport of tourists.  I have been told that most tourists who disembark at Shannon make the immediate environment of Shannon their tourist visiting area.  This is a pity when one remembers that Connemara, West and North Mayo and Donegal are within a few hours drive or a few minutes flight of Shannon.  Therefore, the Minister might possibly find some method of linking Shannon with small airports established throughout the country.  I understand that at the moment there is a link between Belfast and Shannon which is all to the good.  If something could be done, say, by way of link-up of Shannon with Derry and with other small landing strips in the North-West such as Enniskillen, it would prove beneficial to the tourist industry throughout the West generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to explain the advantages of this industrial estate at Shannon.  Many times we have heard mention of the advantages of these industrial estates which were set up.  We are inclined to overlook the fact that it was the Act of 1949 which set up the Industrial Development Authority which was responsible for the establishment of these estates originally.  We are also inclined to forget what the attitude of Fianna Fáil was when that Act was being debated in this House, and it might be no harm to remind ourselves of the attitude of Fianna Fáil to the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority under that Act of 1949.  A few quotations might be useful, not only now but in the future.</P>
    <P>I quote from column 1596 of Volume 119 of the Dáil Debates for 9th March, 1950.  The then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, later Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>Needless to say, we are opposed to this proposal.  It is a typical product of the Fine Gael mind.  During all the 25 years I have been a Member of this Dáil, I have been fighting against that Fine Gael mentality.</P>
    <P>That Fine Gael mentality has evidently penetrated into the minds of Fianna Fáil so that they see the advantage of <Col N="1251" /> that Act and are very glad to reap the benefits of it.</P>
    <P>Later, at column 1598 of the same volume, Deputy Seán Lemass is reported:</P>
    <P>The Minister has said this Industrial Development Authority has had achievements.  If there are achievements, we should be able to see them in factories built and men at work. Where are they?</P>
    <P>The Minister has just told us now where they are and gloried and taken pride in, and we agree with him, the factories that have been established as a result of the Industrial Development Act of 1949.  After Mr. Morrissey had said the factories were going to be built, Deputy Lemass said: &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Now the Minister has told us where they were built and has told us the advantages of them to the State. There are almost 4,000 people employed in industry at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Again at column 1599 of the same volume Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>The drive for industrial development has not lost its impetus.  It will go on in spite of the Minister and the Industrial Development Authority but it will go on at a steadily diminishing pace, unless the impediments to it are removed.</P>
    <P>Remember, the impediment to which Deputy Lemass referred was the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1949, an Act which has been praised by Ministers down through the years ever since then.</P>
    <P>Again at column 1618 he said:</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill in principle ... but, in fairness to them and to anyone else who may be now or who may in the future become associated with this Industrial Development Authority, I want them to understand that my opposition and the opposition of Deputies on this side of the House to the whole idea in this Bill is fundamental and that at the earliest possible occasion we will terminate it ... Our hostility is to this Bill and to the principle of it ... if <Col N="1252" /> ever ... the Party on this side of the House becomes the Government ... these subsidiary bodies will cease.</P>
    <P>They are very glad now to have it. Deputy Lemass was very glad indeed to retract what he said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Not only did he oppose the Bill but the present Taoiseach had a bit to say about it.  At column 1633 of the same volume the present Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, said:</P>
    <P>I suggest again that it is a dangerous precedent to allow men appointed by the Minister to this Authority to have control over the expenditure of moneys in the establishment of industries that are being contemplated by private individuals ... if for no other reason, I am opposing the Bill on those grounds.</P>
    <P>Twice since then we have had amending legislation in respect of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Act, not only endorsing the Act of 1959 but extending the amount of moneys which are being made available. Let me say that we offer no opposition to this Bill: we welcome it. Were it not for the Industrial Development Authority, I think we will agree that Shannon Airport would not be the pride of this country it is today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also said at column 1858 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>... our opposition to this Industrial Development Authority and to the voting of money to it is due to the belief that it will not facilitate the expansion of Irish industry.... I have said that we do not believe in it and that we think it will be an impediment to industrial development. Consequently, it is to be assumed by the members of the Authority and by those employed in the service of that Authority that that opposition will be expressed in a repeal of this legislation some time in the future.</P>
    <P>That was said in 1950, 50 years ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass said that he would repeal that Act but now Fianna Fáil are taking the credit for it and are going around the country telling people that as a result of the incentives given under the Industrial Development Act&mdash;they do not mention the year it was introduced &mdash;they are entitled to the credit for the setting up of these industrial estates.</P>
      <P>We have one in my own county, a Cheann Comhairle, not so far from where Deputy Breslin and I reside.  We are very proud to have it there, and to let the people know that it was under the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1949 that the people there benefit by this particular industrial estate.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say, and possibly rightly, what has all that got to do with what we are dealing with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which started in 1957.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a lot to do with it because the Minister went on to tell us the number of factories which have been established at Shannon, the number of people who have been employed. What were the incentives to those people setting up a business at the Shannon Estate?  Was it not the incentives provided under the Industrial Development Act, 1949 and the tax concessions given by the interParty Government under the 1956 Act?  These are two of the major factors that made Shannon Airport the success it is.  God knows, many people at the time might not have had the faith in Shannon that some of us had. Many people foresaw the day when Shannon would be overflown.  I sincerely hope that will never happen because it would be ruinous to the economy of the West and South-West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply would tell us the amount of foreign capital invested in Shannon <i>vis-á-vis</i> the amount of Irish capital, if it is possible for him to do so.  It may be that the Minister has not got these <Col N="1254" /> figures at his disposal, but if he has, they might be interesting.  We know that approximately 4,000 people are employed in industry there.  We further know that there are approximately 6,000 people employed in all at Shannon.  We know the amount of money made available by the State but we would like to know what amounts of foreign capital have been invested there since the establishment of this company at Shannon.  If the Minister has the information, we will be very glad indeed to receive it.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us about the number of factories that have been set up. Perhaps he would tell us if any factories have closed and if so, how many, what the cost has been to the State and the number of people thrown out of employment as a result of the closing of those factories?</P>
    <P>I am not going to be drawn into the dispute at Shannon at the moment over the employment of non-union labour.  I do not propose to say anything about that subject, other than to hope and pray that this dispute may be settled and that it may not extend beyond its present limits.  That is the fervent prayer of the Fine Gael Party and I think of all nationally-minded people.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am not opposing this Bill on behalf of Fine Gael.  We welcome it. Section 3 of the 1963 Act was amended to permit the Minister to take up shares to the value of £6 million as against £4 million under the 1963 Act. I understand that under the present Bill this will be stepped up to £8 million; in other words, we have doubled since 1963 the amount which the Minister is permitted to invest in shares in this company and we are doubling the amount of grants-in-aid which the Minister is permitted to give to it.  All we can hope and pray for is that there may be a corresponding doubling of the number employed at Shannon during the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill and give it their full support.  However, there are a couple of points I would like to make. One has already been partly made by Deputy O'Donnell, relating to the second paragraph on page 7 of the <Col N="1255" /> Minister's Statement in which he says:</P>
      <P>As has already been announced, it is the Government's view that it would be clearly beneficial to make use of the successful experience of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited within the Limerick/Clare/North Tipperary region.  Accordingly it has been decided that the company will function as an organ of industrial development within this region and will be responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for industrial estate development and possibly the building of advance factories within the region.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a man for whom I have a very high regard but I would ask him would he honestly say if this is simply put there because there is a by-election coming off in Limerick.  Let us have a straight answer to this.  In the last by-election in West Limerick we had a prominent speaker for Fianna Fáil making a statement, for which subsequently the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to come into this House and state that there was no foundation, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has been made yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision had been made at that time nor has it yet been made.  Is the suggestion now that we are about to have such a decision made?  Is that what is contained in paragraph 2 of page 7 of the Minister's statement?  I would like to get this cleared up because during the by-election we will all have occasion to listen to perhaps some speaker from the Government pronouncing as a result of what is contained in this paragraph, that we are on the verge of a big breakthrough, that there will be factories springing up all over that portion of the country.  I would like to have the Minister tell us here and now if that is what is intended or is this just a hope which he feels in the years to come may materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who fight by-elections and take part in campaigns like to be able <Col N="1256" /> to face facts with facts.  I am sure the Minister has more experience of this than I have but there is nothing so annoying as having somebody saying something based on something the Minister said or he thought he said.  I am sure the Minister knows the disappointment which occurs afterwards when it is found there is no basis whatever for the optimism in the district during the period of the particular by-election.</P>
    <P>At the present time in Limerick there are a tremendous number of people unemployed.  I would not like to have those people getting the impression that the Government are about to launch forth on a big scheme of development which will provide factories and work for them, that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited are about to throw their mantle on Limerick and then everything will be grand.  I would be grateful to the Minister if he would categorically state, whether or not this is just some scheme which will not operate for a number of years.  I would like him to state if this is something which will be decided, say, within six months, 12 months or 18 months, or whatever time it will take to start this development.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>The amount of money made available is very sizeable and the number of jobs is very large.  However, I feel the number of jobs being offered to girls is far too high.  I feel an effort should be made to try to have more male employees.  There is no scarcity, or there is not such a scarcity, of jobs for girls throughout the country but there is a scarcity of jobs for men.  I feel that, with the 65,000 unemployed on the register at the moment, an effort should be made to find companies which will give more employment to men or, better still, should the State desire not to give the space for factories to other people, they should experiment, if you like, in full employment by setting up factories to cater for certain needs which they know exist and try to get employment in that area as a result of which they can expand to the other areas mentioned for the development of industrial estates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The Government should face up to this some time.  It is quite obvious that private enterprise are not going to create full employment here.  It would not pay them to do it.  As long as there is not full employment, they feel they can control wages and conditions to some extent.  The Government should experiment somewhere and the Shannon estate seems to be the ideal place for something like this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said he did not want, or his Party did not want, to become involved in the EI dispute.  I do not agree with them.  I think we are all involved in this dispute not because the factory has refused to recognise a trade union but because of the fact that the management of that factory apparently have decided to set at naught everything the Irish people hold dear, the High Court, the Labour Court as well as the trade union movement. They are turning their backs to everything the Minister for Labour and the High Court have done.  If they get away with this, they will do very great damage to this country.  Mind you, they are not fighting an individual case but they are trying to establish that the employment movement of this country should be entitled to set up a new norm or a new process for worker-employer relationships.  The Government should not let them get away with that.</P>
    <P>I know that if the Minister for Labour were here, he would immediately throw across at me: &ldquo;Do you want the Government to take action on the trade union issue&rdquo;.  My answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I do not want him to meddle because God knows, we have enough of it and do not want any more.  I am sure the Minister for Transport and Power will appreciate this.  We want to prevent somebody from outside, such as this company, coming into this country, getting large sums of money, not from the Government, but from the taxpayers of this country, most of whom are workers themselves, and having got substantial grants and loans, refusing to accept normal arrangements made in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe the action of this company and their behaviour here are doing <Col N="1258" /> very great damage to industrial development in this country.  I believe they are doing more damage than all the strikes and lock-outs we have had over the years.  The fact of the matter is that the story going abroad will be that a factory such as the EI are in fact not being allowed to carry on as they should be and this false story will do this country irreparable damage.  There are thousands of companies in this country, some of them Irish, some of them British, many of them from America, Germany and what-have-you and they have conformed to what are recognised conditions in this country. As a result of that, the relationship between themselves, their employees and the trade unions has always been very good.</P>
    <P>Let me here make this comment, as a trade union official, that I and many more like me spend more time trying to smooth the path towards industrial relationship than we do trying to start strikes.  It would be appreciated if the press would recognise this.  Some of them seem to suggest that this is not the case.  We on our side prefer to get things to run smoothly and we find it is far better to have negotiations on wages and working conditions than to see people walking around picketing, carrying placards and with only strike pay to sustain them.  In spite of this we have overlooked the EI company coming here and trying to wield the big stick and trying to run under the cover of our Constitution when the facts are put before them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell hoped it would not spread.  Let us face facts: it has spread.  It has spread to the extent that everybody who is helping EI, whether they supply motor vehicles or fuel or spare parts, and many more items, is involved.  All of those, whether they like it or not, are becoming involved up to the neck in this dispute. They want to injure the interests of the workers of this country but they will not get any succour from the workers when the time comes.  The fact is that this has gone on and unless some attempt is made by this company to see reason, this will spread overseas and we will have the same disputes <Col N="1259" /> coming up all over the world, if something is not done at Shannon.  The name of Shannon will become black.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to ensure that, even if nothing can be done by the Government&mdash;and it is the attitude of the Government that they can do nothing now to make the EI company conform&mdash;never again will a company come in here to try to rub the faces of the workers of this country in the dust as EI are doing at the present time.  I had experience of a German company, as was mentioned in this House, who tried something similar.  To their credit, it can be said that when they found they were not doing what is normally done in the country, they approached their solicitor and made an honourable settlement with us.  The workers were reinstated and paid for the time they were out.  This dispute is entirely different.  The EI dispute is an attempt by a company which has an international reputation for bad labour relations to carry on, even if they have to carry on elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Let me say also that people will say on television and on radio that they are getting good wages and enjoying good conditions.  I have heard that before.  I have heard employers of nontrade union labour appearing on the air offering wages and conditions miraculously attractive and as soon as the dangers disappear, reasons are found for reducing wages and conditions.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for labouring this point but I am sure the Minister will appreciate the fact that all of us on the workers' side of the industrial fence are seriously perturbed by what is happening there.  The Minister for Labour went perhaps further than he might have in inviting these people to talk and to try to explain what the position is.  Their attitude to him is typical of how these people want to carry on.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to ensure that this will not happen again.  When the Shannon Airport Development Bill comes before the House again, as it must, I feel that because of developments, because of the fact that so far it has been a success, if the present mix-up does not throw it back and spoil what has been done, the Minister <Col N="1260" /> might perhaps be able&mdash;and I hope it will be the present Minister if Fianna Fáil are still in power&mdash;or whoever is responsible for the Department, to say if an improvement will be made in the employment of men <i>vis-á-vis</i> women, and I suggest the State should take an interest in that.</P>
    <P>A question was asked by Deputy Mullen of the Minister some time ago about a plane going in beside a factory and the reply generally was that it was not the responsibility of this Government, that it was subject to the regulations of the country from which the plane came.  I am sure the safety regulations at Shannon should override any other regulations in relation to that plane coming in here.  If it is accepted that a plane can go right in beside a factory, and while loading or unloading is taking place an accident occurs, is it the regulations affecting the plane in Britain or the regulations which affect the plane under the Minister's Department which will affect the inquiry which is bound to take place? This is a matter which should be dealt with.  No facilities of this kind should be given to any company.  There is a great danger that not alone will this factory, but many more, be affected if something goes wrong with the loading or unloading of a plane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to certain legislation that has been passed by the Fine Gael Party.  I do not think that at this stage one should get into controversy about which Government were able to encourage the greatest industrial development. I might take the opportunity of speaking about the 1952 under-developed areas grants which gave several grants to western areas in order to provide industries.  Since 1957, more than 306 new factories were instituted to provide employment for 40,000 people.  I do not think it necessary for me to stress the fact that it was Deputy Lemass, former Taoiseach, who was regarded by everybody, even by Fine Gael, as the architect of industrial relations in Ireland.  I leave the rest of what Deputy O'Donnell said.  I am simply repeating that statement now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked the amount <Col N="1261" /> of foreign capital invested in Shannon Free Airport Development Company interests.  It is estimated at £8 million in 1967.  Some six small factories closed and most of the employees were re-employed in other industries.  I would say that the closure of factories in Shannon in relation to the total number promoted is regarded as reasonable and can be compared with the kind of failure that takes place in any community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked me to state definitely the Government policy in regard to the extension of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company sphere of operation.  That does not actually arise on this Bill but since he has suggested that this just might be a <i>canard</i> used to attract votes in the East Limerick election campaign, I should perhaps remind him that this is an absolutely fundamental decision in the light of changing conditions.  We were aware that more industrial development is required.  We got expert advice from An Foras Forbartha that the development of regional centres and the selection of certain towns for industrial factory sites, where facilities were sufficient, where transport and other infrastructural services were available could contribute to more industrial development.</P>
    <P>This was agreed to by the National Industrial and Economic Council who recommended that because of the success of the Shannon Free Airport Development Area the Government should initially extend the provision of the factory site concept to Galway and Waterford.  Most of the factory premises in Waterford have been booked.  I am not sure of the position in Galway but I think it is satisfactory. We have examined the whole question of regional planning and became aware of its importance when the Lichfield plan for the Limerick/ Clare/North Tipperary region was published&mdash;the first of nine regional planning regions.  For the first time we could see the concept of a plan by experts applied to tourism, industry, agriculture, roads, transportation, infrastructural services and so forth.  It was an interesting and brilliant report. It suggested that the Shannon Free <Col N="1262" /> Airport Development Company should continue its activities but that industrial development should be based if possible on a regional concept.</P>
    <P>We were also aware of the fact that in Limerick city, although there is great prosperity, there is also a large number of people unemployed.  It seems, therefore, that, with the development of the successful operations of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the existence of a regional report which could be used by a development company as a basis for industrial planning and the existence of a large city with services available would suggest that the first area to be chosen would be that where an existing local regional development company, as distinct from the Industrial Development Authority, could make use of its talents, techniques and know-how in order to develop industry within the region.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, most esteemed by all of us, naturally pressed vigorously from the very beginning for that development because he could see the success of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and he noted the coming together of a series of steps which had been taken in the region to emphasise its importance. Therefore, the Government have taken this specific decision, first of all, that the IDA will be linked with An Foras Tionscal in one body with consequent savings on operations and more coordination. Secondly, the IDA will be gradually decentralised with a view to taking advantage of plans made by the other eight regional centres and planning authorities in order to develop a concept of industrial growth within certain centres that are regarded as having priority and where industries are most likely to be established.</P>
    <P>The decision was that the first area where this would take place, where the machinery would be set up, would be the Shannon area.  There was readily available there a splendidly successful organisation, which would expand its activities, adapt its techniques to a whole area, while at the same time maintaining the growth at Shannon. That is a completely honest statement. There is nothing about it which is in <Col N="1263" /> the nature of trying to attract votes in the East Limerick election.  That is exactly how it progressed.</P>

      <P>In regard to the suggestion that there could be a customs-free port area as there is as Shannon Airport, that would have to be examined; but I think I could say, without danger of committing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that it would be quite impossible to make Limerick borough a customs-free area. In fact, the existing customs-free area at Shannon Airport, although it is of commercial advantage and saves some administration costs, no longer has the significance one might think it would have.  While it is possible to conceive of a customs-free area somewhere in Limerick harbour, if it is to be of any advantage it would all have to relate to the most complicated procedure.  The main idea of the extension of the company is this: When the company get the capital, when they can acquire the know-how and have sufficient staff to undertake this regional development, it may suggest Limerick city or perhaps some other place as an area where industrial sites might be established and factory premises built.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully asked about the question of the employment of females.  As the Deputy knows, it is very important to employ girls in rural areas because it does raise the purchasing power of small farmer families; but we do try to keep the proportion two-thirds male employment as far as possible.</P>

      <P>The target is two-thirds male employment.  At present the figure is something below that, 57 per cent.  Deputy Tully, speaking about establishing full employment at Shannon, suggested the Government might set up actual State companies for industrial production.  That is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  All I can say is that in everything we have done in the past ten years, there has been no prejudice on the part of the Government against State participation as such.  As the Deputy well knows, when Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta and the B &amp; I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Next week you will see the first modern Irish passenger vessel owned by the Irish people setting sail for Liverpool.  It may have taken a long time, but at least it is an indication that we are not prejudiced against State company activity. It is simply a matter of where it could be applied to the best advantage and whether it is advisable for State company purposes in the case of purely commercial industry.  There is no absolute prejudice in regard to this at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell suggested there should be linking services between Shannon Airport and various other parts of the West.  As the Deputy knows, the small airfield is now beginning to be a proposition.  There is one at Castlebar and there are various proposals for small airfields elsewhere. Should this kind of traffic develop, naturally there will have to be very small aircraft and they will have to have a pretty full load if they are going to pay.</P>

      <P>They may.  In reply to Deputy O'Donnell, there will be no change in our policy in regard to the landing of aircraft at Shannon coming across the Atlantic.  I do not think I need go further into that at this time. I have never heard any allegation of political discrimination at Shannon in regard to employment or grants.  From what I know of the Board, they would be quite incapable of encouraging it and I do not think the private industrialists do it either.  I think the Deputy must have been misinformed.</P>
      <P>Finally, in reply to Deputy Tully with regard to the EI position, I do not think I need say any more than the Minister for Labour has already said.  He made it perfectly clear that the Industrial Development Authority in America and in Dublin and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company at Shannon recommend new firms to engage in trade union relations. I do not think I need repeat what has been said so clearly by the Minister, and the Deputy knows what he has done.  However, the fact does remain that there is no legislation in this country by which anyone could compel a firm and say to it: &ldquo;You must use trade union labour.&rdquo;  That, the Deputy knows, is the constitutional and legal position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Agreement entitled &ldquo;European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts transmitted from Stations outside National Territories&rdquo; which was signed on behalf of Ireland, subject to ratification, on 9th March, 1965.  The agreement binds each contracting party to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft, etc., outside national territories, as well as defined acts of collaboration knowingly performed.  These defined acts of collaboration include the provision of equipment, supplies, programme material and advertising for such stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the radio frequency spectrum is limited.  Before a new radio station can be established, <Col N="1267" /> it is necessary for the sponsors to decide what frequency they propose to use.  But as all broadcasting frequencies are already being used, and since radio transmissions in one country can interfere with radio reception in another, there must be international agreement and regulation regarding the use of frequencies.  The international organisation which is responsible for the regulation of the use of frequencies is a specialised agency of the United Nations known as the International Telecommunications Union.  This union has over 120 member nations, who have undertaken to observe the International Telecommunications Convention and the Radio Regulations annexed thereto.  These regulations provide for the orderly allocation and use of radio frequencies, with the object of enabling the optimum use to be made of the radio spectrum and to avoid harmful interference between transmissions.</P>
    <P>One of these regulations provides that no transmitting station may be established or operated by any private person or enterprise without a licence issued by the Administration of the country to which the station in question is subject.  Another regulation prohibits the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or air-borne objects on or over the high seas.</P>
    <P>The persons or companies against whom the Bill is directed, and whom I may refer to as pirate broadcasters, deliberately break these regulations by appropriating any wavelengths which suit their purposes&mdash;and the wavelengths selected are such as to give wide coverage for commercial ends irrespective of the consequences to legitimate users of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>The problem of &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; broadcasting, that is broadcasting by commercial interests usually from ships flying a flag of convenience&mdash;or no flag at all&mdash;anchored outside territorial waters, has been a matter of concern to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunication Administrations&mdash;of which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a member&mdash;<Col N="1268" /> and to the European Broadcasting Union&mdash;of which Radio Telefís Éireann is a member&mdash;for some years. Both organisations had been pressing their members to urge their Governments to take action to suppress such &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; stations even before the Council of Europe Agreement on this matter was signed in 1965.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the interference which these pirate stations can cause to legitimate broadcasting stations but a matter of more serious concern is the ease with which these transmissions can spill over into the distress and emergency frequencies used by ships, lighthouses and coast stations.  There were times when the activities of a well-known pirate station affected our coast station at Malin Head and our lighthouses along the east coast.  On one occasion Malin Head coast station was unable to receive distress signals from a fishing trawler and my Department had to bring interference with essential lighthouse services to the notice of the pirate station concerned. I will say that the station in question did rectify the position quickly but it was a hazard which can recur when pirate stations are in operation.</P>
    <P>Legitimate stations are subject to many rules.  The laws of libel, copy-right, contracts, conditions of employment and the general gamut of regulation apply as they do to any business in the State.  However, the pirates operating outside territorial waters are subject to no such restraints.  My understanding is that so far as the pirate is concerned the property of creative artists and the whole field of copyright property is there for the taking.</P>
    <P>The existence of &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; stations could also adversely affect RTE income from advertising and could give rise to interference which might seriously impair reception of the Irish programmes.  Serious interference was actually caused for a time to reception on the Dublin wavelength&mdash;1250 kc/s &mdash;by a pirate broadcaster operating off Scotland.</P>
    <P>As in every sphere of activity the Government are concerned to preserve law and order in the use of radio frequencies. It was evident from the number <Col N="1269" /> of pirate stations that had been established around the north-west coast of European in 1962 that some positive and concerned action on agreed lines was essential.  Hence the European Agreement.  This lays an obligation on us as one of its signatories to make punishable as offences not merely the establishment or operation of stations on Irish ships, or by Irish nationals on any ship, but also certain acts of collaboration&mdash;for instance, the provisioning of ships engaged in pirate broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Agreement has been signed by 12 Administrations.  The following members of the Council of Europe have introduced legislation: Britain, France, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Finland, which is not a member of the Council of Europe, has introduced legislation towards the same end.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the speed with which pirate stations operating round the British coast closed down on the enactment of legislation by Britain. There is little doubt that if we show any hesitation in ratifying the European Agreement, ships carrying these stations will operate from our shores. Britain and the other European countries are looking to us to close a gap which we, as a member of the Council of Europe, have undertaken to do. This is really an obligation shared by every member of the International Telecommunications Union.</P>
    <P>The promoters of pirate broadcasting stations have shown a flair for finding and exploiting loopholes in the law of different countries.  They are mainly interested in broadcasting to densely populated areas and can be expected to start broadcasting to Britain from positions off the Irish coast if there is any long delay in enacting legislation here now that the British Bill has become law, or if the Irish legislation contains some loop-hole which does not exist in Britain. The Bill before you is, therefore, designed to correspond as closely as possible with British legislation in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the Government <Col N="1270" /> to deal effectively with any pirate broadcasting station within our territorial limits or from our waters. Sections 2 and 3 make all such broadcasting unlawful and also broadcasts from Irish registered ships operating anywhere.  The net is widely cast as to the persons who can be found guilty of offences, namely, the owner and master of the ship or aircraft and everyone operating or participating in the working of the station.  It also covers agents or companies on shore that assist in the operations.</P>
    <P>Signatories to the European Agreement were aware of the difficulties of getting at stations which operate on the high seas.  Power is being taken in the Bill to deal with Irish nationals if they operate stations in any ship or aircraft on or over the high seas regardless of the place of registration of the ship.  These powers are extended in section 4 to marine structures outside the State.  I should perhaps stress that it will be an offence for anyone in the State, whatever his nationality, to arrange for broadcasting to take place in any ship, aircraft or structure on or over the high seas.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 spell out what I referred to earlier as &ldquo;acts of collaboration&rdquo;. They make it an offence to aid in any way the setting-up or operation of pirate broadcasting stations by provisioning them, transporting goods or persons to or from them, maintaining them, or participating in any way in their broadcasting activities.  The provisions of this section will of course be interpreted reasonably; the phrase &ldquo;knowingly performed&rdquo; is in this connection very relevant and, naturally, the situations that could arise in which it would be necessary to give aid and comfort to people engaged in pirate broadcasting have not been overlooked. These situations &mdash; distress, shipwreck, illness and so on &mdash; are covered in section 8.  Aside from these humanitarian exceptions, provision is made in section 7 for the prosecution of offenders, summarily or on indictment, and such proceedings may be instituted anywhere in the State.</P>
    <P>Clause 9 provides for authorisation by wireless telegraphy licence of what <Col N="1271" /> is otherwise prohibited under the other provisions of the Bill.  The need for this section requires no explanation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is needed for five main reasons&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to enable us to honour our obligations to other broadcasting organisations&mdash;and for this all the provisions of the Bill are essential;</P>
    <P>(2)  to protect the effectiveness of our distress and emergency radio communications which can be jeopardised seriously by the operations of pirate broadcasters;</P>
    <P>(3)  to protect performers' rights;</P>
    <P>(4)  to prevent the irregular and improper use of broadcasting for seditious, libellous, etc., purposes;</P>
    <P>(5)  to prevent a drain-off of the advertising revenue of our own broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>I understand that there was disappointment in certain quarters at the disappearance of the pirate broadcasting stations and that some people have charged that the legislation against them is oppressive and undemocratic and shows a disregard of the wishes of the people.  It has also been represented as an attack on commercial broadcasting because the pirates' activities were - entirely financed through advertising.  Needless to say, the pirate broadcasters themselves have not hesitated to encourage these ideas and in doing so they have been aided by the fact that they have had a powerful propaganda medium at their disposal.  As I have shown however the operations of unauthorised broadcasting stations which are responsible to nobody and which exist only for the purpose of commercial gain, can ultimately produce a condition of chaos in which broadcasting as we know it will quickly become impossible.</P>
    <P>Because some of the pirate stations broadcast programmes which had a particular appeal to the young it has been suggested that their suppression indicates a lack of concern for the views of young people.  This is of <Col N="1272" /> course not so.  If pirate broadcasting were allowed to continue the time would soon come when neither young nor old would be able to rely on receiving any sound broadcasting service.  If we allowed this to happen we would indeed lay ourselves open to the charge of disregarding the will of the people and our responsibilities to them.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from all this that any kind of pirate broadcasting station, irrespective of the kind of programme transmitted, will have to be suppressed.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined the enactment of this legislation is an obligation and a necessity.  Similar legislation in Britain has resulted in the suspension of the activities of pirate broadcasters.  If we are dilatory in following suit there is a real danger that we will have one or more of these unwelcome visitors operating off our shores.  I therefore recommended the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill proposes to ratify the Council of Europe Agreement on broadcasting generally, we certainly welcome it. Without a Bill such as this, wavelengths would become a complete jungle.  It would be impossible to have any organised or recognised wavelengths for transmitting or receiving. In so far as this Bill is concerned with the abolition of pirate stations, we welcome it and it will have our full support. What I have to say, apart from that, may possibly be said more in ignorance than otherwise.</P>
      <P>May I preface my remarks by asking if it is necessary for our fishing fleet to have licences for their wireless transmitting sets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They all have to have licences.  They are all licensed by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to know.  I understood that a fishing vessel on a limited wavelength &mdash;the trawler band, as it is known&mdash;had not got such a transmission licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That simplifies <Col N="1273" /> the matter very much indeed.  It brings me to another point.  The Minister issues a licence to our fishing fleet whereby they may send messages to their base as to their catches, the condition of their catches, the weather and conditions at sea generally.  However, the Minister refuses a licence to the base to communicate with such ships to inform them of the condition of the market and whether it is to their advantage or otherwise to come into port. That is something I have pressed in the House on several occasions and the Minister has refused to grant such a licence.</P>
      <P>I cannot, for the life of me, see the difference between a licence granted to the base of a fishing fleet and the licence granted to the garage in which radio cars are generally based to permit them to communicate with the cars while in transit.  If the Minister could issue a licence&mdash;and if, again, I may use one of the Donegal ports as an example&mdash;to Killybegs whereby Killybegs could, within a radius of, say 50 or 60 miles, communicate with the Killybegs fleet while at sea, and permit them to receive those messages, it would be of considerable advantage to the fishing fleet and to the economy of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that it would arise.  Again, what is the position of foreign trawlers fishing within our 12 miles radius who carry a homing waveband?  They are permitted to send messages to the home port.  They are within our territorial waters.  We do not issue a licence to them.  How are we to prosecute such ships which are duly licensed in their own country?  We are placing them at an advantage or at a disadvantage in relation to our own home fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, a German trawler based at Hamburg which is fishing, say, within a radius of 12 miles of the part of our coast in which it is permitted to fish.  Such a ship may transmit messages, other than messages of navigation and for the purpose of security, direct to its home port and to <Col N="1274" /> its owners.  We have absolutely no control whatsoever over such a ship despite the fact that its messages are received in this country.  What is the position there?</P>
    <P>The Minister prohibits any ship within Irish territorial waters from using wireless telegraphy&mdash;and it is defined in the section.  But these foreign boats, which are legitimately within our territorial waters, are permitted to use wireless telegraphy not by our law but by the law of their own country.  What control have we over such ships?  For instance, if such a ship decides to become a pirate station, and uses the licence issued to it by its country of registration, what control have we over such a ship?  We have no powers of arrest.  The licence has been duly issued.  I should like to know what the position would be in such a case.</P>
    <P>We do know that if an Irish citizen is abroad or if Irish property is used to assist, or if there is connivance, they can be prosecuted.  Supposing, for a second, a ship operating with a licence from this country for wireless telegraphy with its home port is used on the high seas, or in German territorial waters, who would prosecute?  Is there any provision under the European agreement for prosecutions in such cases or do we merely shut our eyes and say: &ldquo;We have no method of apprehending&rdquo;?  Is there reciprocal agreement whereby such a ship would automatically lose its licence in the home country?  These are matters which possibly could better be clarified on Committee Stage.  So far as the Bill is designed to end piracy in broadcasting we certainly welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the measure introduced by the Minister.  It is abundantly clear that if piracy in broadcasting were not to be curtailed&mdash;or, should I say, stopped&mdash; there would be chaos in broadcasting. That having been said, there are a few matters on which the Minister should satisfy the House.  I can appreciate the action that can be taken and the powers that states have in respect of their territorial waters but I wonder who is in control of what are described as the high seas?  If one of these pirate stations is established on <Col N="1275" /> a ship or a vessel somewhere between the limits of the territorial waters of this country and the territorial waters of Great Britain, have the states power to act?  Or does the Convention that was signed&mdash;I am sure it does not, because it is only a Convention of the Council of Europe which would not have the force of domestic or international law&mdash;cover the matter?  In any case, who acts if, for example, the ship is to be appropriated?  Is it the Irish Government or the British Government? The Minister will probably be able to clear up that point.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that there is an absolute prohibition on broadcasting from the high seas?  Would it be possible for one of these pirate stations to apply to become a member of the International Telecommunications Union, and if they apply for a frequency, is there any possibility that it would be granted to them by this Association comprising over 120 nations?</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the concern of the young people at the disappearance of a particular station that has been described as a pirate station.  I know also they got a tremendous amount of enjoyment from it and I am aware that there is&mdash;or was&mdash;floating around the country a petition seeking to protect this particular pirate station from the proposed legislation of the British Government a few months ago.  The Minister had occasion to say that this particular pirate station was of particular appeal to the young people.  I suppose it was due to the fact that for many hours during the day, interspersed with commercials, we had from it continuous pop music.  The young people cannot complain unduly about the absence of pop music from broadcasting generally.  I say this being an &ldquo;oldie&rdquo;.  If I had any complaint about Irish radio stations or, indeed, British, I should say that we had far too much of it but I am not in a position to judge because I am not of the pop group or the pop age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the questions I should like to ask the Minister: What definite control have we over broadcasting from what would be regarded as the high <Col N="1276" /> seas within our half of the stretch of water between Britain and Ireland?  If any of these states now deemed to be pirates apply to be included in the international list of frequencies, is there any possibility that their request would be granted?  Are moves being made by the other countries of the Council of Europe to introduce similar legislation?  I note that Britain has introduced the legislation and so have Belgium, France, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, but there are other countries of the Council of Europe&mdash; I assume they have all signed the Convention&mdash;who have not as yet introduced legislation, such as Holland, West Germany and Italy.  Whether these countries intend to promote this type of legislation I do not know.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill, in principle, has my support because I recognise that if Ireland were to be encircled by pirate radio stations, we would certainly feel it here very much.  There have been very many complaints over the years about bad reception from Radio Éireann sound broadcasting, particularly in South-West Cork and in my area, to some extent&mdash;it has greatly improved recently&mdash;in Wexford. If we were to have these various pirate radio stations, I reckon reception from Radio Éireann would be very poor indeed.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill generally, and, as Deputy O'Donnell said, we shall have an opportunity of having the various proposals clarified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has heard the Minister's speech must accept the need for this Bill which will afterwards become an Act.  The fact that such a Bill is necessary in countries all over Europe points out to us that there must have been a need for those stations, that there was some demand for what they turned out.  They were able to reach a public that paid them to do so and in this way they were in contact with a number of people who thought it worth while to listen to them.  Everybody knows their appeal lay in the music they broadcast. This is called pop music and it appeals mostly to people of a certain age group, teenagers; but I think it <Col N="1277" /> must be admitted that even those who belong to the group Deputy Corish calls the &ldquo;oldies&rdquo;, found some satisfaction in it.  Naturally, like all things that are produced, there is the good and the bad, and we should not set out to condemn the good with the bad. The situation that will arise due to the fact that all pirate stations will, as far as possible, be off the air should provide us with an opportunity for further development of our radio station.  Perhaps this can be done by making it more powerful, by a different approach to the programmes and deciding where consumers' tastes lie.</P>
      <P>I do not say that everything national and everything of cultural value should be put off the radio station.  We must preserve those things, even though we may at times have to make some definite effort to do so, but at the same time we should face the situation that presents itself to us.  I suggest that the Minister's Department and RTE set out to fill this void that exists.  If it is necessary that our programmes should contain a large amount of pop, let it be good pop and let this pop be broadcast to the teenagers and those interested by people who would have respect for the teenagers.  From time to time those men make comments which are of interest to the listeners and which in fact are listened to, and I think that in making those appointments, RTE should pay particular attention to the people appointed.</P>

      <P>It is, of course, always open to the various farm organisations, if they so desire, to get together and form a single council to represent the interests of agricultural producers.  As I have frequently stressed, I am in favour of close collaboration among farming organisations as a means of facilitating consultation and co-operation between the Government and the farming community. However, the Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister, I have no function to intervene in differences or disputes between these organisations and I do not think that any such intervention by me at the present time would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> As regards a Council of producer organisations having a negotiating role, I should like to point out that farmers are entrepreneurs and not employees of the Government and that decisions relating to farm prices and farm supports are of direct concern to many other interests and directly affect the level of taxation.  While, therefore, the Government are anxious to have constructive advice and guidance from representatives of organised farmers, agricultural policy decisions must continue to be taken by the Government in the light of all the factors involved.</P>

      <P>Out of 331 schools which were closed up to 31st March, 1968, only five had been built in the previous 15 years.  Two of these had been provided as temporary structures.

      <P>I thank Deputies for the reception they have given to this Bill.  In reply to Deputy O'Donnell, the radio from ships is related to a part of the spectrum in which the regulations are quite different from those which obtain in broadcasting and the use of radio on ships is governed by international radio regulations.  Licences in <Col N="1298" /> respect of the use of radio in ships are issued by the government of the country in which the ships are registered. The frequency to be used and the conditions under which it may be used must be in accordance with the radio regulations.</P>
      <P>The question of the difficulty of finding wavelengths for certain ships in Donegal does not relate to this Bill at all.  These ships can, if necessary, get their high frequency wavelengths in the same way as motor cars which operate mobile radio, but, there again, there are limitations on the use of this particular type of radio and, at present, because of the scarcity of wavebands available for ships, they are confined to the area of cover they have at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked about ships on the high seas.  We can arrest an Irish vessel which operates a pirate station outside our territorial waters if it returns home.  We can arrest and detain an Irish registered ship if it is positioned continuously outside our territorial waters.  In regard to other ships, the purpose of the Bill is to restrain these ultimately by preventing their provisioning and their securing of spare parts, and by preventing advertisers within our territory making use of these ships for advertising purposes.</P>
