    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last week on this Bill I referred to the strange lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Minister in introducing the Bill to the House.  As was pointed out by other speakers, he did not recommend the Bill, which is usually done.  That may possibly have been a slip on his part, but psychologists say that there is no such thing as a lapse of memory or even a slip of the tongue; we forget what we subconsciously dislike remembering and we make slips because the subconscious is pressing on us in some way.  That could very well be the truth in this particular instance because this Bill has certainly not been introduced with any flourish either to the House or to the people in general. We have, in fact, the very extraordinary situation of the Government blaming a High Court decision for the situation in which they find themselves and longing obviously to blame, too, the citizens in general who tacitly, by their action in the referendum, went against the Government's proposals. <Col N="1801" /> That action on the part of the people is something the Government would dearly like to blame but it is, of course, a rather risky thing to blame 600,000 voters publicly for the action they took and the resolute stand they made in such a vitally important matter as the referendum.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the Irish people have, since the setting up of this State, come to recognise what they should do.  I believe that their action is something which is in the best interests of the country as a whole.  I believe, also, that whatever critics may say against the system, it has enormous advantages.  It has had the great advantage of solving differences which existed in our immediate history.  I refer to the events prior to 1920 and the events after 1920.  I refer to the difficulties encountered in setting up this State&mdash;the &ldquo;Troubles&rdquo; and the Civil War&mdash;and to the fact that the voting method we have used over a number of years has actually resulted in helping to seal the bitternesses in so far as they existed.  That, I think, is probably the greatest single reason why the Irish people have again and against shown their love for this system of election.</P>
      <P>I was speaking about Dublin and the carving up of constituencies and I referred to the constituency which I represent at the moment with four other Deputies, the constituency of Dublin South-Central.  That constituency has disappeared into thin air.  It is gone. Part of it has gone into Dublin SouthWest. Another part is being merged with a constituency across the Liffey. Another part has gone into Dublin South-East.  It is rather extraordinary to split up an area which had an entity of its own, which had built up its own point of view on certain things.  Various organisations and various branches not all branches of political Parties had become accustomed to considering that they are an important part of the city of Dublin and that Dublin South-Central was a going concern, so to speak. Now those interests are split up amongst three different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been reduced to the expedient of crossing the Liffey and amalgamating two areas north and <Col N="1802" /> south.  That happened in the past but it did not survive for very long.  It was always felt that the dividing line between north and south was a very useful division and a very useful base for the city wards.  The Government have made a number of constituencies all of which will elect four members.  Those constituencies have a population of 83,000 odd.  The old natural boundaries have been altered and destroyed ruthlessly. The Government's argument is that they had to do this on the one hand because of the interpretation of the Constitution as laid down in the High Court decision, and on the other hand because of the fact that they could not carve up the constituencies into single member constituencies, so they arbitrarily made four member constituencies. In fact, of course, they are perfectly well aware that there is no reason why we should not have five, six, seven or nine member constituencies. Those numbers allow for the full play of proportional representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have 13½ seats.  That is the only way you could avoid breaching the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The population could have been divided up in a different way in the city.  That is the reason for this strange carving up.  The Government want to have so many three member constituencies and if possible nothing more than four member constituencies. In the whole of Ireland I think there are now only two five member constituencies, 26 three member constituencies and 14 four member constituencies.  I am speaking from recollection.  This shows the Government's reluctance to allow the full force of PR to come into play.  Having been beaten in the referendum they now want to win the battle in the carving up of the constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to say what will happen.  The strange thing in the alteration of constituencies is that it has created a good deal of trouble in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party. It by no means appeals to the average backbencher of that Party.  The idea is that in certain parts of the country they will get two out of three seats in <Col N="1803" /> the three-member constituencies, and that in the city of Dublin they will hold an equal number of seats in the four-member constituencies.  I very much doubt whether this will work out as well for the optimists in the Fianna Fáil Party as they think, because in Dublin city the tide is receding for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>What is being done in this Bill is an effort to defeat the true aims of proportional representation and the wishes of the people as clearly exemplified in the referendum.  It is a strange instance of a Government bringing in a Bill which goes against the expressed wishes of the citizens of Ireland in the referendum.  As this is what the Bill is attempting to do I am against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been so much deliberate misrepresentation during the debate on this Bill so far that no one can be surprised if the people of the country are confused.  There is an old saying that figures cannot lie but liars can figure.  Without calling anyone in particular a liar may I say that what they have contributed to this debate has not been accurate in most instances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said&mdash;it is a petty point and because it is a petty point I as a backbencher will answer it&mdash;that the Bill was not recommended to the House by the Minister and this was the first time a Bill had not been recommended to the House.  I should like, for the edification of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Dockrell, to mention this point also and to point out that in 1959 and in 1961 this formula was not followed.  In fact, on these two occasions the Minister did not recommend Bills to the House.  I mention this just for their own information. This is just one of these tiny points the Deputies bring up time and time again to try to confuse the public at large.  We all know that by 1972 we will once again have to revise the boundaries of the constituencies. This is entirely due to a former member of the Fine Gael Party, now a member of the Labour Party, Dr. John O'Donovan, who, aided and abetted by Deputy Ryan, brought this case in the <Col N="1804" /> first place before the court.  They were screaming &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; right up to that time as well.  They talk about the wisdom of the people of Ireland.  I believe greatly in the wisdom of the people of Ireland and their ability not to be fooled by the antics of the Opposition.  I can understand Fine Gael and Labour screaming &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; as loud and as long as they can in order that the people of rural Ireland will not have time to think who devalued their vote and who is responsible for the fact that their vote is not worth as much as a vote in Dublin.  All that they know is that their constituency boundaries, so far as election purposes are concerned, are no longer recognised.</P>
    <P>I should just like to say this before proceeding any further: there are as many members of the Fianna Fáil Party here in Dáil Éireann who are as unhappy about the changes in their constituency boundaries as there are in either the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  There are some people who are really worried.  On the other hand I can cite one Fine Gael TD&mdash; I am sure he will not mind my quoting his name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Fine Gael TD has his home in his constituency.  I do not know whether I should mention his name here.  I shall not but I can say he is very happy about it.  I know other members of Fine Gael also who are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that members of the Fine Gael Party and of the Labour Party whom I happen to know are very happy about their constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy and Deputy Kyne who were screaming <Col N="1805" />&ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; the last time about their constituencies admit it.  They headed the poll in the subsequent election.  Deputy Treacy's constituency has not been changed this time.  Deputy Kyne's constituency has not been changed this time either.  There is no question of gerrymandering there.  This is just sheer hypocrisy and deliberate untruths.</P>
      <P>The referendum has been brought into this time and time again.  It is interesting to note that in Australia they had 30 referenda and 28 failed, including one the purpose of which was to try to put air safety under the control of the Federal Government, which was recommended by all political Parties there.  This failed.  People are suspicious about change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of gerrymandering just does not stand up to examination.  I spent some time studying the speeches made last week. I should just like to state, for example, that here you have a situation in which Deputy Dockrell a few minutes ago said we should have five-, six-, sevenand nine-seat constituencies.  He saw no reason why we could not have that. He said that larger constituencies were welcome but he did not say they were better than small constituencies.  He saw no reason why that should not be. Yet, in a speech by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, in the Dáil Debates, volume 188 No. 2, of the 12th April, 1961, speaking on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill at column 272 said and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I feel that certain changes could be made which to some extent would improve the allocation of seats in the area adjacent to Dublin and certainly would allow a somewhat more compact area to be made which would facilitate not only Deputies but their constituents. My experience over the years, originally as a Deputy for County Dublin, was that when the county extended around the fringe of the <Col N="1806" /> city, it was extremely difficult for Deputies to keep in contact with their constituents and difficult for constituents to get in touch with Deputies because of the wide area involved.  Similarly, it seems to me the same situation may arise under some of the proposed changes.  It may be that it will be possible on Committee Stage to consider certain changes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says he is in favour of the smaller constituencies.  Anyone can advocate a five-seat constituency for Donegal. Donegal is a big territory to cover and in a three-seat constituency constituents will see much more of their Deputies.  The smaller constituency is much better.</P>
    <P>There are cries about the invasion of constituency boundaries by taking them away and it is said that this is what Fianna Fáil have done to the people of Sligo-Leitrim.  Yet in this particular debate Fine Gael and Labour Deputies do not repeat what they said in earlier debates, which was that county boundaries meant nothing and that they are quite unimportant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you quote that please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly.  I am delighted to do so.  Deputy O'Leary speaking on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill at column 1517, volume 232 of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, originally, and later, the Minister for Local Government, mentioned the great problems involved in changing county boundaries. Who introduced counties into this country?  Is this the national Parliament of this country?  As far as I know, counties are relics of feudalism.  We owe loyalty to this country rather than to any county. We owe loyalty to cities such as Dublin, Belfast and Cork, and to the rural areas: we should not shed tears for county boundaries which were introduced, in the first place, by an English administration.</P>

      <P>On the 15th May, 1968, reported at column 1403 of volume 234 of the Official Report, Deputy Fitzpatrick said:</P>
      <P>I understand that when this matter was before the Courts there was some decision or some suggestion that an effort should be made not to overlap the county boundaries, although in this year, 1968, it is difficult to understand the case which is being made that the county boundaries are sacred at a time when we have members of the Government from the Taoiseach down preaching regionalisation in other spheres;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not enough?  I have got another quote from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is from volume 235, column 145, and the report is for 28th May, 1968:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that county boundaries are sacred and that the counties and constituencies should coincide identically.  I do not think there is anything sacred about county boundaries.  For example, for years back, we have had county managers managing two counties.  We <Col N="1808" /> have had joint county managers in a number of counties.  Practically every police district in this State, consists of two counties joined together.</P>
    <P>Later on, he is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>The day of the old county hospital is done.  A hospital now caters for three or four counties.  Therefore, there is nothing sacred about county boundaries&mdash;there never has been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There was emotionalism in them.  For example, Deputy M. E. Dockrell last week, before progress had been reported, spoke about having to cross the Liffey.  I quote from volume 237, column 1436 of the Official Report for Wednesday last:</P>
      <P>It is not the first time I had to swim in the Liffey but it will only be by accident if I have to swim those turgid waters again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this about having to swim the Liffey was, he said, to get to the other <Col N="1809" /> side of his constituency.  Deputy Dockrell is a member of an old Dublin family who should know Dublin, who should know that he would not have to walk more than 100 yards to find a bridge across the Liffey.  There are five bridges spanning the Liffey within his proposed constituency.  If the Deputy, who is so uninformed, gets in touch with Deputies from Cork or Limerick they will tell him that they have no trouble crossing their bridges there. Again, these are the exaggerations being put out.  At column 1242, volume 237, Deputy Fitzpatrick is reported:</P>
    <P>The result, of course, is gerrymandering. The result is a Bill&mdash;I shall deal later on with the way in which it is gerrymandered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether &ldquo;later&rdquo; meant later on in the Second Stage but nowhere in his speech could I find elaboration of his suggestion that the Bill proposed to gerrymander.  Other Deputies made a stab at it but they did not succeed.  Deputy Fitzpatrick tried to introduce a new word into the Irish language, &ldquo;Bolander&rdquo;.  Boland in Ireland is a far more sacred name to the people of Ireland than the name Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy would say that.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was not in line with the thinking of his Party when he referred to larger constituencies.  Of course, everyone is entitled to his opinion on this but the point here is that, all along, the Opposition have been making a case to try to put across on the people that we would gerrymander.  At column 1250 of the same volume, Deputy Fitzpatrick is quoted:</P>
      <P>The county boundaries mean little or nothing when it comes to the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Minister put 17 pieces of nine counties into other counties,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the time they have been trying to imply that county boundaries mean nothing to us.  They knew that unless the tolerance proposal was carried in the recent referendum, this would <Col N="1810" /> have to happen.  In their hearts they were for it but were afraid that if they said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to one proposal in the referendum and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the other, the people would not understand and might vote for acceptance of the wrong proposal&mdash;the proposal they did not want to be accepted.</P>
    <P>The truth is, of course, that it was we who tried to defend the county boundaries.  They, on the other hand, are engaged in deliberate attempts to mislead the people.  At column 1257 of the same volume, Deputy Treacy, beginning his Second Reading speech of this measure, is reported:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there was widespread astonishment and dismay throughout the country when, a few days after the outcome of the referendum, the Minister announced his intention of revising the constituencies by means of this electoral measure.</P>
    <P>This, again, is an untruth.  Deputy Treacy knew quite well, if he had bothered to read even a quarter of the Minister's speeches, that this Bill had to come&mdash;that before the next general election could be held the constituencies would have to be revised.  This, again, is a deliberate attempt at sham astonishment.  He underestimates the intelligence of our people.  He spoke about the so-called straight vote, the single-seat constituency with gerrymander. All this is gross exaggeration in an attempt to fool the people.  They tell the people: &ldquo;You have turned down proposals and now they have come behind your back with everything that they said would take place if these proposals were passed.&rdquo;  There are many people who argue that it could be done other ways and I have a little quotation about that later on. One Deputy said that Galway needed an injection of Fianna Fáil people so they took off a section of Clare and put it in with Galway to bolster up the Fianna Fáil vote.  On the other hand, you have another member of the Opposition saying: &ldquo;I pity the people of Clare, the county of &lsquo;The Chief&rsquo; himself, ardent supporters of the Party. Their population is being reduced by nearly half, because of their loyalty to <Col N="1811" /> the Party, to bolster up portion of Galway.&rdquo;  In other words we are hurting the people of Clare.  They just want it every way.  Deputy Treacy, referring to the 1961 general election, said that the Government then tried to gerrymander two constituencies.  At column 1265 of volume 237, No. 8, of the Official Report he says:</P>
    <P>You will see that Deputy Kyne was returned at the head of the poll to represent County Waterford and I, a comparatively young man at the time, came into this House for the first time at the head of the poll in my constituency of South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>So what are they complaining about? It is too ridiculous.  Talk about a comedy of errors.  If any member of the public purchased a copy of this Dáil debate&mdash;and he could do so in the Stationery Office&mdash;read it and was really interested to know what is being said in this debate, he would see the inaccuracies.</P>
    <P>They talk about gerrymandering and great play has been made of confusing people over population and votes.  This is being done all the time.  Deputy Seán Dunne, speaking here last week at column 1282 of volume 237, No. 8 stated that they are being discriminated against by the Minister.  He says:</P>
    <P>Dublin constituencies are required in all cases to produce hundreds of votes in respect of every seat in excess of the national average, which is set out at 20,028 votes.</P>
    <P>The Minister interrupted him to say:</P>
    <P>It does not.  The Deputy must not be able to read.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne replied:</P>
    <P>I am reading it here and the Minister can tell me where I am wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is not there.  It is not in that document.</P>
    <P>Eventually the Minister had to tell him that it was population.  Deputy Dunne had said votes.  He did not deny that he said votes.  He was again confusing this question of population and votes. <Col N="1812" /> It is very difficult to explain to people just what is going on here, the deliberate attempts to mislead and to confuse people.  I do not believe that they accidentally slip and say &ldquo;population&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;votes&rdquo;.  It is a deliberate attempt to get people confused.</P>
    <P>With regard to gerrymandering you have Deputy Seán Dunne at column 1284 of the same volume saying:</P>
    <P>I do not see how it is possible today for any Party to say with certainty where their support will lie....</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is stated by Deputy Seán Dunne, an eminent member of the Labour Party.  I did not see that quoted anywhere outside the House but again you have people saying that they know where their support is.  Others admit it is impossible to say, particularly under the system of PR. Again, there is confusion between the multi-seat and the single-seat constituency. With the single seat it is easier to know where your support lies because of the smaller area involved and, therefore, a commission would be the best thing in such a situation.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on what they do in England?  Do they have a commission over there?</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Dunne at column 1342 of this volume said:</P>
      <P>I am not altogether enamoured of all this talk about the sacrosanct nature of county boundaries.  I think they are a relatively modern concept, modern in the historic sense.  I do not suppose they are any more than 250 or 300 years old and they are vague at that.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I believe it was King John in the early 12th century who first introduced boundaries of that nature over here for Deputy Dunne's information.  No doubt he will be able to educate me on other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> who is congratulated by Deputy Donegan later on as having really done a good job and a lot of research. I did a little bit of homework on some of Deputy Hogan's figures.  In <Col N="1813" /> fairness to Deputy Hogan he admits at one stage that one can make mistakes in figures and that he may be wrong in a figure here and there.  I would like to give him a couple of those figures.  At column 1350 he says:</P>
    <P>Admittedly, that type of constituency would be big.  Sligo-Leitrim itself has got 67,000 acres, but my own constituency of South Tipperary-West Waterford has 77,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Sligo-Leitrim has not 67,000 acres but 820,570 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is a couple of thousand acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The South Riding of Tipperary, which is the greater part of Deputy Hogan's area, has 558,034 acres.  Therefore, one can see there is no relevance at all in these figures. They are so inaccurate.  One does not mind five, six, seven, eight, ten, 15 or 20 per cent error but when it is thousands of per cent error it is just ridiculous and contempt for the public is shown in the way certain Deputies prepared their contributions.  Deputy Hogan at column 1360 says:</P>
      <P>The views I have expressed are entirely my own.  Senator Garret FitzGerald expressed his views in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  My views are somewhat different, but the principle is the same.</P>
      <P>I would say to Deputy Hogan he should be a tolerant man and allow also that the Minister's views are different but the principle is also the same with him.</P>
      <P>There was a question about the number of three-seat constituencies.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick said they were all in the west and none in Dublin.  He will correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I did not say that.  I said you had as many four-seaters in Dublin as you could mathematically have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are two three-seaters in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points I wanted to make but before I conclude I would like to ask that this mud-slinging and this slandering of <Col N="1814" /> Fianna Fáil would stop.  Supporters of our Party come up to me and say: &ldquo;Why do you not answer those charges?  I wonder why you do not denounce them?&rdquo;  I said we did.  I pointed out that where they are inaccurate we denounce them, but the point is that many of those people do not read the details of the report in the press where those charges are answered and answered accurately.  The blind appeal to emotionalism is something that does not fool all the people.  It might fool some of them, but not all of them.</P>
    <P>The Opposition like to say that there was a majority of 276,000 votes against the proposals which we put before the people.  We make no apology for putting those proposals before the people.  We still feel they were the right proposals to put to the people irrespective of their free right to decline to accept them.  I hope somebody like Deputy McLaughlin, when he goes back to Leitrim, will explain to the people of that county that it was his own Party as much as any other Party who were responsible for the boundaries of Leitrim not being regarded in the re-drawing of the constituencies. I do not expect he will do this but I do not think either the people of Leitrim are such fools that they will not be aware that any tears now being shed by Fine Gael or Labour for the boundaries are purely crocodile tears.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe used whatever talents he has fairly well.  The only thing about his speech is that he complained that the people do not read what Fianna Fáil say in this House.  You know I do not blame them for not doing so because they have been saying such a lot of stupid nonsense over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are fed up hearing this sort of thing trotted out again and again.  Some of what Deputy Briscoe said was fair comment but some of it was just waffling, filling up and using up time.  I do not know whether the statement by a Fine Gael Deputy as to the size of two constituencies has any bearing or not on the discussion we have here today.  That is a matter for Deputy Briscoe.  Personally, <Col N="1815" /> I do not think it matters a damn one way or the other.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe also said that a lot of Fianna Fáil Deputies were unhappy with the dividing up of the country at the present time under the new constituencies. Of course they were unhappy, but who are they to blame? They have to blame themselves and their cumainn throughout the country. One thing I cannot understand is the stupidity of the Fianna Fáil Deputies themselves who &ldquo;traipsed&rdquo; in and out of the Minister's office telling him to take a little bit off here, a little bit off there, telling him where the strength was and where the strength was not. However, in their efforts to improve the Party they forgot something they have never forgotten in their lives before&mdash;they forgot themselves.  The most selfish group of people who ever represented any Party in this House suddenly found they made a mistake, that they had forgotten themselves and found they had left a number of themselves out in the cold.</P>
      <P>It is really extraordinary when one gets down to look at the way this matter was worked out.  Take, for instance, during the debate on the referendum here in this House when the Minister&mdash;I am sure he will not deny this&mdash;threatened, although maybe that is not the correct word to use, me with what would happen in my own constituency, the one I represent now, if the referendum went against the Government.  He said that perhaps I would find portion of the constituency I represent with Louth and perhaps I would find portion of it with County Dublin.  The General Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party even wrote to my local paper and referred to the fact that I seemed terribly anxious that the Minister would put my area in with Louth and referred to the fact that the rest of the county would be left to the tender mercies of the Minister for Defence and Deputy Farrelly</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time I challenged the Minister in this House to put my area in with Louth or in with Dublin.  As a matter of fact, I particularly wanted him to put me in with Dublin.  I said then, and I repeat it here now, that if <Col N="1816" /> he put me in with County Dublin where he is a representative himself he would not get things as cushy as he is getting them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne does things in a certain way and he is able to get an awful lot of votes but he does not do them in the way I would if I went in with the Minister. That is something the Minister should take into account.  The Minister should leave me alone without interrupting and when he comes to reply he can speak for as long as he wants. He spoke for 6 hours and 55 minutes in the Seanad and he can do that again if he wishes because he has the right. Let him listen to me now and if he does not want to listen he has his remedy.  He suggested he was going to divide the constituencies.  He said that cutting up constituencies would cause terrible things to happen.  He kept repeating this again and again. He kept saying that terrible things would happen in my constituency and his General Secretary wrote to my local paper, not one letter but two letters, threatening that I was going to desert them, go off into County Dublin and leave them to the tender mercies of the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>The Minister's local advisers must have told him that all he had to do in that portion of the country was to put portion of County Meath into Louth and make it a four-seater or to put Drogheda into Meath where the boundary of the Boyne is already in Louth and make it a four-seater.  If they did not do that and left it as it was, what would happen?  Monaghan and Cavan would have to go together as a five-seater.  That did not suit the Minister because the probable loss there would become a certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Minister do?  He divides Meath in three ways.  He slices off portion of North Meath, my own area, in which I was born and reared and puts a half circle around the village I was born in just in case there were supporters who would be inclined to vote for me and proceeds to slice off what he considers to be an area which <Col N="1817" /> would be pretty useful to the Labour Party and he continues on through Deputy Farrelly's home town and nearly cuts off the toes off his boots in doing so.  He puts that portion into County Monaghan.  He then continues to slice off another portion of North County Meath with two small exceptions and puts it in with County Cavan.  Supposing by any stretch of the imagination the same results come after the next election and that we have the same returns for the County Monaghan constituency, what happens? Somebody in North Meath who wants to see a Deputy will either have to go down to Monaghan town to see Deputy Mooney, to Ballaghaderreen where Deputy Dillon resides or to Highfield Road, Dublin, to see Deputy Erskine Childers.  Maybe the Minister does not see anything wrong with this because it has become practice in his Party, particularly among Ministers, as soon as they get nice and secure, to feel that the only place to live is in Dublin.  I suppose I cannot blame the Ministers or the Fianna Fáil Party.  I blame it on the stupidity of the people who continue to support them.  Once they get into the big House they have no more use for them; they want to move away and to be as inaccessible to them as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe talked here about the breaking of county boundaries.  I do not care what any Member of the House says, I have a personal view on this.  I believe that county boundaries are important just as I believe that the national boundary is important and I would not agree that somebody who lives in County Meath would be happy being attached to another county any more than I agree with the suggestion which was made here by a former Taoiseach that we should join the EEC, and by the present Taoiseach, that we were prepared to accept everything that was laid down there, which would include giving up our national sovereignty, if necessary.  I do not agree that that is right.  I do not agree, therefore, that county boundaries should be sundered.  The Minister has a sin to answer for.  He did one good thing.  He gave portion of South Meath which was tied to County Kildare back to Meath.</P>
    <P>Just to show how vioious he was, he <Col N="1818" /> took portion of Kildare right down as far as Lullymore and put it into County Meath, the object being quite plain to anybody who wants to see.  It is not because he was interested in levelling off the numbers but because one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies lives in an area there and, as there are only three seats in Kildare instead of four, he is anxious to provide a seat for him in Meath. Good luck to him if he can win it.  If he wins it, he will have to work very hard.  Even the portion which the Minister has so kindly presented to him as a going away present from the Kildare constituency will be very little use to him at the time the next election comes.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, what the Minister and his Party were after when they started to gerrymander&mdash;it is the only word I can think of&mdash;the constituencies was that, if they could arrange things in such a way that they would get at the weak Opposition Deputy in the constituency, they might win two out of three seats, which is what they have been doing for many years.  That is the whole idea behind the present breaking up of constituencies.  The Minister should admit that this is what they meant to do and that this is what they have done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred here to the fact that Deputy Kyne and Deputy Treacy had nothing to complain about as their constituencies were not interfered with.  Of course, their constituencies were not interfered with.  This is one of two peculiar things which many people looking at the whole pattern realised a long time ago.  If the voters consider that an outgoing Deputy is being badly handled by the Government, being ill-treated, that the carving up of the constituency is done for the purpose of unseating him, the reaction of the voters, no matter for whom they had been voting previously, is to give a very large vote to that individual. This has happened, as everybody knows, in Deputy Tom Kyne's case.  Deputy Kyne is one of the best Deputies who ever came into this House.  This was realised and the effort by the Fianna Fáil Government to unseat him failed because the voters were determined not to allow it to happen and, therefore, gave him a very big vote which put him at the head of the <Col N="1819" /> poll.  Similarly, in the case of Deputy Treacy, who is also an excellent Deputy, it was quite clear that the Fianna Fáil Party felt that he had not a chance of being elected.  They have got their answer.  The people put him at the head of the poll.  That is one of the things Fianna Fáil have overlooked in the present carve-up.  I am quite sure that after the next general election the Government will realise, not for the first time, that they have misjudged the electorate and have walked into something that they cannot get out of easily.</P>
    <P>I know that it is not proper to go into details about the result of the referendum on this occasion but I should like to point out that anybody who suggests that if the single seat proposal had been carried there would have been no disturbance of county boundaries must not know the facts. The single seat would mean that Meath, for instance, must be carved up three ways.  Knowing what the Government had done on a previous occasion, when they wanted to straighten out the boundaries to suit themselves, and what they have done or are attempting to do under this Bill, I am perfectly satisfied that, if the Government proposal had been carried and if the Government had succeeded in getting away with the single seat constituencies, they would almost certainly have breached the county boundaries as they have done now in Meath in three seats but would also have breached the county boundaries all round because it is not possible to have the exact number required in any constituency.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here again and again, both during this and previous discussions, to the High Court action.  Would the Minister care to explain when he is replying why if he, as he says, considered the High Court action had created an impossible position, the Government did not do something about it before now?  Why did the Government not try to get legislation through this House to remedy the position or, if that could not be done, why did they not include it in the referendum in such a way that it would <Col N="1820" /> be acceptable to the people, and not try the gerrymander, a cute sort of thing which he thought would be carried because, according to Fianna Fáil, the people were thinking only of one side?  Deputy Briscoe seems to have overlooked this fact: the people were not codded.  The people knew what they were voting for.  They knew what Fianna Fáil were trying to do.  The people made sure that there would be no doubt about the result.  Deputy Briscoe presented us with an extra 40,000 votes.  Thanks very much.  They were no use to us.  We won by 230,000 odd.  But then, Deputy Briscoe does get rather mixed up.</P>

      <P>The plain people of this country are the people who won.  They gave their answer.  The two Opposition Parties campaigned against the proposal.  Numerous bodies outside the House who believe in democracy campaigned against it.  Democracy won.  That is something which might come rather hard on the Deputy who is interrupting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right through the debate which took place prior to the referendum we had, as I said earlier, a suggestion by the Minister that the people should vote for the Government proposals &ldquo;or else&rdquo;.  Following the result the Minister sat in the front bench of Fianna Fáil and, as the old saying goes, he had not a word to throw to a cat.  It was nearly impossible to get him to answer questions.  He had his head down.  He was glum.  Everybody knew that there was one thing at the back of his mind: &ldquo;These people have beaten me and I am going to punish them.&rdquo;  Now he is trying to punish the voters because of what they did to him in the referendum and his punishment is being meted out in the most sadistic way.  He is arranging to have areas throughout the country broken up so that&mdash;as he himself said he wants to prove himself right&mdash; the transferable vote will result in <Col N="1821" /> people having to go a very long way to see a Deputy.  Let me repeat that no matter how far you have to go you will not have to go as far as you have to go to see some of the Fianna Fáil Ministers if they represent your constituency down at the end of the country.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill has gone its weary way through Dáil Éireann and since we are, according to the Taoiseach, on the eve of a general election, I would hope that a little bit of common sense might seep through to the Minister and that before he puts the Bill through its final stages he might consider there are a number of ways in which he can undo the things he started to do; there are a number of ways in which, having had time to settle down, possibly not the 90 days waiting period we hear of in other places, but a considerable waiting period in which to simmer down, he may realise what he is doing is no credit to him.  It was said here this morning, and I agree, that the name of Boland is one which deserves honour in this country.  The way in which the name Boland will be considered after this Bill is carried through will certainly not reflect any credit on it.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gave an opportunity to the Minister to overcome certain shortcomings which were in the legislation for a number of years in regard to election to this House.  I am amazed that the Minister did not include any of those proposals, despite the fact that the title of the Bill gave that right to the Minister.  He decided to deal only with the constituency boundaries and nothing else.  I would suggest that the Minister might, even at this late stage&mdash;and there will be amendments from the Labour Party on these points coming before the House&mdash; consider the age of voting.  This could have been put before the country in a referendum.  The Minister did not include it, but he should at least express an opinion on reducing the voting age to 18 and perhaps we can suggest this is one referendum he could carry if he put it to the country.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the system of the compilation of the Register of Electors is a national scandal.  In election after election one goes to a polling booth and <Col N="1822" /> finds that not alone all the people over 21 on 14th April are not included but many people who were on the polling register since they were 21 years of age some of whom have reached the 60's and 70's find for some extraordinary reason their names have been left off. Do not tell me they have the right to look up the list in the local post office to ensure their names are included. That is all cod.  A few people who are interested in politics between elections may go to the local post office, but most people are too interested in looking after their own affairs to bother about these things.  It is too big a job for anybody except those who are paid to do it, to bring the Register of Electors up to date.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council are setting up a franchise section.  I do not care what they call it or what the Minister calls it, but under the present system, people&mdash;rate collectors in the country districts and other people who are given the job in the city&mdash;go around or are supposed to go around to find out who should be on the Register of Electors. They go to one house and inquire there who is in the area and make up a list from that rather than go around to each house as they should do.  This is wrong. It is also wrong that in a house where there are half a dozen flats a number of cards should be left in the hall, the intention being that somebody will pick them up and have them filled in and sent back so that the list can be made up.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for voting itself must be changed.  We still have the same arrangements where somebody living beside one village may have to travel through that village and four or five miles to the next one in order to vote, because the townlands were registered in a certain way long ago and have not been changed over.  The Minister must seriously consider the question of extending the postal vote.  It is unfair that so many of our citizens who are entitled to vote are not allowed to vote because their job or other reasons keep them away from home when the voting takes place.  While I know it is not an easy matter, the Minister must look into it and do something about it.  The Minister must also seriously consider the <Col N="1823" /> question of having the elections held on Sundays.  There may be a religious objection to this; I do not know, but I am quite sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will be coming up on the Committee Stage. I have covered most of the points I wish to raise.  I thank the Chair, if he felt that way, for allowing me to raise them.  As I said at the start, the Bill is a vindictive one.  It is being introduced by the Minister for the purpose of getting his own back, literally, on the people he feels showed him up during the recent referendum.  The Taoiseach has said again and again it was not a political matter: &ldquo;We put the matter to the country.  The country decided, and we accept their decision.&rdquo;  That does not appear to be the attitude of the Minister for Local Government.  His attitude is: &ldquo;We put the matter to the country.  They have voted against us and, therefore, we are going to punish them for not doing what we wanted them to do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that the only way in which the constituencies can be drawn up is the way in which the Minister has drawn them up is too ridiculous for words.  I have already pointed out at the start of my speech that with a very simple adjustment the Minister could have put four seats in County Louth, three in County Meath, five in Monaghan and Cavan; or he could have put four seats in County Meath, three in County Louth and five in Monaghan and Cavan.  Instead of that he decided to slice off two parts of Louth, put them into Monaghan, and make Monaghan a three-seater, Louth a three-seater, Cavan a three-seater and Meath a three-seater.  He has sliced off considerable parts of Meath and put them in with Monaghan and Cavan.  I think this is vindictive because of the area which he took away. <Col N="1825" /> He took away the area where I was born and reared.  He did that because he felt it was an area in which I would get, and did get, a lot of support.</P>
    <P>No matter what way the Minister twists it around or breaks up the constituencies and uses the weight of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, it will be all the same.  Deputy Ben Briscoe talks about the unhappy members of Fianna Fáil, those who are unhappy at the decision of the Minister for Local Government and who do not like the breaking up of the constituencies.  In all their unhappiness they will troop into the Division Lobby to vote for the changes in the constituencies.  I can assure the Minister that, despite the efforts they are making to have the Labour Party wiped out, when the next election is over, gerrymander or no gerrymander, he is going to have back in this House a stronger Labour Party, and we will deal with his successor, because I know quite well he will not be there to make an effort to do this sort of thing again.  I will tell him something else, that if Labour have anything to do with the next Government&mdash;and Labour intend to put enough candidates in the field to be the next Government&mdash;one of the first things they will do is review all the constituencies and remedy the situation that the Minister has brought about in his famous carve-up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amused to hear Deputy Briscoe's approach to this.  He went to great pains and did a lot of research to find quotations from this side of the House, which he took out of context, to support the case he was making.  It was quite evident he was approaching this matter and the terms of this Bill in the same manner as he and members of his Party always approach such matters, with a blind political loyalty to the belief that Fianna Fáil can do nothing wrong. Deputy Briscoe went to great pains to criticise Deputy Pat Hogan because he had the courage to suggest to the Minister that there was a more scientific approach.  It is right to quote, despite what Deputy Briscoe said in criticism of Deputy Hogan, what is contained at column 1364 of volume 237 of the Official Report.  It is a tribute from one <Col N="1826" /> of Deputy Briscoe's colleagues, Deputy Fahey, to Deputy Hogan.  He said:</P>
      <P>I had no intention of contributing to the debate until I heard my colleague, Deputy Hogan.  I want to say this much for Deputy Hogan over and above the other speakers I heard on the Opposition Benches.  At least he has the courage to make suggestions as to where the divisions should take place in the constituencies in order that the requirements of the Constitution, as laid down by the High Court in 1961, may be complied with.  He also had the courage to make those suggestions during the referendum debate here in June.  On that occasion he suggested putting West Waterford in with Cork...</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe seems to underestimate the intelligence of the people when he said that, if they had an opportunity &mdash;which they have if they avail of it&mdash; of providing themselves with copies of the Dáil debates and reading some of the speeches made here by the Opposition, they would immediately know they were in favour of those suggestions. It is extraordinary now that it is necessary to give more seats to Dublin because we have not the population in the rural areas.  It is extraordinary how everything comes to life.</P>
      <P>I believe it was Deputy Briscoe's father who said in 1932: &ldquo;I am happy to think that as things are working out now we shall not have so many persons migrating to the city.  The Government is going to look after the whole country and not a section or part of the country.&rdquo;  I need hardly remind the House that we are now in 1968 and that the country was so well looked after by Fianna Fáil that the rural areas are now losing four seats to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the result of the policy which has been pursued over years of denuding the rural areas of their population because they did not get an opportunity of making a decent living.  The primary purpose of the Bill should be to revise the constituencies in the light of the 1966 Census which is legally necessary, but it is now emerging that that is not the real purpose of the Bill.  We can say in connection with it that Fianna <Col N="1827" /> Fáil are taking every opportunity to preserve their interests and ensure that their own representatives will be reinstated after the next election.  It is quite apparent that this approach is as a result of a plan that was not prepared overnight but was in readiness so that if the referendum was defeated there would be a way of putting it before the people and ensuring that the Government would be entrenched in office.</P>
    <P>That is actually what will happen. Deputy Briscoe could not understand gerrymandering in the sense that it was done by Fianna Fáil but he referred to and I think he quoted my own Leader, Deputy Cosgrave, in reference to gerrymandering some years ago. However, the people in no uncertain terms told the Fianna Fáil Government what they thought of their recent suggestion to change our voting system and have single-seat constituencies, which they maintained will be more workable and will give better results to the people.  In the terms of this Bill, however, they are going as far as possible from the principle of PR.  It is now suggested that we shall have 26 three-seat constituencies, as against 17 at present, and 14 four-seaters, as against 12 at present, and only two five-seaters as against nine at present. It is well known that PR works more successfully in the larger constituencies. The idea of three-seat constituencies is impossible and with the gerrymandering we would have two-to-one; but, of course, the people have yet to express an opinion on that and the other suggested changes.  They will be given an opportunity to do this in the next election, whether this will be in the near future or not.</P>
    <P>However, it is quite evident that Fianna Fáil want to get away as far as possible from the full operations of PR and it would seem that they are going along that channel without considering the views of the people.  The lesson learned by them in the referendum does not seem to have been enough.  The people are thinking for themselves and, indeed, they did this in no uncertain manner in the referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> Alternative suggestions have been made here in the House as to how this matter could be approached in a different manner and not in a political manner.  At the moment, the Bill suggests the wholesale breaking and breaching of county boundaries and also electoral boundaries and, in the process, we have lost one county.  In wartime, we would refer to people on the road as refugees but the people of Leitrim, to my mind, are political refugees.  They are on the road.  They have lost their county, despite all the talk that we hear in the Republic about getting back the North-Eastern Counties.  Fianna Fáil have got rid of one county because the retention of it would not suit the aims and fortunes of that Party.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and approach this matter in a realistic way, in the way that the people of the country would approach it.  I am quite sure that the electors will be frustrated when this is presented after the Bill has been passed.  Then, they will really know where they stand.  They will realise that, despite the lip service that it is for the good of the people, it is for the betterment and future preservation of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, November 19th, which gives the Government's plan in detail.  It shows the displacement of something like 100,000 people and the breaching of 19 boundaries&mdash;this figure is subject to correction.  Side by side with that is an alternative put forward by a Senator&mdash;Senator Garret FitzGerald&mdash;who maintains that, while it is necessary and imperative to revise constituency boundaries, it is not necessary, in his opinion, to displace all those people. He maintains that it could be done by displacing fewer than 40,000 people but, despite that, the Government have emphasised the fact that theirs is the only way, in their opinion, that this change could be successfully brought about.  This is correct only in so far as the preservation of the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned.  This is gerrymandering in a big way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> gave the history of gerrymandering and said that now, for the first time, we had &ldquo;Bolandering&rdquo;.  This is a new word, but very appropriate.  We know very well the Government are trying to halt the decline in their dwindling forces brought to light in the referendum. They cannot deny the facts.  It is there in black and white, that, from the 1965 general election to the referendum, their voting support has been reduced by 175,000.  That, in itself, is an indication that the people feel it is high time to have a change of Government. The sooner we have an election the sooner Fianna Fáil will get their answer.</P>
    <P>As regards the breaching of county boundaries, I must again refer to what Deputy Briscoe said.  He gave us much information but he was taking refuge in the fact that it was necessary to introduce this measure in view of the High Court decision in 1960.  He wants to attribute the suggested changes here to what the court ruled, which of course is not sensible.  This Bill is what Fianna Fáil desire, what they want and what they will get because they have the majority to put it through.  With regard to county boundaries Deputy Briscoe made great play of the fact that Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick and other Deputies on this side of the House had not that great an objection to the intermingling of county borders.  He did not say that Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick and my colleagues on this side of the House were definitely opposed to the breaching here and there of county boundaries.  We know well that in regionalisation we can walk over county boundaries but the Deputy did not say that we were opposed to and considered it unnecessary that electoral boundaries should be breached here, there and everywhere.  Looking at the suggested boundary changes one is reminded in certain cases, such as in my own constituency and the Leitrim boundaries, of a game of chequers. Someone said we will move this a bit in; someone else said we will bring out this bit&mdash;in here and out below.  Consequently, I have no doubt in the world that there are personal influences at work in the setting up of boundaries.</P>
    <P>However, I am not complaining <Col N="1830" /> about my constituency.  I will let the people answer and I am happy to await their verdict.  The Fianna Fáil Party cannot get away from the fact that a lot of this exercise is unwarranted and unnecessary and that there will be general resentment in the country. When the people get an opportunity of exercising the franchise at the next general election they will exercise their vote in no uncertain terms.  They did so in the recent referendum in spite of what they were told&mdash;that they would never see a poor day if we had the single seat.  God help us, we know what would have happened in that event. Now that the Fianna Fáil Party have been defeated they are taking their revenge on the people.  They have learned that the people are now thinking for themselves in a mature way.  That is good for the country.  We are clear on the facts here in the House.  The people are not blind either and they will do what they think is best for them and not for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying, Sir, that the people will resent this measure and will in no uncertain terms give their answer when the opportunity arises.  Be it sooner or later, we will have a Fine Gael Government in consequence of this suggested gerrymandering and the recent defeat in the referendum.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy for the Minister for Local Government.  He has a very difficult job.  He was faced with the task, according to the law, of dividing up the constituencies.  I should like to find one man who wants to lose friends.  I have represented County Dublin for some time and I am about to lose a number of good friends in an area in which I usually got a reasonably good vote, according to what those who usually attend the counts say.  We all have to put up with that.  I do not like this word &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo;. The Minister had to introduce this Bill, whether it reacts against his own Party or against the Opposition.  He had a job to do and he had to consider it carefully.  He had no chance of doing what he wanted to do, to save the county boundaries.  The people of Ireland answered that question.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to the Opposition speakers.  It is nice of them to make observations; that is democracy in action.  We accept all these things but we have to be just as far as the Minister is concerned.  He is, even in his own case, taking in an area in which he got 70 per cent of his votes when he was elected.</P>

      <P>I do not want to dwell on all the Opposition have stated on this subject.  I shall just say that the Minister has succeeded in doing a very good job.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick very well knows, I am not in the habit of repeating myself but, if Saint Peter himself was there and if Deputy Fitzpatrick was there, they would not succeed in pleasing everybody in this House. While we are all losing friends, we hope to make a few new friends.  When this Bill goes through, we must all take to the high road to see if we can make a few new friends to compensate for all the good old friends we have lost.  During my time in this House, this is the third occasion my constituency has been changed.  I do not think I shall survive this time.  However, I shall try.  I wish the Minister luck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we have to be realists if we are to be politicians. There is no doubt at all about what the real nomenclature of this Bill should be.  It is a tremendous effort to try to save waning support for the Government Party.  I am going&mdash;in a very erudite way, I hope&mdash;to illustrate quite clearly the esoteric limits to which the Minister for Local Government has gone in the changes he has made.  It is nice to find a kind of avuncular episcopalian episcopus&mdash;Deputy P.J. Burke&mdash;graciously embracing what is to come and, with a kind of benevolent sympathy, saying farewell to what is gone.</P>
      <P>When we look at what has been done to South-West Cork we really can get the guideline of the purpose and the real issue in this Bill because, not only has the Minister succeeded in breaking up county boundaries in my constituency but he has made mincemeat of parishes and for one purpose only, namely, to try to get in a few little strong pockets&mdash;some of them will help Deputy Meaney&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Meaney's colleague will tell him they will.  But, if <Col N="1834" /> you take a view of my constituency objectively, you will find that half of Castletownbere has gone to Kerry.  I should be very sorry to lose part of Beara.  They are some of the finest people this country has produced.  They are a tremendously hard-working, decent people.  Kerry is to represent some 3,000 or 4,000 of them.  South-West Cork will represent the Beara town itself, down the road into Glengarriff. But, lo and behold, as soon as we get to Glengarriff they take Comhola off us and put that off into mid-Cork and the rest of the parish of Bantry stays in South-West Cork.  Then we come up to Keimaneigh and the old traditional parts of Gougane Barra, Inchigeela and Ballingeary&mdash;all lopped off.  Then we come back into the Macroom area where some most amazing gymnastics have been performed in the transfer lists.  We swing around areas and intermix them with other areas and we have some in mid-Cork and the other half of the parish in Cork South-West.  There is only one feasible explanation for the whole thing: it is a deliberate, positive and calculated effort to try to make two Fianna Fáil quotas in mid-Cork.</P>
      <P>I am not, like Deputy Burke, afraid I shall not come back to this House in the new constituency.  The person who is going to beat me in my new constituency will have to do it the hard way. He will have to do it before the public, on merit.  While I know that I shall gather many friends in the Bandon-Kinsale area, it does not in any way prevent me from making an effective protest, I hope, against what can only be described as deliberate gerrymandering at one end of my constituency. It is not even gerrymandering; it is the subdividing of parishes even and the splitting of areas in a wholly farcical way for the sole purpose of trying to hold the mid-Cork constituency together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give fair warning to the Government, just as I gave fair warning to the Government on the referendum: the Government are making one hell of a mistake.  The Irish people can think for themselves.  They have learned the value of PR.  They understand the purpose and the strength of the system.  The last time Fianna Fáil revised <Col N="1835" /> the constituencies the revision boomeranged.  If we could get Fianna Fáil to the country quick enough the boomerang this time might be even more catastrophic.  People do not like being pushed around.  They dislike lame excuses: &ldquo;I am doing my best not to breach county boundaries, but I have to do it in accordance with the decision of the court.&rdquo;  That is utter nonsense.  The design is quite simple. The rigging is quite obvious.  Where four-and five-seat constituencies would have met the situation they were not considered at all because the Government were not sure of the outcome and so the Minister deliberately seeks to reduce the effectiveness of PR by making a great number of three-seat constituencies.  Under proportional representation, small groups anxious for representation, are likely to get more effective representation in bigger constituencies and the three-seat constituency is designed to save a few seats for the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have had a long innings and, as the sands of time run out, it is inevitable, I suppose, that they should make an effort to bolster up their own shaky situation.  They suffered a tremendous reverse in the referendum under which they sought to give themselves such dictatorial powers as had never been experienced in this country heretofore.  They have learned a salutary lesson and they are now wondering whether they should have a general election immediately after this Bill is passed, whether they should try to weather the by-elections or whether they should wait until next October or November in the hope that they may be able to solve some of their difficulties in the meantime.  It is somewhat unreal to find ourselves here discussing a Bill like this and, if the Government had any self-respect they would go to the country immediately and get their answer there effectively. They would not be playing with parliamentary time.  Our economy and even our sovereignty is in danger.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Per se</i>, this is a bad Bill.  It has been conceived in hatred.  It is designed for the purpose of taking revenge on the people because they had the courage to <Col N="1836" /> say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The arrogance and powerlust of the Government had become so apparent to everybody throughout the length and breadth of this State that the people had no option except to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  This Bill is, as I say, revenge. It is designed to force the people to keep Fianna Fáil in power.  But it will not work.  My only regret is that we have not got some effective machinery to compel the Government to go back and face the jury of the people instead of sitting here creating anomalies all over the country, anomalies which may affect the people's confidence in democracy. While some may think that it is of no consequence to have political Parties wiped out, I think there is a very sinister significance in any such attempt.</P>
    <P>There have been many traditional links between Leitrim and Sligo and Leitrim and Roscommon.  The only reason why Leitrim is being eliminated is that Fianna Fáil Deputies want to ensure that the constituencies carved out of the defunct Leitrim will return a majority of Government candidates in the next election.  This is a deliberate effort and it is founded on the fact that the Leitrim people have always had the courage to take a certain view.  It has been suggested that the Minister was forced into a situation in which he had to do all this because of a court decision.  That is twiddle and twaddle, because on the basis of preserving the boundaries, the alternative was open to the Minister of creating five-seat and four-seat constituencies where necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to give the maximum possible return to the Government on a rapidly diminishing vote.  That is particularly true in relation to the western seaboard and the south-western areas.  We have had this myth, all this codology and all this propaganda spewing out year after year about saving the west, and about what they would do for the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and the constituencies of the west.  The myth has dissolved and we see before us the evidence of complete failure.  The Government are trying to deny those areas proper constituencies to save a seat or two to keep them in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> This is a bad Bill.  It could not be a good Bill because it is wrongly conceived. Certainly it is Party designed. We have had naïve gestures from Fianna Fáil Deputies saying: &ldquo;The poor Minister.  If he were St. Peter he could not please everyone.&rdquo;  One thing is certain.  He has to listen to Deputies. They had their say.  They brought in their little tally books showing how the vote went in the different polling booths and they said: &ldquo;Minister, throw out that bit.  It is all Fine Gael.  Stick that bit in where Fine Gael will get the seat anyway and give me this bit.&rdquo;  That is the whole design of the Bill and that is why I can talk about my constituency so effectively.  I have told the House about my constituency.  I told the House the peninsula of Beara has been cut in two and half of it is now in Kerry and the other half in Cork.</P>
    <P>There was no difficulty in connection with South-West Cork and mid-Cork if the Minister wanted to see straight when formulating this Bill.  There were about 5,500 surplus votes in mid-Cork and there were 6,000 votes short in South-West Cork, and a simple adjustment of part of the area in the Macroom district would have put the situation right.  They chopped off a lump of Berehaven and put it in South Kerry and they re-arranged the mid-Cork constituency completely.  They took Bandon and Kinsale out of mid-Cork. Naturally the people resent this constant switching of areas.  Fortunately for myself I am fairly well known in the Bandon-Kinsale area and I will make a good fight there to maintain and consolidate our vote.  To my mind there is something sinister and something fundamentally evil in cheeseparing on one side of a constituency and chopping and switching on the other side.  This has gone on in the South-West Cork constituency.  This can be traced back to the fact that we have always been proud, independent, freethinking and level-headed people in that area.  No matter what kind of constituency is made of South-West Cork, Fianna Fáil will not get Fine Gael out of it.  So long as I am young enough and strong enough to continue, they will not get me out of it.</P>
    <P>We have to read this Bill in globo. <Col N="1838" /> If we are to do our job as Parliamentarians we must tell the people of the nature of this enactment.  It will be steamrolled through the House without reference to anyone's wishes save those of the backroom boys of the Government Party who are designing the constituencies for one purpose only, that is, the continuation and attempted consolidation of the Government in office. That is a shabby kind of trick.  It is well within the ken of the Fianna Fáil Party. It is necessary for us, as we did on the referendum proposals, to spell out the background, to elucidate the issues, and let the people know that there is no merit in this type of gerrymandering practice which becomes more noxious when we view the situation in the Six Counties.  We are trying to alert the Irish people to the fact that the Government are attempting by statute, by constituency hopping and switching, to maintain power for themselves to which they are not entitled and of which they are certainly not worthy.</P>
    <P>I could talk for many hours on this Bill but I do not intend to do so.  I have made it quite clear why the chopping has been done on my constituency.  I have been down in the areas where the axe is falling and I have left them under no illusion as to the Government's purpose.  I have alerted the people generally to the fact that this Bill is a follow-up to the nose bleed which Fianna Fáil suffered, an effort to retrieve something from the catastrophic slap in the face the Irish people gave them in the referendum.  It is another miserable dying effort by an atrophied, decaying and semi-defunct Government to keep themselves in an office of which they are unworthy and from which the people would cheerfully evict them if given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Get this Bill through as quickly as you like with your steamroller but, for heaven's sake, be men enough to give the people of Ireland the opportunity of giving you, in the ballot box, the answer that this country badly wants to put it back into a position of confidence, growing hope and proper government.  Push it through as quickly as you like, but give us the general election immediately after it.</P>

      <P>It is very evident that many Deputies are inclined to view this matter from a very narrow angle.  If we look at it from the all-over point of view we will all agree that, no matter who brought in this Bill or who is in power, everybody could not be satisfied. That is definite.  It is quite evident that there are Deputies from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour who are better placed than they were after the last change.  There are others who are not so well placed, but that is the way it is going to be so long as we have to fulfil the present law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that this Bill is brought in for gerrymandering purposes. Of course, I do not agree with that at all.  I have listened to Fine Gael Deputies from my own county talking about gerrymandering.  When they are in Cork they state to their own people how happy they are; they say that they are likely to gain a seat in Cork county. I was amazed at Deputy Fitzpatrick referring several times to the Minister for Local Government and his qualifications for bringing in this Bill.  As a matter of fact, he seemed to be harping a lot on this point.  He also seems to be harping on the point of whether he should not have done this on account of the Government losing the referendum. Everybody knows at this stage that the referendum proposals were put to the people in a democratic manner. The people were asked to vote on the proposals and they gave their decision. They gave the decision that they were anxious to retain PR.  I would like to remind Deputy Fitzpatrick once again that it was only by a very small majority his own Party were not looking to change PR.  His Leader was in favour of change.  A number of other Fine Gael Front-benchers were in favour of change.  There was also a large group of his Party members in favour of change.  When he tries to say that the Deputies on this side of the House introduced the referendum he should look at his own side and see how they lost out on that process.  He talks of the qualifications of the Minister for Local Government to bring in this Bill.  The Minister is a straightforward man.  He is a Republican and the son of a Republican.  The only worry Fine Gael and the Opposition <Col N="1840" /> have is when he makes them feel the pinch, when he is a director at a general election or by-election.  He is well qualified to be a Minister and the Party has complete faith in him.  Long may he be a Minister in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  It has been said that the Fianna Fáil Cabinet put Leitrim off the map.  Why did Leitrim lose representation? If our proposals in the referendum were adopted Leitrim would be sending back a representative to the Dáil, but they were not adopted. Those speakers from the opposite side sent out propaganda one way or another and brought in different issues. The result is that one county has now completely lost out.  If our proposal of one-seat constituency, &ldquo;one-man onevote&rdquo; was adopted you would have a representative from Leitrim coming back to the next Dáil, regardless of his Party affiliations.  I know that the Opposition will state that we tried to do away with a county.  I have given you the facts which are that, if our proposals had been adopted, Leitrim would definitely have a representative in the next Dáil.</P>
    <P>We hear much discussion about the carving up of county boundaries.  We have a record of a Labour Party speaker who said that it was really a case of loyalty to the country and not to the county.  We have also a Fine Gael speaker who stated during the referendum that county boundaries did not matter.  However, now when the Minister has to make out his areas and to cross county boundaries, they are all talking about it.</P>
    <P>All this is to the disadvantage of the rural areas.  We are all very well aware that this country is getting Dublinheavy. Dublin is over-represented.  It does not take as many votes in Dublin to be elected a Deputy as it does in rural areas.  Certain proposals were brought in which would save the rural constituencies, but they were turned down.  We will now lose a number of seats on the western seaboard to Dublin city.  That is to the disadvantage of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers try to blame the Fianna Fáil Government for people leaving the land.  They do not wish to look at the fact that all the world over <Col N="1841" /> in Great Britain, in the Continent of Europe and in the USA people are leaving the rural areas and going into cities.  This is part of the cycle we are going through and is something that is very hard to stop.  One cannot stop young people leaving rural areas if they wish to and going to live in a city where they have more amenities and social life.  This is a world-wide problem which is not really confined to this country.  Already in this debate I have noticed some contradictions.  Even within the Labour Party I noticed Deputy Treacy bemoans the fact that Dublin has got many four-seater constituencies. I quote column 1262 of Wednesday, 27th November, 1968:</P>
    <P>They purposely chose four seats as the best means of securing the greatest possible number of Deputies in the Dublin area.  These four-seat constituencies in Dublin then are designed to neutralise in very large measure the losses expected by the Government Party in Dublin in the next general election.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer Deputy Treacy to a Labour Party Convention at Ennis on Sunday, 1st December, 1968.  Mr. Barry Desmond, Chairman of the Labour Party, presided at the Convention and I quote the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Monday 2nd December:</P>
    <P>Grave dissatisfaction was expressed by delegates at the mutilation of Clare under the new Electoral Act and it was agreed to stage public demonstrations against the &ldquo;butchering&rdquo; of the constituency.  It was also decided to ask the Parliamentary Labour Party to table an amendment to the Bill asking that Clare be allowed to retain its four seats in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I ask the Labour Party where do they stand?  Do they want three, four or five seats in Dublin, or four in Clare?  I do not see that, with all their talk about candidates to form a Government after the next election, they have confidence enough to put a policy to the people in Clare that would give them at least one of the three seats.  They do not deserve Government one way or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (Acting Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give statutory effect to the Financial Resolutions brought before the House in Committee on Finance on 5th November, 1968. The provisions of the Bill are described briefly in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the text of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide for the increases of 2d in the duty on the pint of beer and the glass of spirits; sections 4 and 5 relate to the increase in the tobacco duty of the equivalent of 3d on the packet of 20 standard-size plain cigarettes and also to the duty on stocks of duty-paid tobacco held by manufacturers on the afternoon of 5th November, 1968.  Sections 6 and 7 make provision for the increase in the rate of the wholesale tax from five per cent to ten per cent.</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides an exemption from tax for the premium of three per cent payable on the maturity date of the proposed investment bonds.  At present, changes in the rates of interest payable to depositors in respect of savings in the Post Office Savings Bank and trustee savings banks are made by legislation.  As a result, substantial delays can occur before desirable adjustments are made.  Section 9 provides for fixing these rates by regulations.  This will make it possible for interest rates on small savings to follow general interest rate trends more closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Financial Resolutions from which this Bill stems were fully discussed <Col N="1843" /> in the House in Committee on Finance and I have dealt at length, on several occasions recently, with the background to these measures.  I do not think, therefore, that further elucidation is called for at this stage.  At Committee Stage, I will gladly go into any points of detail that Deputies may wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to read the Bill a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have had a second Budget this year, so now we have Finance (No. 2) Bill.  As the Taoiseach indicated, this is the legislative proposal under which Deputies will vote new taxation on beer, spirits and tobacco, increase the wholesale tax and generally carry out the details of the Budget recently introduced.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling and noting that once again in this Finance Bill, as has so often happened in the past, fresh taxation is being imposed on beer, spirits and tobacco.  Deputies who were in the House in 1963 can no doubt recall, perhaps with some irony, the case then made by the Minister for Finance in regard to the old standbys of beer, tobacco and spirits.  They will recall that the Minister for Finance then made the case that these sources of taxation had dried up &mdash; that so much taxation had been imposed on beer, spirits and tobacco that saturation point had been reached.</P>
      <P>It was in those circumstances, in that year, in that Budget, that a new form of taxation known as the turnover tax was introduced.  I wonder, recalling that, recalling those views expressed nearly six years ago, what credence can be attached by Deputies and people generally to considered statements by a Minister for Finance.  Six years ago, saturation point had been reached in relation to beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol, but despite that, in almost each year since, new burdens by way of taxation have been imposed on these commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, this Finance Bill will have the effect in a full year of increasing taxation by close on £20 million.  In any one year, indeed, in any group of years, an increase in taxation of that extent would be regarded as significant <Col N="1844" /> and burdensome.  To have an increase of this size imposed by what was canvassed as a mini-budget&mdash;almost an afterthought, a by-the-way at the end of the financial year&mdash;is surely indicative of the gravest possible disarray in Government planning and Government thinking.  Increases in taxation to the extent of £20 million, imposed in the second half of the financial year, seem to indicate that the Government have no ability to foresee the budgetary requirements of this country in the short space of 12 months.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm to remind Deputies that in the first Budget of this year the Minister for Finance, concluding his Financial Statement, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The budget underlines the Government's confidence in the nation's ability to maintain a high rate of economic progress even in difficult international conditions.  At a time when many countries whose economies are much stronger and more diversified than ours have had to accept severe budgetary measures and stiff economic policies, we are placing our faith in expansion and in the capacity of our people to meet from their own resources any challenges the year may bring.</P>
    <P>They were fine phrases, fine sentiments, indicative of an optimistic expansionist approach as far as the economy of this country is concerned&mdash;indicative of an aim and a will and a desire to get this country punching forward to meet the competition and the difficulties of trade and commerce.</P>
    <P>Now, what credence is to be attached to these sentiments that only appear to be fine, lofty, imaginative?  Is it the truth that they were, in fact, so much froth and bubbles with nothing behind them by way of Government plan or Government will?  It certainly so appears when, a few months later, this second Budget has to be introduced imposing £20 million in extra taxation, in damping down the fires of commerce, of business activity, in giving the people and the economy a fresh, bitter dose of deflation. and in so doing extinguishing any optimism that was beginning to be felt this year, optimism that we had got out of the bleak, difficult <Col N="1845" /> period of the last 18 months and were beginning to move forward again.</P>
    <P>I notice that in this morning's paper the Federated Union of Employers expressed their view on the current economic situation and on the necessity for this second Budget.  They criticised Government planning which led to the increases and they referred in particular to a lack of foresight in respect of national finances.  They went on to charge that the Government should have known last April the cost of wage and salary increases in the public services within one or two percentage points; the acreage under wheat; the probable size of the deficit in the Post Office; the demands and possible concessions to the agricultural community, and the gap between wages and salary awards and the growth in productivity.  Having referred to the announcement of the Third Programme for Economic Expansion, they go on to say:</P>
    <P>The Autumn Budget is a poor prelude for it.  Many will ask what is the purpose of planning for four years if Budget policies, designed for a period of one year, have to be torn up after six months.</P>
    <P>After the early retirement of the Second Programme cynicism about the value of national planning has been mounting.</P>
    <P>That is a serious indictment, coming from a responsible source, of this Government, of the way they have been managing our affairs and of their standing with the business community.</P>
    <P>We were always concerned or we should always have been concerned in this country with the building up of confidence among our own people in our own ability to survive.  Two major political Parties in this Dáil sprung from the idealism of the late President Arthur Griffith and from his movement, Sinn Féin.  Sinn Féin taught the message that it was by our own efforts eventually we would and could survive. That philosophy of Sinn Féin had, and I hope will continue to have, an important effect on our character and on the way we shape up to our national problems.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties and problems <Col N="1846" /> in the last decade or so has been to convince people here at home who are engaged in any form of production or taking any part in the economic development of the country to have confidence in the plans and long-term programmes laid down and in the attainment of the targets set out in these plans.  That necessity was fully recognised in this House when the First Programme was announced some seven years ago.  It has been one of the problems in the last seven years to get people to realise that if there were continued efforts we could survive as a viable economic unit.</P>
    <P>From time to time in relation to the Second Programme we indicated certain areas in which the targets and the aims were not being achieved and could not be achieved because the methods and policies being adopted were unsound.  We advocated consistently that, for the Second Programme to move forward, permeating confidence among the people, it was essential to have periodic, realistic reviews of the progress being made and of the methods and policies being adopted.  Our representations in that regard were spurned and refused by the Government.  The result was that in the early part of this year the Second Programme, which had been creaking and tottering, finally collapsed leaving nothing in its place.  It collapsed to such an extent that it sent out with its collapse waves of dismay, of suspicion and of discontent throughout the business community. It confirmed many weak people in the lack of confidence which they had in their own country and in their own country's ability to survive.  Here today we have the Federated Union of Employers coming out and instancing as another example of failure to plan and lack of foresight and lack of ability and efficiency in Government the fact that the Government are incapable of carrying out even the simple task of the national housekeeping for a period of 12 months.  It is a serious indictment and it is one which, regrettably, is perfectly and amply justified in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>We find now that in the spring of this year this Government were incapable <Col N="1847" /> of foreseeing the result on the Public Service of the wage and salary increases which had been commenced. We find also that, although the Budget statement of the spring of this year refers to wheat and milk and dairy increases, it was not possible for the Government accurately and reasonably to anticipate what the cost would be to the Exchequer.  Budgeting is no more than a reasonable exercise in foresight. We find that, in these respects again, the Government failed to measure up to what was required.  That would be tolerable, it would be perhaps something that could be borne by the people, were it not for the fact that in present circumstances this Budget and this Finance Bill contrived to bring about a very profound dampening effect on the general economy.</P>
    <P>We are at a time when the Taoiseach has had the lot of experiencing, particularly in recent weeks, that our economic circumstances and needs require that we should be pushing forward vigorously and with determination to win new markets for our products. We certainly cannot continue to be tied to the sick man of Europe.  If that is to remain our horizon then our people will not find a way of life in their own country.  We have got to get out beyond the English market.  We have got to think with optimism and enthusiasm, have fresh peaks to climb and fresh areas to try.</P>
    <P>That should have been our disposition now.  Had we a Government that were doing their job we should have had a vibrant, determined business community working in co-operation with the trade unions, helping to push the things we have to sell over wider and wider areas.  Instead, what have we?  We have a tattered free trade agreement with the sick economy of England, an arrangement which permits us no room for manoeuvre, an arrangement which causes problems and difficulties for our people and our country from time to time.  Not only that but by our own positive action, by Government error, lack of foresight and mistake we are actually depressing business activity in our own country at this very time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> The situation is so serious that the interests of the country would be much better served by a general election and the possibility at least of a new Government being selected forthwith. There are £20 million in increased taxation.  Leaving aside the broader questions of economics and all the rest of it which are bandied about so glibly by so many Deputies in this House in language not frequently understood, even, by the ordinary man in the street, what does £20 million mean to the ordinary man?  The price of his beer and tobacco has gone up.  If he drives a car it will cost him more.  The wholesale tax is increased so that the price of goods will go up.</P>
    <P>What effect will this have?  The cost of living will be forced up significantly by those Budget increases.  It will be just another part of the long war of attrition which successive Governments in this country have waged on the real value of money.  The cost of living is going up.  That, perhaps, will be tolerated by those in the higher salary brackets and by those classes who, in any event, apparently have the power to shake some golden apples from the tree and recompense themselves for any rise in living or other costs but there are people who cannot do that.  The social welfare recipient, the old age pensioner, the person who is sick and in need and who has to depend on unemployment benefit of one kind or another or, indeed, on unemployment assistance receive no cushioning in this Budget.  There is no benefit for the social welfare recipient to compensate for this new spiral in costs which will be set up with regard to living costs.</P>
    <P>That is unjust.  Not only is it unjust but it is dangerous.  It is wrong to have a situation in this country in which once a mistake has been made and new taxes are imposed the poor, the underprivileged and the distressed have to be the one section who will have to pay and who will have no means whatsoever of compensating for what is involved although others will.  An increase in the price of beer, spirits and so on will hit the worker.  He will feel the pinch of rising prices if it affects his pay packet.  Is it to be suggested that the worker is to bear that <Col N="1849" /> patriotically and with tolerance and do nothing about it?  Even if it is so suggested it will not happen.</P>
    <P>As a result of those blunders, this lack of foresight or whatever it is and whatever the reason, I can see a situation in which we will have a fresh spiral of wages chasing prices until our competitive position in the markets to which we should have been aspiring becomes worse and worse.  However, although we can speak here at length, we are merely confronting a Parliament, two sides, the Government side and the Opposition and nobody will be open to conviction or the votes cannot be changed.  I wanted merely to say what I have said so that it may be regarded as a protest on behalf of my own Party, on behalf of the main Opposition Party here, to the deplorable bungling which has gone on in this financial year.</P>
    <P>What the next Budget will bring no one knows.  I sincerely hope that this has not been another exercise in politics, gimmickry.  I sincerely hope it has not been any Machiavellian scheme to bear taxation now so as to appear in the role of the fairy godmother in a few months time.  If that has been done, then political expediency will have taken the place of patriotism and responsibility because what is being done now, what has been done in this Budget, will have caused serious harm throughout the country, to the economy and it will take us a considerable time to recover from that.</P>
    <P>I hope that this latest example of stop-go financing will be the last and that sooner or later we can have a broad economic plan, a plan which will contain recognisable and attainable targets, a plan which will command the confidence of our people because it will be something that they will understand. It is only when we get our policies along that kind of lines that we can make the steady systematic progress which is so essential for a small country like ours in the world as it is.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to have a repetition of what has taken place over recent years&mdash;the sun shining one moment and the black clouds blotting it out the next.  We cannot afford to have the situation in which a movement towards greater employment is <Col N="1850" /> reversed with more and more unemployment. We cannot afford to have a repetition of the series of recessions and advances that our economy has been subjected to.  It all stems from the fact that this Government have been there too long, have been in office for far too long.  They have grown stale in relation to their duties.  They lack a plan.  They lack a policy.  They have no idea even in relation to a 12-month period where exactly they are going. That has caused harm to the country. The people have been made to suffer.  I hope it will not be continued for very much longer.</P>

      <P>When, some years ago, the system of introducing a second Budget in the autumn was started, somebody said that the spring Budget to carry on the nation's housekeeping for the year was not sacrosanct, that there was no reason why one Budget should regulate the economy for the year and that there was nothing at all wrong with having two Budgets.  That might be fair enough as long as it is recognised that that is the system which is being adopted but it is just not good enough to do as was done this year, that is, to adopt a Budget in the spring, the Minister for Finance saying that unless something very extraordinary occurred there would be no need to introduce further taxation during the year, and then in the autumn to have what was described by the Government side as a mini-Budget which turned out to be almost as big as the spring Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Taoiseach and his Government the fact that there is a very serious position in this country.  It does appear as if the Government feel that as long as they find enough money to plug little holes as they go along, the boat will continue to float.  It does appear that we have reached the stage now, and I regret having to say this, that the Government are living from hand to mouth, that the situation has become so serious that there does not appear to be any forward planning of any kind.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, used to say that everything was fine <Col N="1851" /> around the corner but we never seem to go around that corner.</P>
    <P>One of the things which the Government should know is that apart from the row which has been dragged on unnecessarily, I believe, by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, with the National Farmers Association, there is the problem that the only form of production farmers are being encouraged to go into at the present time is of something which it is almost impossible to sell.  Milk and milk products are being sold on a heavy subsidy everywhere.  Yet, it does not appear as if all the Government experts have ever given any time to the question of finding something which the farmers could substitute for that, something which would not cost the colossal amount of money which this is costing.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a few years ago, was terribly anxious to get into the EEC for one reason only, that is, as he said in an unguarded moment, that it would relieve the Department of Finance of the heavy subsidy on milk and milk products.  His one idea was, to heck with everything else; if we can get in there and find somebody else carrying the subsidy for us, we will have a lot of money to play around with.  It did not turn out that way.  We have the situation that production of milk and milk products is being encouraged, is, in fact, being subsidised heavily, and there is no plan to replace it or even to reduce the necessity for the farmer to continue producing milk.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of wheat. There was a very reasonable question asked here yesterday.  Is wheat going to cost the country a lot of money in a successful year?  This year wheat in this country was very good, mainly for two reasons, first that because there was not so much wheat grown the previous year and there was no forward planning or advice from the Government, everybody who could do so went into wheat production.  This has been the pattern down the years.</P>

      <P>Anybody who was present at the opening of this debate will have noticed that the remarks of the Taoiseach were not very extensive.  That is quite understandable, because the Taoiseach is holding the baby in the financial and economic arena for the Minister for Finance who is, unfortunately, not able to be here <Col N="1854" /> himself.  However, what strikes me about the financial set-up in this country is that we are simply ambling along and when we find ourselves short of money somebody comes in here&mdash;the Taoiseach on this occasion&mdash;and imposes heavy extra taxation, this time to the tune of £20 million.</P>
      <P>No real reason has been given to the Dáil by any member of the Government or any Member on that side of the House as to why this taxation is necessary.  The only reason I can recollect being given was that the weather was somewhat different from what they expected it to be.  Responsible people in this country who understand finance, such as bankers and industrialists, feel that we are gradually getting more and more into a difficult situation here with no future or no outlet whatsoever.  The Taoiseach has not attempted to justify from an economic point of view the imposition of this £20 million on the economy; no Minister who spoke on the recent Budget debate has endeavoured to do that either.  What they have simply said is: &ldquo;We find ourselves in a difficult situation, and, therefore, we have to look for the money.  We are sorry but we have to impose this taxation&rdquo;&mdash;Fianna Fáil are always sorry whenever they have to do anything in this line&mdash;&ldquo;but it is necessary to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to succeed and to justify ourselves as a self-governing unit we have to be economically sound.  Anybody, even an elementary school child, will recognise that the imposition of these taxes must have one direct effect, to put up the cost of living.  Already before these impositions have been felt by the public at large, we have a rise in the cost of living.  I was in a house the other day where there was a husband and wife and six children sitting down to a meal; I just came in to see them about something.  The recent increases of 4d per pound in the price of tea and in the price of bread will seriously affect such people, before the effects of this Finance Bill are felt. What is going to happen after the 1st January when this 10 per cent wholesale tax becomes operative?  Looking at it even from the best point of view, one must agree there is bound to be <Col N="1855" /> a substantial increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred very rightly to our total dependence on the British market.  The Taoiseach will agree, if he has ever bothered to listen to what I have said or read any of the speeches I have ever made, that I have been pleading for the last six years that we should get away from this total dependence on the British economy. The whole policy of this Government is based on that line of thought.  The present economic difficulties in Britain are due to one thing and one thing alone: the high costs of production have priced them out of world markets. As Deputy O'Higgins said, Britain is the sick man of Europe.  What we are doing is basing our economy, our prices and our wage standards almost entirely on the British ones.  Our costs of production are so high that we are in a position only to export to Britain if she allows us to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>If as a result of the recent British action, our exports are seriously affected and if we want to export to other markets, can we be competitive? The Government should be able to tell the House whether what I am saying is right or wrong?  Can we be competitive in our exports to European countries? Can we be competitive in our exports to the United States of America?  I am talking about the new impositions that are being placed on the economy. Those are things on which the people should be informed.  I am sure the Taoiseach has expert advisers on finance.  I do not agree with the advice they have given if it is on that advice the Government have acted.</P>
    <P>We cannot escape the fact that we are getting into a very dangerous situation.  It is time the Government recognised that we are not a great nation and we cannot stand a certain level of taxation unless we are able to counteract it by increased production and exports.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will tell us that our exports are growing all the time and that our employment is improving. Industrial exports may have grown to a small extent but they are low compared with those of other countries <Col N="1856" /> and although they have increased somewhat they are not sufficient to carry the economy or carry the load of taxation which is being imposed.</P>
    <P>For that reason, even with the most optimistic outlook it is quite obvious there will be further pressure for increases in wages and, in justice to the people, there must be a further claim for increased social benefits.  How will the £20 million cover this?  The £20 million is already damaging our economy although its full effects are not apparent but when it begins to act generally on the balance of the economy there must be further demands for more Government expenditure. In other words, the dog is chasing his tail all the time and there is no answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>If those who advise the Minister have an answer I do not know what it is, nor does anybody on this side of the House.  We began with the turnover tax which was supposed to be a simple equitable tax imposed on everybody. That began the spiral but, of course, we do not go back to the turnover tax because the Government know that to impose direct taxation on those lines would mean a repetition of what they had before when the businessmen were out in the street marching.  Therefore, they put on a wholesale tax which it is suggested does not touch food or the necessaries of life and so on.  Of course, it affects all these because if you impose a wholesale tax you impose a manufacturing tax and the charge will be thrown back on the public.  My guess is as good as that of anybody else and I say that this Finance Bill will not give the country a 5 per cent increase although certain things are excluded from it.  In the final analysis when the bill is fully paid, probably not in the time of the 18th Dáil but in that of the 19th Dáil, whoever will be sitting on the hot seat of Finance then, the bill will be considerable.</P>
    <P>At one time when these taxes were imposed I felt there was a possibility that the Government were trying to collect a few pounds for the kitty so that then they might be in a happier position to face the public in the next spring Budget as a sort of general <Col N="1857" /> Father Christmas.  It seems as if that theory may have been exploded because of the recent event in relation to what I might describe as the complete sell-out to British economic interests and we shall probably find ourselves in further difficulties.  I think I am right in quoting the Taoiseach&mdash;I have not got the reference at the moment&mdash;in a major speech quite recently in his native Cork, I think, in which he said it might be possible that the taxes which they had imposed and which were so strongly criticised by the Opposition might not be sufficient. Does that mean that we shall not be able to last out without coming back&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <P>I did not say that anywhere, neither in Cork nor elsewhere. The Deputy must be thinking of somebody else.</P>

      <P>It was some responsible member of the Government. I read it in the papers but if the Taoiseach says he did not say it and if he assures me that there will be no further taxation, which would be very difficult for him to do in the light of recent circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, when introducing his Budget last spring mentioned that the Schedule B tax on farms was going to be abolished with certain exceptions.  He also mentioned that Schedule A tax would be abolished and if I remember rightly he said that there would be finance regulations to deal with that in the autumn.  We are now in December, having completed the autumn, and I see nothing in this Finance Bill regarding those proposals. Perhaps, the Taoiseach will tell us, when replying, if what I regard as a very necessary and useful remission of taxation will become effective or not, <Col N="1858" /> whether it is one of the things being shelved in the general financial chaos in which the Government find themselves.</P>
      <P>To my mind, remission of Schedule A tax would give a tremendous incentive to private enterprise in the building trade and would save the Government and those responsible for budgetary proposals vast sums of money.  It was really a good piece of political thinking although not as yet legislation.  A considerable number of people would be interested to know the answer to my question.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that in the not very distant future we shall face a great increase in the cost of living which will be a great source of embarrassment to the Government.  The Taoiseach knows I am a friendly critic and the only friendly advice I can give the Government is to get out as quickly as possible before they meet with utter disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It astonishes me that Dáil Éireann should approach this Budget without stating the one clear, fundamental fact: this Budget is the price of inflation and so long as inflation continues to recur you will have a repetition of these Budgets.  Deputy Esmonde has rightly described the state of the nation as that of the dog chasing his own tail.  The Government have announced that they regard it as acceptable that there should be annual inflation of approximately 4 per cent.  Does anybody realise what that means, that in any 20-year period 80 per cent of the value of money goes down the drain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the price of tobacco alone.  I have an old friend here in Dublin who has not many comforts now.  He said to me: &ldquo;My God, Mr. Dillon, the plug of tobacco is gone up to 9/2d.&rdquo;  When I first sold a plug of tobacco in my shop the price was 1/6d.  The man to whom I was speaking is a man who has very few frills or luxuries in his life.  Very occasionally, I think he would take a pint but the criterion would be if he could afford it.  There is one&mdash;for him &mdash;virtually indispensable amelioration of his existence and that is a blast of his pipe and the way this strikes him <Col N="1859" /> is: &ldquo;My God, Mr. Dillon, the plug of tobacco is gone up to 9/2d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Taoiseach was sympathetic to this point of view which is extremely difficult to communicate to the people.  Inflation is always popular while it is going on but to those who understand its nature it is the supreme evil because it is the poor who suffer, the poor who do not know how to grapple with the process of inflation; the labouring man who is given an increase in his wages and who likes the feeling of getting more money and is delighted to hear his wages are going up by 10/- or 15/- a week.  That gives him a warm comfortable glow.  It is true that the trade unions are negotiating wage increases and fringe benefits. The whole functioning of their organisations is there for all to see.  Imagine anyone who understands the function of money allowing himself to be crushed by the steamroller of inflation. That is what maddens me.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach became very indignant with me recently because he said I was the first person ever to speak in disparaging terms of a national loan while it was at issue.  I have said twice in the course of the past 12 months that I could not, in conscience, subscribe any longer to the practice of recommending fixed interest loans to poor people.  I said recently in this House that in the last decade no rational manager of money has retained in his portfolio any fixed interest Government stock but what happens is that these stocks are subscribed to to a great extent by the banks&mdash;the only deposits with them are the deposits of poor people&mdash;also, the industrial insurance companies and the only people who ensure with the industrial insurance companies are wage earners and poor people.</P>
    <P>I know, and everybody who knows anything about money, knows that publicity hunting organisations will subscribe a quarter of a million pounds to the national loan but they will have a standing order with their broker to unload as quickly as possible. The only ones who retain it are the industrial insurance companies and the unfortunates who have been <Col N="1860" /> persuaded by some of us in past years to put their modest savings into it and they hold them in order to recover the redemption price because they cannot bear to sell the loans at 62 or 63 per cent of their face value.</P>
    <P>Who is going to pay all the tax in this Budget?  Who is going to pay the wholesale tax?  How many Deputies in this House have asked themselves what are the commodities on which the wholesale tax will fall?  A woman buying sheets for the house, buying towels or any of the other things that are required to keep the home neat and tidy will have to pay.  Our friends will have to pay 9/2d for their plug of tobacco.  The poor have long given up drinking spirits but they will pay more for a pint if they can afford one at all.  They have no means of avoiding the consequences of these kinds of taxes.  It would be true to say that I have and that every other Deputy in this House has.  I can buy stocks and shares that I know will react to inflation by giving me capital appreciation.  I know I can buy land. I know men who have been buying land ever since the Government made up their minds that inflation was to be an annual characteristic of our life. These people make lots of money in this way.  They can afford to buy brandy and whiskey and any other luxury one may care to name because they know what the inevitable consequences of inflation are.</P>
    <P>I admit that the Government are not peculiar in surrendering to this socalled controlled inflation; there is no such thing as controlled inflation.  Inflation cannot be controlled once a Government bases its whole philosophy on the assumption that controlled inflation is a desirable thing. They are working on slippery slopes which bring them ultimately to catastrophy. This Budget is merely one step on that road and it is about time that the people opened their eyes to this.  It is not a question of a series of Budgets raising taxation but it is the inevitable step towards the substitution of authoritarian government for freedom.  That is what this policy means and that is where it will lead us if it continues.</P>
    <P>This issue has been fought in the <Col N="1861" /> world time and time again.  I remember my old friend, Congressman Bourke Cockran of the USA fighting his own Party&mdash;he had been a lifelong Democrat&mdash;and defeating his own Party in 1898 because he said that since he was a Democrat he would continue to be a Democrat and he would fight the defence of sound money in order to preserve democracy in the world.  He was profoundly right.  It is very painful to have to leave one's own Party, particularly in a country like the USA where loyalties to Parties are so strong. What alarms me today is that so few people see where the present policy is leading us.  There is not the slightest use in coming in here and denouncing the Government for imposing tax upon tax if we all subscribe to the economic philosophy which makes that course inevitable.</P>
    <P>I want to warn Oireachtas Éireann now that this is nothing compared to what it will be during the next five years if the present dialectic is pursued. When these costs bite there will immediately be demands for increased social services and for increased wages. These, in turn, will create a situation in which the Government will have to meet increased charges.  The Government will find themselves in a dilemma if they are to keep the public service manned; they will have to compete for personnel and after holding the line as long as they can they ultimately will give way and an immense addition will be made to the total cost of the growing bureaucracy.  It is no reflection on the bureaucracy.  The plain fact is that the graduates are not prepared to accept less than the going rates.  The best young men from the universities will not go into the Civil Service at less than industrial salary rates and if we have not a good Civil Service the whole machinery of the Government will break down.  But, as we get it the cost will rise.</P>
    <P>The plain truth is that we are living in a highly competitive world and the way catastrophe creeps upon us is that as those tax rates rise and rise, and wage rates and salary rates rise and with them our transport rates rise, and everything else rises, as costs accumulate our position as a competitive exporter is steadily eroding.  But, we are <Col N="1862" /> not fighting in the competitive export markets of the world on the basis of equality with our competitors.  More and more in every great exporting country of the world the exporting industries are being automated.  They are being automated on the basis of a huge domestic market, such as the USA or the EEC or the somewhat less closely integrated common market of EFTA. Each of these provide a domestic basis upon which automated industry can be established.</P>
    <P>We belong to none of these organisations. We are fighting in export markets, in automated economies, which have become successively and rapidly more and more automated, with our bare hands.  Mind you, competing with automation with our bare hands is handicap enough; but if on top of that we apply the burden of a steadily increasing cost structure this country will collapse. That collapse will be largely concealed for some time by the fact that we are still essentially a primary producing country.  As money depreciates in value the price of cattle and livestock increases. Signs on it, as most Deputies know, the price of cattle in the last 12 months has never been better.  This is concealing the growing difficulty into which we are drifting on the industrial front.</P>
    <P>There is no use blaming the Government if we are not prepared to blame the cause.  There is no use telling the Government they are right in following an inflationary policy and then complain about its inevitable consequence. There is only one criterion by which you can judge as to whether the economy has a desirable and safe future.  That is whether its money is stable and its cost of living stable too. People have asked themselves how has America achieved her miracle of economic prosperity.  The answer is by expanding production with a substantially stable cost of living.  Up to eighteen months ago with the impact of the South-East Asian war, the Vietnam War, America had achieved the economic miracle of steadily and dramatically expanding her national production while maintaining a relatively stable cost of living.  The same is true of Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> The reason for it in Germany is that the Germans have gone through the crucifixion of uncontrolled inflation and the whole German people think of inflation with horror.  The Germans save and work and they do not want to run into huge adverse balances in their annual Budget.  Signs on them. After the ghost of Lord Keynes has been capering about Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as they call themselves, capering about France and the rest of Europe, after the President of France has been shaking his golden stick, overnight the fate of Europe made Germany raise the value of her money to enable everybody else in Europe to carry on with the capering.  I could not withhold admiration for the President of France when he said that it was an absurdity to suggest that the French Republic who are gold-plated should be asked to revalue their currency.</P>

Once you surrender to mob rule and accept inflation under the threat of riot, overnight what seems to be a golden rock can disintegrate into powder, whereas the stolid old Germans pounding along on the simple proposition that you pay as you go and you save a part of anything you earn and you do not depreciate the currency now find themselves the most prosperous community in Europe, the highest paid people in Europe with the highest level of social security in Europe and with every other national in Europe asking them to raise the value of their currency not to save Germany but to save France, to save Holland, to save Belgium and to save Italy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not something queer about that?  Is it not remarkable that the one country in Europe with a sound currency, which consistently rejected inflation as a loathsome thing, has not only 100 per cent employment but has millions of depressed Europeans from Turkey, Italy, Spain and the east, all working for her?  They are providing under their law that anyone from Turkey, Spain, Greece or Italy, or anywhere <Col N="1864" /> else who comes to work in Germany must not be excluded from their social services programme.  It is an essential condition of the employment of an alien in Germany that he will be in a position of absolute equality with them as a German national working in Germany.  Is that not a better condition for a people to be in than to be facing interim Budgets every year? Is that not a better position for a nation to be in than to be in the situation we are in of a dog chasing its own tail?</P>
    <P>My mind goes back to the days when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  I do not think he will charge me with being derisory if I recall his introductory words on the occasion of the first interim Budget he ever introduced in this House as Minister for Finance.  He opened his speech by saying: &ldquo;What went wrong with my Budget of last April?&rdquo;  I do not believe he knew.  I want to tell him that nothing went wrong with his Budget on that occasion which did not go wrong with Deputy Haughey's Budget on this occasion.  It is the same old story all over again.  In some places, they call it the policy of &ldquo;Stop-go&rdquo;.  In other places they call it the policy of The Programme for Economic Expansion. It always has a lovely name.  It always has a beautiful description.</P>
    <P>There was an old Chinese emperor who lived 3,000 B.C. who embarked on precisely the same policy.  I think in those days it was described as the policy of Sharing the Radiance of the Eternal Sun.  The ridiculous thing is that it is as old as history.  It always has the same end.  The tragedy is that it seems to be impossible to forewarn people of the inevitable consequences.  I do not despair.  We, in public life, sometimes stand rebuked that nobody shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  I am now saying &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  I am warning you that you are on the road not to economic catastrophe alone&mdash;that is bad enough &mdash;but also on the road to the loss of freedom.  Because that lesson is branded on the Germans as if it were branded with a red-hot iron, they are now the most prosperous country in Europe. They turned their back on inflation and said &ldquo;Never again&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> I shall not finish without recalling to this House what inflation means to freedom. This Budget is simply one step on a road which leads inevitably to a certain end.  Sooner or later, the floodgates will break open and inflation will gather in velocity.  When that time comes, nobody trusts money any more. The net result is that thousands and thousands of small people are wiped out.  But, while they are being wiped out, nobody seems to care.  The elderly widow living on a modest invested income; the retired person who is trying to live on a pension: they simply go down the drain and they die of gradual starvation as their fixed income dwindles in value.</P>
    <P>As our competitive situation declines, unemployment will begin to grow. The factories, which operate on the assumption that they will be able to sell their goods abroad, will find that they will not be able to do so.  Then there will be demonstrations.  Wherever demonstrations begin &mdash; whether of students, the unemployed, and so on &mdash;the international Communist Party will turn up.  We have them in Dublin now.  When perfectly decent people&mdash; whether they be students, trade unionists or workers &mdash; who have a deep sense of grievance and who begin to feel that Dáil Éireann is forgetting them&mdash;&ldquo;We gave them £2,500 a year but what do they care now for us? They do not feel the pinch&rdquo;&mdash;decide to demonstrate, the international Communist conspiracy, which is designed to wipe out freedom, rears its ugly head.  Its only purpose is to make us the creatures of the State instead of the State being our creature.  The philosophy of the Communists is that the people were made for the State, not the State for the people.  People who are driven to exasperation take to the streets and those who want to see freedom perish urge upon them that that is a good thing to do.  The method employed is that the genuine, honest demonstrator, who has no purpose other than to make his grievance felt and heard, marches&mdash;and the Communists get in behind him.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later, that march is confronted by the Garda Síochána in this country or by the police in some other <Col N="1866" /> country.  The leaders of that march do not want to break the law.  Their only purpose is to bring their grievance under public observation.  But, behind them&mdash;they are always well behind them&mdash;the elements of which I speak proceed to attack the police by hurling golf balls with nails stuck in them, bits of rock, stones, bottles and so on. Eventually the police, in order to discharge their duty, are bound to repel the mob.  The impact of police action falls on the decent people and, within half an hour of the necessary police action being taken, there is a meeting proceeding a quarter of a mile away to protest against police brutality.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking for the Fine Gael Party now: I am speaking for myself because this will make me unpopular with the Fourth Estate.  You will get some bloody nuisance with a camera or some fellow who is out to get his signed piece on &ldquo;Riots in Dublin&rdquo; on the front page of, say, <i>The Daily Express</i> and he gets a clout during the proceedings and writes a piece, a mile long, about the &ldquo;savage brutality&rdquo; of &ldquo;Constable Pat Twohig&rdquo;, who is well known to be a mild, inoffensive fellow who never hurt anybody in his life but who, I suppose, got a kick in the groin and maybe a crack on the head and, in trying to keep order, lashed out at somebody&mdash;and immediately there is a colleague trying to take a photograph of the blood, if it is not tomato juice, on the person's head.  Deputies may smile or laugh.  It is all good fun&mdash;but watch what happens.  That is carefully organised and spread throughout the world and, ultimately, the police in any country say to themselves: &ldquo;Why should we be made the tools of these people?&rdquo;  We know perfectly well that 95 per cent of this is propaganda. There is no talk about stones, no talk about bags of faeces thrown at the police, or the language used to provoke any fellow with a hot temper.  There is no talk of the fact that nobody went to hospital, that nobody was seriously hurt.  And the police begin to say: &ldquo;Why should we carry the can?&rdquo;  Now that is exactly what the Communists are looking for; they want to strike from the hands of constitutional Government the weapons with which a Government must ultimately keep <Col N="1867" /> control.  Once they have done that, if they succeed in doing that, no matter what Government are in office, the immediate sequel is anarchy and, out of anarchy, all history will tell us, people will accept any form of Government rather than anarchy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I will conclude this dialectic in a moment and come right back to the point.  Out of anarchy you get a Government of the extreme right, like the Nazi Government in Germany, or a Government of the extreme left, which certain people hope to precipitate in France if they succeed in overthrowing General de Gaulle.  That is why I say this Budget is another step on the road not only to economic crisis but to political crisis, a political crisis which puts the freedom of us all in desperate peril.  And there is no budgetary procedure which will rescue this country, or any other country, from this danger unless the people can be persuaded to realise that the only means of putting an end to interim Budgets such as we are discussing here today is to restore stable money and abolish inflation and that will not be an easy thing to do.  But the Swiss have done it.  They are a small country.  The West Germans have done it; they are a big country.  I think the Americans will do it.  These are the countries in which freedom survives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am trying to do is to awaken Dáil Éireann to this fundamental fact: it is not the contents of this particular Budget, it is not the fact that the price of the plug tobacco has gone up to 9s 2d or the pint by tuppence that matters; what really matters is whither are all these successive Budgets taking us?  It is now a word of warning should be issued that, if we continue in the belief that it is both desirable and possible to maintain an annual inflation of our currency at four per cent, that is only the first of an endless series of interim Budgets.  We will never catch up.  And the certain and inevitable consequence of that is that this Oireachtas, <Col N="1868" /> as we know it, will disappear and there will be a new system of Government in this country.</P>
    <P>Mark you, I hear people talking already off public platforms of the desirability of acknowledging that Parliament is no longer adequate to provide the kind of Government required in a modern society.  I want to see Parliament survive.  I want to see Government carried on in this country by the processes of the Oireachtas.  I believe in our system of Government. I would prefer to do things slowly, certainly and justly rather than to do them quickly, efficiently and unjustly. I would prefer that civil servants should remain the servants of the people and I believe we are lucky enough in this country to have a great establishment of civil servants who want that too; they want to continue as the servants of the people.  But I already hear people speaking of a new system of Government in which civil servants would not be the servants of the people but the masters of the people.  There are people who believe in that.  I do not believe that these people, if they come out in the open and tried to overthrow the institutions of this State by force, will ever be permitted to do so provided our people know what their purpose is.  But here is the method which they may successfully employ if somebody does not shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  The interim Budget, the hallmark of the inflationary column, that is the instrument that will be used to tear up the foundations of Oireachtas Éireann.  It shocks me to see people whom I know have no sympathy with that philosophy suffering themselves to be made the tools of a conspiracy to destroy freedom in this society.  I would be interested to hear does the Taoiseach still believe in the possibility of controlling inflation, because it is on his answer to that question the future of this country very largely depends.  I hate this Budget.  I hate this Budget for the burdens it will put upon the people, but I hate it far more because I recognise in it a milestone on the road to the ruin of liberty.  What causes me concern is the fact that in the first 30 years I was in this House I do not think we had a <Col N="1869" /> single interim Budget.  In the last six we have had three or four.  Has that any significance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On this Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1968, I want to say a few words in relation to the taxes it imposes, on the effect those taxes will have on the social welfare or poorer sections of the country, and on the effect they will have on industrial relations and the wage structure in the country during the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon has so ably pointed out, it is very unfortunate that in recent years we did not seem to be able to budget for 12 months ahead. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, when speaking within the past couple of years, seemed to think that there is not much virtue in or, indeed, a great deal of necessity for budgeting 12 months in advance.  I want to ask the Taoiseach and the House, if we are not prepared to budget for at least 12 months in advance, how can we expect to have stability in wages?  How can we expect to avoid industrial unrest?  How can we expect to avoid numerous and frequent demands for wage increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget which was introduced in the spring of this year imposed substantial enough taxes, and to offset those taxes social welfare payments were increased in some categories, at any rate, by about 7s. 6d. per head.  The increases payable to the social welfare classes came into operation in August in respect of the non-contributory section and, in respect of the contributory sections who fall within the social welfare code, they will not come into operation until January of next year.  I want to say that the benefits which are supposed to have been given to the contributory social welfare recipients in the spring Budget of this year under the Finance (No. 1) Act have already been nullified and taken away from the people before they actually received them, because these taxes which we are now asked to impose will increase the cost of living substantially on recipients of the social welfare benefits.  I say that the contributory sections will never reap the benefits of that Budget because this Budget will rob them of those promised benefits.  The non-contributory <Col N="1871" /> section received those increases in August and have had them during September, October and November.  They have had them for one-third of the year and now they are being taken from them by the taxes which we are imposing.</P>
    <P>I say that is unjust.  I say it is unfair that the social welfare payments should be increased by the Finance (No. 1) Bill in a particular year on the basis that taxation will remain as provided in that Bill, and that we should then have another Finance Bill introduced which will &ldquo;up&rdquo;, and &ldquo;up&rdquo; very considerably, the taxes on the ordinary necessaries of life and the ordinary enjoyments of the poor without giving them any compensation by way of increased social service payments.  I say that simply is not fair.  I say it is dishonest.</P>
    <P>If the Government cannot budget 12 months in advance so far as taxation is concerned they should admit they have not budgeted fairly 12 months in advance so far as the social welfare payments are concerned.  If they find it necessary to re-think on the question of taxation before the year is out they should re-think on the social welfare benefits and increase them also.  That is elementary.  It cannot be successfully argued against.  It does not take any eloquence or any lengthy speech to show that this Bill is robbing the poor. It is a Bill which is robbing the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan, the recipient of unemployment benefit and assistance.  It is robbing them of what they were promised earlier.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>I also think that if the Government see fit to increase taxation and thereby diminish the benefits promised to those people who are badly in need of social assistance, they should increase the social welfare assistance in the amending Bill too.  In this year of affluence, 1968, the social welfare classes are getting little enough.  It is not as if they were in receipt of sums which could withstand an attack of this sort. They are in receipt of no such payments. They are in receipt of miserable assistance which is barely enough to keep body and soul together.  Try to visualise old age pensioners living on <Col N="1872" /> an income of £3 5s a week with the cost of living as it is, having to pay rent, buy fuel, clothes and food, and then finding in the middle of the year that further taxation is being imposed. Can that be justified?  Does the Taoiseach attempt to justify it?  I should like to hear his observations on it.</P>
    <P>I have also said that this is bound to lead to industrial unrest.  This Bill which we are asked to pass coupled with the increase in Post Office charges and the increase in bus fares which was just announced, is bound to put up the cost of living considerably.  If the cost of living goes up we know we will have demands for increased wages.  We know we will have industrial unrest. We know that will seriously damage the economy.  The Taoiseach will probably run for shelter to the umbrella of the troubles in France and the troubles in Great Britain, but I say that is no excuse.  Long before these measures were announced across the water the Taoiseach had introduced this Bill.  I want to go on the record here as saying that the Minister for Finance told us in so many words when introducing his Budget in the spring that he would be introducing another Budget before the end of the year.  He told the House that in a backward way.  He told us that, unless something unforeseen turned up, he did not anticipate another Budget before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I said at that time that the Minister was introducing a pre-referendum Budget and passing a pre-referendum Finance Bill through this House. We are now dealing with the post-referendum Finance Bill implementing the post-referendum Budget.  It is the business of the Government in power to run the affairs of the country in such a way that the people will know for a reasonable time in advance how they stand in relation to taxation and to the cost of living and that the wage-earner and factory worker will know whether the wage which he is getting early in May will be a fair wage for the following 12 months, and that the social welfare recipient will know that his old age pension in May, 1968, will hold its value until at least March or April, 1969.  I think it is the Government's <Col N="1873" /> business to do that.  The Government which fail in that duty are not distributing fairly the wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>Another thing I would like to say is that the housing situation in this country and in this city has not been solved.  The housing situation is desperate. That is a matter which can be dealt with in greater detail on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, but this Budget is something that the Minister for Local Government will have to bear in mind when he introduces his Estimate.  It is something that the Minister for Local Government will have to bear in mind when he is advising the Taoiseach and the Government on housing grants because this Bill which we are discussing now will substantially increase the cost of houses.  It will increase through the wholesale tax the cost of house-building. We know that the cost of building houses has gone up considerably in the last few years.  Devaluation put it up; turnover tax put it up; wholesale tax when first introduced increased it.  Now we have the wholesale tax doubled in this measure.  I want to know if the Taoiseach can tell us whether it is the intention of the Government to increase standard housing grants because the standard grant of £300 payable in respect of a new house has not been increased for many years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to have a long discussion on the housing grants beyond saying that I hope that the Taoiseach will do something to offset the increase in the cost of house-building which this Bill will definitely bring about.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that this year, which was the referendum year, was one in which we had two Budgets, just as in the Presidential Election year we had two Budgets.  I was accused of being unfair to the Taoiseach when I spoke in the general debate on the Budget and said I thought that the fact that in the Presidential Election year of 1966 we had a pre-election and a post-election Budget was unjust and not honest, just as this year which was a referendum year we had a pre-referendum and post-referendum Budget and Finance Bill.  I think that the Taoiseach, now that he finds himself saddled again with the portfolio of the Department of Finance, should resolve that, in so far as he is concerned or will in future have any control, there will be an end of this &ldquo;two Budgets a year&rdquo; business so that the working people and the social welfare recipients will know whether the benefits given to them in the spring Budget really mean anything or whether these benefits are going to be cut away, reduced and rendered valueless by another Budget introduced later in the year, as has happened in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go into the details of the taxes imposed here by this Bill.  They <Col N="1875" /> have been dealt with in detail before. It is sufficient to say that the taxes on beer, spirits and cigarettes and the wholesale tax, coupled with the increased Post Office charges and the increased bus fares will, in my opinion, bring about a very stiff increase in the cost of living which will lead, as Deputy Dillon has so ably said, to untold trouble in this country.  The Taoiseach and the Government must take the blame for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my meetings with the British Prime Minister and other Ministers was to make known my deep concern about the recent British measures which run counter to the spirit, if not also the letter, of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  I pressed strongly <Col N="1876" /> for our exemption from the British import deposit scheme.</P>
    <P>I referred once again to the restrictive effects on our economic development of earlier British measures such as the regional employment premium and the voluntary restraint on capital investment.</P>
    <P>I expressed serious concern about the possible implications for this country of the recent British policy statement on development of domestic agricultural production and I discussed the problems of trade in certain agricultural commodities especially cheese.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson explained that, despite the close association of the two countries in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, it was impossible to exempt imports from Ireland from the deposit scheme as the scheme must be non-discriminatory and it applies to Britain's EFTA partners, to the Commonwealth, and even to British dependencies. The British Government accepted, however, the reasons why we had to take special measures to safeguard the interests of our exporters.</P>
    <P>I received a clear assurance from the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that his recent policy statement on domestic agricultural production will not frustrate the agricultural objectives of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  In my subsequent meeting with Mr. Wilson, the Prime Minister not only endorsed this assurance, but agreed that our respective Ministers of Agriculture should maintain close contact to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Finally, Mr. Wilson and I agreed that all of the issues arising out of our discussions, including the working of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, should be further considered at a meeting beginning on Monday next of the Anglo-Irish Economic Committee in preparation for a meeting of the Irish and British Ministers concerned.  Mr. Wilson agreed that we should, if necessary, have a further meeting together following this Ministerial meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether it is proposed to take any countervailing action, as provided for under Article 18 of the Free Trade Area Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1877" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in reply to the debate last week that, if the effects of the British action are shown to be adverse and if they impinge on our balance of payments position, then we would contemplate taking countervailing action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The present arrangement which we have provided for the purpose of assisting our exporters will involve a charge on the Exchequer. Can the Taoiseach say what steps it is proposed to take to meet that and whether any representations have been made to the British Government in an effort to get them to offset that charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I put certain suggestions to have that charge offset to the British Prime Minister and this will be one of the matters which will be further discussed at the meetings to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Britain made certain regulations with regard to our exports to that country in order to correct their trading problems, will the Taoiseach say whether he and the Government are now to take the decision that they will not proceed with the lowering of our protective tariffs as from 1st July next?  Will he say whether he got an assurance from the British Government that Irish agricultural exports will not be curtailed?  He has said he got an assurance that the objects of the Agreement as far as agriculture is concerned will not be frustrated.  I do not know what that means in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now, it is not proposed to take a decision on the question of reducing our tariffs by a further one-tenth next July.  As far as our cattle exports are concerned, the Free Trade Area Agreement provides for the expansion in our agricultural output that we envisaged under our Programme for Economic Expansion. That is the kind of expansion in regard to which I sought an assurance from the British Minister of Agriculture, <Col N="1878" /> Fisheries and Food would not be frustrated. As far as meeting the interest charges on the deposits which the banks have agreed to make available is concerned, normally that would fall on the Exchequer, on the taxpayer, but as I already indicated in my reply to Deputy Cosgrave's supplementary, I have put forward suggestions to see if that will be offset&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to cattle exports, is it not right to say that there is nothing in the Agreement compelling the British to take 638,000 cattle from us&mdash;that they will take them only if the British farmers want them?  There is nothing in the Agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement provides that we use our best efforts to export to Britain 638,000 head of cattle.  There are provisions whereby we are guaranteed the repayment of the British subsidy for our meat.  There are other guarantees for us within the framework of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of prior consultation and pointed out how important it was for us on any action the British might see fit to take in the future, action that might affect our exports to that country.  That will be pursued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is capable of argument.  Fine Gael suggested that the British Government might have acted within the Agreement by imposing the provisions of Article 18 of the Agreement which would mean quantitative restrictions on our exports.  That was clearly stated in the Fine Gael statement last Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of supreme importance, as the Taoiseach must realise.  Yesterday he said, not in so many words, that he and the Dáil had not time to discuss this important problem.  The Taoiseach has now stated there will be consultation between him and his British counterparts, or with some British Ministers, in an effort to review the Agreement.  Does he not think the members of his Party, of Fine Gael and of my Party should be given an opportunity of having a full dress debate on the whole Agreement?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to be debated in the course of that time.  I intimated yesterday that I did not propose before Christmas to give time for that motion, and I was quite right. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement is published, well known, and to the extent that it is in existence everybody must know of its terms.  Structurally it is a sound agreement.  There have been little chinks in it which have not operated to our advantage and these are the chinks we hope to seal up in the course of the next couple of months.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that the one apparent safeguard in the Agreement which precluded Britain from imposing anything other than quantitative restrictions appears to have been breached clearly by the action of the British Government?  In those circumstances will the Taoiseach not agree that what was done was more than a breach of the spirit of the Agreement and was in clear open defiance of the treaty between the two countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as I said, this is capable of argument and I am sure Deputy O'Higgins would agree with me if he had read the provisions.  It refers to &ldquo;quantitative restrictions and other administrative measures of like nature&rdquo;.  I assume the Deputy would agree that is open to argument and that is why I said that while I regard it as against the spirit of the <Col N="1881" /> Agreement, it may also be against the letter.</P>

Under existing law a widow's contributory pension payable under the Social Welfare Acts is chargeable to income tax as earned income but in the case of a widow with no other income a liability to tax does not, of course, arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question the answer is in the negative.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware £100,000 was voted by the Dáil on the 9th July for the purchase of food and medicines in Ireland for dispatch to Nigeria and particularly to the distressed districts in the eastern area.  So far £84,890 has been expended by Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann; £62,790 for relief supplies dispatched from Ireland to Fernando Po for onwards transmission to the distressed eastern districts; £12,100 for relief supplies for distribution in the distressed areas under Federal control; and £10,000 in cash, recently sent to the International Red Cross to help defray transport costs, which the Society could not meet without obtaining additional donations.</P>
      <P>As a result of a further appeal the Government decided on the 28th August to pledge £25,000 to Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann to help it to equip and supply two additional Red Cross medical teams and to extend the tour of the team which has been doing splendid work in the Uyo area since September.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Government's contributions, Cumann Croise Deirge has, of course, received &mdash; and is continuing to receive &mdash; generous donations from the Irish public in both cash and kind and it is at present assembling further consignments of relief supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the whole question of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the famine and disease which have resulted from the <Col N="1886" /> tragic conflict in Nigeria will continue to receive the most careful and sympathetic attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether consideration has been given to initiating joint action with other countries in the United Nations anxious to provide relief?  The Minister no doubt has had his attention directed to the very serious report which was published at the weekend which would indicate that the appalling prospect of millions dying between now and the spring has become a reality.  Perhaps in those circumstances he would consider initiating action with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a co-ordinating committee which holds meetings from time to time.  The various humanitarian organisations attend those meetings and go into the matter of how supplies which are available or about to become available should be distributed.  The United Nations Children's Fund and other funds co-operate with representatives of the United Nations Secretary General and indicate the area they consider should be helped in conjunction with the co-ordination committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister must be aware that recent reports would indicate that while whatever has been done up to the present has made some contribution in different places, there is an immediate prospect of millions dying from starvation through lack of carbohydrates and proteins and due to the fact that the seed planted for next year had been largely eaten.  In those circumstances has any bigger relief commitment been considered in the United Nations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is to get the relief supplies delivered into the heart of the Ibo territory.  They have to be flown in under most difficult conditions. Until there is a surface passageway opened to get in heavy supplies there is no use going on accumulating a lot of supplies in tropical areas which have no prospect of delivery within a reasonable time.  I feel certain if roads were opened that would accommodate heavy supplies, carbohydrates and other foodstuffs, <Col N="1887" /> supplies would be forthcoming very quickly from many parts of the world.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies of the 12th and <Col N="1888" /> 14th November, 1968, to previous questions on this subject.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the B and I announced on the 5th November, a comprehensive freight plan framed on a national basis which included <i>inter alia</i> the discontinuance from the 1st January, 1969, of the present twice weekly direct service between Cork and Liverpool and its replacement by a daily service by liner train via Dublin at reduced freight rates.  The plan also provided for a freight service between Cork and Swansea on the new car ferry service which is due to enter service in May, 1969.  This decision was taken by the company on their own responsibility in pursuance of their statutory powers and their mandate to operate on sound commercial lines without special State subsidy or assistance.  In view of the strong protests from Cork interests concerned, I asked the B and I to defer implementation of their plan in so far as it would provide for discontinuance of the Cork/Liverpool direct service from the 1st January to enable me to examine the whole plan fully and to take into account the reasoned objections of the interests in Cork which would be affected.  I have asked the B and I to provide me with comprehensive and detailed information on the whole plan and I hope to receive this shortly.  I have invited all the Cork interests concerned to submit to me their reasoned comments and representations on the proposals as they affect Cork and I have asked the B and I to supply to those concerned all the information which can be made available. I have not yet received the submissions from the Cork interests but I presume they are being prepared.  Until I have received and examined the B and I submission and the Cork representations, I will not be in a position to make a further statement on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from one instance, no representations or complaints have been received in my Department about the quality of potatoes on the Dublin retail market this year.  The quality of ware potatoes has, in fact, been very good generally.  There have, I understand, been a small number of cases recently where the abnormally mild weather coupled with late blight in foliage resulted in some blight development in tubers, which could, however, appear quite sound when packed by the grower.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, for the sake of the maintenance of understanding between the consuming public and the potato growers of the country, I hope he may be able to give the House some information as to the reason why so many inferior potatoes have arrived in consuming centres after what appeared to be a propitious year.  I was told by some people it was due to late blight being washed down in certain restricted areas.  This may be the reason for it.  I would be glad to know if the Minister has heard any such suggestions.</P>

      <P>It is true that the crops generally, particularly the earlier crops, <Col N="1896" /> were very much free of blight, that, in fact, blight made little appearance anywhere until practically into the month of September and, perhaps, later, even October, it seemed to have begun to affect particularly the Kerr's Pink variety but, generally speaking, while there may be complaints, the Deputy's question is the first and only complaint that has been brought officially to me in any sense of the word in this matter because of the fact that even though there may be some blighted tubers on the market at the moment the general quality has been much better than in most years.  That is not to say that I regard the quality of potatoes, particularly in the Dublin market, as truly representative of the best quality potatoes to be got in the country and it always amazes me why, even in the worst years, there should be anything but the best sold in the consuming areas of the country.</P>

    <P>25.  Mr. McLaughlin asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will give full details of the calved cow subsidy scheme; and if he is aware of the heavy burden placed on small farmers by depriving them of the benefits of this scheme because they send some small supply of milk to the creamery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Full details of the new beef cattle incentive scheme will be published shortly.  The scheme is intended to benefit those herdowners who give the milk to their own livestock instead of sending it to the creamery and who, therefore, are not already assisted by the present very substantial milk subsidy.  Furthermore the scheme is likely to benefit all creamery milk producers indirectly as it will minimise the increase in deliveries to the creameries and so help to keep down the amount of the producers' levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the suggestion been made to the Minister, in the light of his earlier statements that this scheme was designed to persuade the larger farmer to confine himself to cattle breeding for meat rather than entering the already overburdened milk market that £8 per cow is too low and should be raised to £15, that this would be a more realistic figure if the purpose of the scheme was to be served?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one could scarcely disagree that £15 would be a better figure than £8 for the purposes of the scheme.  On the other hand, it is really computed as to the national average milk yield per cow.  This would be saying to the farmer in respect of each cow: &ldquo;If you keep the milk at home we will give you 4d a gallon for keeping it there&rdquo; instead of paying a shilling a gallon from the taxpayer's pocket if he sends it to the creamery. <Col N="1898" /> It may be argued strongly that if we were to give twice that amount to keep the milk at home, that is 8d a gallon, this would be a greater incentive to stay in beef or to get into beef than the £8 or the 4d per gallon equivalent average would be.  However, this is likely to cost £2,500,000 or maybe slightly over that, and this together with the other provisions we are making towards the support of various commodities is undoubtedly a heavy burden on the taxpayer.  These things must be weighed against that situation at all stages.  Let us have a try at it on the basis on which it is.  I think it will work.  Whether it would work better if it was higher than this I am not prepared to dispute.</P>

      <P>A neighbour of mine who feeds 20 cows uses 10 of them for supplying milk to the creamery and the other ten to rear 20 or 25 calves. Is the Minister trying to encourage that man to divert the milk from the creamery and rear livestock by giving him the sum of £160?  This man is about 60 and is rearing a family of 11 children.  Does the Minister really think that £160 is going to encourage him to forego the creamery cheque every month?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he can rear them in Donegal on fewer than 20 cows, they should be able to do it in other parts of the country.  In regard to the ten cows for milk and the ten cows for calving, if he wants to get the 20 subsidies, he goes out of milk with his ten cows.  If he does not want that, we are taking nothing from him; in fact, we are giving him an additional penny per gallon for the first 7,000 gallons of his milk.  Nothing could be fairer.  If the scheme has the effect of taking out of or keeping out of milk men with far greater numbers than 20 cows, then it will enable us to concentrate the taxpayers' support of milk on the people who most need that support, namely the small producers, who constitute 80 per cent of our producers.</P>

      <P>Why do the Deputy and some of his friends not get wise to this, that 108,000 tons were killed and put through our meat factories last year as against four years ago when only 19,000 tons were killed?  To give this picture that there is a 25 per cent decline this year without reference to the huge build-up there has been in the previous four years is misleading and might be disturbing to some of the people who are interested in meat factories.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In his short contribution, Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde commented on the introductory statement that I made in introducing the Second Reading debate on this Finance Bill.  I should like to remind the Deputy in case he implied in any way that I tried deliberately to cut short my introductory statement that it is the practice in successive debates for the introductory statement on Finance Bills to be very brief.</P>
      <P>Having dealt with most of the points raised during the course of the debate on the Resolutions, a lengthy contribution to the debate in Committee would require me to repeat much of what I said last week.  Deputy Esmonde also charged that neither I nor any other Minister who spoke during the course of the debate referred to the reasons why this supplementary Budget was introduced.  Perhaps that is a good starting point to reply to the subject matter of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to great pains on a number of occasions to indicate to the House and to the country the reasons why the Government believed that this supplementary Budget was necessary.  The reasons were mainly because of the extent to which expenditure was outrunning <Col N="1922" /> income during the current years and, because we, like many other countries throughout the world, had to take certain action to offset inflationary tendencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the spring Budget deliberately did not give any indication of the amount of expenditure that would have to be met during the course of the year I think it is quite clear that the Minister for Finance on that occasion envisaged this possibility.  Deputy T. O'Higgins called attention to the FUE statement that we ought to have foreseen to within a small percentage the amount of money that increases in salaries and wages of the public service would cost. It is, nevertheless, true to say that the 11th round had only barely begun to start at that time.</P>
    <P>As I said before, if we had made precise provision for the increased cost to the Exchequer of the public service wage increases that, I feel, would have given a fairly strong indication and guide to the level that the public service ought to seek.  However, as is generally known, the public service do not usually come into the van of wage increases but rather tend to await the outcome of the free negotiation process that we have.  Therefore, it was all the more important that the Government should not give an indication in advance to the people who would be negotiating for wage increases in the private sector.  In any event, the increases that were given to the public service were consistent with the increases that were given in the private sector.  The cost of the increase amounted to roughly £9 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance clearly said in his Budget speech that if a liability of that order came up for payment during the course of the year it would be necessary to introduce the appropriate taxation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we deliberately kept back these taxes until the referendum was over is equally untrue and I should like to remind the House that on a number of occasions before the referendum took place, I gave an indication that extra taxation would have to be raised in the course of the current financial year.  Therefore, there <Col N="1923" /> was no question whatever of trying to conceal from the electorate in advance of the referendum that extra taxation was likely.</P>
    <P>There is also the increase in agricultural subsidies and I think it is worth mentioning again that the increase is caused by the unusually high yields and quality of the wheat crop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will rule the Taoiseach out of order if he continues on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to relate it specifically to the £1¼ million that it will cost the Exchequer to provide for these unusually high yields and qualities as well as the record yield in milk. That is something in excess of £4 million. Thus some £15 million had to be provided immediately if we were not to run into a serious deficit and that deficit would have been of the order of £18¾ million or £19 million; buoyancy accounted for a little more than £7 million of that leaving what would have been a deficit of the order of £11 million.</P>
      <P>The new taxes will raise £15 million in a full year, but only £4 million in the remaining months of the current financial year.  We face a net deficit of £7 million in the current budget this year. This amount will have to be provided for in the usual way, unfortunately, by borrowing&mdash;by imposing further on the commercial banks.</P>
      <P>There is no question of trying to preempt the ordinary Budget next year.  In the course of the Budget debate I mentioned increases in spending of the order of some £27 million that would be required in the coming financial year.  I related that £27 million to certain specific items but that list was not exhaustive.  It was suggested at some stage&mdash;not in the course of this debate, but in the course of the debate on the Resolutions&mdash;that the taxation now being imposed would offset any increases that were likely to come up in the coming year.  Fifteen million pounds in taxation will not go even half way to meet the kind of increased costs that are likely to face the Exchequer in the financial year, 1969-70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> Deputy T.F. O'Higgins mentioned the cynicism that is abroad about national planning.  It is true that the plans we made and the developments we envisaged&mdash;the Second Programme for Economic Expansion&mdash;were based on assumptions that were incorrect but any forward planning of that nature must be based on reasonable assumptions and, while economists can make forecasts&mdash;this is a general rule not only in this country but throughout the world&mdash;they can be very far off the mark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, we have learned from the shortcomings of the Second Programme but let me remind Deputies that the First Programme was highly successful.  After many years of the economy tottering along slowly and making no progress or progress at the maximum of one per cent a year, we envisaged in the First Programme an increase of an average of two per cent a year.  In the event, we achieved an annual increase of the gross national product of some four per cent.  It was reasonable to assume, on the basis of that experience that we could maintain that kind of increase during the currency of the Second Programme.  Unfortunately, we did run into the kind of difficulties in 1965-66 that are now threatening us at this stage.  We took action against them that was timely&mdash; but not timely enough to ensure the maintenance of a four per cent growth rate.  In the event, we had a two per cent growth rate in 1965 and one and a half per cent in 1966 but we came back again, mainly because of the temporary measures we took, to reach a growth rate of four per cent in the last two years, and we envisage maintaining that growth rate, if not a slight increase on it, during the course of the Third Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> Unfortunately, the world-wide inflationary trend has now set in against us but on this occasion we have taken timely action.  We can envisage a maintenance of the growth rate that we now enjoy, something like four per cent right through 1969-70 and subsequent years.  I agree entirely that it is difficult for businessmen to plan effectively their forward programmes, if they are not sure from one year to another that there may not be a second increase in taxation.  I suggest that a second or supplementary Budget, a second increase in taxation, is far more beneficial to the country generally than to ignore the kind of trend that would lead us into an inflationary position from which we could not recover for some time.  We would have only a few years of great effort and great hardship and a running down of employment generally.</P>
    <P>It is not ideal that we should have supplementary budgets.  But it is far better that we should take action of this nature rather than that the economy run down, rather than refuse to face up to the realities of the situation, rather than refuse to face whatever political unpopularity measures of this nature usually involve.  Therefore, I suggest that the Government were doing what was right in the circumstances. Speaking of inflation, I do not accept at all the facile interpretation of Government policy which Deputy Dillon mentioned a few minutes ago&mdash; that we have accepted an annual inflationary rate of 4 per cent.  I do not accept that at all.  We recognise that inflation exists.  Deputy Dillon expounded on the effects inflation has had in certain countries, and warned that, ultimately, serious effects could flow from continued inflation in this country.  I agree entirely that they could, but there is not much point in Deputy Dillon berating the Government or anybody else unless he can come up with a satisfactory solution. Our alternative is to encourage as far as possible by any means we can, by inducements, by encouraging verbally and by practical measures, the increase in productivity of our various economic activities&mdash;mainly farming and industry &mdash;and trying to ensure, as far as possible, that increases in productivity will <Col N="1926" /> at least match the increases in costs of production, these increases being mainly taken in the industrial sector, by increased wages which the workers have won for themselves by free negotiation.  Free negotiation will continue to be the means whereby our industrial workers can win for themselves increased benefits by way of increased wages or conditions, or otherwise. There is no other way the system can work properly and certainly, as far as we are concerned, we do not see any other way for doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that Germany was an example of a country that can make progress and ensure that inflationary trends do not follow in the wake of progress.  The West Germans had a strong incentive.  They had emerged from the Second World War with a divided country.  They got assistance, admittedly, through the Marshall Aid Plan particularly and in other respects as well, but they used it wisely and in West Germany the circumstances made for an updated industrial system.  We have, unfortunately, a rather outworn industrial system, one we inherited from Great Britain.  We are left with some of the worst aspects of that system and it is up to our employers generally to improve our industrial relations system, which is possible, to ensure that there is better understanding between both sides, to ensure on the employers' side that they recognise the need for improved working conditions and on the workers' side that they recognise the difficulties of employers as well, difficulties in particular in relation to the maintenance of the competitiveness of the particular undertaking.  That is the key point.  If wages continue to outstrip productivity, this and the competitiveness of the particular industry in which the workers are employed will become less and less and then the output will become less and less because the industry will tend to become insolvent.  With regard to our export markets, unless we produce competitively against other countries then our exports are bound to go down, our employment will not be maintained; on the contrary it will be reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said <Col N="1927" /> that we have not been doing enough to ensure that we gain access to wider markets.  I can claim that we are trying to do all that we can to encourage existing Irish manufacturers to seek export markets for their products in countries other than the United Kingdom. Córas Tráchtála have in recent years stepped up their activities through their representatives in different countries.  Everywhere Ministers have gone, including myself, we have tried to ensure that increased outlets would be gained for our industrial products, and indeed agricultural products, in markets other than the traditional ones, the main one being Great Britain.  We have been increasing our exports not only to Britain but to the Common Market countries and to the United States as well.  These two are our second largest markets after the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I announced the initiation of negotiations for a trade agreement with Japan.  We believe there are prospects in Japan for our exports once we get to know each other and know what the Japanese require and the standards of delivery they require as well.  This will be worked out in the coming weeks and months to see to what extent we can come to an arrangement with them. At the same time, we are exploring the possibility of opening up markets in East European countries.  In this connection the House will be aware of the visit of the Minister for External Affairs to Moscow to sign the NonProliferation Agreement some months ago, when he exchanged lists of commodities with the appropriate Ministers there of the products we can export to them.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to suggest that because of the existence of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement we are concentrating only on the British market.  It is true that 70 per cent of our exports go to that market.  It is true also, no matter how we may see otherwise, that the great bulk of our exports will go to that market in the years to come.  It is facilitated by the traditional pattern, by the existence of commercial dealings and other factors which are common to both countries and which will, therefore, facilitate a greater outflow <Col N="1928" /> of goods to that country than to any other.</P>
    <P>In this connection, too, Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the traditional co-operation and constructiveness of Fine Gael in trying to encourage the expansion of our economy.  I think the last effort in this area was not very conducive to objectivity or constructiveness or the encouragement of the best interests of our economy in that, when we very quickly introduced a system of assistance for our exporters to the British market in order to offset the effects of the deposit scheme, the Fine Gael Party derided these methods and were anything but helpful in ensuring that the action we took would be a success.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that Deputy Tully did not get permission to expand because I had taken some notes on what he was about to say and I had some arguments ready&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We get plenty of criticism and we are well able to stand up to it.  I do not want to go into any great detail about the subject matter of this debate except to correct an impression that, perhaps, Deputy O'Higgins inadvertently gave when he referred to the increased cost of driving a motor car.  I trust he did not wish to suggest that petrol was one of the commodities affected.  I presume he was referring to the purchase of motor cars and the effect the increase in wholesale tax will have.  There was no suggestion whatever in this supplementary Budget of increasing the tax on petrol: we deliberately refrained from doing so because it would have added to the costs of industrial production and&mdash;to an extent&mdash;agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> Deputy Esmonde mentioned that the legislation envisaged in the Budget debate last spring as regards Schedules A and B of the income tax code has not yet been introduced.  That is so. During the course of the Budget debate the Minister did say that tax under Schedules A and B would not be chargeable in 1969-70.  That will still be the case.  Unfortunately, the Minister's illness delayed the preparation of this legislation which is very complicated. Nevertheless, that delay will not affect his undertaking as to the incidence of tax under Schedules A and B.</P>
    <P>The overall comment I should like to make is that the situation in this country is such that we cannot isolate ourselves from the economic winds raging throughout Europe and, indeed, throughout the whole world, at present.  Almost every country, with the exception of Germany, is in the middle of this unfortunate inflationary process. We took fairly timely action to offset it.  We recognise our action may not be completely effective to stop inflation once and for all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to this Budget as being, in itself, inflationary while many members of his Party denounced it as deflationary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various means of providing against inflation. <Col N="1930" /> You can use monetary or fiscal measures.  Monetary measures are usually restrictions such as those in the field of hire purchase.  Fiscal measures are those taken to raise taxation.  Fiscal measures are considered by some to be the most effective means of dealing with inflationary trends.  The advice recently given by the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development and, indeed, by the International Monetary Fund is that more use should be made, in circumstances like this, of fiscal measures.</P>
      <P>It is fairly up-to-date economic thinking now that fiscal measures are about the most effective means of controlling inflation.  If we had not taken the action we took, the situation would have become much worse already.  The situation would have arisen where our balance of payments would have gone so much against us that it would be very difficult for us to recover.  When that kind of trend is seen to start, naturally its own consequences have effects upon us but they generally have other results&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as Deputy Dillon so well put it during the course of the debate.  As soon as people who have money invested in this country&mdash; whether they are native or non-native &mdash;see these trends developing&mdash;see the balance of payments going out of equilibrium, then they begin to draw off their investments and to put their investments where the payments are in better balance.  As well as that, the kind of capital on which we depend to a large extent for our economic progress &mdash;investment capital from abroad&mdash; begins to dry up.  We had that situation in 1965 and 1966.  Fortunately, I think we have been able to avoid any movement in that direction.</P>
      <P>I believe people will see that we have been running our affairs well, wisely and fearlessly, and there will be confidence in the country amongst our own people and the confidence of those from outside who have invested here will be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, in the end, it is our own people and, to use the term Deputy <Col N="1931" /> O'Higgins used, sinn féin, on whom we shall ultimately have to depend. Unless our people recognise that we must earn at least as much as we are spending then we cannot survive.  If we spend more than we can earn, the inevitable will follow.  We want to be able to maintain the increased standards of living which I feel are due to all our people.  It depends on the will and the effort of the Irish people who are at least as good as any other people in the world&mdash;I shall not claim they are better&mdash;if they work to the extent to which I think they can work. If they recognise the difficulties that will follow from doing less work for more wages, if it can be explained to them that not only will their own jobs become affected but that the job potential of posterity will be affected, then I think it will be realised by them that they should work a little harder. The term &ldquo;workers&rdquo; to me embraces everybody who has to earn a living&mdash; whether with the hands, the head or through business acumen.  Everybody in the country can, I believe&mdash;and <Col N="1932" /> must&mdash;do that little bit extra.  We are only a small developing country in the middle of huge economies with great natural resources such as the United States of America and countries of the continent of Europe.  We have not such resources.  However, those countries also are beset by inflationary trends.  They have to take action, from time to time.  It is impossible for us to ignore these trends or to immunise ourselves against that kind of action.  We must get that message across to our people.</P>
    <P>Even though we must rely on investment from abroad, even though we must rely on the markets to which foreigners who set up factories here already have access, and even though we must have these aims as well, and that kind of assistance, in the long run it depends on ourselves and I believe that, if this message is got across to the Irish people, we can withstand these inflationary trends which seem to be so recurrent in these modern times.</P>

Will we get a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill <Col N="1935" /> or will we have to wait until next year?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was discussing with some Members across the House statements about four-seat constituencies.  We had Deputy Treacy who was very critical of the four-seat constituencies here in Dublin.  There was a Labour Convention in Ennis last Sunday and the members there instructed their delegates to have an amendment moved here <Col N="1936" /> in the House that the constituency would be made a four-seater.  They cannot be shouting for four-seaters in one place and not have them in another.  It seems that the Opposition generally seem to shout &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo; without looking at the position one way or another.  Many of them have not yet spoken; those who have are contradicting each other.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to my own county of Cork.  At column 1266 of the Official Report of 27th November, 1968, Deputy Treacy said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A large portion of North Cork has been detached and is now being added to Mid-Cork.  This proposal, too, is quite unnecessary and is designed solely on a selfish political basis to try and weaken Fine Gael and Labour in these two constituencies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the very same day, 27th November, 1968, at column 1276 we have Deputy Barrett, a Fine Gael Deputy from Cork saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the last occasion the constituencies were carved up&mdash;and plainly in a spirit of gerrymandering which had no regard whatsoever for a portion of the constituency which, whilst it was then in the county, always looked upon itself as part of Cork City constituency&mdash;the Minister and his Party proceeded to carve up the areas of Blackrock and Douglas in such a way that an area of the city, within a quarter of a mile of the City Hall, was shifted into a constituency which sprawled itself away down through County Cork and on to the borders of County Kerry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have Deputy Treacy stating that there is no need to change the constituency and Deputy Barrett stating there was no need to have Blackrock and Douglas added to the Mid-Cork constituency.  Deputy Barrett was speaking about 1961.  They are contradicting each other.  When one comes to Blackrock and Douglas in 1961 it is well to remember that they were part of County Cork and that they were electing members to the Cork County Council.  They were not in the city then.  However, since then they have been taken into Cork city and they are <Col N="1937" /> now electing members of the corporation. It is only right that Blackrock and Douglas should form part of Cork city constituency or constituencies as the case may be.</P>
    <P>We have the usual remarks here from people like Deputy Barrett who always bring it up one way or another about &ldquo;sprawling itself away down to the borders of County Kerry&rdquo;.  One would think that we people who live on the borders of County Kerry have a malignant disease and should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also states at column 1277 of the Official Report of 27th November, 1968:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are fully aware that the Minister and his Party will have the most cynical disregard for their rights if their rights clash with the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party, because the reason Blackrock and Douglas were pushed out of Mid-Cork was because they were very notably Fine Gael in their sympathies and that disturbed the balance of Fianna Fáil's power in Cork City&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer Deputy Barrett back to the general election of 1965. when Fine Gael had a candidate in the field from the Blackrock/Douglas area.  In that election the quota was 8,000 odd and over 40,000 voters cast their votes.  The Fine Gael candidate from that area polled 789 votes.  This is the area which is supposed to be predominantly Fine Gael.  Our candidates in the same area got close on 3,000 first preference votes.  This is an inaccuracy which I would like to be put on record.  Again, we were speaking about statements being accurate and I would like to go back to column 1276 of 27th November, 1968.  Deputy Barrett said as regards the people of Blackrock and Douglas:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If they wanted to find a TD they had to hie themselves off to the country, the nearest TD being at Bandon or in Macroom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is very unbecoming of Deputy Barrett or anybody else to cast a slur on a Deputy who lives close to me and is my good friend, Mrs. Eileen Desmond.  It is bad form that <Col N="1938" /> she should be deliberately omitted. After all, she was elected as a Member of the Dáil in the general election of 1965.  She headed the poll at that time.  It is very strange that we have here a man who is regarded as a leading Fine Gael personality in a city of 120,000 population and that he does not know a Labour Deputy who resides within seven or eight miles of his home.  He would probably go astray there.  If he is in any difficulty I will be glad to show him around the area.</P>
    <P>This morning we heard Deputy Burton and Deputy Collins, who spoke about mid-Cork.  Deputy Collins was bemoaning the fact that the Béara peninsula was going in with County Kerry and was being halved.  Everybody knew that County Kerry in itself had not enough population to maintain six Deputies and that, if they are to maintain six Deputies, population would have to be added from some other area.  Senator FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>I would suggest adding the districts of Knocknagree, Cullen, Doonasheen, Derragh, Caherbarnagh and Coomlogan.</P>
    <P>That was a different part of Cork but, on Senator FitzGerald's suggestion, we would actually have a parish halved. The Minister would be accused of gerrymandering if he did that in order to get three seats in South Kerry.  It was obvious they were going to say he was gerrymandering for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>As regards the area of mid-Cork I think it is properly described as a truly rural area.  I am very glad it is a truly rural area.  I hope I will be able to represent those people after the next general election.  It is strange that when I went to West and South West Cork many people welcomed me though many of them were of a different political viewpoint. They stressed the importance of having their Deputy living in the constituency.  They were not used to it because of the Fine Gael Deputy who had represented them for years.  I should like to emphasise that it is only right that when a TD is elected he should live within his area as much as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1939" /> Deputy Seán Collins announced to all and sundry that he would be reelected in the next general election, that we in Fianna Fáil would not put him out.  The only danger there lies within his own Party: there are a few young colts there fretting at the reins and he may have a problem keeping them down.  However, that is his business, not ours.</P>
    <P>From what Deputy James Tully said it appears that the Labour Party would like to see general elections occur on Sundays.  I thoroughly disagree.  Irish people generally, regardless of their religious persuasion, have always held that Sunday should be a free day, away from work or any political activity as regards polling, <i>et cetera</i>. Long may it remain that way.  There was talk by the Opposition to the effect that it is the plain people of Ireland who will decide the next general election and that it was they who defeated the referendum&mdash;the ordinary man and woman.  Do we not all know that Fine Gael represent the upper class, the conservative element, in the urban areas and that they have their eyes set on the 400 acre farms in the rural areas?  Do we not also know that when there was a Coalition Government Labour, strange to say, came in and backed Fine Gael and that the ordinary man and woman got very little by way of social service improvement from the Labour Party who rowed in with the conservative Party?</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in conclusion about Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that this Bill should be known as a &ldquo;Bolander.&rdquo; Deputy Boland is the Minister whose duty it was to introduce this Bill. He brought it in, he was qualified to bring it in.  This Minister has true Republican blood in his veins&mdash;those who came before him were of that outlook.  All I can say is that I wish him many years of success in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  The Opposition have said it may not be long before there is a general election.  The day may not be far away but we will meet them and beat them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention <Col N="1940" /> to speak for long.  I should like to refer to a few remarks by Deputy Meaney.  He referred to the people whom we in Fine Gael represent, and at one stage he said we are associated with people who own 400 acres of land or more.  The constituency I have represented to date is probably the biggest in the country and I doubt if there is one individual in it who owns 400 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Deputy knows either the policy of Fianna Fáil or of Fine Gael so there is no point in arguing with him.  If the Deputy went to Cork and spoke there as he did here today and if every person in the constituency heard him he would not be long here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean much to the man in the street whether he votes in a three-seat, a four-seat or a five-seat constituency.  Only those who are well versed in politics know the difference between the three-seat, the four-seat and the five-seat constituency and there cannot be a complaint about how these constituencies have been drafted as far as the Minister's Party are concerned.  The Minister for Local Government did an effective job, probably the most effective ever done, in the division of constituencies.  I will refer firstly to what he did to my neighbouring county, Mayo.  Traditionally, there were North Mayo and South Mayo and, as we all know, there have been two Fianna Fáil Ministers returned from South Mayo with two Fine Gael representatives also.  Due to the fall in population in Mayo, it was not entitled any longer to four seats in each constituency.  If they were reduced to three seats, there was a danger that one of the sitting Ministers would lose his seat.  So what did they do?  They drew a stroke from north to south of the county and ensured that the Minister for Justice was on one side of it and the Minister for Health on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Geographically speaking, this is unfair. <Col N="1941" /> North Mayo should have been left as it was and given three seats and South Mayo should have been left as it was and given the same number of seats.  If that had been done, however, one member of the Fianna Fáil Party, now a Cabinet Minister, would no longer be elected.  The same occurred in Donegal which also had been split from east to west.  Now it is being split from north to south.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the majority of the constituencies are four-seaters.  In any of these constituencies, less than 50 per cent of the vote will ensure two out of four seats.  If you had 60 per cent of the poll you could get three out of the four seats.  As I have said, with 40 per cent of the votes you would be guaranteed two seats.  Fianna Fáil's general idea in Dublin, where their popularity is probably at its lowest ever, is to get two seats, to give one to Labour and one to Fine Gael.  I am sure the Minister had this idea in mind when he drew up the boundaries.  He has told us that some of them are not finalised and I am sure that if Fianna Fáil cumainn point out to him that it would be more advantageous to have this bit out and that bit in he will agree.</P>
    <P>In reference to the west again, 150,957 people have emigrated from that region during the last 40 years, 46,000 having gone during the last ten years.  I would go into the counties in detail but I feel sure the Minister for Local Government knows exactly the number of people who have left each county.  Galway has lost 7,213; Roscommon 7,400; Mayo 18,000; Leitrim 7,000 and Sligo 6,000.  If those people could find a living in their own country I am sure they would have stayed but their emigration is due to the fact that we have had a Fianna Fáil Government in office for so long who have done very little for these people.  That is the reason we have lost seats now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out to the Deputy that emigration is not within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's viewpoint but I was merely pointing out that the number of people who have left the west of Ireland would constitute <Col N="1942" /> approximately two more seats here in the Dáil and the reason we have lost two seats is, in all probability, because we have had a Fianna Fáil Government for so long.</P>
      <P>The constituency which I hope to represent in future will now be known as North-East Galway.  I must say I am sorry that the part of South Galway that formed part of East Galway has been taken away from me but I am sure that the people in that area who supported me in the past will support the Fine Gael Deputy for that area now and prospective Fine Gael candidates as well.</P>
      <P>I would like also to welcome the people of West Roscommon into North-East Galway.  It seems that the Minister for Education was not altogether happy with the people around the Cloonfad and Athleague districts because he no longer saw fit to keep them in that area.  Of course, this takes trouble off his hands because these districts are within the Suck basin and for a long time past he has been promising them drainage.  He has got that off his hands now and it will be the responsibility of those who represent North-East Galway in the future.</P>
      <P>This is an example of what the Minister for Local Government would have done if PR had been abolished. It seems to me that the Minister had a commission or his own organisation working on this for a long time because these boundaries were drawn very quickly indeed.  I was surprised at the very efficient manner in which the Minister introduced this Bill and the fact that he introduced it so quickly after the referendum.  I am sure that, if PR had been abolished, he would have introduced another Bill setting out the single-seat constituencies.  I dread to think what that would have been like considering the job he has done on those three-, four- and five-seaters&mdash; three-seaters where he has a chance of winning two and four-seaters where in all probability he will only get one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I forecast that, as good as the job is that has been done by the Minister to gerrymander constituencies and to ensure maximum Fianna Fáil representation, this will backfire on the people who drew it up in the same way as <Col N="1943" /> their efforts to abolish PR backfired. I have no doubt it will backfire at the next general election.  It might have been possible in the past to pull the wool over people's eyes but the people today are more awake than they ever were in the past.  I know that at the next general election they will give you the answer they gave in the referendum and which you hope they will not give you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my few points to this debate and to say that we are going through a constitutional exercise which has been described as vindictive gerrymandering and getting our own back on the people.  The attacks that have been made by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party have been heard before. No matter what way the constituencies are revised, in the last analysis it is the people who will decide who will go and who will stay.  We have no fears in relation to that particular problem. We will face up to our responsibilities now, just as we will in the future.  It is about time the Opposition speakers, both Labour and Fine Gael, grew up and realised that it is the people who will decide; that the composition of this House cannot be decided in the House but only outside it.  It is only people who are afraid of the decision of the electorate who are terrorised in the manner in which the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies seem to be terrorised here.  When &ldquo;the chips are down&rdquo;, the Irish people are an intelligent people.  They have displayed this intelligence in elections over a long number of years.  When it comes to deciding whether they should remain in employment or not, then they will decide whom to vote for&mdash;and they can only vote for one Party, Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Fine Gael Deputy for Cavan describing the Minister's Bill in a certain type of way.  I would say in relation to this particular Deputy that he is &ldquo;Fitzpandering&rdquo; to the weak-kneed politicians, trying to terrorise those unfortunate men into a situation where they will believe they will lose their seats as a result of the revision.  There is no doubt drones must <Col N="1944" /> be frightened and terrorised.  The lost years of inactivity must be staring them in the face.  Now that the situation has caught up with them, I can understand that they should have this great feeling of fear they have displayed here during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party should change their name to the Political Legal Adoption Society of Ireland and adopt the Labour Party.  It would seem this is what they are trying to do.  During the referendum campaign they were concerned about the future of the Labour Party.  Now they are concerned about the future of the Deputies of the Labour Party.  I am not so sure this particular &ldquo;adoption society&rdquo; is not endeavouring to get into its ranks the super socialists we hear so much from in the Labour Benches as they have done in the past with a number of other political organisations that came into the House.  The efforts of Deputy Donegan and many others to attract the socialists over to the Fine Gael benches may succeed at some stage.  At the moment both Parties are just putting up a front.  The people do not know what is going on behind the scenes, that the &ldquo;backroom boys&rdquo; of both Parties are conniving and supporting one another in their campaign of terror and character assassination here in the House&mdash;the campaign that was carried on so forcibly during the referendum.  Efforts have been made by many of the speakers here to carry this out.  I want to sound a warning at this stage to the Front Bench of both Labour and Fine Gael.  The next time I hear comments such as have been made in relation to honourable men on this side of the House I will read out, paragraph by paragraph, what these men stood for and their misdeeds, and they will go out of this House very sorry men.  That is what is coming to those people who attacked honest men in the malicious manner they did in the not too distant past.</P>
    <P>The area I am about to represent is one on which I will stake my claim. Ballyfermot is coming into my area and I welcome it with open arms. Some of the finest people in the country come from Ballyfermot and <Col N="1945" /> Inchicore.  I do not shrink with terror like some others at a new place coming into my area.  This is a very fine area and I gladly accept it.  People who have done their work honestly have nothing to be afraid of.  It is only the TDs who did not do their jobs well in the past and who now find their past is catching up with them who have something to be afraid of.  They relied on the historical situation in the country and they are now having to meet the possibility of having a revised area.  It is quite obvious from the terror we have seen in the eyes of the Opposition that those unfortunate men may well have a political breakdown as well as a mental breakdown before the next general election.</P>
    <P>It is easy to pick those people out. You can pick out the happy ones and the unhappy ones and you can also pick out the drones.  There are many of them in this House and they now have to do something at last.  We heard very few complaints from this side of the House because, as I said before, we are quite sure that the people of this nation, when called on, will put their marks on the ballot paper and will do so in a responsible manner. In the Ballyfermot area I am going to represent I want to sound a note of warning for the socialist Santa Claus who is going to get his long beard singed in the very near future.  We have heard his complaints on this Bill and on other Bills and I want to warn him that he will be answered quite definitely in the future.  I am quite sure this Bill will go through in the very capable hands of a very capable Minister and I am quite sure the people will get value for their money from their representatives who will be elected by them.</P>
    <P>I listened with some interest to Deputy Donnellan, a man with great imagination.  He spoke about the four-seat constituencies and said that one would only need to get about 40 per cent of the votes to get two seats.  We gave you the option of one seat for 51 per cent.  Now you are claiming that we can get two seats with 40 per cent.  You cannot have it both ways. We are prepared to face a situation <Col N="1946" /> in which you would have to get 51 per cent for one seat.</P>

      <P>The number of four-seaters in the country in 1961 was 12 and now it is only 14 so it is not a big difference.  It is only 12 as against 14. If that was the system which was to obtain surely we would have all four-seaters but there is only an increase of two.  However, I do not want to detain the House very long.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure it will give satisfaction to the majority of the people.</P>
      <P>I note, as a Dublin Deputy, the population explosion in the city has meant that we need further representatives. We cannot be held responsible either individually or collectively in this Party for that explosion as it is something which happens in a progressive city.  As a result, there is bound to be this increase in representatives.  We hope this trend will continue.  No doubt people have been attracted to the city because of employment opportunities or other factors.</P>

With the development of the industrial estate in Galway and the industrial estate at Shannon I hope there is not sabotage in the future as Shannon was sabotaged in the past.</P>

The ghosts of the Labour Party are sitting in the front benches. There is not a Member present.  That shows their interest in the Bill.  They are like terrified men prowling the constituencies scratching out envelopes to send cards to their constituents. Some of them appeared in my new area from the socialist Santa Claus. He would want to dig much deeper into the bag next year or there will be nothing left.  That is the Ballyfermot area which I have already mentioned. I took a small trip through the area the other day and noticed the desperate conditions in it.  I will have to work hard next year or maybe the next two or three years to put this area on its feet.  Nevertheless, I tackle it with great pride and on the understanding that the people there are good and honest people.</P>

While I am here I shall make every effort to obtain nothing but the best for the very fine people there.  I now want to refer to the other area in my constituency, Inchicore, where the sabotage took <Col N="1948" /> place not so long ago in relation to the chassis works designed to employ 3,000 people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Had this taken place, there would be 3,000 more people in the area and I might not have had to take so many people in from outside. I am prepared to make that sacrifice in the interests of the community, to serve these people, although far removed from me.  I regret that the industrial workers who should have been employed in Inchicore are not there now but I will do my part to rectify this situation and to see, if possible, that there will be quite a substantial number of people there by the end of my time as a representative for the area.  I have already asked the Minister, in relation to this area, to speed up the services that would create more employment there and, therefore, swell still further the population of this prosperous and ever-expanding area.</P>
      <P>There was mention made today of the Senator's alternative.  At least, one thing can be said about the Senator: he gave this matter some consideration. It would seem from the comments of the rest of the Fine Gael Party that they neither heeded him nor gave him any assistance.  The suggestions made by many Fine Gael speakers certainly did not coincide with the suggestion made by the Senator.  Nevertheless, the Senator did give consideration to the matter and was prepared to put the facts on paper.</P>
      <P>Once again, I want to compliment the Minister on the difficult job he has done.  As Deputy Burke said earlier today, it is impossible to please everybody. The people who are most noticeably displeased are the drones and those who after years of inactivity are horrified that they may lose the little bit of leather that they sit on in this House, as I have no doubt they will when they go before the people in the very near future.  The people are always conscious of the fact that while Fianna Fáil are in office they will be in employment.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate.  I am quite satisfied with the area which I have got.  I believe that any Deputy who has done his work properly for the people should not be afraid to enter the contest in any constituency that he is given.  The last speaker mentioned Deputies who did not do their job.  In this connection I can see a few of the heads opposite falling.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies in the west of Ireland did nothing to try to arrest the tidal wave of emigration which has been going on in the west for at least a quarter of a century.  A great deal has been said by Deputies on the opposite side of the House about the loss of Deputies which is about to take place in the west.  It may be that we will lose two or three Deputies in the west of Ireland but let us look at the reason for this.  The reason is not what happened in the referendum.  The reason is the neglect by the Fianna Fáil administration down the years which allowed 44,000 people from the province of Connacht to emigrate in the past ten years.</P>

      <P>With due respect, I think this is pertinent to the discussion, that we would not lose two Deputies in the west of Ireland had that emigration been arrested.  There would be 44,000 extra people in the west, which would give us at least two more Deputies. There appeared to be a ring of dissatisfaction in the voices of those who spoke of our losing two or three Deputies.  That loss does not surprise me, having regard to the neglect of the west that has taken place over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much the demise of <Col N="1950" /> Leitrim as a political entity in our national Parliament.  I cannot understand why the name of Leitrim will no longer appear on the political scene.  I see no reason why the constituency comprising the area I represent should not be called Sligo-Leitrim or why the constituency comprising part of Leitrim and Donegal should not be called Donegal-Leitrim or why the constituency comprising part of Leitrim and Roscommon should not be called Roscommon-Leitrim.  It is noticeable that the constituency comprising part of Clare and Galway is to be called Clare-Galway. It is not very clear to me whether that is due to political figures having associations with Clare.  If that is the reason, may I suggest that we had great national heroes in Leitrim also and, if that is the case, it would constitute an insult to Leitrim that gave us the great Seán MacDiarmada?  I have had close associations with Leitrim all my life.  For 25 years, before I became a Member of this House, when part of Leitrim was in my constituency, I worked there as a young man and I found the people of Leitrim to be the kindest and most generous that I have ever met.  Leitrim got the rawest deal of any county.  The people of Leitrim withstood the evictions of the notorious Lord Leitrim.  The people there now are the descendants of those who were driven into the hillsides and had to live amid rocks and rushes.  It is the memory of these people that has been insulted by the deletion of the name of Leitrim from the political map.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked from the opposite side of the House, what was the alternative, what was the cure? When the proposal to change the constituencies was first mooted I forecast to many people in this House what would happen and the reasons why it would happen.  The reasons were very plain to me.  The entire rot in the division of the constituencies in the west of Ireland set in in Donegal.  There were two three-seat constituencies in Donegal.  In each constituency there were two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Fine Gael Deputy.  If Donegal were made a five-seater the Government were bound to lose a Deputy; they could not get four out of five, and it might have <Col N="1951" /> been a Minister who would have gone. I do not say that if we were in power we would not do the same, but I am pointing out that this is where all the trouble started.</P>
    <P>If Donegal became a five-seater, there were a few thousand left who could have been pushed into Sligo-Leitrim. Sligo-Leitrim had exactly enough for four seats: Sligo, about 50,000, and Leitrim, about 30,000.  As I said, Donegal had to retain these two three-seaters and this had to be done at the expense of mutilating Leitrim. Once that happened no other change could have been made except to put central Leitrim in with Sligo and the south in with Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to Leitrim disappearing off the map in the context of the Taoiseach's visit to Drumshanbo during the referendum campaign, when he bewailed the plight of County Leitrim, which, of course, is the most depressed county in Ireland.  At the same time, he had in his pocket an £8 million contract for an industry in this country, and we know where he put it, in his own city of Cork.  If he was in earnest, why did he not put that industry in Leitrim, whose condition he bemoaned so much?  That industry would have arrested emigration and possibly emigrants would return to build up the population so that we could have an extra Deputy there.</P>
    <P>If this Bill passes and if I am returned again, I should like to welcome the new area of Leitrim in with Sligo, that is Ballinamore and south of it, and I can assure them of my best attention in solving any of their little problems if and when asked to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody looking at this action by the Minister for Local Government does not have to go too far under the surface to see that this has been a deliberate, last-minute subterfuge adopted by the Minister in his disappointment and in trying to recover from what the people told him in no uncertain manner on 16th October last.  He now finds himself like the drowning man who will grasp at any straw passing by on the surface of the tide in order to save himself and to <Col N="1952" /> ease his conscience in respect of what he tried to perpetrate through the referendum.</P>
      <P>The people are not fools, and in his desperation he now comes along and as he himself and members of his own Cabinet have said, they will now start on the butchering operation.  What he means or who he means to butcher, whether it is the land of Ireland or the people of Ireland, is a matter for conjecture. My view is that by this hasty action the Minister is seeking refuge and succour and trying to safeguard himself and the dying Party he represents.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think this will be an injection that will bring back again the Party which he represents on to the republican road we had not heard of for a long time until the representative from Donegal mentioned it some days ago and was publicly rebuked by his own Leader for the statement he made, in the presence of no less than two ambassadors to this country who were listening in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery?  If the Minister thinks that he can now introduce Kathleen Ní hUallacháin and break the shackles that have bound us to a foreign foe, that he can wave the republican flag which was buried and buried long ago by his Party, he has another guess coming.</P>
      <P>In this last-minute effort to retrieve himself and his Party he is only going further into the mire and he will sink down and drag the Party with him in this exercise.  Anybody with only half an eye on political affairs in the country today knows in his heart and soul that this effort by the Minister has not got anything like the support he thought he should get from within his own Party.  We know that members of his own Party made him change his mind with regard to the butchering operation which he wanted to carry out and of which he is well capable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk for a moment about my own constituency.  We had a surplus in East Limerick and it was generally known and spoken of by the intelligentsia of the Minister's Party how the butchering was going to operate in Limerick.  However, having assessed the position, his own members in desperation, <Col N="1953" /> and knowing exactly what would happen, made a last-minute effort and got him to change his mind and leave a particular electoral area and take over another to safeguard their own interest.  That is common property.  It applied in East Limerick. A similar situation existed in West Limerick.  His own Deputies knew it and they fled like scalded cats to try to change his mind regarding the butchering operation he had in mind there.  West Limerick was short of the quota undoubtedly; so was North Kerry and it was his intention to take some of West Limerick and land it into North Kerry across the river.  The pressure groups got busy and the Minister had to pull down his flag and tack his sails and turn from North Kerry to South Kerry.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the slaughter of the &ldquo;Holy Innocents&rdquo; in the Banner county of Clare who have stood by the Party for so long in their stupidity and we find that all that was needed in Clare to make a fourth seat was 3,000 votes.  They knew they could only get two elected in Clare, the Minister for Labour, God help us, and some old throwback that they would bring in for good measure and so it was no advantage to the Party to bring in 3,000 people into Clare and make it a four-seat constituency.  Somebody else would benefit but not themselves in the Minister's view.  So he divided Clare from the Atlantic Ocean to the Shannon, took 15,000 votes from it and threw them into Galway to make a threeseater of this famous constituency of Clare-Galway to suit himself and his Party.  He divided Clare from Lisdoonvarna across to Killaloe knowing very well that the Minister for Labour was snugly tucked in between Ennis and West Clare.</P>
    <P>Then what would he do?  Last Monday he had received advice from members of his own Party through the urban council of Ennis and Clare County Council that a protest was signed by members of his own Party dissociating themselves from his action in this butchering operation.  That was passed at the Ennis Urban Council and the members of his Party who signed it were brought to a special meeting called and held in Ennis on Monday. <Col N="1954" /> The local Deputy was sent down to castigate the members of his own Party who signed the protest.  They were hauled before the council meeting and chastisement was administered to them. They had to come into the council chamber and talk their way out of it as best they could and make excuses for their action in signing the protest.</P>
    <P>This is what has happened as a result of the Minister's action and he cannot deny it.  It is something we shall talk about as we did prior to the 16th October, something I hope the Minister will take cognisance of, if he can retain the memory of what the people of Clare and Limerick say about his action.  The Clare constituency is now butchered in such a way that one mile from Ennis the people no longer vote for a Clare man.  That is part of ClareGalway. But the Minister went further afield into County Roscommon and took a piece out of Roscommon to make up the constituency of Clare-Galway. If that is not butchering brought to the nth degree I am no mathematician.  The people of Clare know why this was done and nobody better than the Minister for Labour but the people of Clare will give their answer in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>Is there any justice, honesty or fair play in this action?  The honest-minded Fianna Fáil supporter who thinks back to the 16th October will reflect again because they have all seen the double dealing which the Minister has brought to his task since he took over his Department.  We in the Labour Party are not afraid to face the people at any time.  We are always honest with them and we have taken the honest, longterm view on these matters.  Whatever way the Minister tries to butcher&mdash;his own words &mdash; constituencies &mdash; whether he means the land or the people, I do not know; eventually it is the people&mdash; he will get the answer he deserves.</P>
    <P>There are much greater issues to be resolved; there are bigger things in the destiny of the nation that we cannot have discussed.  We cannot let the people of Ireland into the knowledge of what is taking place or what should be discussed but we are rushing into this as we rushed headlong into the referendum operation and there is no doubt in <Col N="1955" /> my mind about the outcome of this operation by the Minister for Local Government.  Let us not leave this today without impressing on him that the result of his action will boomerang with the same velocity as did the result of the referendum on 16th of October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the start of this discussion on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill I have been amazed at the inconsistency of the Opposition Benches.  Indeed, one could say that the Opposition have been using cajolery and humbug to confuse and cloud up the issue.  This will not pay any dividend. Their insincerity is obvious and it is plain to see that they have no regard whatsoever for the intelligence of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>A Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick, when opening the discussion on this Bill on behalf of his Party certainly put up a very good show.  He did his best despite the fact that he had very little to go on.  He was, of course, very critical at the start of his speech that the Bill was not recommended by the Minister.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I believe that it happened in 1959 and also in 1961.  He made what can now be expected of Fine Gael, a sly attack on the character of the Minister for Local Government because the same Minister who is now introducing this Bill was with us as Minister for Local Government when the referendum proposals were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These remarks and the approach of Deputy Fitzpatrick have well and truly been answered by speakers from this side of the House.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is to be complimented on his valiant efforts to introduce the commission into this discussion because he got his point on record despite all the efforts of the Chair.  He went on to accuse us of gerrymandering under this new Bill but I should like to refresh the mind of Deputy Fitzpatrick and all those who think like him that the same thing was said of us and would have been said of us if the straight vote had been accepted and if PR had been abolished.  The main cry of the Opposition <Col N="1956" /> during the referendum campaign was that we would have wholesale gerrymandering and I suppose they are now trying the same approach under the present system, the system of PR.</P>
    <P>This is a repetition also of their approach to the Electoral Bill of 1961. We know that the 1959 revision was virtually an agreed revision; boundaries were to be breached and there was to be fair representation for rural Ireland and the west.  I understand that this approach was specifically endorsed by the then Leader of Fine Gael.  Soon after the passing of the Bill, however, legal proceedings were instigated by the then Fine Gael Senator, Dr. John O'Donovan, acting through Fine Gael lawyers, to have this measure declared unconstitutional precisely because of its approach to rural representation.</P>
    <P>We all know that the court held the 1959 Act to be unconstitutional and Dr. O'Donovan and his friends were, therefore, quite pleased with their work and, as a result, a revision of the constituencies had to take place in 1961. However, in 1961 the Bill was bitterly assailed by Fine Gael and their allies simply because the county boundaries were to be broken but when the opportunity was given to the people of doing away with the necessity of breaking county boundaries and of having single-seat constituencies, the Opposition raced up and down the country and made sure that the issues of the referendum were clouded from the people and, as a result, the Government's efforts in regard to these electoral reforms were not successful.</P>
    <P>Part of the opposition to the 1961 Bill was based on the view that the Government should have moved an amendment to the Constitution but when the Government adopted this advice after the publication of the 1966 census they were assailed by the Opposition.  The Opposition are on record as having jeered at the Government for trying to maintain county boundaries&mdash;boundaries that, I might add, were laid down as far back as the time of King John.  They argued that the west of Ireland was overrepresented. When, as a result of <Col N="1957" /> the decision of the people, the Government introduced a new Bill which necessarily reduces representation in the west and breaches many county boundaries, there is an outcry from the same people who only a few months ago travelled up and down the country opposing the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill which sought to preserve county boundaries and to give fair rural representation.</P>
    <P>In an answer to a Parliamentary question put by me to the Minister for Local Government on 26th November, it can be seen that TDs in certain parts of the country will need to get as many as 13,220 votes while in Dublin North West, 10,520 votes would suffice. We can also see that 10,850 votes in South County Dublin will do the same work as 12,350 votes in North East Donegal or 13,240 votes in South West Donegal.  When the opportunity of having fair representation for the west and for rural Ireland was given to the people it was not accepted although we all pay lip service to the fact that rural Ireland should be fairly represented, all, that is, excepting one Deputy of the Labour Party, Deputy Seán Dunne who is on record as maintaining that rural Ireland is overrepresented. Even under the present Bill he wants to cut rural representation down further.</P>
    <P>These are some of the inconsistencies that have come to the surface during this discussion and there are others. As regards the Constituency Commission, such a proposal was put forward by the Government in 1959 as part of the proposed amendment of the Constitution put to the people at the time.  Both Opposition Parties criticised it, particularly the provision that the decision of the commission would be altered by only a two-thirds majority of the Dáil.  They held that this gave too much power to the commission, that the commission would be too strong altogether.</P>
    <P>In the 1968 Bill the Government changed the form of the commission to meet these objections, in particular by providing for amendment of the commission's findings by a simple majority of the Dáil.  The Opposition then attacked this because it gave too <Col N="1958" /> little power to the commission.  I do not think it would be any harm to place on record that the very same Senator who moved an Opposition amendment in 1959 to change a two-thirds majority of the Dáil to a simple majority, moved an amendment in 1968 to change a simple majority to a two-thirds majority.  Fine Gael, having opposed the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution to provide for a Constituency Commission, are now pressing for it although they must know that it is not possible without an amendment of the Constitution.  The Constitution as it stands, very clearly gives to the Oireachtas itself the duty of revision of the constituencies.  Any measure which sought to transfer that power elsewhere would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>One could go on citing inconsistencies. The Opposition and members of the Labour Party, in particular a prime mover, called for an early general election.  They know well that under the Constitution an election cannot be held until a revision of the constituencies is carried out.  Yet they are carrying out a filibuster against this Bill.  We had Deputy Treacy attacking the Government for their &ldquo;indecent haste&rdquo; in introducing the Bill.  It must be conceded, however, that there are a number of constant factors underlying the Opposition approach.  The most prominent of these facts is their unconcealed contempt for the intelligence of the people.  In this they are very much mistaken.  It is because of this attitude that they are almost permanently in opposition.  A second factor is their contempt for the will of the people.  They opposed the Constitution in 1937 and they opposed in particular those provisions which gave the people direct control over the organs of Government.  They opposed the decision that the people be given an opportunity to amend the Constitution in a Bill this year and they are now advocating proposals which conflict with the people's decision.</P>
    <P>We have many charges of gerrymandering, charges that this Bill was given to us as a result of the work of a large Party and that the Bill is introduced for the primary purpose of <Col N="1959" /> making sure that our Party, Fianna Fáil, will have enough seats after the next general election to form a Government. I do not think that I should go into the general election campaign or the formation of a Government on this basis.  As a result of the next general election, which will be held between now and April, 1970, the people will make up their minds whether they want Fianna Fáil to remain on as their Government.  If they do not want them, the decision will be theirs as to what sort of Government they will have.</P>
    <P>This is not the time nor the place to go into this and I only mention it in passing.  We have Opposition Deputies saying that county boundaries are being pushed here, there and everywhere. I honestly believe that I would be the best person to draw up this Bill, if I were to do it to satisfy myself.  I believe every Deputy in this House would draw up a different Bill if he had to do it to satisfy himself.  I believe there are few people who are completely and wholly satisfied with the revision of the constituencies.  It would be completely, utterly and totally impossible to please everyone.  I am not pleased with the advantage I get in my constituency in West Limerick.  If gerrymandering were the interest there, I should like to explain that this is largely a strong Fine Gael area which was given to West Limerick.  This is known to the local people.  I see Deputy Clinton smiling there.  He probably thought I was about to trip myself up.  This area is 60 or 70 miles away from my own area of Abbeyfeale.  It is as far away as the town of Roscrea is from Dublin.  If that is gerrymandering, it is a nice one.  If I were working in my own interest I would like to see West Kerry pushed into it.  I have nothing behind me and what I have been given is 60 to 70 miles away.</P>
    <P>I had to laugh here today when I heard Deputy M. Dockrell, a prominent member of Fine Gael, saying that he would have a job to get across the Liffey if he were to get part of another constituency.  If he considers it a job to cross the Liffey I should like to see him in a rural area trying to travel 70 miles odd and after that getting up <Col N="1960" /> on the Galtee Mountains to visit constituents. I wish Deputy Dockrell every success and I hope he will not suffer any stress in getting across the River Liffey.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of talk about the breaking of county boundaries by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> and other speakers.  According to Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick, over the last few weeks, county boundaries should not be interfered with or broken.  I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick, as well as Deputies from the Labour Party, are anything but worried about the breaking of county boundaries.  County boundaries are not sacred things and should be broken if necessary.  We had another inconsistency in the Opposition Parties saying that the county boundaries should not be broken.  They are contradicting themselves.  We had Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick saying on 28th May, 1968, and I quote from volume No. 235, column 145:</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that county boundaries are sacred and that the counties and constituencies should coincide identically.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything sacred about county boundaries.  For example, for years back, we have had county managers managing two counties.  We have had joint county managers in a number of counties. Practically every police district in this State consists of two counties joined together.</P>
    <P>He says that a hospital now caters for three to four counties and that, therefore, there is nothing sacred about county boundaries.</P>
    <P>If you listened to Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick, as I did last week, you would think that he has now forgotten what he said.  It is only fair, right and proper that he should be well and truly reminded of this.  In volume 235 column No. 518 of the same date he says:</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that people have all that dislike to moving from one county to another.</P>
    <P>He said this after I had spoken at the time and made the case that we should not have to shift from one <Col N="1961" /> county to another unless it was vitally necessary.  Indeed, Deputy Fitzpatrick and other members of his Party were not alone in that.  We have had members of the Labour Party saying the same thing.</P>
    <P>Earlier today a member of our Party said it was on record that the Labour Party were not in favour of county boundaries and this member of my Party was severely &ldquo;sat on&rdquo; by Deputy Tully.  I avail of this opportunity to quote from the Official Report, volume 233, column 1517, where Deputy Michael O'Leary of the Labour Party is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, originally, and later, the Minister for Local Government, mentioned the great problems involved in changing county boundaries. Who introduced counties into this country?  Is this the national Parliament of this country?  As far as I know, counties are relics of feudalism. We owe loyalty to this country rather than to any county.  We owe loyalties to cities such as Dublin, Belfast and Cork, and to the rural areas: we should not shed tears for county boundaries which were introduced, in the first place, by an English administration.</P>
    <P>When this was mentioned earlier today it was denied by Deputy James Tully that a member of the Labour Party would say such a thing but here is the proof that it was said by a member of the Labour Party.  When it was mentioned to Deputy James Tully, he said, in effect: &ldquo;Do not mind Deputy O'Leary: he is only a city TD.&rdquo; Deputy James Tully, for his own personal reasons, may have classified Deputy Michael O'Leary as &ldquo;only a city TD&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Leary is a representative of part of the city of Dublin and, furthermore, he is a Corkman and it is not so very long ago since he came to live in Dublin.</P>

Deputy Coughlan spoke of the revision of East and West Limerick and had a cock and bull story to tell.  He said that great efforts were made to keep one little townland from being transferred into West Limerick.  Deputy Coughlan must not be very familiar with the rural part of his constituency. It is plain to see, since the introduction of the Electoral Bill, that the area given to West Limerick from East Limerick was in a bottleneck and that five parishes were there.  Even with an imagination as large as that of Deputy Treacy, one could not say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure I can get a lot of help from Deputy Fahey. Would Deputy Treacy and his colleagues please keep quiet and let me make my speech?  I listened to the speech by Deputy P.J.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot be regarded as a good surgeon where the creation of constituencies is concerned because the figures he gave were so glaringly out.  When I checked them, they were not out by ten or fifty per cent nor by 100 per cent; in some cases, they were out by thousands per cent.  Admittedly, he said he was not an expert at such figures and we let it go with him.  He should be informed. His worthy colleague from South Tipperary, Deputy Fahey, cleared the air for him in no uncertain manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan alleged that East Limerick was fashioned in order to keep out a particular town.  It was not named because the Deputy knew that what he said was completely untrue.  It is typical of his approach to the debate. I have no doubt that the Minister for Local Government will deal with what he had to say as it deserves to be dealt with and as he was dealt with a couple of weeks ago when the Minister had the same type of job to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan also told us that there was gerrymandering in West Limerick and that we were afraid that part of West Limerick would be pushed into North Kerry.  It is a pity Deputy Coughlan did not enlarge on that statement because I should love to take it up and to give him the information which he is so sadly lacking.  It is typical of the half lies, half charges, half truths which they are all adept at putting across.  I have no doubt but that, when this measure goes through and when people have had time to digest it properly, it will be seen that we made the best use of the material available to us, in the interests of the nation.  There are no steam-rolling tactics.  Nobody can say with any degree of honesty that we as a Party are trying to push through this measure as fast as possible.  Up to now, we are offering speaker for speaker.  I honestly think there are more speakers from the Opposition benches so far but I think there is very little in it, if anything.  Maybe the edge might be somewhat with the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would be inclined to think that, with all the cries we are getting for a general election&mdash;cries which we know not to be genuine&mdash;there would be some co-operation in putting this measure <Col N="1965" /> through the House.  Despite those cries which we hear, I am inclined to believe that something of a filibuster is going on.  I believe every effort is being made to keep this debate open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the crowded House here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be crowded but it is certainly plain to be seen by anybody who sits here long enough that there is no shortage of speakers.  One does not have to have a crowd, I think, to have a filibuster. If we had nice timing and a nice placing of speakers we could certainly have that.  Again, there is something else that strikes me.  There has been all the outcry about gerrymandering and about what will happen, but Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> has told us that there is no fear whatever as far as Fine Gael are concerned. In volume 237 of the Official Report, at column 1243, Deputy Fitzpatrick gave us a definition of the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; taken from the <i>Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, New Edition, Volume II:</i></P>
      <P>To arrange the political divisions of a State so that, in an election, one Party may obtain an advantage over its opponent even though the latter may possess a majority of votes in the State.</P>
      <P>If Opposition Deputies are not afraid that we will get a majority of the votes then the so-called gerrymander will not succeed.  Indeed, Deputy Fitzpatrick is on record as saying that the Minister will not succeed in his objects.  If that be the argument, then Deputy Fitzpatrick, speaking for the Fine Gael Party, and Deputy Treacy, speaking for the Labour Party, are talking a great deal of rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to join with Deputy Collins, who has just sat down, in congratulating Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick on the able manner in which he dealt with this Bill and on the very clear way in which he pointed out the motives behind the Bill and its many defects and deficiencies. It is not often that we get compliments and congratulations from the <Col N="1966" /> other side of the House, but it is nice to hear them when they are paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fair.  It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins also talked about filibustering.  There is no doubt about it, if his speech was anything at all it was a first-class example of filibustering.  I do not intend to say a great deal on this Bill.  I certainly will not be accused of filibustering because, quite frankly, I do not think this Bill is worth debating.  I believe the Minister has finally and definitely made up his mind that, no matter what arguments are put forward and no matter how convincing the evidence, he will not change a single line in the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the outcome of many weeks and months of haggling within the Minister's own Party.  It is a wellknown fact that the horse dealing was so intense that, in some cases, all the Fianna Fáil members of county councils had to come up here to try to settle the arguments.  All the time the basic motive was how could they get the maximum number of Fianna Fáil TDs returned to this House.  If any further evidence were needed of the arrogance towards, the disregard for and even contempt of the people, this Bill certainly provides it.  The Government have wasted the best part of the last 12 months and an enormous amount of money in trying to provide themselves with the necessary machinery for gerrymandering on a large scale, but the people gave them their answer.  When certain proposals were put before the people in the referendum they met with a crushing defeat. This is now a further effort at gerrymandering. It is a last ditch attempt to use the situation in which they are obliged to revise constituencies in order to gerrymander the country and ensure that the maximum possible number of Fianna Fáil TDs are elected. &ldquo;The best laid schemes ... gang aft agley&rdquo; and I have no doubt that the people will respond, when the opportunity offers, in the very same way as they did when the referendum proposals were before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred at length to <Col N="1967" /> the question of breaching boundaries. It is well known that the Minister for Local Government went all over the country, thumping his breast piously and solemnly because of the grievous sin it would be if natural boundaries had to be crossed or infringed in any way.  He was denied what he was looking for in the referendum and he now comes back here with a job to be done. Had he tried to cut up the country and breach the greatest possible number of boundaries&mdash;natural, county and otherwise&mdash;he could not have done it better than he has done it in this Bill.  He has separated no less than 17 pieces of nine counties, although it has been clearly shown, and it has not been denied by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party so far, that revision could have been done by altering only six pieces of six counties, and this without the expertise and the advice available to the Minister in his own Department.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently familiar with the greater part of the country to criticise in detail, but there are a couple of areas with which I am familiar.  I am certainly familiar with my own constituency of County Dublin.  It is quite obvious to me what the intention is in County Dublin.  There is little regard to natural boundaries.  I am sorry the Minister is not here because I intend to spell out for him in some detail what has been done.  Ballyfermot has been put in with the city.  Now that is something with which I agree.  It always belonged there, but it is no harm to point out that the Minister recognised that he himself had lost the support of the people of Ballyfermot; he recognised that very definitely on the day of the referendum.  He recognised it previously in the Presidential Election. He used to have the support of the people of Ballyfermot but the people in Ballyfermot have wakened up to the fact that absolutely nothing has been done for them over the years and that theirs was a most neglected area.  The Minister decided it was better to get that load off his back.  He did not want any repetition of that humiliation in the coming general election.</P>
    <P>The next motive uppermost in his mind was to get rid of me.  He told me <Col N="1968" /> twice across the floor of the House that he would settle me.  Possibly he may have succeeded, but I am quite happy to leave that to the verdict of the people. He divided my county council area exactly in two so that no matter which area I chose to stand in I would find myself with half the votes I normally get as a result of the work I have done over the years in my council area, where I have headed the poll on three different occasions in the local elections. I am confident that when this comes before the people they will give me the support they have always given me in the past.</P>
    <P>His next motive was that he wanted to get away from Deputy P.J. Burke. Deputy Burke has always been a great embarrassment to the Minister.  He has been an embarrassment because he has headed the poll consistently.  He is a hard worker and the people know it in his constituency.  They have recognised that over the years.  The Minister thought it was as well to get away from him.  I understand that the latest rumour at Fianna Fáil meetings is that the Minister is trying to get Deputy Burke to stand with him in South County Dublin.  Could anything be a greater laugh?</P>
    <P>That was not the end of his motives. His further motive was to ensure that Deputy Foley would be kept in this House.  Deputy Foley is a favourite with the Minister and consequently he chopped up the constituency in such a way that two seats would be almost assured for Fianna Fáil in North County Dublin. I would not be as certain as the Minister is that those are two safe seats, because I believe the people have made up their minds.  We have had a landslide recently, and it would not take a landslide to ensure that Fianna Fáil are not able to retain two seats in North County Dublin.  However, that is the intention behind it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the people to have a look at the shape of the new constituencies, to have a look at the shape of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, to have a look at the shape of South County Dublin, to have a look at the area that is now described as North County <Col N="1969" /> Dublin.  Believe it or not Kimmage, Manor Estates and Greenhills are in North County Dublin which goes over to KCR Garage.  Talk about natural boundaries.  There were numerous natural boundaries which could have been followed but they were ignored. They were ignored for certain purposes, and I have enumerated some of the purposes.  One was to eliminate a councillor of their own who was likely to be a rival and who is not a favourite, Councillor Walsh, and by splitting his council vote they ensured that he was killed off.  When you live in a constituency and are intimate with what is happening in it you know the moves behind the scene.</P>
    <P>The Minister was bound to be an expert in his own area.  Why did he not take the Naas road as a boundary? Everyone knows it is a natural boundary. Why not take the road to the west or the Navan road?  Those are natural boundaries.  Why not take the Navan road and make North County Dublin a three seater and give South County Dublin four seats?</P>

South County Dublin now crosses the Bray Road at one point.  Is the Bray Road a natural boundary?  Why chop in and out like that?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Cosgrave succeeded he succeeded in getting something sensible done.  I am not sure he has succeeded.  I would ask anyone with time to spare to have a look at the way they have cut in on the map. Look at Walkinstown, Greenhills and Manor Estates.  See the shape of the map and ask what regard was had for natural boundaries.  It is the greatest laugh and the greatest nonsense to say that any heed was paid to the natural boundaries.  This is simply and solely a revenge Bill, a Bill to show the <Col N="1970" /> people that they have not succeeded in changing the Government's efforts to gerrymander the country and keep themselves in office for the next 20 years.  This is a further blatant effort to do that.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word now about County Meath.  I said I know something about County Meath.  Here Deputy Farrelly was uppermost in the Minister's mind.  Deputy Farrelly lives at the furthest end of County Meath and, of course, the effort here is to get rid of him by putting his own home area in Monaghan.  This is very important&mdash;the area where he is known best and where his vote is strongest. There has been a Fine Gael seat in Meath since the foundation of the State and a Fine Gael seat will remain in Meath no matter what effort the Minister makes.  I think he can only succeed in giving us an extra seat in Monaghan and an extra seat in Cavan. As I said before: &ldquo;The best laid schemes&mdash;&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister deserves.</P>
      <P>Knowing our own areas no one can understand why the country has been carved up in this way except that it was done for petty purposes and to show the people that they were wrong. It was obvious that Deputy G. Collins was not prepared to accept the verdict of the people.  He says he believes they were completely wrong in the referendum and that this is a further opportunity for them to rectify their serious error in not enabling Fianna Fáil to provide themselves with machinery to gerrymander the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in speaking at length on this Bill because the Minister has finally and definitely made up his mind.  There will be no change, and no argument will have any effect. We are being accused of delaying the prospect of getting this to the country. I will not be accused of delaying the prospect of getting it to the country because, so far as I am concerned, the sooner it goes to the country the better.  I am confident that the people have made up their minds that Fianna Fáil are too long in office and that the most important thing at present is to change the Government.  The country is being governed from the outside because of the pressures that have built <Col N="1971" /> up.  The people have their minds made up and they will change the Government and, no matter what gerrymandering machinery they try to provide themselves with, they are gone.  This change is inevitable and the Government may as well take it in their stride.  Many of them are convinced that this will be useless.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said that speakers in this debate had no regard for the intelligence of the Irish people.  What regard had the Government Party for the intelligence of the Irish people when they put before them the proposal in the referendum?  They had the same regard as they had for their intelligence in the proposal they are putting before them now in this Electoral Bill. I know that a job had to be done. The constituencies had to be revised. I spoke during the course of the referendum and indicated that this was vitally necessary because of the fact that in 1961 when the constituencies were being revised the position was that in County Dublin it took 9 per cent more population to elect a Deputy than it did in South Mayo, but in 1966 when the census came out this 9 per cent had grown to 72 per cent because of developments that had taken place in County Dublin.  I say that the revision is essential and must be done.  It provided the Minister with an opportunity to do a proper job.  I do not know how anybody trying to rationalise the situation could come in from the Naas Road on the Long Mile and not take the small corporation area on the right hand side into County Dublin.</P>
    <P>You meet the corporation area first and then the county and then the city. If we were doing anything rational, surely this should have been included in the plan?  It is not included in the plan.  Every natural and normal boundary in the country has been ignored. The Minister may say that he had to go by townlands?  He may say this is the by townlands?  He may say this is the only way we have because we must go according to population on the register.  Townlands can go through the middle of fields.  We have a position now here under this new arrangement in which people who voted all <Col N="1972" /> their lives in Newcastle, and who went to school in Newcastle and are beside Newcastle, will be obliged to vote in Lucan, because of this north-south boundary according to townlands.</P>

      <P>I submit there are very few people in the country who know the exact townland boundaries. People know the roads very well.  This is the way this effort should be made. This is the only way you could have a rational break-up.  It might present a little bit of difficulty here and there because of population and of the collection <Col N="1973" /> of the census.  It is the only sensible way to do it.  Anybody who would tell me there were no motives behind the way the Dublin County constituency, Dún Laoghaire-Rath-down and the city constituencies were broken up could not be believed.  I would say it is quite a laugh.  If it is an attack on the people's intelligence this is it.  One has only to look at the map and see the way the job is done with the line going in and out to fulfil certain purposes and to separate certain personalities.  I have spelled it out in fair detail and I do not propose to do anything more.  I am not fully familiar with the situation so I cannot indicate in detail the motives that have moved the Minister in the various other parts of the country but I know what was behind his movements in Dublin.  I can tell him that there is serious resentment on the part of many of the people in what is now described as North County Dublin because no stretch of imagination could put them into North County Dublin.  It would take a mind like the Minister's to conceive it.  I know the people will give them their answer in the next election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to this Bill it is stated that the purpose of the Bill is to revise Dáil constituencies in the light of the 1966 census.  We all know that there is another purpose and that is to revise Dáil constituencies with a view to securing the greatest possible advantage for the Fianna Fáil Party.  That has been repeated very often in this House.  Most of the general arguments on the Bill have been repeated at this stage.  As Deputy Clinton and other speakers have said, it seems frustrating and futile to deal with the arguments on this Bill.  Unlike my Labour colleague, Deputy Coughlan, who referred to this measure as a hasty one, I believe that this measure was framed long before we went out on the referendum campaign.  This measure was framed before the referendum. Perhaps, some little alterations were made in it by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party by leaving in townlands, but generally, I have every <Col N="1974" /> reason to believe that this measure was framed before the referendum was held on the 16th October.  This was the fall back.</P>
      <P>When the Minister talked about the consequences of the defeat for the Government on the 16th October he knew very well what he was talking about and what the next step would be.  The only consideration that appears evident in the measure and in the alterations that have been made is that the constituency boundaries throughout the 26 Counties appear to be arranged having regard to the desirability of decreasing and eliminating as many Opposition Deputies as was possible. That was the purpose.  Another purpose was to avoid so far as possible competition between Government members or Government Ministers. I think my colleague, when speaking here earlier this evening, made that point pretty clear.  He spoke about Mid-Cork and said it was essentially a rural constituency and that he will be able to represent it.  That is why Mid-Cork has been so framed&mdash;so that a Fianna Fáil man can represent it.  But, if you will pardon me, that is not what is important.  What is important in the framing of constituencies is that the needs of the people are met, not the needs of individual Fianna Fáil Members.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney made the point I am trying to make on this Bill.  It was framed long before we fought the referendum campaign and Deputy Meaney said he had toured the area which will form part of his new constituency. He did not say when, but we all know it was during the referendum campaign to collect &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; votes for the proposed changes and, ironically, in the area which is now added to his Mid-Cork constituency. He was also concerned that another Cork man, Deputy Barrett, when speaking last week, overlooked the fact that I lived only seven miles from Cork city.  Deputy Barrett had been making the point that the people of two Cork suburbs, Douglas and Blackrock, had to travel to Bandon or Macroom, if they required to see a Deputy.  I am sure Deputy Barrett did not intend to reflect on me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> The point I wish to make is that members of the Government Party did not overlook my presence when reframing the constituencies in County Cork, because quite a lot of the area in which there was Labour support was syphoned off and put into West Cork.  Two considerations influenced the Government when reframing County Cork and any of us could have foreseen that.  First, North-East Cork carries five seats, of which the Government Party have secured two.  The referendum result made it abundantly clear that the Government would not secure in the immediate future, if ever again, more than two seats in that constituency, so the obvious thing to do was to reduce the number of seats and arrange the constituency so that they could secure two out of four seats.</P>
    <P>If one is concerned with Party rather than with the good of the people whom it is intended to represent, this makes sense.  There was also Government concern because there has been a growing swing to Labour in Cork as, indeed, in all our cities, and the way to combat that was to divide Cork city.  Great play has been made of the fact that it is important to retain Cork as a completely urban area and this prompts me to ask why not apply that principle to Dublin, <i>vis-à-vis</i> County Dublin, to Limerick city and to other such areas?  If it is logical to treat Cork in this way, does the same logic not apply to other cities?  However, a similar decision has not been taken in respect of the other cities.</P>
    <P>We have abundant evidence in County Cork that what was in mind was to make it as difficult as possible for Labour Members, and for Opposition Members generally, to secure reelection. Also in mind was the need to eliminate as far as possible competition between Government Members and to create competition between Opposition Deputies.  No consideration was given to the matter of convenience &mdash;convenience of representation or the convenience of the people.</P>
    <P>Surely some consideration might have been given to the idea of having constituencies based on existing health areas.  In County Cork we have north, <Col N="1976" /> south and west health areas, but we have a situation as a result of this unfair, unjust alteration of constituencies, in which in Mid-Cork we represent three different health areas, in East Cork we represent two health areas and in South-West Cork we represent the same number.  This makes representation difficult and it makes it difficult for the people.  The only purpose it serves is to ensure that the maximum benefit will be derived by the Government Party.  This is rampant in the entire proposals for the 26 Counties&mdash;one finds that the same picture obtains throughout.</P>
    <P>That is why I agree with others who have said that it is futile to speak at length on this measure.  It was framed for this purpose, it will be carried and put through the House despite anything we can say.  That is what matters in the minds of the present Government. Two nights before the voting took place on the referendum, the Taoiseach appeared on television.  He said he was horrified at the suggestion that gerrymandering could take place under the single seat system and he challenged the Leaders of the other two Parties to do any better than the Government had done in the reframing of constituencies. I do not think the situation has changed since&mdash;there is the difference between multi-seat and single seat constituencies&mdash;and I now challenge the Taoiseach to leave to a Committee of the House the job of reframing constituency boundaries.  Of course, that challenge will not be met because, when the House had the chance of acceding to a request to set up a commission, the Taoiseach and his Party voted against the proposal.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is no point in continuing to speak on this.  I realise I may not refer to questions which are not included in the Bill but perhaps I might be allowed to speak on something which I think should be in the Bill.  I refer to postal votes for emigrants. This is not a novel idea.  A great deal of concern is being expressed for rural Ireland.  It was expressed by the Minister during the referendum campaign, it was expressed in his introductory statement and in Government speeches on this Bill.  We have made provision for votes for Army personnel <Col N="1977" /> serving overseas.  We should decide that our emigrants, particularly temporary emigrants, as we hope most of them will be, should be entitled to vote in elections while they are away from home.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add except to say that this is not a Bill based on the 1966 Census.  It is a Bill designed to make the best of a bad job after the colossal defeat experienced by the Government in the recent referendum. This is a last desperate attempt by the Government to hold on to power, but I can assure them that when the next election comes along the people will decide that the Government who are capable of rushing a measure of this sort through the House will be defeated just as they were in the recent referendum&mdash;by a colossal margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a few very brief remarks.  Maybe I can attribute the fact that I wish to make these remarks to the contribution of Deputy Mrs. Desmond, at least the latter part of it.  She was referring to the idea of the constituencies being drawn up by a commission, to the Taoiseach's offer on television during the referendum campaign.  She did not appear to state very clearly that he was making the offer to accept any type of commission in the setting up of single-seat constituencies.  The idea of having single-seat constituencies has, of course, been rejected and we are to continue under PR.  It came to my mind that throughout the referendum campaign the Opposition speakers time and again emphasised the point that the PR system that operated in this country suited the country, that it was an Irish PR system, that it was a system particular to this country, something which had been accepted by the <Col N="1978" /> Irish people, something which was understood by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The system we have we know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was more or less the line you were taking.  If, however, we were to have an independent commission set up to draw up the constituencies under PR you would have a much different position because the Constitution only states that constituencies must have at least three seats.  There is nothing in the Constitution to stop an independent commission from recommending to this House that we should have one constituency with 144 seats.  There would not have been any necessity for them to pay any heed to what we were told was the Irish system of PR.  We could have ended up with recommendations which would have been abhorred not alone by Members of this House but by the vast majority of the people.  We could have ended up with a completely different electoral system, something we did not want at all.  I just want to point out the many strange decisions which it would be possible to make by giving an independent commission power to draw up constituencies under PR.  They could not have done this to any great degree under a single seat system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the referendum campaign charges of gerrymandering were being made.  I was very much in favour of the single-seat constituency idea and of the straight vote because it would be the only proper way to operate single seats.  We were being told&mdash; because it was good propaganda I suppose at the time to drag this into it&mdash;that we were seeking power with which we could gerrymander the constituencies. As we know the proposals in the referendum were defeated.  The people who were making the charges that if they were passed there would be gerrymandering are still making the charge that there is gerrymandering. I suggest they just cannot have it both ways.  The Irish people are intelligent and it is very foolish of political representatives to underestimate the intelligence of the people. I feel that it is a deliberate insult to the <Col N="1979" /> intelligence of the Irish people to suggest to them not to vote for something because it would give power to gerrymander and then when they do not vote for it, to still come in and make charges that gerrymandering is being carried out.  It is not logical and I suggest to them that they are wasting their time with those allegations.</P>
    <P>Nobody expects the Fine Gael or Labour Party to come into the House and tell the Minister for Local Government that they agree with his proposals for the drawing up of the constituencies in their entirety.  He did not wish it upon himself to have to draw up new constituencies.  He has to do this because of the position under the Constitution.  Everybody understands this.  The revision was thrust upon him and he had to do the job. It is not reasonable to expect that the Opposition Parties would agree with him, but to continue to make charges of gerrymandering just does not make sense to me because no matter what proposals he brought in they would still be opposing them.</P>
    <P>There are 144 Members in the House.  Slightly over half of them are on the Government side of the House and very few of the Government Members are satisfied with these proposals either because nearly every Member of the House has had his original constituency, in which he was elected, interfered with.  They had to be changed to meet the new requirements. Even in my own constituency in the west of Ireland which was a three-seat constituency and still is a three-seat constituency under the new proposals we have had a change, a small change.  I am not happy about it, but I have to accept it.</P>
    <P>We have lost a portion of the West Galway Constituency and, when one has worked as well as one can for people in an area and then finds that they will not be in a position to vote for him at the next election, naturally one is rather sad about it and feels slightly upset.  But that is political life and I am afraid it is something we will have to put up with.  I hope that the people whom I represented in the Liscannane electoral district will be <Col N="1980" /> happy in their new constituency.  However, that is only a very small change. Some of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House will find themselves in completely new areas and to a large extent will find themselves in a very difficult position as regards going to new people asking them to vote for them.  This affects both sides and all Parties and it just is not good enough for members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party to say that they are the only people who have cause to be upset.  In the corridors of this House the Fine Gael and Labour Members know from speaking privately to Fianna Fáil TDs that very many of them are upset and unhappy about the new situation&mdash;not, indeed, that they fear it but it is natural to be upset about having to stand in a different area from the one in which one has probably stood for many years and where one has come to know a large section of the electorate and has worked with them and lived with them.  For a large proportion of those people it will be quite a change.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal for a little bit of fair play from Fine Gael and Labour. It seems to me that the great desire on their part is to throw as much mud as they can, to say as many things, horrible things, as they can possibly think of.  There is a tremendous amount of rumour-mongering emanating from the Opposition Benches and every time that it is challenged there is no evidence produced to substantiate the allegations being made.  I congratulate and compliment Deputy Cosgrave on the appeal which he has made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to his own members to stop this kind of carry-on.  I wish to associate myself with the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave.  He was speaking to his own people and I only hope they will listen to him on this occasion because they did not listen to him when he asked them to vote for the Government proposals in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That was enlightened advice from Deputy Molloy.  Having <Col N="1981" /> listened to some of the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, it surprised me to hear Deputy Molloy turn away from the purpose of the debate this afternoon to give advice to the members of the Fine Gael Party.  I do not think the members of the Fine Gael Party need any advice from Deputy Molloy or any other Deputy as to how they should behave.</P>
      <P>I have just one or two things to say on this Bill and I do not think there is any Deputy in this House who should have more to say about it than I have.  I am not going to say very much this evening as I will have more to say on it during the later Stages.  I happen to be a Deputy who has had two-thirds of the electoral area he represents on the county council taken away from him and one-third of the adjoining electoral area also taken away.  All those areas are within 12 to 14 miles from me.  Actually, the parish in which I live has been divided. One portion has been put into Cavan and the other into Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Of course, when one thinks about Monaghan it immediately brings to mind the purpose of the whole act. We have now in the constituency of Monaghan an eminent Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He has gone around most of the constituencies in this country during his lifetime.  From 1938 to 1948 he was a Deputy for Athlone-Longford and from 1948 to 1961 he was a Deputy for Longford-Westmeath. From 1961 until the present day he has been a Deputy for Monaghan.  Cavan and Monaghan could have been made a five-seat constituency.  That was in the ordinary scheme of things but with this eminent Minister going around from one constituency to another he could not be left in that invidious position so they had to give him a portion of county Meath so that he could arrive back in Dáil Éireann after the next general election as a representative for Monaghan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He might do so or go to Longford-Westmeath as it was.  As I said earlier, I am one of the victims of <Col N="1982" /> what the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party are doing.  I am proud to have represented the people of County Meath since 1961.  It is the royal County.  We have been kicked around in changes of constituencies since the late 1930s.  We were thrown at one stage into Meath-Westmeath. We had a sojourn there for a while and then we were taken back into County Meath and remained as one unit during the 1940s until 1959-60 when the last redrafting of constituencies came around.</P>
      <P>In 1960 they proceeded to dole out portion of County Meath to Kildare and that is the way it has remained until the present day.  Now, as I said before, to help this particular gentleman who is now a representative from Monaghan they had to take two portions of County Meath and they extended the constituency of Meath up to the Bog of Allen.  I do not think anybody who heard the speeches made by members of the Fianna Fáil Government during the referendum to the effect that if you wanted your TD you did not want to have to travel long distances to see him can agree that if the Minister for Local Government wanted to find the TD from Navan or within five miles of Ardee that he should have to go to the Bog of Allen to find him.  I do not think this is right and I do not believe the Minister for Local Government thinks it is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been done in the hope that they would keep a Fine Gael representative from County Meath out of Leinster House.  Since the foundation of the State there have been Fine Gael representatives in County Meath and I have no doubt that when the next election comes around and the chips are down the people of County Meath will return a Fine Gael Deputy to this House despite what Fianna Fáil may think they have been doing to try to disfranchise the people who support Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1960 rearrangement the Deputy for Fine Gael in County Meath was the late Captain Giles, God rest him.  At that time, in order to see if they could take away Fine Gael support <Col N="1983" /> from the county they took his portion of the constituency away.  He was not in very good health at that time and he decided not to go forward again.  I stood for election and was elected.  It is a very strange thing and looks very strange to me and the people in County Meath that I represent that they have followed me to the north of County Meath and have taken away the area I live in.  I shall have more to say on this during the later Stages of the Bill but when the chips are down the people of County Meath will thwart the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party who are trying to deny Fine Gael their true representation in County Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this Bill is a vindictive act, a vindictive Bill brought in by a vindictive Minister against the people who dared express their opinions in a massive vote against the Government recently in the referendum.  The Government stand condemned and discredited. Because they know that have lost the support of the majority of the people they are trying in this Bill to hold on to the reins of office.</P>
      <P>We have in this Bill a form of gerrymandering equal to, if not worse than, that which the Unionists have perpetrated on the people of Derry.  We have heard Fianna Fáil speak about their aspirations for a long number of years.  We have heard them tell us they would get back the Six Counties.  For a long number of years we had 26 Counties but now one county in the west, lovely Leitrim, is being wiped completely off the map. The Government try to blame the Opposition Deputies.  The Minister has done so day after day and said across to the people on this side of the House: &ldquo;You and you alone are responsible for this.&rdquo;  I want to say that the people are responsible for what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Molloy speak a few moments ago about the intelligence of the people.  The people are certainly intelligent because over 600,000 of them have shown how intelligent they were recently when they showed they were not prepared to allow the Government <Col N="1984" /> to rivet themselves in power by the first proposition that was put to them.  Because that was defeated by an intelligent electorate, they now come with this proposition to the House.  If marks were to be given for gerrymandering, the Government would get 100 per cent.  Deputy Briscoe may smile.  Consider how the constituencies are framed, the manner in which the Government have crossed county borders where and when it suited them.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald pointed out in the daily national newspapers that if a body of people wanted to arrange the constituencies in a fair and honest way, cherishing all the children of the nation equally&mdash;a sentiment to which Fianna Fáil give so much lip service &mdash;they could have done it by crossing only six county borders and disturbing approximately 35,000 to 36,000 of the population.  Here we have a proposal to cross 13 borders and to disturb well over 100,000 people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is the last one who should speak about it. If, for example, the Government wanted to cherish all the children of the nation equally, if they wanted to be fair to the minority, they could have left Cavan and Monaghan as a five-seat constituency and could have left Donegal as a five-seat constituency but the grass roots came out and said, &ldquo;If you do, the Protestant Association will get a seat in each area and we cannot trust them to walk into the division lobby with Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  They did not want that.  When you talk about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, they should have given those people their God-given right.  They are the people who speak so much about the rights of the minority.  The minorities should remember that.  It is well known that people from Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan came up and asked them not to leave Donegal as a five-seat constituency, that the protestant Association would get a man in there and that they could not trust him, that they did not know what way he would vote.  The same happened as regards <Col N="1985" /> Monaghan.  It is obvious from the map that it would be quite easy to leave Cavan and Monaghan as a five-seat constituency.  It had the right number of people for a five-seat constituency. A smaller number of Donegal people could be moved into Limerick&mdash; I mean Leitrim&mdash;and if that were done Leitrim would still be on the map.  The Minister need not smile because I said &ldquo;Limerick&rdquo; instead of Leitrim.  When I mentioned Limerick I might not have been so far out.  You brought portion of the constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Portion of Clare has been added to Galway and to make up that constituency they have brought in portion of Roscommon.  So that it would not be stretching the imagination too far to suggest that the Minister could quite easily have done what I, through a slip of the tongue, suggested. Their plan was quite simple.  Where Fianna Fáil think that they are reasonably strong and could get 45 or 46 per cent of the votes, they have made the constituencies three-seaters, hoping that by doing so they may get two out of every three seats.</P>
      <P>In the recent referendum they got the highest percentage of the votes they received in the entire country in Connacht and Ulster&mdash;45.2 per cent. It may be no harm to remind them that that represents a drop from the 54.8 per cent that they got in the same area in the 1959 referendum.  Their desire now is quite simple.  They think that in those areas in Connacht and Ulster they will get two out of three seats in the three-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us come to Dublin where in the recent referendum the Government got only 30.6 per cent of the votes. They are hoping that through some miracle they may get two out of the four seats.  The people of Ireland have found them out as they have shown by their intelligent vote in the recent referendum.  It is well known that the <Col N="1986" /> Government are flying against the wishes of the people as expressed by the massive number of votes cast against their proposals in the referendum. The people showed that they want to retain proportional representation. If the Government were to concede the wishes of the people, there should be five, six or even seven-seat constituencies.  The Government believe that by having the larger constituencies they would lose heavily. Despite what the Government have done in this Bill they will be defeated because the Irish people have found them out and know them for what they are.</P>
    <P>The Minister and many other Members of the Fianna Fáil Party were shedding crocodile tears because the west was to lose four seats which were to be added to the representation of the city of Dublin.  As one who comes from rural Ireland it is my opinion that it is people, not mountains, hills or rivers, who are entitled to seats.  If the west loses four seats, who is responsible for that?  The responsibility and the blame rests on the shoulders of the people on the far side of the House and the Government now in power.  Representation is based on the population of a particular constituency on a particular day in 1966.</P>
    <P>Through Fianna Fáil's bad government, as a result of their neglect of the west and of rural Ireland, they have driven from the west over 150,957 persons, with the result that in Connacht there were 150,000 fewer persons on the register in 1966 as compared with 1956.  That is the reason why there will be four fewer Deputies in the west under this Bill.  It is because of the mismanagement of the Minister for Local Government and the Government of which he is a member.  When the Minister sheds crocodile tears about crossing boundaries who but himself is to blame?  The Minister often comes in here and talks about the dreadful year that 1956 was.  We hear this regularly from the Fianna Fáil Party.  In County Galway, since 1956&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Bill was put before the Fianna Fáil Party for consideration, and therefore you have the constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said is quite true.  I made a similar allegation before when the referendum was being discussed.  We were told the decision was unanimous at a Fianna Fáil meeting.  I stated here it was not.  It has since been admitted by Fianna Fáil Ministers that it was not, and it was admitted by Deputy Lionel Booth, who proposed an amendment in this House, despite the fact that the Minister for Local Government said here it was a unanimous decision of the Party without anybody dissenting from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> This Bill is designed so that the maximum number of Fianna Fáil Deputies can be returned to this House and so that the Fianna Fáil Party can try to rivet itself in power despite the wishes of the people.  The Bill was deliberately framed to put out of this House at least three or four of our Deputies.  For example, in the constituency of Roscommon they came within one mile of where Deputy Joan Burke is living, taking away 45 or 46 of her best polling booths.  Something similar has happened in the constituencies of Deputy P.J. Reynolds and Deputy Philip Burton.  We know what has happened in County Meath, the constituency of Deputy Denis Farrelly: they took part of Meath and put it into Cavan; they took another part of the constituency where he is living and put it into Monaghan, and at the other end they added part of the constituency of Kildare to Meath.  As regards my own constituency of Longford-Westmeath, we welcome back the part which was taken from us by the Government in 1960, but we deprecate what they have done in dividing the town of Athlone and transferring 4,000 of the population there, more than 2,000 votes, to bolster up the position of the Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
    <P>The Government's gerrymandering tactics will misfire and will boomerang on them.  An intelligent electorate has found them out, and while they suffered a massive defeat amounting to more than 234,000 votes in the referendum, it is nothing to what they will suffer in the next general election, come when it may.  We are ready and all we want Fianna Fáil to do is name the day. Despite the fact that their Ministers have gerrymandered the constituencies to suit their own purposes, the Irish people love fairplay and justice.  They hate injustice and will certainly teach Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, and his Government a lesson when the next election comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy L'Estrange one would imagine that nobody suffered through this rearrangement but the Fine Gael people. It is unfortunate that Deputy L'Estrange and his Party did not support the section of the referendum that <Col N="1989" /> would have maintained the existing constituency boundaries.  They were completely against this and the result is the situation in which we find ourselves today.</P>
      <P>I think I have the greatest grievance of any of the Deputies in this House inasmuch as, taking the area from one end of my constituency to the other, I have a distance of 113 miles to travel, that is, going from Ballydavid on the Dingle Peninsula down to Dursey Island in West Cork.  This is equal to the distance from Dingle to Clonmel or from Killorglin, my own town, to Roscrea.  This is an intolerable position in which to find oneself.  No matter what Deputies on the far side say, we have plenty of grievances on this side of the House.  I would, even at this stage, appeal to the Minister to ease this burden that has been imposed on us.  Certain sections of my constituency have been taken from me, and if the Minister were trying to gerrymander at all, there are plenty of good territories in the north-east part of South Kerry that could have been dealt with, but the Minister did not do that. Speaking from my own knowledge I can say that our voting potential in South Kerry is no less than it was before the constituency was rearranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something should be done in the future to see that people get the service to which they are entitled.  We have already very extended lines in Kerry, and it is difficult to get to the people even once a year.  I try to visit all areas at least once and that is not sufficient if a Deputy is to deal with the many problems that arise in his constituency.  At some future date all Parties in the House should get together and try to alter this impossible situation which has been brought about as a result of a High Court decision. I am referring to my own constituency, but I am sure there are many others, particularly in the western areas, that are in the same position.  The people are entitled to a far better service than we can give them.  Some of the people in those western areas are not very well able to put their cases in writing and have to depend on others to do it. I have to get to towns and villages and <Col N="1990" /> the various crossroads at least every two months in order to meet the people who are looking for my assistance, and it is an impossible strain for a Deputy to give the service that is needed.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition Deputies are honest in their approach to the referendum result, they must face up to the problems that have been created.  The proposal was put before the people to adjust the constituencies or at least to bring the tolerance into effect.  This is a position which should have been made clear.  It is an aftermath of the whole thing that now remains and makes things very difficult.  People require greater service today than when I first came to the Dáil which is not many years ago.  They seem to demand more; they follow Deputies around to get necessary advice.  They are leaning more and more on Deputies.  I hope at some future date, not too far away, something will be done to have the constituencies once more adjusted.  It should be possible to reach some agreement with all sides of the House to have this brought about.  Otherwise, the people cannot get the services they require.  We find we have a further 15 miles added to the length of our constituency.  This should never have happened.  That is the position now and it certainly gives us plenty of work and headaches for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose everything that could be said by both sides has been said on this Bill.  Deputy Connor was very frank when he said that not everybody in Fianna Fáil was satisfied with the Bill.  The Fianna Fáil people who attempted to apologise for the Bill and give reasons why it was introduced have had their say.  People on this side of the House have accused them of ulterior motives but the fact remains, as Deputy Connor said, that this measure has changed constituency boundaries to the detriment of Deputies on either side.  In my own constituency of Mayo the gerrymander, as I shall call it, has meant that my end of the constituency has been so changed that I shall have more difficulty in being elected than I had previously. <Col N="1991" /> From the Fianna Fáil point of view that may be very sound because I believe Fianna Fáil, and the Minister for Local Government in particular, so designed the two constituencies in Mayo as to ensure as far as possible that they would gain two seats out of three in each constituency.</P>
      <P>The Minister carried out this division with that in mind.  I am sure he had the advice of his two Ministers in the constituency and I know that from the Fianna Fáil point of view he probably felt it would be better to have the Miniters divided there.  They were in the same constituency, the one I have the honour to represent.  The Minister for Local Government did not do that in the interests of Fine Gael and possibly could not be expected to do it, but the way in which it was done ensures that another Deputy elected with me has been given more votes than he needs with the intention, of course, of lowering the Fine Gael vote in the other constituency.  In fact, it is done to ensure that while a Deputy of my Party in one constituency would have a quota and a half a Deputy in another constituency, deprived of that halfquota might not be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps that is good practical politics. Some Fianna Fáil speakers have said that if Fine Gael had accepted the referendum measure this would not have occurred.  I opposed the measure even though I come from the west and I was accused by Fianna Fáil speakers on every platform of neglecting the west by so doing.  It was said that by taking the action I took and making the speeches I made I was depriving the west of representation in Dáil Éireann to which they were entitled.  I wanted representation for the west&mdash; there is no Deputy of any Party who does not want it&mdash;but I feared that the Bill was misleading, fraudulent and dangerous.  My reason for saying that is that the Bill enabled any Government that might be in power&mdash;perhaps Fianna Fáil had no intention of using the powers they gained through the Bill&mdash;to arrange constituencies in such a way that one-sixth above or below the designated number of 20,000 would enable them to put an individual <Col N="1992" /> candidate into a seat.  That is a power I would not like to give to my own Party or any other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall bow to that ruling. The people gave the decision and it is no use now for any Deputy on any side to attempt to deny that the people took such action.  They took it in a manner that possibly nobody on any side of the House could have believed possible.  They made the decisions so clear by their massive vote against the referendum proposals that never again, I think, in the history of the State will such proposals be put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, and possibly the Minister for Local Government, were proved wrong in this.  It has been said that this was &ldquo;Boland's madness&rdquo; rather than a decision of the Fianna Fáil Government but whether it was &ldquo;Boland's madness&rdquo; that was responsible for this referendum or not, the fact remains that the people spoke out loud and clear.  The other night the Minister for External Affairs said it was because the Parties opposite had posed the questions in an untruthful way.  He did not say it that way but the implication was that the reason why the majority of the electorate rejected the Bill was that we used <Col N="1993" /> propaganda that was not true and which was apparently designed to scare the people.  Surely that was a naïve statement from the Minister for External Affairs?  Surely he does not believe that our people are so naïve as to accept an argument of that kind? Surely the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine is greater and far more efficient than he would give it credit for? Surely he did not believe that the electorate would accept that kind of argument and that they could be scared and stampeded into taking an action against their beliefs because the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party had decided to use certain propaganda in order to beguile?</P>
    <P>I wonder if this man really believes that this is so but whether he believes it or not, this Bill is before us now as a direct result of what the people did in the polling booths.  I do not know why the Minister should have taken the action he did or why he should have put the proposals before the people knowing that, in 1959, the people had rejected this idea and, at the same time as they rejected it, they elected one of the greatest figures in the political life of this country as President of Ireland.  That illustrious gentleman had come out in favour of a change in the electoral system and yet the people elected him to office but rejected his proposal.  Surely any sane man in Fianna Fáil should have seen the red light and should have known that the people would reject both proposals in the referendum of 1968?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister for External Affairs straying very much the other night.  However, I will accept your ruling.  If a rule is made for Deputies, it should apply also to Ministers.  However, I am not going to argue that point and I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  There were many other methods of devising constituency boundaries than the one adopted by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> It has been clearly shown in this House by Deputy Patrick Hogan of Fine Gael that there were methods of devising constituency boundaries to give us exactly the same number of Deputies and that, instead of moving 101,000 people from the constituencies where they hitherto had voted, the same result could have been achieved by moving 35,000 people.  Senator Garret FitzGerald writing in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> also explained, and had maps to prove it, that this should have been done in a certain way.  The charge against the Minister of drawing up constituency boundary lines in order to ensure, in so far as is possible, that Fianna Fáil people would be elected, is well substantiated and the House must realise that this is true.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, including Deputy Connor who is not satisfied with the changes in his constituency, believe that the people they have represented for a considerable period of time will feel a sense of loss.  All of us in constituencies that have been carved or dismembered will feel the same sense of loss.  Deputy Boland, apparently, did not ask some of his Fianna Fáil people or some of his Fianna Fáil Deputies for their opinions.  He just decided arbitrarily to carve the constituencies in a certain way and to let the Deputies and the electors take the consequences.</P>
    <P>There would be no need for this Bill if Fianna Fáil had adopted the suggestion that Deputy Connor mentioned a few minutes ago&mdash;a conference with the other Parties in the Dáil to try to divide the constituencies in such a way that boundaries, in so far as is possible, would follow county lines and traditional lines and that fair representation was given in relation to rural areas and also, of course, to the urban areas.  A means of doing that could have been devised with the consent of all Parties in the Dáil and if Deputy Boland's madness had not driven him to put the proposals before the people he could have introduced an amendment to the Constitution that would have enabled him to disregard the High Court judge's decision of 1961.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> Certainly this House could decide to pass a Bill through Dáil Éireanna Bill that would be designed to give fair representation to the west of Ireland and to rural areas without being unfair to the urban areas and to the cities.  That was within the competence of Dáil Éireann and if that were not achieved, and if a tolerance Bill, independent of changes in the electoral system, had been proposed in this House, the House would certainly have passed it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government must be taken to task for not doing that and Fianna Fáil may long be sorry for not having advised their Minister.  The men at the Party meetings could have said: &ldquo;We know the rural areas need greater representation; we know that the urban areas are growing and growing and as they grow the danger exists that representation for the west and for all the other rural areas will fall more out of balance.&rdquo; Certainly, the Government could have devised a Bill that would have been passed through the Dáil in order to ensure that such representation was given.  However, they did not do that and there is no doubt that the charges made against them of doing it in order to attain more power are true.  They did it to ensure that men who had grown stale in power would remain in power for a longer period without having to fight for their constituencies.</P>
    <P>The people, as I said, rejected the idea but certainly there must be people in Fianna Fáil now who are sorry that they did not attempt to bring this idea before the Minister and before the Government.  They may be very sorry as time goes on because I believe that at the next election the people will remember that the Fianna Fáil Government played politics when there was an economic situation building up in this country that could become dangerous, which has been shown by the mini-Budget as something on which the Government should take drastic and immediate action.  It was a matter of fiddling while Rome burned.  It was a matter of fiddling with a referendum when the economic situation was deteriorating from day to day.  I do not <Col N="1996" /> talk about a tug-of-war in the Fianna Fáil Party.  That has nothing to do with the House and nothing to do with the country but I do say this.  They will stand before the bar of judgement at the next election and the people will decide whether the Party that fiddled while the economic situation was deteriorating are entitled to come back as the Government in the future.</P>
    <P>The people will vote massively against the Fianna Fáil Party at the next election and it will be their just due because any Party, Sir, that so miscalculated public opinion in this country, any Party that was so far off the pulse of public opinion, certainly does not deserve the support of the electorate and are not competent to rule the country in the interests of all the people.</P>

Others said that at the Fine Gael Party meeting there definitely was a very narrow margin between the people who wanted to hold PR and those who wanted the single seat.  I want to deny that with all the vehemence I can because I was present at the Party meeting and I can assure the House that the majority for retaining PR was a very strong one.  That is a certainty. The Minister smiles.  Possibly he thinks that does not matter.  Perhaps it does not matter but I just mention it to refute the allegations made across the House.  It is wrong.  Whether it was right or wrong does not matter now because the people have spoken.  Perhaps, we could quote what the illustrious man in the Park said about it <Col N="1997" /> years ago and, perhaps, we could quote what Deputy James Dillon said about it years ago but this has no bearing on the situation now.  The people will say to themselves that the Fianna Fáil Party had support for a long time and that they are not capable of doing a job in the way in which they should do it.

      <P>Like most other people, I appreciate the onerous task facing the Minister for Local Government. No county has suffered as badly as my constituency in the re-arrangement of the constituencies.  In County Clare we have a situation in which some 14,000 of the population have been taken out of the county and put in with Galway, forming a new constituency. This is probably one of the most historic constituencies in Ireland and Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and all political Parties deplore what has happened here but at least we appreciate that something like this was inevitable in view of the result of the vote on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
      <P>In Clare a few weeks ago, before the referendum, Opposition members of the county council called a special meeting to advise people to vote against the Third Amendment and the other day&mdash; last Monday&mdash;another special meeting was called to protest against the rearrangements of the constituencies. Anyway, the people appreciate that something like this was inevitable.  At least it can be said that transferring 14,000 people out of the county is better than the transfer of a small number, such as 6,000 or 7,000.  In this 14,000 of the population there are close on 10,000 voters who are on the electoral list and this gives an opportunity to the people of this area to enter in the next election a Clare man as one of their TDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure they will see it this way and they will go about doing that when the time comes.  We appreciate that the Minister when coming to Clare did not depart from the pattern which he followed for the rest of Ireland, that is, creating three-seat constituencies which, <Col N="1998" /> at least, are smaller and more manageable than some of the four-seaters now in existence.  It means that a TD has far less ground to cover in order to look after the interests of his constituents. Perhaps, three seats will do better in the future.  It is hard for people to knuckle down to this and be any way joyous about it.  The first reaction of everyone was that of disappointment. As I have said, we appreciate that we are no worse off than a county like Leitrim.  This gives us an opportunity to elect a Clare man and be represented by a Clare man in that part of the constituency.</P>
    <P>We have a growing population in County Clare and after the next census, perhaps, we will have the required population to enable us to revert to the four-seat constituency we had.  We look forward to the day when we will have all the electors in the county again united as one constituency, that is, the constituency of Clare.</P>

      <P>I think the Government have wasted a lot of time and taxpayers' money during the past 12 months.  It might have been necessary to revise the constituencies but it is quite clear that the real purpose of the Bill is to preserve the interests of the Government.  Were it not for the mass emigration from the west we could have, at least, four to six more seats.  This is entirely due to the mismanagement of the Government in not providing jobs for the people.  In my constituency alone they have taken from me 48 polling booths, giving to Clare-Galway 1,975 of a population and 7,938 from Roscommon to East Galway&mdash;a total of 9,913.  The Minister should leave County Roscommon unmolested. It has a population of 56,228 and, with 4,424 from Athlone West Urban, we have 60,652 of a population. This would give us a three-seat constituency and a little to spare.  Of course, it is quite obvious why we got the Athlone West Urban: it is to consolidate the position of the Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I might add that, in taking away all along the Suck there was taken with it also the drainage of the Suck which was one of the Minister's main problems <Col N="1999" /> in the constituency and which had been promised to the constituents in the 1964 by-election.  This is not a revision: it is a butchering of the areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the individual constituencies only to the absolute minimum.  I should like to speak about constituencies in general rather than about constituencies in particular.  I may be able to do this as a Dublin Deputy better than people from rural Ireland where certain county boundaries had to be breached.  The last speaker has claimed that the main purpose of this Bill is to protect the interest of the Government. I say that this cannot be shown to be true to any extent in the city or county of Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>
      <P>In the last general election, in the constituencies as they now exist, Fianna Fáil won two seats out of three in Dublin South East; three seats out of five in Dublin South West; Central; three seats out of five in Dublin County; one seat out of three in Dublin North West; two seats out of four in Dublin North Central and failed, after a very long count, by a margin of a total of four votes, to secure the majority of seats in Dublin North East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to this Bill, if I have any, is that, from the time I entered politics in 1956 and when we first succeeded in securing three seats in Dublin South West in 1957 we felt we had achieved something because it was the first time since the establishment of that constituency that Fianna Fáil secured a majority of the seats. In the subsequent by-election we lost the additional seat by a little over 50 votes and we did not regain it in the next general election but we did regain it in the last one&mdash;and comfortably, if I may say so.  I believe the main reason the Fianna Fáil voluntary organisation was able to bring about this situation in Dublin was that most of the constituencies had an odd number of seats and where you have one Deputy out of three or two <Col N="2000" /> Deputies out of five, then everybody with the slightest interest in Fianna Fáil will come out to try to help to achieve a majority of the seats.  When you have an even number of seats, there is apt to be complacency&mdash;and I mean this on all sides, including the Fianna Fáil Party.  A lot of them will say: &ldquo;Four seats: Fianna Fáil will probably get two out of four.&rdquo;  If you add the figures I have given for Dublin it will be seen, by simple mathematics, that Fianna Fáil will not only be able to hold its present position in Dublin city, but will probably end up maybe a seat less&mdash;that is, if these straightforward mathematics work out. This does not always happen.  We know you cannot have straightforward mathematics.  As a Fine Gael speaker will say, the Government Party was guilty of gross miscalculation in putting the referendum issue to the people but I would point out that for a whole week before the end of that campaign, nobody in the Fine Gael Party would offer better than even money and, therefore, they also were guilty of miscalculation on that particular issue.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt at all that even the young people coming up today have been told by their fathers and mothers of the time of the recession of 1956 and 1957 when their fathers lost their employment.  That was the time when people who had been in jobs for 18, 20 and 30 years found themselves out on the dole.  We found families breaking up.  We had no housing shortage, certainly, because we had nobody to take the houses, and there was not the price of a bag of cement in the coffers when Fianna Fáil came back.  Fianna Fáil offers job security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Job security has nothing to do with the county council. Certain international problems have adequately been dealt with by the <Col N="2002" /> Government.  I imagine this Bill has been considered on more than one occasion by the Government before it was eventually produced.  I do not believe the Government will lightly amend the recommendations put before the House.  Unfortunately, I have not all the reports with me that I would like to have now because I found that the speeches were shorter this evening than usual, which is a good thing: sometimes we should have a rule here, as they have in the local authorities, about ten-minute and 15-minute speeches.  Deputy Dockrell opened the debate this morning and concluded it last week.  He referred to old Dublin and to the fact that the constituency he represented for so long had been changed beyond recognition and that all south Dublin, where the Dockrell name and family have been established for so long, had been reduced in size. He recollected how this constituency used to extend almost from the Pigeon House right up to the county boundary. He asked that the constituency be extended.  I support that request.  I would prefer to see the constituency a five-seat constituency, as it was before, and my own constituency made, if necessary, into a three-seat constituency.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer now to Deputy Briscoe, as reported in tonight's <i>Evening Herald,</i> page 8; he said:</P>
      <P>A lot of the debate was sheer hypocrisy and the charge of gerrymandering did not stand up to examination.  He believed that three-seat constituencies were better because they would make it possible for people to have closer contact with their TDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this general view of Deputy Briscoe.  At the moment it would appear that Deputy Briscoe and myself are likely to contest the same constituency.  I would prefer to see this constituency either reduced to three seats or increased to five seats because in a four-seat constituency I believe the ordinary run of the people will not show the great enthusiasm I have seen them showing over the years.  From what I read of Deputy Maurice Dockrell's speech last week and Deputy Briscoe's tonight, I think I am <Col N="2003" /> in line with both of them and I would ask the Minister to examine this question of the even number seat constituencies, particularly in South Dublin. I cannot speak so well for North Dublin because we are sometimes described as provinces apart.  As the Bill stands, it is more than likely I will seek to represent Dublin South Central. I shall be sorry to lose the people of Drimnagh who gave me such very valuable support in the last general election, but I will be very glad to get back the people in Rathfarnham whom I represented when I was first elected.</P>
    <P>I understand that it has been suggested to Deputy Maurice Dockrell that he should leave the old South Central constituency and contest Dublin South-West.  I should like to warn him that I suspect this suggestion has come from Deputy Richie Ryan, who is anxious to protect himself and anxious to prevent my very good friend from Fine Gael, the former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and Councillor Maurice O'Connell from securing election to this House.  He is afraid he may be asked to contest that area which elected him in third place in the second last local authority election.  I should like to remind Deputy Richie Ryan that he barely took the last seat in what is now Dublin South-Central, the area he has intimated he intends to contest in future elections.</P>
    <P>I should like to go on record that I believe the people of Dublin will stand firmly behind Fianna Fáil in a general election.</P>

I am certain the people of Dublin will stand behind Fianna Fáil and give <Col N="2004" /> them a majority of the seats, if this Bill gives them the opportunity of doing so.</P>

There was a threat of unemployment. I am just wondering are the Taca men wagging their fingers at the people.  I represent a constituency that has not been affected by this proposed revision but, if it suited Fianna Fáil, they would have carved up my constituency too.  It suits them as it is because it is a three-seat constituency.  That is why Fianna Fáil did not get moving in that particular area.  I would be adopting an attitude of &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; if I were not to comment, however briefly, on this revision.  We had a Deputy from Clare a few moments ago describing the historic county of Clare.  I do not know what he meant. Maybe I have an idea.  The historic county of Clare was being cut up.  He tried to suppress his feelings but, of course, he had been brainwashed, as a great many members of the Party are when they come in here, and he must toe the line like all the rest.</P>

      <P>My brains are better than that.  It could not be done by Fianna Fáil, and neither would I be brow-beaten by them.  I have been in this House for 14½ years in spite of Fianna Fáil.  This Bill is a monument to Fianna Fáil, to the great &ldquo;Fianna Failure.&rdquo;  They were to save the west. The population of the west has now been depleted and the people are &ldquo;gone west&rdquo;.  If we had issued a postal ballot paper to the men from the west who are in Coventry and Birmingham and spread all over the world due to Fianna Fáil failure, or &ldquo;Fianna Failure&rdquo; as they are known, Fianna Fáil would have got the greatest mauling they ever got in their lifetime from those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to be licking his wounds after the great mauling he got in the referendum.  As I see it, this is a savage attack by the Minister on the people for not having accepted Fianna Fáil policy.  With this carving up I can see the Minister in no other role than that of Jack the Ripper.  He gets his knife out and stabs here and there to get his own back on the people.  Fianna Fáil seem to be very complacent.  They seem to think the people are fools, but <Col N="2006" /> they forget there is a voters' list.  They may fool the old people, but they will not fool the youth.  In the future they are likely to get the mauling they deserve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said a few minutes ago that while he agreed with the Bill he had some reservations.  He said he would like the Minister to do this and look at that.  Can they not do their dirty washing in their Party room without letting it overflow in here?  It shows that there is no unanimity in the Party.  Let us hope that when it comes to casting his vote for or against this Bill he will take the right side.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;hardly mentioned the Bill before the House tonight.  Any electoral Bill is bound to be criticised by the Opposition and by some of the Government Party, because to get a perfect Bill the Minister's name would have to be Solomon and not Boland. I think this is a fair effort to give us an electoral pattern so that the people's voice will be heard in a truly representative way.</P>
      <P>It is galling to hear Deputies speaking of gerrymandering.  It is impossible to gerrymander in a country like ours. We have not got a ghetto pattern.  This is not Little Rock or Derry.  We have not got all the Fianna Fáil supporters living in one area and the Fine Gael and Labour supporters living in others. All our skins are white.  I am not boasting when I say that but just making the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the referendum debate it was pointed out by Opposition speakers that you cannot gerrymander under the PR system which they wanted to keep. The Minister had a difficult task.  He has not pleased everyone but what he has done shows that we are truly a democracy.  In the space of a few months the electoral system has been reviewed by the people and by the Oireachtas.  This shows the desire of the Government Party to ensure that one basic rule of democracy, that is, a person's right to vote, will be preserved. The people have spoken on the system they want, and we will now try to make the best of it.  It has been said that many areas were butchered or charged to suit the Minister or someone else.  That is quite absurd.  You cannot do that in a <Col N="2008" /> society like ours.  I can speak for the city only.  In the city there is not a Fianna Fáil area, a Labour area or a Fine Gael area.</P>

      <P>I have one fault to find with this Bill.  I am speaking now not as a politician but purely as a native of this city.  I wish the Minister had kept to the old ward boundaries as far as possible.  The wards system in this city dates back for many hundreds of years.  We claim that in the time of Grattan's Parliament those wards were there.  The whole structure of society has changed since then but the fundamentals have not changed.  The people of this city when exercising their franchise want to do so in their local areas so far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you mention the wards&mdash;the Royal Exchange wards, the Mansion House ward, Pembroke East and Pembroke West&mdash;you might say that the very names are redolent of the old regime. Maybe they are, but at the same time they are the basis of our electoral system in the city.  We should by all means preserve these wards.  It will not always be possible for the Minister to do so.  I know he tries hard, but perhaps he could try harder to keep these wards intact because the city, like the rural part of the country, has certain traditions.  You have a class of people who hold certain broad political views which they like to express.  The city goes back to the Norman invasion. These city people have a wonderful sense of independence.  Deputy Dockrell of Fine Gael has praised the spirit of the people and I do the same. Throughout the history of the country <Col N="2009" /> they have fought for this independence and they have not been broken down by the enemy.  Despite the cutting off of the wards they will come forward and vote as they think best, always expressing their consideration for the country as a whole and for the city in particular.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any attempt to gerrymander.  We know it is not true.  It is impossible to gerrymander the constituencies.  If certain Deputies on the Opposition side are hit, let them remember some of us on this side will also be hit.  It is something which is very hard to avoid.  To suggest gerrymandering is to damage the national image because it is not true that it has been done.  I do not think it can be done.  During the remaining Stages the Bill should be examined again.  I would be all in favour of being fair to any Opposition Deputy who could prove conclusively that he is, in fact, being unduly injured by the new changes.  If we are going to preserve democracy in this country in face of the attacks made on it, not only here but also in Europe generally, not only must an electoral Bill be fair but the changes must appear to the people to be fair.  We can only do this by having a Bill brought in here after careful consideration and put to the House saying: &ldquo;This is our honest effort to make the best of the changes which we must make&rdquo;.  I am quite convinced that the Minister has made an honest and genuine effort not to please the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party Deputies but to give the best possible set-up in the electoral areas so that the people can express their will in a very democratic way and give us a good Parliament.</P>

      <P>I am trying not to be partisan.  I am thinking not only of my own Party or myself in this matter, but I am trying to think of the Oireachtas. Somebody said that corruption does harm to governments.  It harms the country as a whole.  We see it happening in Europe, which is not very far <Col N="2010" /> away.  We are lucky in so far as we have had in the periods since the State was founded a democratic Government. At times this was a very good Fianna Fáil Government and at times we had another Government, but to suggest gerrymandering is to damage this image.  Some people would believe it. It is our duty here to give the people an opportunity to elect a representative Parliament.  I believe in the integrity and the intelligence of the people doing this.  The issues should not be clouded by unfounded suggestions that the Minister has done something wrong. No matter what Minister sat where the present Minister sits tonight somebody would criticise him because they were hurt by the proposals in the Bill or because they did not get the areas they wanted.  They say that the people get the Government they deserve, and I suppose that an area gets the Deputy it deserves.  Unless there are people who will examine the claims of every person putting himself forward for election&mdash; and people do this&mdash;they will not be sure of getting the best people to form the best Government.  I have no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Party will occupy these benches after the next election but I do not think that even this is the most important thing.  The most important thing is that the people should have chosen the Government whom they think is best fitted to serve.  Until we get away from those charges of gerrymandering and corruption we will not improve the image of this House.  It would be very easy to make countercharges to the Opposition charges about Taca.  I should love to meet a Taca man.</P>

There is plenty of time during the sessions here to debate the issues which we have heard discussed, like those of unemployment, emigration, and Taca.  There is an obligation on the Government to bring in this Bill.</P>
      <P>One point Deputy Coogan made was that the Fianna Fáil Party had to wash their dirty linen here.  There is a duty on the Minister and on the Cabinet to bring in this Bill here. We in the Fianna Fáil Party make our views known when we are trying to be honest and criticise where criticism is necessary, and then we are accused of falling out.  We are united behind our Leader, Deputy Jack Lynch, and in regard to this Bill, the people will show their confidence in the Party and will return them in the new electoral areas which Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, has given to us in a fair and honest attempt to meet the situation which confronts him.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, so far as my own constituency of Limerick East is concerned, I have not heard any complaints whatever about the Bill.  The change there is very slight and is an obvious one. Nobody could talk of gerrymandering. It is a small corner of east Limerick which jutted into west Limerick that has been taken out and put into west Limerick.  There is no complaint there.  The same thing applies to the majority of counties.  A couple of counties have had to be divided up in a way that one would prefer to have avoided, in particular Leitrim, but my mind goes back to the beginning of the referendum campaign, when the Minister for Finance went down to a public meeting in Leitrim and told the people assembled there that if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill were not passed Leitrim probably would have to be divided by three, that it would not form a constituency <Col N="2012" /> of its own, that it would have to go in with others.  He strongly advised the people of Leitrim, therefore, that if they wanted to avoid that situation they might support the Government's proposals in the referendum.  The same advice was given in other counties and cities which were threatened with being divided up.  That advice was not followed and, as a result, a certain amount of dividing up has had to go on.  It has been carried out in much the same way as the Government forecast it would have to be carried out.</P>
      <P>What strikes me as being utterly hypocritical is that the Fine Gael and Labour Parties come in here whining and complaining about the Minister for Local Government butchering the constituencies when the real people to blame are the Fine Gael and Labour Parties because, during a period of months they went up and down and around and about this country persuading the electorate to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  They told the people there was no harm in the breaching of county boundaries, that it was better to do that than to accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>They got what they asked for and, having got that, having forced the Minister for Local Government into the position of having to divide counties&mdash; he had first of all told the people that they would be faced with this&mdash;Fine Gael and Labour come back and complain and whine because the Minister has to do it.  They are the people who are to blame, and it is complete hypocrisy on their part that they should attack the Minister and accuse him of all sorts of low tactics and of vindictiveness. The Minister has carried out what he told the people before the referendum he would have to carry out if the proposals in the referendum were not accepted.  These proposals were not accepted because of the opposition put up to them by Fine Gael and Labour.  Therefore, it is obvious that Fine Gael and Labour must take the blame for the unfortunate situation that now threatens Leitrim, Clare and other areas where people are being cut off from the main body of the people in their own counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have nothing to <Col N="2013" /> be ashamed of in this Bill.  The Minister had an unpleasant duty to perform and he did it with the absolute minimum of butchering and carving up.  If he had wanted to be vindictive, there is nothing to stop him carving up every county and forming constituencies bearing no relation to county boundaries.  He did it to the minimum extent possible and any fairminded person will agree that he did it without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>Though some Fine Gael Members and Labour Members may not be suited by it, an equal number of Fianna Fáil Members are not suited by it.  Deputy L'Estrange tonight repeatedly made the allegation that this Bill was discussed at Fianna Fáil Party meetings before it was finally decided. Deputy Briscoe pointed out that that was not so.  It was not discussed before it was published.  The first and only time it was discussed at a Fianna Fáil Party meeting was after the Bill had been circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps typical of the hypocritical Fine Gael approach that, having caused this situation, they now turn around and say Fianna Fáil are trying to use it to their own advantage.  This situation was caused by Fine Gael and Labour, not by the Minister for Local Government who is now being accused of so many low tactics.  The Minister has done a difficult job very well and, apart from this hypocritical whining from Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, no serious fault has been found with the Bill among the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say I want to pay a special tribute to the Minister for the manner in which he has carried out the difficult task of dividing up the constituencies, particularly for the manner in which he has tried to preserve county boundaries.  In all the Minister's speeches, here and throughout the country during the referendum campaign, at all times he tried to explain to the people that he wished to preserve county boundaries. What amazes me is the weeping and whining of the Opposition, having received exactly what they asked for during the referendum.  Here in the House they cry bitter tears because the Bill <Col N="2014" /> is before them.  They say it involves gerrymandering.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt Members of the Opposition are peeved by the division of some constituencies.  They fear that in that division they may be isolated, whereas they would like to see themselves in a position where their only opposition would be perhaps a local councillor or some unknown outsider. The reason they are peeved is that they may have to face a Fianna Fáil Deputy or they may find themselves facing each other.</P>
      <P>In regard to my own constituency of County Dublin I am peeved in many ways, particularly because I lose an area which was very good to me &mdash;Tallaght, Rathfarnham, Dundrum, Bohernabreena, Newcastle, Saggart and other districts.  Deputy P.J. Burke has lost a similar area.  Though we are peeved, we realise at the same time that this was necessary.  The referendum was held, the people did not accept the proposals put to them, and therefore a division of constituencies had to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in County Dublin has caused annoyance to Opposition Deputies, particularly to Deputy Clinton. I know the reason why.  It is because Deputy Clinton will now be in a constituency to be contested by the Minister for Local Government.  It is a constituency in which Deputy Clinton has not done any work, relatively speaking.  He has never tried to help the people there as Fianna Fáil Deputies have done.  Deputy Clinton made specific references to me, to Deputy Burke and to the Minister.  He said the Minister is aggrieved, that he wants to get rid of Deputy Burke because at all times Deputy Burke has topped the poll.  Deputy Clinton can say things like that but there is no truth in them.  The Minister has always worked solely for the good of the people whom he has represented as a member of Fianna Fáil.  He is not particularly worried whether he tops the poll or not.  It might be well to remind Deputy Clinton, who is so measly minded as to make reference to people in their absence&mdash;I have on two occasions been listening to the debate in the Whip's Office when Deputy Clinton made reference to me <Col N="2015" /> and I say this in his absence but his colleagues will probably convey it to him&mdash;that Deputy Clinton was the last man elected in the five-seat constituency of County Dublin at the last election.  Deputy Clinton was elected without reaching the quota and he was an elected representative before the last election.  I came into the field completely unknown to the people and I was elected prior to Deputy Clinton, and I reached the quota.  Deputy Clinton should bear this in mind when he says that the Minister is trying to safeguard me.  I challenge Deputy Clinton here and now to come out and to defend his seat in North County Dublin with me and we will see how he gets on.  I know well he would not do it.  I know well the work on which he is engaged is for a small sector of the community who are arrogant at all times against the Fianna Fáil Party and who have displayed it in many ways not alone by marches and other political demonstrations. Deputy Clinton has been assisting these people but he will see that this is not a true reflection of the people of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I want to say that in County Dublin in general the Minister did what I would term a reasonably good job.  As I have said, I am aggrieved at losing areas which were particularly good to me at the last election but I am convinced that the Fianna Fáil Members have worked sufficiently hard to ensure their own re-election.  I am sure the people of County Dublin received good enough representation from the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government to ensure that the Fianna Fáil Members are returned to office.  I cannot speak for the Opposition Members because seldom was the Fine Gael Member ever seen doing anything constructive in the area.  As for the Labour Member he has concentrated on the area of Ballyfermot but this concentration seems to be wilting away because Fianna Fáil has a Deputy who has worked hard in the area, who has got down to business and who is now changing the erroneous ideas given to the people of Ballyfermot by the Labour Deputy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he divided the constituencies. I compliment him on the manner in which he received allegations made by the Opposition Deputies and I have no doubt that he in his reply will deal with those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the referendum we had a number of articles appearing in certain daily newspapers, articles written by a Fine Gael Senator, and in regard to Leitrim the suggestion was that Donegal should be a five-seat constituency and an area of Donegal put into Leitrim. This was supposed to solve the problems which might arise in relation to any forthcoming legislation on the revision of the constituencies.</P>
      <P>During the referendum campaign in Donegal this suggestion was backed up by, above all people, a Donegal Deputy, also of the Fine Gael Party. He said that any thinking voter in Donegal would vote against the referendum proposal and would agree with the sensible suggestion that Donegal should be a five-seat constituency and that the balance of 8,000 or 9,000 Donegal people could be put in with County Leitrim.  This is on the record of this House because he repeated it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if there is such an outcry by Fine Gael and by Labour against the crossing of county boundaries, why is it that they see nothing wrong with this suggestion by a Fine Gael economist who is used to dealing in figures, whose business it is to deal in figures &mdash;and facts I hope, too&mdash;and a Fine Gael Deputy?  But the Minister, who is tied to a 20,000 figure of population per Deputy, is criticised.  It has been called gerrymandering but the suggestion put forward in respect of Leitrim and Donegal by two prominent Fine Gael people has not been branded as gerrymandering.  It is very difficult to understand the mentality of people who, on the one hand, advocate a situation like this themselves and who, when somebody else does the very same thing, describe it as gerrymandering. We in Donegal would object as violently to having some Donegal people going into a Leitrim constituency as Leitrim is now objecting to <Col N="2017" /> having their people go into a Donegal constituency.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The other problem which has arisen for Leitrim is that they find themselves as a Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  You must remember that there is more than one two-county constituency in the Schedule of this Bill.  You have Sligo-Leitrim, South West Donegal-Leitrim, Roscommon-Leitrim and Clare-Gal-way. There are many others.  All of these problems arise because the Minister was tied within certain limits, but the problem admittedly becomes more acute in a county with a population of over 50,000 people.  The county has just enough population for two Deputies. Therefore, had there been a constituency of Leitrim it would have not alone taken in that part of Donegal suggested by Fine Gael, but parts of other counties as well.  So that there, again, there would be wholesale breaches of county boundaries.  As far as Donegal beis concerned&mdash;I speak of Donegal because I know the situation there&mdash;one must start at Malin Head.  In order to get the required number one cannot go anywhere else.  I think the Minister&mdash;I did not discuss this with him before the Bill was circulated&mdash;has done a reasonable job here.  Here you have a county which has kept the setup which it had apart from the taking in of a certain portion of the Leitrim constituency.  If all the Members of this House were in the Minister's position and were asked to do the same job and 143 blueprints were superimposed on one another it certainly would be a jigsaw puzzle.</P>
    <P>If we were given a pencil to do as we wished I do not believe that there are two Deputies in this House who would come up with the same blueprint. Accordingly, when a person comes up with a blueprint for all of us it is only logical to assume that all of us can disagree on it.  It would be impossible to provide one which would satisfy all Deputies and all Parties and this one does not do so. Before we saw it we did not expect it would.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Lemass spoke loudly in praise of the Fianna Fáil policy in recent years <Col N="2018" /> which has resulted in the fact that Dublin now gains an increased representation. Under the proposals in this Bill the number of Deputies in Dublin will be increased by four.  He attributed this increase to the success of the Fianna Fáil economic policy in recent years but Deputy Noel Lemass very cleverly avoided any reference to another aspect of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill says: &ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is to revise Dáil constituencies in the light of the 1966 Census returns&rdquo;.  Deputy Noel Lemass dealt with one aspect of this.  However, there is another aspect of it which to my mind shows the most significant and the most tragic effect of the Bill.  After 40 years of native Government we have now a situation in which the west of Ireland is losing three Dáil representatives.  When one looks at the census returns for 1966 one finds that in the Province of Connaught between the years 1926 and 1966, a period of 40 years, the population of Connaught fell by 150,957. Between the years 1956 and 1966 the population of the Province of Connaught fell by 44,271 people.  The fact that the Bill is necessary to reduce the number of Deputies in the west of Ireland by three is a terrible indictment of the economic policies pursued by the Government, particularly the disastrous policies enshrined in the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion.</P>

      <P>The decline in the west has gone so far now that County Leitrim has been written off the political map.  It has been gerrymandered and butchered into three different sections.  The Minister stated, and many Fianna Fáil spokesmen reiterated this during the referendum campaign, that it was desirable as far as possible to avoid having to breach county boundaries.  Therefore, there is no reason why it was not possible to avoid doing this in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware it was possible to make Donegal a five-seat constituency. Deputy Barrett from Clare <Col N="2019" /> mentioned that 14,000 people from Clare were going into the Clare-Galway constituency.  He said this was a good thing because it would enable those 14,000 people to elect a Clare man to represent them in Dáil Éireann.  I think I know the area it is proposed to transfer to Galway and if I know those 14,000 people I believe they would prefer to elect a Clare man to represent the constituency of Clare.  It would have been much more desirable&mdash;and I am sure those 14,000 people would have preferred it&mdash;to have a Deputy returned for the constituency of Clare rather than for the constituency of Clare-Galway.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil spokesmen say, and harp on this, that because Fine Gael and Labour succeeded to a remarkable degree in defending proportional representation during the recent referendum, we are now responsible for this measure.  This Bill, as I have pointed out, and I think this is the most significant thing about it, is necessary because of the fact&mdash;I am sure the people of Ireland are now well aware of it&mdash;that Fianna Fáil failed to a remarkable degree to implement a realistic policy to retain the people in rural Ireland.  In addition to that, faced with the fact that Fine Gael and Labour succeeded in retaining the system of proportional representation, the Government and particularly the Minister for Local Government, were then faced with having to revise the constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that this Bill has been very cleverly designed with a view to ensuring as far as possible that the present Fianna Fáil Deputies would in so far as the Government can ensure it be returned after the next election.  There is no justification whatsoever for the new constituency in Cork which stretches from Charleville right down to the coast.  It is a long, narrow constituency, 90 miles long and there is no justification whatsoever for that division.</P>

      <P>As my colleague, Deputy O'Malley from Limerick, said, <Col N="2020" /> there is only a very minor adjustment between east and west Limerick.  I suppose I am one of the Deputies who are least affected in so far as our political fortune is concerned.  The revision of the constituencies does not affect me at all and, therefore, I am trying to give as objective a view as possible on this whole thing.</P>
      <P>The position then in regard to the west of Ireland, as many of my colleagues from the west who have spoken have said, is that they have lost three seats.  I do not know whether one can go so far as to say, as some of my colleagues have said, but there are certainly grounds for saying, that this Bill is revenge on the people for having voted so overwhelmingly in the recent referendum for the retention of the system of proportional representation. As a Deputy who has been keenly interested for a long number of years in the welfare of the people of rural Ireland, as one who had the privilege of serving under the great apostle of rural Ireland, the late Canon Hayes, in the organisation he founded, Muintir na Tíre, I deplore the fact that we have now reached the stage where one western county is being wiped off the political map.  I am confident that the people in the west of Ireland, when they will get the opportunity at the next general election, will vote in a very striking manner, just as they did in the referendum.  They will express their opinion of the failure of Fianna Fáil to implement a proper economic policy and their votes will reflect their resentment of this attempt to gerrymander and butcher the western province.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Opposition Parties are trying to defend an impossible position.  The sole purpose of the recent referendum and the putting before the people of the Third Amendment was to avoid bringing this measure before the House.  It was to avoid having to deprive the western seaboard of Deputies and transferring them to Dublin.  We find the very Deputies who so confused the issue that the people who were most affected voted as they advised, that is, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, coming into the House and trying to blame Fianna Fáil for doing what is <Col N="2021" /> absolutely necessary under the judgment of Mr. Justice Budd given in 1961.  The Minister has no alternative. The Government have no alternative. They must carve up the constituencies. There is no tolerance that is worth while.  The Minister is hamstrung.</P>
      <P>It is colossal nerve for people to come in here and shed crocodile tears for a position for which they are mainly responsible.  They themselves are responsible mainly for the position in which we find ourselves today.  It is a sad position.  It will be sadder still in future when there will be fewer Deputies representing the west.  The last speaker spoke about the depopulation of the west.  I am a southerner. In every country in the world people are leaving the land, leaving agriculture, for cities and industrial employment&mdash;I suppose on account of the better conditions there and because the people are now better educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had here a Deputy from Cork city who has spent the last six or seven years in public and in private and in this House bemoaning the fact that three districts&mdash;Ballyclough, Blackrock and Douglas&mdash;were taken from his constituency and put into the city of Cork and for that reason he is no longer heading the poll and that it has been to the great detriment and handicap of his Party.  Now that they are being given back to him and the city is united again, he came into the House last week and, although he could not criticise the fact that they were given back, he made slighting references as to what the Minister was going to do and what he had up his sleeve when putting these portions back into the city of Cork.  Is it possible to please them?  Of course, it is not.  That is one of the benefits of being in Opposition.  You can have it both ways.  You can tell the people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and then you can cry crocodile tears because the consequence of voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; is to deprive them of their representatives in Dáil Éireann.  I agree with the Deputy who said that it would be impossible to get two men even of the same Party to draw up constituencies that would suit everybody.  In fact, if Solomon himself were to return he could hardly please <Col N="2022" /> every Deputy in drawing up constituencies.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has done a fair job.  Nothing has been pinpointed against him in regard to what he has done.  Personally, although far away from the county, I am sorry that Leitrim has gone as a political entity but we know where the blame is and it is not on the Fianna Fáil side.  I am perfectly certain of that.  I am sorry because I am afraid, if this is to continue, we will see other counties going off the political map in the future, all because the people will never get another chance of voting for the proposition contained in the Third Amendment.</P>

If there is anything wrong with this measure, it is due entirely to the result of the referendum and the advice given to the people by the Opposition Parties.</P>

I know from the few contacts I have that they are very aggrieved to think that a Fianna Fáil Minister would do this to the most Fianna Fáil Minister county in the country.  They feel they have been badly treated.  The word I hear most often used is the &ldquo;partition&rdquo; of Clare. &ldquo;Partition&rdquo; is a dirty word in this country.  That is how they feel.  They feel that badly in Clare that this is the term they use for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was given to understand when the <Col N="2023" /> Minister for Local Government was speaking about the redistribution of the constituencies prior to the referendum that the whole idea was to make constituencies, where possible, compact and not to breach county boundaries.  If elected in the next general election, I will find myself representing part of three counties&mdash; Roscommon, Galway and Clare.  It seems to me, in spite of what the previous speaker said, that the Minister is trying to penalise us in the west for defeating the proposition put forward in the referendum because he has breached every county boundary that he could possibly breach.</P>
    <P>The only explanation I could imagine for the swipe at Roscommon was that possibly it would help Deputy Millar but he has changed his mind and I do not think he intends to avail of the little bonus he got in that end of the constituency.</P>
    <P>I can see that amalgamation of Clare and Galway should help the Fianna Fáil people in the Galway end of the constituency.  I do not agree with the Deputy from Clare who says that Clare will elect a Fianna Fáil Deputy on their own.  I think this is impossible.  I am sure they would like to because I think Clare people like to vote for Clare people.  That is why I feel that I will get a vote in Clare.  I think it was done purely to protect the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Carty. It certainly will not do anything to boost the Government in that area.  The people feel they have been terribly let down.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we must play musical chairs in the constituencies. When I was first elected to the House some 11 years ago I stood for South Galway.  In those days Galway had three three-seat constituencies.  In those early days, Fianna Fáil held six seats and the Opposition had three.  Then we had a change of constituencies and East Galway was a five-seater and West Galway was a three-seater.  Then the Government slipped and it became obvious that, if we were to retain a five-seater in East Galway or if we went down to a four-seater, the Government would then drop another seat.  It <Col N="2024" /> could be argued that I might have lost a seat.  Certainly I might, but it looked more likely that it would be a Fianna Fáil seat that would go.  Obviously, there was hasty consultation by way of shoring up the slipping Fianna Fáil votes, so they turned it back into a three-seater.  The Government have not been very smart, and I think that out of the nine seats for Galway they will lose one if not two extra seats.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused when the last speaker, Deputy Healy, blamed the Deputies on the Opposition side of the House for the depopulation of the west.  It must be admitted that the people are leaving the west because they do not find it economic to live there any longer.  Surely we are not to blame for the economic state of the country?  The Government, and solely the Government, are to blame for the flight from the land.  It is interesting to note that since 1956 the population of Galway has gone down by 7,213 and I am afraid that in the next ten years there will be a similar drop unless we have a change of Government very quickly.</P>
    <P>I agree with the large number of speakers here who said that the gerrymandering and the butchering&mdash;to use the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce Deputy Colley, on television&mdash;has been done purely as a sort of revenge.  I remember the Minister, Deputy Colley, on the night of the referendum stating that: &ldquo;The people will be sorry when we come to the butchering of constituencies&rdquo;, and it looks as if the vendetta is being carried through to the bitter end.  While we welcome the people of Clare into the new Galway constituency, I have sympathy for them in that this has been perpetrated on them, because it looks as if they only got enough to make their presence felt but not enough to give them a Deputy.  However, I am sure that those of us in the Galway constituency who are elected will look after their interests as best we can.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht an Bhille seo a chur ós ár gcomhair.  Níl mórán le rá agam ina thaobh, agus ní chuirfidh mé moill rómhór <Col N="2025" /> ar an Teach leis na smaointí atá le nochtadh agam.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the last speaker, Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins. It is grand to hear the women of the country, especially those in this House, saying their piece.  We have accusations levelled at us from time to time in regard to the equality of women.  If we had more women elected to Dáil Éireann we might be able to disabuse the minds of people who feel we are against women in politics.  We are all in favour of women in this House, regardless of political allegiance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins says that Fianna Fáil have gerrymandered the constituency of Clare.  Surely the answer to this is that historically Clare has always been a Fianna Fáil constituency and will, indeed, always be a Fianna Fáil constituency?  At the moment it is represented for Fianna Fáil by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Dr. Hillery, Deputy Seán Ó Ceallaigh and Deputy Barrett.  If possible, we would have left it intact instead of having to split it up into the constituencies of Clare and Clare-Galway. As I say, Clare has a history of voting for Fianna Fáil.  It elected the President of Ireland, in the first instance, and from that time it has returned Fianna Fáil members with considerable majorities.  If Fianna Fáil wanted to gerrymander surely in this instance the wise thing would have been to leave that constituency intact.  Unfortunately, or fortunately as the case may be, this Bill had to be introduced and the constituencies had to be revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to indulge in self-interest in this debate, but there is one matter in the Bill which worries me in relation to the constituency I represent, the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  First of all, may I say that a considerable part of what I would consider to be my support has been taken away from me?  The townlands of Dundrum, Mount Merrion, Goatstown, Clonskea, Milltown&mdash;indeed, Milltown, where I hold a monthly clinic&mdash;all these have been taken away from the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. I should like to take <Col N="2026" /> this opportunity of thanking the people for the considerable support they have given Fianna Fáil over the years in those areas.  I am sorry I will not be their representative in the next election. Of course, I hope I will succeed again in the revised constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, but I would urge the people in those areas to support the Fianna Fáil candidates who will be on offer at the next general election.  I know very well the people who will be elected there for Fianna Fáil, whoever they may be, will give as good service as they have been getting to date.  That does not sound very humble, but it is a personal point of view, as all opinions are personal.</P>
    <P>In relation to the division of the constituency, the map in the Library which is available to Deputies shows a line going from Leopardstown Racecourse right up to Ballybrack, and then suddenly shooting down again to take in Shankill and Rathmichael.  I would ask the Minister to straighten out that line from Leopardstown Racecourse to Shankill.  This is the complete answer.  It gives a coherence to the constituency.  It makes it physically practicable to get around and I think the Deputies in the constituency, those representing Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, would like this line to be straightened out.  There is undoubtedly a bend in it which, in my opinion, is unnecessary.  The Minister could take a part of Rathmichael and a part of Shankill out of this constituency to solve the problem of balancing the population.  I can foresee no difficulty for the Minister in that respect, and I would urge him to have another look at the map which is available to Deputies in the Dáil Library.  Indeed, for historical reasons he might revise the map itself because in many ways it would appear to be out of date, in the sense that it does not deal particularly with new areas in the constituency, but I have no doubt that in time the map will be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>One matter which seems to have dogged this debate is the element of self-interest introduced by the Opposition Parties as to how representation of the constituencies will affect them personally; in other words this Bill has <Col N="2027" /> been reduced by the Opposition to a personal level.  This is, I think, a matter of some importance.  No Deputy worth his salt would have any fear about putting his name before the people in any given area.  Party politics are moving away from the arena of personalities into the area of Party policies.  Policies rather than personalities are what the people want today and they will follow the policy of a Party they consider good.  Discussing this Bill in terms of self-interest is very wrong.  Any candidate offering himself to the people should be prepared to take what is coming to him whether he be elected or defeated.</P>
    <P>The debate has been one long litany of self-interest in the case of the Opposition Party and I should like to remind them that it is the people who decide these issues and that coming here to shed crocodile tears merely indicates their own little area of self-interest. &ldquo;Shall I or shall I not be elected the next time?&rdquo;&mdash; that is apparently the question they are discussing.  Can anybody in the House, particularly from city or suburban constituencies, say with certainty where his votes come from?  Can he go along a street in suburbia and say: &ldquo;That is Deputy Andrews' side of the street; that is Deputy Cosgrave's side; that is Deputy Booth's street and that is Deputy Dockrell's&rdquo;?  Alternatively, can he go along and say that houses numbers 1 to 10 are Andrews' street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure that when I am dead and buried the people of Dún Laoghaire will erect some sort of monument to me and, if not, perhaps they will consider calling a street after me.  Can one say with certainty that No. 1 is Andrews', No. 2 Cosgrave's, No. 3 Andrews', No. 4 Dockrell's and No. 5 Booth's?  One cannot do that any more.  City and suburban people and, I have no doubt, rural people are becoming far more sophisticated than those who voted traditionally for a Party out of loyalty to that Party.  The new generation is more concerned with policies than with personalities.  We are moving into an arena of sophistication <Col N="2028" /> in politics.  With the coverage given to politics by RTE, the newspapers and various journals people are becoming far more aware and this is a very good thing.  Communication has been lax over the years but now, with more modern media, people know and understand issues which are put clearly before them.  In saying this I do not intend in any way to denigrate those people who have voted from the establishment of the State up to five, six or seven years ago.  They had their own views and their own ways of formulating their opinions but people nowadays are becoming more aware.</P>
      <P>I have here some rather interesting statistics.  There have been four revisions of constituencies before this: this will be the fifth.  There was a revision of constituencies before the election on the 9th June, 1927.  The second revision was before the election of the 1st July, 1937, the third in 1948 and the fourth before the election of the 4th October, 1961.  I am not in a position to announce to the House when the next general election will be but it will be held after the fifth revision of the constituencies. The number of TDs defeated in the election of the 9th June, 1927 was 43.  The number who did not contest the election was 30. The number of TDs defeated in the election of the 1st July, 1937 was 31 and the number who did not offer themselves for election was 16.  After the fourth revision of the constituencies in the election of the 4th October, 1961 the number defeated was 11 and the number of TDs who did not contest the election was 15.  The average turnover of Deputies in 16 general elections only four of which followed revision of constituencies, was 33.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to check that again.  There were four revisions of constituencies and I am grateful to the Deputy for reminding me but it was not in 1947; it was in 1948.  That was the third time the constituencies were revised.  The number of TDs defeated was 20 and the number who did not contest the election was nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now coming to the fifth revision of the constituencies.  The first <Col N="2029" /> revision was on the 27th August, 1923; the second on the 1st July, 1937; the third on the 4th February, 1948 and the fourth on the 4th October, 1961. This is a matter that concerns all of us but we should look at it more from the point of view of how we can serve the people rather than how they can serve us.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of abuse has been levelled at the Minister and for the record, I want to say that from my own experience as a Deputy and as a party worker in Fianna Fáil in my townland of Dundrum for the past 16 or 17 years, the Minister for Local Government has consistently received bad press or bad publicity.  This has been uninformed and unreasonable.  For my part as a backbench Deputy of the Party I can say that the Minister, Deputy Boland, is a man who is available to backbench Deputies and I have no doubt available to all Deputies in the House.  One has just to mention a problem to him in relation to a residents' association anxious to meet the Minister for Local Government and give him a day's notice and you can come in and line up behind a large queue of people waiting to see him. He is an extremely hard-working and dedicated Minister and a man of integrity. It comes ill from certain Deputies to level at him the type of abuse that has been forthcoming from them.</P>
    <P>Personally, I want to thank the Minister for what he has done for the constituency I represent.  He is going into the new constituency of South County Dublin and I have no doubt he will receive the same support as I received there.  I wish him the very best of luck in these areas of Milltown, parts of Dundrum, Goatstown, Mount Merrion and Clonskeagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Minister in his approach to the redistribution of constituencies tried to achieve what he had failed to achieve in the recent referendum.  He set out, in so far as it was in his power to do so, to nullify the wishes of the people which were so clearly expressed in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people gave their verdict in no <Col N="2030" /> uncertain manner and even the most ardent Fianna Fáil Members of this House stated that they were glad that there had been a very clear-cut decision and that there was no ambiguity about the result.  The people had spoken and spoken clearly and loudly to the effect that they wished to retain the PR system of election.  The Taoiseach himself said that the lesson of the referendum would not be lost.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody knows&mdash;and it has long been agreed by all Members of this House&mdash;that PR worked at its best in larger constituencies; the larger the constituency, the better PR is seen to work.  The Government should realise even at this late hour how foolish and stupid they are in trying to alter the system.  They should accept the lesson they have learned and agree to abide by the wishes of the people.  The wish of the people is that PR be retained but the Minister, in the revision of the constituencies, has adopted the opposite attitude.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum we see that in 1961 there were 17 three-seat constituencies and, under the new Bill, the Minister proposes to have no fewer than 26 such constituencies.  In other words, he has created more small constituencies and this is in direct contrast with what the people expressed in the referendum.  We had 12 four-seat constituencies in 1961 but, under the new Bill, there will be 14 and, of course, as regards five-seat constituencies in which PR works very effectively, the Minister is reducing these from nine to two under the new system.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister was careful to pick and choose the different areas in which he will make three-seat and four-seat constituencies.  All along the western coast, from Donegal to Kerry where he knows that as yet Labour have not been very strong and the issue has mainly been between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the Minister is hoping, with a small majority in these three-seat areas, to get two out of three.  That is the sole purpose of having three-seat constituencies in that area.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, where Fianna Fáil know that in a three-seat constituency it is <Col N="2031" /> practically a foregone conclusion that the three seats would divide 1-1-1 &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash;they are hoping that they will be able to get two out of four in the four-seat areas.  Two out of four is much better for them than one out of three.  In the five-seat constituencies in Dublin, Fianna Fáil hope only to get two out of five; they could not hope to get three out of five, hence, the Minister is reducing those five-seat areas and making them four-seat ones.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last local elections when the Minister revised the local authority areas, it was accepted here by all Parties, Fianna Fáil as well as Fine Gael and Labour, that the decision to divide North Dublin and South Dublin by the Liffey was a very wise one. Part of the No. 9 local authority area embraced part of the north side of the Liffey but then the Minister decided that this would no longer be the case. Members of all Parties seemed satisfied that the north and south sides were clearly divided by the Liffey.  In this Bill, however, the Minister is re-introducing that.  He is now creating a constituency of Dublin Central.</P>

      <P>I do not know but surely the Minister could have devised something better in County Dublin.  I do not know if there is any truth in the rumour that he created North <Col N="2033" /> County Dublin and South County Dublin because he did not want to be in the constituency with Deputy P. J. Burke.  That rumour has been going around that the Minister wanted Deputy Burke out of the constituency. However, a more daring example of the way constituencies were carved solely and entirely for the purpose of suiting Fianna Fáil is Mayo.  The county of Mayo has practically the same population still, but instead of having a North and South Mayo now we will have an east and west side. Was there any advantage in changing to east and west rather than north and south?  The only answer to that is that Fianna Fáil did not want to have two Ministers in the one constituency and this was a way of dividing it.</P>
      <P>Of course, the county of Leitrim has been completely carved up.  Part of it has gone to Donegal, some of it to Roscommon and some to Sligo.  It no longer exists at all.  The Minister took the part around Athlone and purposely put it into Roscommon in the hope that it would suit the Fianna Fáil Minister in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Leitrim no longer exists as a political entity on the map, we see that the Taoiseach was in undue haste, within a fortnight of the death of Senator Miss Pearse, in appointing a Senator to that area.  He did not wait a month before he appointed a Senator, and I do not know what was the need for this great haste.</P>

      <P>I will be brief on this. Before the debate comes to a conclusion I should like to say a few words in so far as the revision of the constituencies is concerned.  At the outset I would say that, looking at this revision from a personal point of view, I should be pleased indeed with it.  I represent the constituency of Mid-Cork and I also represent Bandon/Macroom electoral area in the Cork County Council. Up to now in the old constituency the area I represent in the local authority was almost detached from the constituency I represent in Dáil Éireann and the Minister has included in that constituency now the area where I live and the town of Macroom.  I agree with the Minister only on this point.  This town has been changed in every revision that has come about and it should always be included in the constituency of Cork.  This town is always regarded as the capital of Mid-Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as I am concerned, I am mature enough and have experience enough to look beyond my own door and beyond the boundaries of the constituency of Mid-Cork.  The proposed new constituency, if it is not altered in this constituency revision, is almost 90 miles in length.  I believe the Minister had complete disregard for <Col N="2035" /> distance.  In the new constituency there are four outgoing Opposition Deputies. There are two Labour Deputies&mdash; Deputies McAuliffe and Mrs. Desmond &mdash;and two Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;Deputies Burton and I.  This was set up for the purpose of trying to select a constituency where the two Labour Deputies would be opposed to each other and the two Fine Gael Deputies. In so far as that constituency is concerned, with regard to the two Fine Gael Deputies at least after the next election we will return two Fine Gael TDs in that constituency.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the gerrymandering in the city of Dublin as I do not know enough about that but as far as Cork county is concerned&mdash;I am sure Deputy Crowley will agree with me&mdash;and particularly the constituency of Mid-Cork, you have an area in Mid-Cork where Kinsale is almost in the centre of the county and you have Kinsale town in the new constituency of West Cork and Pearson's Bridge at the entrance to Bantry which is near the west of Cork.  This does not make sense.  You have the constituency extending from Newtownshandrom and Charleville right across to Crosshaven. In the old constituency I represent there are two different housing areas, the southern Cork housing area and the northern housing area as well.  I felt the people I represent were at a disadvantage. People who came to me in connection with problems would be dealt with by the Northern Housing Committee of which I was not a member. The only way I can make representations on their behalf is by letter or telephone.  If I am returned to the Dáil in the new constituency, which is divided between three housing areas and three health authorities as well, I can see a difficulty.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that the recently-held referendum showed in no uncertain terms that the people wanted to hold on to the system of PR.  I will not refer to the referendum beyond saying that the people figured that the PR system had served them well and that it was a most democratic system.  If we are honest&mdash;and surely the Minister <Col N="2036" /> for Local Government is honest?&mdash;we must agree that it is an established fact that if proportional representation is to be used effectively it can be used to greatest effect in five- or six-seat constituencies rather than in a three-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>Particularly along the western seaboard, all the constituencies there are three-seat constituencies.  The Minister for Local Government is hoping, I suppose, that, with 51 per cent of the vote cast in those three-seat constituencies, Fianna Fáil can gain two out of the three seats.  The referendum proved that the political tide has turned against the Government.  Their hope now is that gerrymandering of constituencies will modify the trend.  I know perfectly well that this will not be so and that the people, having in no uncertain way given their answer in the referendum, will certainly give them their answer again whether there are three-seat, four-seat or five-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>There are many counties such as County Leitrim that have been completely mutilated.  I admit that it is probably a difficult job to divide the constituencies and that, no matter what way they are divided, somebody is likely to complain but I cannot see any reason why a county like Leitrim should be divided between three counties. Look at the constituency of Galway-Clare, where a part of Clare had to go into Galway.  The Minister for Local Government will be known as the great exterminator of county and constituency boundaries.</P>
    <P>Let me come back again to the constituency of mid-Cork.  In the recent referendum.  I had in my possession from the Fianna Fáil director of elections in that constituency, a printed pamphlet signed by Deputy Tom Meaney, Director of Elections in the northern area of Millstreet, Knocknagree and Boherbue.  Leaflets were handed out to the effect that, if the people in that area voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; then that area would go into Kerry in the revision of constituencies.  I refer to this because that very Deputy, when he spoke here this evening on this very Bill, stated that the Fine Gael <Col N="2037" /> Party were threatening and spreading false propaganda in the referendum in order to intimidate and force people into voting &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The people have voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and have held on to the system of proportional representation.</P>

      <P>When the Minister comes to reply to this debate, it will be most interesting to hear his reply to the charge by Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan that it is quite illogical, even dishonourable, for a person in his position, who did all that one man could do to overthrow the system of proportional representation, to come now into this House with an Electoral (Amendment) Bill which purports to reorganise the operation of the system.  Deputy Fitzpatrick points out most significantly that the Minister breached the <Col N="2038" /> normal and sensible convention of this House that a Minister, when introducing a Bill, recommends the Bill to the House.  It is quite clear that, having been thwarted by a substantial majority in the referendum, the Minister is now doing what he can&mdash;indeed, it is not very much but it is enough to warrant a protest&mdash;to make the system of proportional representation inoperable.</P>
      <P>In the course of the many interesting television presentations&mdash;&ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; and other programmes&mdash; during the referendum campaign, the programme which gave us the history of proportional representation established very significantly that those who propounded the system visualised large constituencies because the system of proportional representation comes into play to full effect in large constituencies.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is very interesting to recall something which many Members of the Oireachtas may overlook.  In the early days of this State, when we were filled with enthusiasm for proportional representation as the fairest system, large constituencies were the rule rather than the exception.  In the election for the Seanad fought on the universal franchise in the 1920's, the whole country was a single constituency. It might not have been very practicable and it did not work, it is true, but, nevertheless, the fact that this development took place establishes that those concerned with proportional representation at the time were anxious to operate it in large constituencies.  Indeed, for many years, up to the first Fianna Fáil gerrymander in the 1930's, we had constituencies of seven members and nine members in Dublin city&mdash;the whole of North Dublin as one constituency and the whole of South Dublin as another. Now, we have a reduction in the number of five-member constituencies from nine to two and we have an increase of nine in the number of threemember constituencies, in the hope that Fianna Fáil will obtain two out of three seats, thwarting, as I have said, the principle of proportional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Dublin Deputy, I resent very <Col N="2039" /> much the line taken by the Minister and the Tánaiste in endeavouring to promote friction and ill-will between the west of Ireland and Dublin city in the allegations made in the course of this debate.  If the population of the west has declined from the point of view of the principle of one man one vote, which the Government did their best to overthrow, that is not the fault of my constituents in Dublin NorthEast or the fault of any other voters in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter not in any spirit of acrimony or criticism of the Taoiseach or, indeed, of criticism at all, but because a very important principle is at stake.  The question is whether or not State-sponsored companies will be allowed to compete with ordinary trading interests, interests which have to pay rents, rates and taxes and carry all their own costs whereas, in this particular case, in which a very large one, the question of costs is something that can be completely disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know every member of the staff of this particular company and I am glad to learn from the Taoiseach that all the staff have been assimilated by the Sugar Company and their jobs are secure.  I am not raising this matter merely to chase some hare. I raise it because it is a matter of grave public interest.  In my opinion, it is vitally important that we should come down on either one side of the fence or <Col N="2040" /> the other.  Is it the intention now that State-sponsored companies will enter into competition with ordinary citizens and trading interests, or is it not? There is, too, the fact that there seems to be a contradiction in the two statements made to Deputy Clinton and myself when we asked supplementary questions and the answer given to me yesterday.  If it is a case of the Taoiseach not being completely briefed on the first occasion, then I have no criticism to offer, but it is important that the matter should be clarified and that we should know once and for all whether or not State-sponsored companies are going to indulge in this sort of trading.</P>
    <P>The background is important.  Interchem was an agent here for Fisons which distribute a large range of agricultural and horticultural chemicals. They did it, having moved from one agency here, through a company called Interchem which, I think, they themselves floated.  The position was that the particular products were available here and were in competition with the products of other companies selling a similar range of products under different brand names. Apparently, Interchem was going to fold up and the Sugar Company took it over on the basis that there was a certain chemical&mdash;I do not want to advertise any brand name&mdash;necessary for use on the beet crop.  The reason given by the Taoiseach was that it was to ensure supplies of this particular chemical that the company was taken over.  It is important at this stage that I should advert to the fact that if the costs of this company were taken in relation, for instance, to the amount of money that would be brought in by one-eighth of a penny per lb of sugar you could produce a colossal profit in this company when, in fact, all that would be happening would be that the citizens would be paying fractionally more for the product they use in their daily lives.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to volume 237 of the Official Report, column 172, of Wednesday, 13th November, 1968. Deputy Clinton asked the Minister for Finance if he would give details of <Col N="2041" /> the takeover by the Irish Sugar Company of Interchem and the Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>Interchem Ltd. is an Irish company engaged in the distribution of agro-chemicals some of which are considered by the Irish Sugar Company to be of importance to the beet industry.  The company was about to cease trading and the Irish Sugar Company was anxious to ensure that the products in which it was interested would continue to be available to beet growers. Accordingly, the Irish Sugar Company acquired the share capital of Interchem Ltd., which will continue to trade as a separate company offering the same range of services as it has offered in the past.  The existing staff of Interchem Ltd. have not been disturbed in their employment.</P>
    <P>I then asked a supplementary question:</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: Does the Taoiseach not know that the product, which he state was a worry in relation to its being available to the Irish farmer for the production of beet, its being available anyway in Britain for which Interchem is an agent?  The answer the Taoiseach gave is quite incorrect.  This is a case where a semi-State company has entered into competition with other companies in this country.</P>
    <P>There were other supplementaries, including one by Deputy Dillon as to what the consideration was for the purchase of the shareholding of the company, but it is the Taoiseach's last replies which are the salient ones:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: the only intention is to secure delivery for the purpose for which it was used hitherto; that is, beet growing.  There is no competition with other Irish chemical companies.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: We take it they will not indulge in competition with other companies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: If they do they will not be permitted.</P>
    <P>That, as far as I was concerned, settled <Col N="2042" /> the matter.  I then discovered that in the Carlow-Kilkenny area meetings were being held by various people in the agro-chemical trade at which a complete range of products offered by the present company were being offered wholesale through Interchem Ltd.  In other wards, a State-sponsored company had gone into direct competition selling similar types of goods.  Now that is an extremely bad principle.  It is one on which we must now be guided by the Taoiseach.  In passing, I should like to point out that not only did this occur but the Irish Sugar Company has now gone into competition with compound millers and is offering compound feeds for sale direct to farmers. May I once more point out that one-eighth of a penny on the lb of sugar would again change the price at which these products are sold by, perhaps, £2, £3, £4, or £5 a ton?  In my view, that is improper and unfair competition. It is competition to which a complete stop should be put in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The question I asked the Taoiseach yesterday is of interest.  I asked the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>If he is aware that notwithstanding his undertaking in reply to supplementary questions on 13th November a firm (name and address supplied) and its State sponsored holding company are in direct competition with existing traders and have held meetings of customers all over the country to offer them their wares; and if he will take steps to ensure that such competition will not be continued.</P>
    <P>The reply given by the Taoiseach is as follows:</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to the question on 13th November, the firm in question will continue to trade as a separate company offering the same range of services as it has offered in the past.  Trading will continue through the established channels, and groups of merchants who are established customers have already been assured by the firm that there will be no change in its distribution arrangements.  The intervention of the holding company was to ensure the continuation of the <Col N="2043" /> availability in this country, in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices, of certain chemical sprays of importance to the beet industry.  It was never intended that the firm should case its normal commercial trading solely because it became a subsidiary of a State-sponsored company. There is no intention that it will engage in any unfair competition throughout the country and, consequently, I see not justification for limiting its commercial freedom.</P>
    <P>That is in absolute contradiction to what was said on 13th November.  Now certain supplementaries were asked and I want to make it clear here that I am quoting now from the carbon copy, which I obtained from the editorial section, and, if there are any corrections to be made, it is only fair to the Taoiseach that I should point out the source from which I am quoting:</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: Does the Taoiseach not agree that on 13th November he assured me in his reply on that date that this firm would not compete with existing firms and that the take-over by the operating company was merely to guarantee the provision of certain chemicals for the beet-growers?  The Taoiseach's reply today is in exact contradiction to that of the 13th.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I told the Deputy the company would continue the kind of operations they had engaged in and, when he spoke about competition, I answered his question in the context of this new company being a subsidiary of a State company would not have any commercial advantage over a private company but must continue its present range of operation.  In fact, beet-growing farmers are always asking the Sugar Company to expand their range of services on these lines.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: If the Taoiseach reads his reply of 13th November he will clearly see that he assured me there would be no competition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: But that would mean they would have to withdraw from business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> Mr. Donegan: The Taoiseach assured me further that the purpose of the exercise was to provide certain chemicals for beet-growers, which was pure cod because anyone with a pound note could buy it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: My information is that those engaged in this operation would not produce nor were they interested in the kind of chemicals needed by the beet-growers and supplied by this company.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: That is a complete contradiction of what the Taoiseach told me on the 13th.</P>
    <P>I hold that is a complete contradition. I hold that this is a further intrusion on the rights of private enterprise, private business.  I hold that when a person pays rent, rates and taxes, pays properly negotiated trade union wages, and behaves properly in every sense in his business capacity, he should not be interrupted or competed with by any State sponsored company, because when we come to the question of State sponsored bodies, the ESB or another body, their accounts are very often a matter of opinion.  For instance, if Interchem Ltd. are given offices in the Sugar Company Buildings, what will be the charge for those offices?  If there is an accountancy fee at the end of the year, what will the charge be?  How do you break down all the costs?  If the company have cars and if the Sugar Company have garages and those cars are kept in those garages, what will the charge be?  Are we sure there will be an exact break down of the costs that should be levied against the gross profits of the company when they produce their net profits?</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that it is quite incorrect and improper that we should have competition from a State sponsored company with private traders. This should cease.  I want to say again that I know personally all the people in Interchem.  I am delighted that their jobs were preserved.  I know the Taoiseach's word is good enough on that.  Their jobs will be preserved.  I hold that either the Taoiseach was not properly briefed on 13th November, or something slipped.  Whatever happened&mdash;and <Col N="2045" /> I think the House will agree with me if they read the references I have given&mdash;I got an absolute guarantee on 13th November that there would be no competition with existing companies operating in this field, and it now appears that there will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The background facts to the take-over by the Irish Sugar Company of Interchem Ltd. are broadly as Deputy Donegan has stated them.  There is no conflict on that.  As I have already stated in reply to Parliamentary questions, the Irish Sugar Company's main concern in acquiring Interchem Ltd. was to secure that certain agro-chemical products would continue to be made available to the Irish beet-growing industry.  The use of agro-chemicals in beet-growing must be strictly controlled as regards quality and as regards timing of application. The Sugar Company have always guided the beet-growers in these respects.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Company consider that the products marketed by Interchem Ltd. are the most suitable products for the beet-growing industry.  They were, therefore, particularly interested to ensure that the supply of the products marketed by Interchem would continue to be made available to the beet-growers.  As a result they did not want Interchem to go out of business, which would affect the continuation of the supply.  The expressed intention is to run Interchem as a separate company. It will depend on its own resources. I think that answers the last part of the Deputy's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company will continue to work through existing established channels and not through Sugar Company agents.  The Sugar Company's instructors and agents will not be acting in any way as promoters or salesmen for Interchem products.  Interchem will not deal directly with farmers for anything in which it is not already in direct contact with the farmers.  It will not add anything to its list of products for direct offer which it did not offer in the past.  These are firm assurances which I have been authorised to give by the Sugar Company.  If Interchem <Col N="2046" /> incurs trading loss it will have to bear that loss itself without assistance from the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>The meetings to which Deputy Donegan referred a moment ago in the Carlow-Kilkenny area were meetings which Interchem had with its regular customers.  The Sugar Company also arranged a meeting with the agro-chemical group to indicate the circumstances of the take-over and to indicate that Interchem were prepared to work with the existing partners in the business, in the existing range of products, and within the limits of the present range of activities as they had already done.  The Irish Agro-Chemical Association, by the way, is representative of the principal traders in the business and also includes certain manufacturing firms.  The Association have been assured that Interchem will continue to operate on an ordinary commercial basis without favouritism or support from the parent company. The Sugar Company and Interchem have indicated that they will give full support to any move the Association wish to make to ensure that trading and trading practices in the agro-chemical business are conducted on a reasonable and economic basis.</P>
    <P>I might mention here that the Sugar Company have purchased quantities of their requirements of agro-chemicals from Irish manufacturing companies. The manufacturing companies were apprehensive about this take-over but the Sugar Company assured them that they were willing and anxious to take from them the same type of products which they had always taken from them and that they were prepared to work with them and not only assist them inexpanding their range of products but also to assist them in marketing as far as possible.  There is no evidence whatever that because of its association with a State-sponsored company&mdash;the Sugar Company&mdash;Interchem will become a disruptive force in the agro-chemical business.  The company will be obliged to measure up to the same commercial criteria as it had in the past.  Even in the case of the Sugar Company it will have to tender for the Sugar Company's agro-chemical <Col N="2047" /> requirements the same as any other company in the business.  Interchem is, of course, anxious to continue as a member of the Agro-Chemical Association and it is willing to work in full co-operation with them and to work at all times in the best interests of the trade.</P>
    <P>To come to the suggestion that I went back on an undertaking I gave to the Deputy I want to repeat again the answer I gave to Deputy Clinton as reported at column 173 of the Official Report of 13th November, 1968. I said:</P>
    <P>.... Interchem Ltd. ... will continue to trade as a separate company offering the same range of services as it has offered in the past.</P>
    <P>That is a very clear statement.  Further on Deputy Donegan asked:</P>
    <P>Is it the intention of the Sugar Company to market the products of the parent company in Britain?</P>
    <P>I take it that by the parent company he means Fisons.  Deputy Donegan specifically mentioned the Sugar Company in that supplementary question and that must be taken in the context of the subsequent supplementary which he asked:</P>
    <P>We take it they will not indulge in competition with other companies.</P>
    <P>I take it it was still the Sugar Company he was referring to.  I said very plainly:</P>
    <P>If they do they will not be permitted.</P>
    <P>Even if the Deputy contends that this cannot be read into the context of his previous supplementary question, I <Col N="2048" /> can assure him that the answer is that there will not be unfair competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about agro-chemicals as sold by Interchem Ltd.  What I have in mind is that the Sugar Company itself will not be engaged in the marketing of agro-chemicals. It was clear from the main reply to Deputy Clinton's question that Interchem will continue to trade in the normal way and in ordinary competition with other wholesalers of these products.  As I said and I repeat again: &ldquo;The company will continue to trade as a separate company offering the same range of services as it has offered in the past.&rdquo;  To interpret otherwise what I said in reply to a quick flash of a supplementary question from Deputy Donegan across the floor of the House would mean they would have to come altogether out of trading in the lines they do&mdash;if the Deputy wants to interpret it in the very narrow way which he has done.  The fact is that the Sugar Company do not propose to engage in this business themselves. Interchem will operate as a subsidiary of the company on its own merits, carrying its own losses, tendering in common with other companies and marketing agencies to the Sugar Company for its requirements.  In the circumstances I see no justification whatever for putting any commercial restraints on Interchem Ltd. because of this new position.  Firm assurances have been given that it will not derive any commercial advantage by virtue of its association with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> The foregoing represent the main groups of workers employed by my Department.  There are, however, various other categories for whom the question of overtime has not arisen. It is the practice of my Department, in fixing rates of pay, to have regard to the rates payable in comparable outside employment in the area concerned and this practice would be followed if the question of overtime for any of these employees arose.</P>
