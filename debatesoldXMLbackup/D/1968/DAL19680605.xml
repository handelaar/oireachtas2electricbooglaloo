    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any proposals to reform the method of conducting business in the Dáil are contemplated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be recalled that the conduct of business of this House was the subject of debate in December, 1965, when, as Minister for Finance, I introduced the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Bill, 1965, with the aim of securing a more rational and effective use of the time devoted to parliamentary financial business. Since the enactment of that measure, there has been no general complaint about the conduct of business in Dáil Éireann, and the Government are not, at present, contemplating any proposals in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think the time has come when this House should up-date its procedures, which, in the main, were borrowed from those of the British House of Commons?  Does he not think there is a danger of this place becoming an isolated club in its procedures and traditions unless we make proceedings in this House more relevant to the affairs of the country?  Does the Taoiseach suggest there is no need for change at present in the conduct of business here?  Is he not aware that, even in the British House of Commons, there are people attempting to up-date procedures there and does he see no need for change here in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always reason for change so long as it is change for the better.  I do not know what the Deputy has in mind by the expression &ldquo;up-date&rdquo;.  If it is to be modern just for the sake of being modern, then that is not a valid reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that a lot of time is wasted in this House, particularly on the Committee Stage of Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a specific point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that we should adopt a system whereby several Committees would be running at the same time in order to have practically all the House engaged in these Committees?  Also, does the Taoiseach not recall that&mdash;as far as I remember&mdash;one of the terms of reference of the famous Constitution Committee, established by his predecessor, Deputy S. Lemass, included a reference to an examination of all our institutions, including Parliament, to see how much more effectively they could work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That Committee has, I believe, terms of reference to that effect, namely, that they review the political, legislative and constitutional institutions of Government&mdash;that was the term used.  With regard to the suggestion that more Committee business might be done outside the House, when that question was put to me, shortly after I became Taoiseach, I said I felt the Irish people wanted their parliamentary business done in the open, as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in other Parliaments&mdash;in the British Parliament and in the United States Parliament&mdash; this system of Committee work. However, in the United States, there is much more work to be done than could possibly be done in the open forum.  Similarly, with the British Parliament.  There is this distinction in the United States and in European Parliaments that Ministers and members of Government are not members of Parliament and do not <Col N="461" /> come into the House to debate matters. Until it can be seen that we cannot do our business effectively on the floor of this House, I do not see why our method of conducting our business should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want work done in secret Committees but as it is done in Britain and in the United States where press, radio, television and the public are allowed to sit in at the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that situation is reached, certainly I will contemplate change.  I would welcome the change if we found we could not do our Committee work in the House. We have several instances of Committee work being done outside the House&mdash;the Companies Bill, which I handled myself, and the Income Tax (Consolidation) Bill, which I also handled.  On Bills like these it is much more expeditious and satisfactory.  On the other hand, we are a limited House in so far as we have 144 Members.  If we had sufficient Committees going at the same time, it would be difficult for the remaining Deputies to keep the business of the House going.  It is a fact that in some of the Parliaments to which Deputies have referred members are torn between Committees and the House and between one Committee and another. It is not always easy to adopt a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that after 46 years wherein we have had no change there should be an immediate review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But there was a change which was effected with the consent of the House when I was Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Deputy Corish accompanied me to a discussion with the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, when we agreed on substantial changes after very careful deliberations regarding the transaction of financial business in the House with a view to its expedition?  Is there now any reason to believe that if the Taoiseach, <Col N="462" /> or the Leader of the Labour Party or the Leader of my Party feel that any further reform is called for and if they request a meeting with the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach would not be glad to meet them, discuss the reform, have it considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which is representative of all the House, Parties and individual Deputies included, all of whose voices are entitled to be heard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why that should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, as a member of the Constitution Committee which has been mentioned here, ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that in spite of a request to the Chairman, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to convene a meeting to deal with this matter which it is so necessary to deal with, we have not had a meeting for six months and it would appear that the whole purpose of this Committee now is really a manoeuvre to get this business which is so dear to the Government before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas the terms of reference call for a review of parliamentary procedure.  Would the Taoiseach not direct that this Committee should be convened right away and get down to this most important job of looking at our methods of procedure, many of which are completely out of date, and only exist by reason of the fact that they were originally created by the British?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the Labour Party have abandoned it and would not attend a meeting if it were convened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally and absolutely false because in fact I have requested a meeting of that Committee and the Taoiseach must be aware of that.  I was assured there would be a meeting but there has not been a meeting for six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the precise information required by the Deputy is not available, it may be possible to obtain an indication of the order of magnitude of the numbers involved from the following considerations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the 1966 Census of Population the total number of widows aged under 55 years was 17,827 and it may <Col N="464" /> be presumed that the great majority of widows having dependent children would fall into this category.</P>
    <P>The number of widows under 55 years of age who were gainfully occupied in 1966 was 8,030.  Of this number, approximately 3,550 were in agricultural occupations and 4,480 were in non-agricultural occupations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if the Government recognise the sovereignty of Israel over the territory acquired by that State in 1967; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>As to the second part, the Government consider that no country has the right to annex the territory of its neighbours.  As I said at the Fifth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 27th June, 1967, which was convened to consider the situation in the Middle-East:</P>
      <P>If the Security Council did not insist on the restoration of the boundaries as of 4th June, the very basis of the Charter would be destroyed....  Anything less than a complete withdrawal would be intolerable on the part of a signatory of the United Nations Charter.</P>
      <P>I made it clear on that occasion that we believe that one of the elements of any stable and lasting peace in the Middle-East must be the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied by it during the hostilities, and this was affirmed by the United Nations Security Council in its resolution of 22nd November, 1967.  The Council also affirmed the necessity for guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government accept that the 1960 war was triggered off by the military menace of Israel's Arab neighbours and that since then Israel has continued its efforts to bring <Col N="465" /> her Arab neighbours to the conference table and, notwithstanding those efforts to have a conference in the area to get agreement on the question of Israeli security, the people who menaced her then continue to menace her now and even menace her in a more threatening fashion today?  Having regard to this, would the Government use their good offices to see that there is an early meeting in the Middle-East between the parties, with particular regard to the need to give Israel security and, if necessary, such territory as may be necessary to maintain that security in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have explained the Government's policy about which the Deputy put down a question and, as the Deputy is aware, the United Nations representative is at present busily engaged in trying to bring the parties together to negotiate a lasting and peaceful settlement.</P>

      <P>CIE have, however, secured a contract for the transport of dolomite from Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, to Ballinacourty, Dungarvan, County Waterford, where a factory is being established for the manufacture of magnesite.  CIE propose to re-open for this traffic the section of the railway line between Waterford and Dungarvan to a point about 1½ miles from Dungarvan, from which it is proposed to construct a railway siding connecting the railway line with the factory.</P>
      <P>The magnesite will be transported by rail from Ballinacourty to Cork via Waterford and Limerick Junction.  CIE have informed me that this new traffic would not make it an economic proposition to re-open the whole of the Waterford-Mallow railway line.</P>

      <P>The recent appointment of an established postman from the nearby head office at Castlerea was in accordance with the long-standing policy of filling full-time posts by officers appointed by Civil Service Commission competition.  It is the case that the former occupant was a local man, but that arose from his employment on the full-time post&mdash;as an alternative to terminating his services <Col N="468" />&mdash;when it was upgraded in 1955 from part-time status.  The circumstances now are quite different as the part-time post remains available for the part-time postman who temporarily performed the full-time job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a temporary vacancy arising from the regretted death through an accident of the full-time postman in that area.  In the normal run of things, when something like that happens, the Post Office approaches the employment exchange for a list of men and appoints somebody in a temporary capacity.  The Post Office are usually not ready to put in a full-time man the minute an unexpected vacancy like that arises.  It is not right, but it is typical of the Deputy, to suggest that there was any political interference in this case.  The man appointed is a full-time postman appointed by the Civil Service Commission and this is the type of appointment that is desirable in order to be able to provide full-time established employment.  The postman did the test and went through the necessary training.  There is no question of the man in question being replaced.  That man was informed when he was taking on the job that it was only a temporary position.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the right to make regulations from time to time in regard to the payment of this production allowance which is now standing at 7d.  One of the matters which was brought to the attention of this creamery and all others was that where there was any intimidation attempted and where, as a result of that intimidation, the milk of any supplier failed to be collected, then the cost of alternative methods of delivery would be deducted from the allowance payable to that creamery.  In this case there were two such people; it happened for only a very short time because it got through to those who would do otherwise.  I have no apologies whatever to make for doing this.  I think I had every right to do it on behalf of the people who pay the piper, in this case the taxpayers, whose money was being paid to a creamery who by various means were causing intimidation to the point where their collector refused to collect milk from certain people because they would not join a particular organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to previous questions on these matters on 21st February, 3rd April, and 1st and 30th May.</P>
      <P>In my reply on 30th May, I dealt comprehensively with the situation regarding skim milk and pointed out that current difficulties affect only a limited proportion of producers.  I indicated the measures which are being taken to deal with the situation, mainly by promoting increased use of skim for livestock feeding.  I would hope that the use of skim for this purpose will be so increased that there will be little or no loss to producers generally as a result of the collapse of the price of skim milk powder on export markets.</P>
      <P>As regards milk supplies generally, the existing support system and marketing arrangements are not affected by the difficulties arising in export markets. With the obligation on An Bord Bainne to accept at 469s per cwt. all butter of the required standard offered to it, there is no reason why any creamery should be unable to dispose of its production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are heavy stocks of dairy products in a number of countries at present and prices on export markets have weakened considerably.  This is leading to a substantial increase in the <Col N="474" /> losses being incurred on our exports and unfortunately there are no grounds for assuming that there will be an early and sustained improvement in the export market situation.  At the same time our milk output is expanding steadily and the creamery intake seems likely to exceed 500 million gallons this year as compared with 473 million gallons in 1967.  Despite the export market difficulties, however, the expansion in the creamery intake coupled with the higher prices for calves this year will mean a substantial increase in the income of dairy farmers in 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider the increased costs of production at all?  Surely incomes and production costs should be considered together in this case?  Costs of production have increased.  The Minister says that production has increased and it continues to increase on his advice, the advice given in the small farms plan in the West and elsewhere, and, at the same time, is it not true to say that the income from milk will drop considerably in the present year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of processed separated milk has fallen catastrophically, due to its subsidisation in Europe and, as a result of that, the Irish factories are not able to take the separated milk.

If the Minister does not understand that, I will explain it to him privately.</P>

      <P>That is not really necessary.  I should like to tell the House and the Deputy that, far from the factories not getting the skim milk, the record to date is that they have taken in more separated milk for processing this year than in the same <Col N="476" /> period last year.  In addition to this, the amount of processed or skim milk sold out of stocks in that same period this year is in fact practically double what the sales were in the same period last year.  So that things are not as black as the Deputy has been led to believe so far as this operation is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the products and processes developed or improved by An Foras, in many cases in conjunction with An Bord Bainne and firms in the dairying industry, are the continuous method of manufacture of salted butter, the production <Col N="477" /> of canned butter, the manufacture of ripened cream butter and the satisfactory production of butter-oil. An Foras also took part in developing manufacturing processes involving manufacturing problems for a number of products.  I understand that An Foras has at present in hands 17 separate research projects in dairying but it would obviously be unwise to give particulars of these publicly.</P>
    <P>Research into dairying problems is also conducted by the teaching staff, currently numbering 36, attached to the Dairy Science Faculty at University College, Cork.  Particulars of the Faculty's research activities are given in the annual reports of my Department.</P>

      <P>So far as my Department is concerned, action has already been taken on such matters as the introduction this year of a comprehensive national breeding scheme with provision for mare nominations at a higher value together with new foaling premiums. Other recommendations on such subjects as the display of Connemara ponies and Irish draught horses at the Horse Show have also been implemented.</P>
      <P>A major recommendation relates to the establishment of a Horse Board, the provision of a National Training Centre and statutory control of riding establishments.  The various organisations concerned with this recommendation have had consultations among themselves and had a further meeting with my Department on 24th May.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The preservation and development of local amenities, including rights of public access, is the responsibility of the local planning authority under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  A planning authority may include as an objective in their development plan under the Act the preservation of any existing public right of way giving access to seashore, mountain, lakeshore, riverbank or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility.  Where this is done the authority must take all steps necessary to secure the objective.</P>
      <P>A planning authority may also enter into an agreement for the creation of a public right of way over land, or may create one by order subject to a right of appeal to the Minister, and payment of compensation where appropriate.  Where a public right of way is created or a provision relating to its preservation is included in a development plan the way must be maintained by the planning authority and penalties are provided on conviction for obstruction.  All planning authorities have been specially exhorted to make use of these wide powers to ensure that local needs and the needs of growing tourism for access to beaches and other places of public resort are fully provided for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no prescribed limits for the matters referred to by the Deputy.  However, planning permission is required for the use as two or more dwellings of any structure previously used as a single dwelling.  In deciding to grant permission, a planning authority must consider the proper planning and development of the area including the preservation and improvement of its amenities.</P>
      <P>Moreover, section 65 of the Housing Act, 1966, empowers a housing authority to serve on the owner of a house a notice specifying the maximum number and categories of persons by whom the house or any room in it may at any time be occupied, without causing overcrowding.  The authority may require the owner to publish the contents of this notice in rent books or in such other manner as they may specify. Penalties, including imprisonment, are provided for contravention of the requirements of an authority.  This power can be used in conjunction with the grant of planning permission for the division of a structure into separate dwellings.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 to 24 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the report in question and, in so far as I can verify from the information in my Department, the Dublin city projects listed represent 1,640,000 square feet, not all of which is for letting and only 225,000 square feet of which has been completed. I am not aware how many of the projects listed have permission from the Corporation but four of them, totalling 471,000 square feet, are before me on appeal.</P>
      <P>Permission was obtained on appeal for development on the sites at Burlington Road, Lansdowne House, Carisbrooke House, Marlboro' House, 9/10 Dawson Street and Adelaide Road.  In all these cases, the Minister imposed conditions reducing or limiting the floor area proposed to be provided. The criteria in relation to which planning appeals are decided are set out in section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>I have no information as to the total number of residents whose dwellings were demolished in these cases.  So far as I am aware existing premises on the sites were not occupied as dwellings when the appeals were made, with the exception of one case where it was the owner-occupier who sought and obtained permission.  The former owners may still have been in residence in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> In regard to the location and total floor area of all projects of property development in Dublin city where permission has been obtained since 1960 following a refusal by the planning authority, it would take an inordinate amount of staff time to go through all the appeals since that date and make the necessary calculations.  In many cases copies of the plans are not now available in my Department and, in any event, projects are frequently altered or revised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which would require commercial property developers to expend a percentage of the cost of such projects on art work and the criteria governing control of development under that Act are not such as would enable permissions to be made subject to any condition in these terms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of providing advance information on the expected future level of building activity, the Central Statistics Office has undertaken, on an experimental basis, the compilation of aggregate monthly data on projects for which full permission or approval has been granted under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. For this purpose planning authorities were requested by me some time ago to send to that Office particulars of each permission and approval, other than outline permission.  It is not yet possible to say exactly what form the statistical results will take but it is hoped that in due course it will be possible to have monthly indications of the extent of the principal types of <Col N="488" /> proposed construction for which planning permission or approval has been given in that month.</P>
      <P>While the limited investigation possible in my Department indicates that the report in question contains some inaccuracies and does not include certain prominent office buildings completed for renting in recent years, I am of opinion that the separate compilation and maintenance of statistics by my Department of such development in Ireland would not be warranted having regard to the arrangements made already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with some further points which Opposition Deputies had suggested I should deal with, although I felt myself I had dealt with some of them adequately already.  I think I should refer to a point raised by Deputy Norton who suggested that in view of the fact I had made it clear that the overall effect of the provisions of this Third Amendment of the Constitution would be to move closer towards having the value of a rural vote the same as an urban vote, it might be better to put a provision into the Constitution to the effect that representation would be based on the electorate rather than as at present on total population on the grounds that this would be a better way and would ensure that votes in every part of the country would be of the same value.</P>
      <P>The figures have disclosed that the present position, which the Opposition are so tenaciously trying to hang on to, ensures that it will take a considerably greater number of voters in rural areas to elect a Deputy than it will in urban areas.  Deputy Norton then suggested it might be a good idea to change the requirement in the Constitution entirely from population to voters.  I would agree that, if this were feasible, it certainly would be more democratic than the present position which the Opposition want to maintain. The present position is not even theoretically democratic as distinct from being practically democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> I made it quite clear from the figures that to do what is required by the present interpretation of the Constitution would result in the infliction of injustice on considerable sections of the community in different parts of the country without conferring any corresponding benefit on those people. There are however a number of reasons why it is more desirable to base revisions of constituencies on census figures rather than on the figures of the electorate which are compiled annually in the compilation of the register in different constituencies.</P>
    <P>The first point is we already have this requirement in respect of population in the Constitution.  It was considered better to amend the Constitution&mdash;to get rid of the constitutional infirmity to which Deputy J.A. Costello referred the last day&mdash;rather than introduce completely new requirements with regard to voters.  Particularly in view of the manner in which the Opposition Parties oppose everything on the basis merely that it has been proposed by the Government, to make a fundamental change like this would be likely to lead to even more vehement opposition than usual.</P>
    <P>As I said, the same result is achieved by this provision allowing some slight scope in the revision of constituencies in order to do justice to the people involved in such a revision.  What I have pointed out during the debate on this Bill is that what we are proposing will result in rural votes in general being of the same value as urban votes, but at the same time the effort to avoid the injustice and anomaly of breaching county boundaries in certain cases will produce local divergencies in particular areas.</P>
    <P>For example, I stated that if you take the area of Kerry-Limerick as a whole, the population in that area would make it justifiable to maintain the same total representation there but that the present constitutional requirement necessitates, in order to do that, the transfer of some of the population of Limerick to Kerry.  What I pointed out was that there was no net gain to the people of the area as a whole <Col N="497" /> and that I was quite sure the people in Limerick whom the Opposition want to transfer to Kerry would be just as pleased to remain and vote in their own county, even though it might take marginally a greater number of votes to elect a Deputy there than it would in the neighbouring county of Kerry and that it was not required by any democratic principle that these people should be uprooted and required to vote in County Kerry rather than in Limerick.  I did not believe they would look on this as any vindication of their democratic rights.</P>
    <P>While you would have these local differences, at the same time the effect of what is proposed will be to redress the differential of voting power that otherwise the present constitutional requirement confers on people in built-up areas generally.  To change to having a rigid requirement, to basing the representation on voters rather than population, would have the same overall effect but at the same time it would not avoid local injustices such as those to which I have referred.  In addition to that there is the fact that populations are compiled by means of the census every five years.  They are ascertained on a national basis by a nationally mounted, complicated and costly process.  Census figures generally are accepted as being authoritative.  They are carried out under the control of the Central Statistics Office, whereas with regard to registers of electors, although they are compiled as carefully as possible, still, anyone concerned with elections realises that they are not always, at any rate, 100 per cent accurate.  The compilation of registers of electors must be an annual operation and the same elaborate organisation and expense as for the compilation of the census would not be justified.  Censuses, in fact, have before now disclosed that other statistics have not been accurate.</P>
    <P>I think it is undesirable that constituencies should be based on figures whose accuracy is not absolutely unimpeachable. As we know, the standard of accuracy in the compilation of registers often varies from county to county, or from constituency to constituency, whereas the census is compiled <Col N="498" /> on a national basis under the direction of the Central Statistics Office.  So, in a number of ways, the census figures are more reliable.  It is this rigid requirement in the Constitution that necessitates this injustice being done to certain sections of the community because of the fact that no consideration can be given to the percentage of voters in the total population in the different areas of the country.</P>
    <P>In addition the census must be compiled at five-yearly intervals.  For this reason it has an element of stability which is not possessed by the registers which are almost continuously undergoing a process of revision.  They have to be revised every year almost.  If this requirement were to be inserted in the Constitution, that is, if the constituencies were to be based on the number on the registers rather than the population as ascertained at the previous census, there could be practically continuous pressure for a new revision of the constituencies.</P>
    <P>Basically I would agree with Deputy Norton that the number of voters per Deputy is a more relevant factor to take into consideration, but it is clear from the figures I have given that the overall effect of operating some scope such as we are proposing in this Bill over the country as a whole for the purpose laid down in the Bill&mdash;to avoid breaching the county boundaries &mdash;will be to even out representation over the country.</P>
    <P>On the whole I think the present proposal, if carried, is reasonably satisfactory. I believe that even if we were to amend the Constitution so as to base representation on voters rather than on population it would still be desirable to have some such scope in regard to the numbers per Deputy in individual constituencies as has been proposed here; so we would be making two changes instead of one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne raised a number of points.  I do not know whether I should reply to them.  His whole contribution showed the capacity of the Opposition to ignore the facts.  Deputy Dunne maintained that the effect of this will be to give greater representation to <Col N="499" /> some sections of the community whereas, in fact, the figures disclose the exact opposite.  The present position does exactly what Deputy Dunne and other Deputies pretend they want to avoid.  It gives greater representation to some sections than to others. For instance, I showed on the figures of the last census and the last available registers that, if the revision of the constituencies which is now required is carried out on the basis of the present constitutional position, it will take only 10,206 voters to elect a Deputy in certain parts of Dublin city, whereas it will take over 13,500 voters to elect a Deputy in parts of rural Ireland. That is the position which Deputies apparently want to retain.</P>
    <P>Mainly I have been answering queries and arguments put forward by the Opposition and I have been accused of filibustering and delaying the passage of the Bill through the House.  Of all the allegations that Deputies have been making that is the most amazing of the lot, when we consider that on Second Reading which opened on 28th February, 1968, and ended on 3rd April, 1968, 21 Members of the Fine Gael Party spoke. As we all know, there was a majority of only one in favour of the position now being taken by Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a majority of only one this seems to be an indication that the 21 Deputies who spoke were nearly the maximum of the number of Fine Gael Deputies in favour of the position they are now taking up. The peculiar thing is that they all made practically the same speech.  Some of them used the same words.</P>

      <P>He made a slightly different speech.  It is clear that all the speeches were leading up to Deputy Hogan's speech and to the recent speech by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins <Col N="500" /> which consisted of an abject appeal to another Party to put them into Government and an admission that there was no prospect whatever of their ever doing it under their own steam.  Those speeches were all leading up to the &ldquo;will-you-walk-into-my-parlour&rdquo; speech by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that Fine Gael had practically a full muster of the members of the Party who are in agreement with the attitude they are taking.  On Second Stage no fewer than 15 Members of the Labour Party also spoke.  Yet, when I come along to repair their omissions, and to put them in possession of some of the facts, and let them know exactly what they are doing in opposing this Bill, they accuse me of delaying the passage of the Bill through the House.  Also when I respond to their demands to deal with specific points they make the same allegation. I believe I have done a very valuable service for the Opposition Parties in putting these facts on the records of the House.  I have taken cognisance of the Fine Gael complaint about their lack of research facilities which was quite obvious from their ignorance about what they themselves are doing in opposing this Bill.  Figures with regard to the different constituencies which, if they were studied, would give the Opposition the picture of what the consequences will be if their opposition is successful, were made available to them.  These were put on the records of the House and it was obvious that they have not been studied.  I have now given them an indication of what will happen if their opposition is successful and they cannot plead ignorance of what they are actually doing.  These facts will be made known to their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Fine Gael attitude to this proposal is typical of the inability of the Party to make positive decisions. Deputy J.A. Costello at least apparently cannot bring himself completely to renege the stand taken by the Party <Col N="501" /> in 1961 after the present scheme of constituencies was drawn up as a result of a decision of the High Court.  He admits there is a &ldquo;constitutional infirmity&rdquo; but he will not admit this is the way to remedy it.  At the same time, he is unable to suggest any other way in which this constitutional infirmity could be remedied&mdash;because, of course, Fine Gael cannot make up its mind on any positive decision and, in fact, there is not any way in which this can be remedied except by giving some scope for the avoidance of the type of injustice to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The only decision apparently that the Fine Gael Party was able to come to was to defend the existing position to the last, irrespective of their wholehearted denunciation of the inevitable injustices which were involved in 1961 and which must now be repeated on a much wider scale if they are successful in their present opposition.  At the same time, they are particularly touchy about any reference to the fact that this position was established as a result of a Fine Gael manoeuvre in the courts. Any Fine Gael complicity in riveting this interpretation of the Constitution on the country is hotly denied in face of the fact that the action was brought by a Fine Gael Senator, Dr. O'Donovan; that his solicitor was a Fine Gael Deputy, Deputy Ryan; that his senior counsel was a Fine Gael Deputy, Deputy P. McGilligan and that his junior counsel was a Fine Gael Senator, Senator O'Quigley.  It is just too naive to expect anyone to accept that this action, which secured this interpretation of the Constitution, was not a deliberate Fine Gael Party action.  Of course it was a Party operation, just as surely as if the action had been taken in the name of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that this proposal is to facilitate gerrymandering. Here, again, we have another clear indication of the confused state of the minds of the Opposition Parties.  Quite clearly, this is a provision to reduce the breaching of county boundaries, to reduce the adding of parts of one county to another county, and so on. <Col N="502" /> When, as a result of the High Court's decision, this had to be done on a comparatively limited scale in 1961, the claim was made by the Opposition that the portions taken out of one county and added to another county were selected on the basis of deliberate gerrymandering.  Now, the claim is that adherence to county boundaries is gerrymandering also.  The Opposition have voted against the preservation of county boundaries.  They therefore voted, in effect, for a considerably greater application of what happened in 1961.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to gerrymander in this country&mdash;and this is doubtful&mdash; obviously the most favourable circumstances for doing it is a position which requires the wholesale taking of parts of one county and adding them to adjoining counties.  Here, again, the Opposition obviously do not know what they want.  All they know in regard to this matter is the same as with every other matter that comes up in this House: if it is proposed by Fianna Fáil, they, as the Opposition, feel bound in duty to oppose it.</P>
    <P>I think it is obvious that too much rigidity in this matter is unwise and is bound to give rise to anomalies and injustices.  This proposal gives only a very small amount of scope to avoid doing this, small compared with other countries, and I do not claim it goes far enough to avoid injustices completely. It is obvious that the only way to overcome the constitutional in-firmity&mdash;which has been admitted by Deputy J.A. Costello, to the consternation of his colleagues on the Fine Gael Benches&mdash;is to allow some slight scope such as this for the exercise of commonsense, for taking into account the natural wishes of the electorate and the problems of their adequate representation.  This is what is being proposed here.  It is clearly in response to the unanimous opinion of the Dáil in 1961.  The amount of scope requested is very small indeed compared to what is allowed in every other known democracy.</P>
    <P>The position the Opposition are so desperately trying to maintain does not exist anywhere else in the world. <Col N="503" /> There can be only two reasons for their attitude&mdash;apart from their normal attitude of opposing anything proposed by Fianna Fáil.  The only other two reasons I can see are that the Opposition know that what must happen, if they are successful, will give rise to frustration and discontent on the part of large numbers of the people&mdash;and they thrive on frustration and discontent.  The second of the two reasons I can see is that both of the Opposition Parties have made a deliberate decision to abandon rural Ireland and, for this reason. have decided to try to retain a position which down-grades the value of each rural vote by amounts up to 33 per cent of the value of an urban vote.</P>
    <P>Deputies of the Fine Gael Party and of the Labour Party have deliberately and cold-bloodedly decided to try to rivet that requirement of the Constitution on this country for all time to ensure, as I have pointed out, for instance, that it would take only 10,200 odd votes to elect a Deputy in Dublin North-West whereas it would take over 13,500 votes to elect a Deputy in Donegal South-West.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in so far as he is faced with the difficult task of trying to fit a number of seats into different areas, at the same time trying to preserve traditional county boundaries.  In my particular constituency, my opposite number in this House&mdash;Deputy Fahey&mdash;pointed out the other day that South Tipperary had 11,000 people voting from West Waterford.  He said he found it difficult in so far as he was a Deputy for South Tipperary-West Waterford but was not a local representative for the major part of his constituency, namely, the South Riding proper.  I am in an analogous position &mdash;possibly not as bad as he is.  I am not a local representative for the West Waterford area.  Consequently, I find myself in the same position when I go into West Waterford as Deputy Fahey finds himself in when he goes into South Tipperary.  Half the problems he has to deal with are local and he is unable to <Col N="504" /> deal with them except indirectly by writing to the Manager of the county council, and so on.  In my case the problem in West Waterford has to be handled similarly by me as I am not a member of Waterford County Council and do not attend county council meetings.</P>
      <P>It is stated that these proposals arose from the High Court action.  I suppose they did but in South Tipperary it is quite clear that the bringing in of West Waterford was a political manoeuvre. At that time we had in South Tipperary one Fine Gael and three Fianna Fáil Deputies.  The third Fianna Fáil Deputy was standing in a very weak position and it seemed as if he might go out.  To make the situation safe for him West Waterford, which we know to be predominantly Fianna Fáil and with which the particular person concerned had family associations, was brought in with 11,000 people.  In the event the manoeuvre did not come off and a Labour Member got the seat. The position has remained with 11,000 West Waterford people in the South Tipperary constituency.</P>
      <P>At one time North and South Tipperary formed one constituency with, I think, seven members for the county.  They always had North and South Ridings and I think, with the exception of Yorkshire, it was the only county in these islands which had that arrangement; we had formerly one constituency and two county councils. Then we had the two constituencies of North and South Tipperary.  We could still keep within the county boundary using the figures and adapting them as the Minister has done.  In order to conform to the 1961 requirements, in addition to the 11,000 people brought in from West Waterford I think 2,901 were transferred from South to North Tipperary.  Taking Tipperary County as a whole and taking the figures I have here from the last census for North and South Tipperary we find 53,832 in North Tipperary and 68,946 in South Tipperary.  That makes a total population of 122,778.  If we take the Minister's maximum and minimum figures and the 5 per cent tolerance which he says is allowable at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am explaining to the Minister how Tipperary itself could be accommodated. It would mean that you could have a six-seat constituency for Tipperary as a whole.  Alternatively, by moving some more from South Tipperary into North Tipperary you could have two three-seat constituencies which, from the point of view of general workability, might be a better arrangement.  That would, of course, cause a certain breach of frontiers.  It would mean that an increasing amount of the South Riding would be put into and joined up with the North Riding to form a new constituency, some figure greater than the 2,900 people already gone in.  I worked out the figure and may be able to find it in a moment.  If we say that in North Tipperary there are roughly 54,000 people and in the South Riding there are 69,000, that gives us something over 120,000 which would give <Col N="506" /> us six seats.  If the North Tipperary population was raised to 56.44 and the South to 66.33, an adjustment of possibly 2,000 or 3,000 more would give you two three-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>There is one observation I want to make from the practical point of view. If an area has to be brought into a constituency from outside it, it is far better if you can so arrange it, to bring in a centre of population such as a large town.  Take, for example, Ballaghaderreen.  Whether that goes into Roscommon or into Mayo does not make much difference; it will not suffer as regards representation. Similarly, the bigger the centre is the less it will suffer if it is taken from its parent local authority and put for Dáil purposes into another constituency because the Deputies will go into the big centre, but if you bring in a whole countryside that is sparsely populated, such as in the case of Waterford which is thinly populated, you will have an area which will simply make the situation worse.  If it is necessary to transfer you should take a more concentrated population.</P>
      <P>The Minister wanted to know what we could do with Waterford which is at present a three-seat constituency.  If you give back the 11,000 people you will have, I suppose, a 3½ seat constituency which creates an awkward position.  The Minister also asked what he can do with West Cork, North Kerry and South Kerry.  When you come to examine the Cork constituencies you have three, West Cork, Mid-Cork, North Cork, all under one local authority.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is easy to fix North and South Kerry. They do not need very much.  North Kerry needs little more than 1,000, and South Kerry, 500.  Limerick West is a difficult problem; it needs 2,700, and South West Cork 3,700.  However considering that all these areas are contiguous and the three centre ones are under one local authority, by adjustment from the Waterford side, we would have 11,000 to play with, and with what has been taken from South Tipperary, you have 11,000 to match up the 8,000 needed for this adjustment.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> By that adjustment there would not be much infringement of county boundaries and I believe that, if the Minister studies all the figures for the rest of the country, it should be possible to arrive at a similar adjustment. I have just considered the ones in Munster, the most interesting to myself.  Having dealt with Tipperary. I had to consider what the Minister would have to do with the 11,000 people of Waterford he took back from South Tipperary and that was the only solution I could come up with offhand.  There are probably many others, but I suggest that one to him as a possibility.  It is for Deputies from other areas to make suggestions for their own areas, if they so wish, and if they are interested in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked why voters are used instead of population.  He has made the point that the under-representation of the eastern part of the country is possibly exaggerated by the figures.  I think he is right in that.  You have a bigger population in the eastern <Col N="508" /> part of the country, but you have not the same percentage of voters as you have on the western seaboard, largely due to the fact that you have an older population, the younger people, because of the poor administration of Fianna Fáil, having fled the countryside. The position the Minister is crying about is largely due to Government maladministration.  He mentioned, for example, that Clare had insufficient population to merit four seats but it had sufficient voters; similarly, Donegal constituency had not sufficient population and had sufficient voters to justify its present number of seats, a clear indication of a fleeing from these two areas and of the Government's failure to keep the population in the West and in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I cannot say which is the more important, the contention that the eastern part and the Dublin area is under-represented population-wise or the under-representation on the western seaboard voter-wise.  It would be a matter for a mathematician to work out.  On balance, I think the eastern part of the country would possibly have the stronger claim, but one weighs against the other, and I do not think there is an awful lot in it.  However, I have made the suggestions I wanted to make to the Minister and I am sure he has heard hundreds of others which he can also think over for the next few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the last change we had in Limerick, a portion of the East Limerick constituency was brought into the West Limerick constituency.  Having actively participated in that campaign, I was quite satisfied that the people who were brought from East Limerick into West Limerick would have preferred, for many reasons, to be left as they were in the East constituency.  First, they knew the candidates they voted for, whether they were Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  When they were brought into the new constituency, they had to start at the beginning once again and try to get to know all the Party candidates.  They felt confused and mixed up.  They found it hard to understand why they could not vote <Col N="509" /> for their neighbour who might be standing for East Limerick and who might live near them, five, ten or 15 miles away, and instead had to vote for candidates who lived in Abbey-feale, Newcastle West or Askeaton. This is a very hard thing to explain to people and they felt very annoyed about it.</P>
      <P>Unless the proposed change goes through, worse can happen and, indeed, worse probably will happen, because we will have a portion of Limerick going into Kerry.  Bad and all as it was having parts of East Limerick going into West Limerick, certainly the people of County Limerick would feel very much annoyed at being taken from their own county and put into Kerry.  The Fine Gael Deputies for County Limerick, Deputy Jones and Deputy T. O'Donnell, who are conspiring to bring this about, seem to think that this will weaken Fianna Fáil, but it certainly will not.  The people Fine Gael want to put into Kerry will resent the change and will, I am sure, vote in the referendum and show their dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>I personally do not think it matters all that much whether or not it takes 20 or 30 more votes to elect a Deputy in Limerick than in Kerry.  Certainly as far as I am concerned, the people of Limerick will be made aware of what the Opposition Deputies want to do with it and, when this is considered in conjunction with the Fine Gael policy to exterminate the family farm, the people will see that their interests lie with Fianna Fáil and with the proposed amendment of the Constitution which is necessary to preserve their rights and their representation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The case made by the Minister for this Third Amendment is based on the necessity for arranging the constituencies in such a way that county boundaries will not be unduly interfered with, and that natural divisions in the county such as mountains and rivers will be taken into account.  That is the case he is making and for the purposes of what I am going to say it does not matter whether there is merit in that <Col N="510" /> case or whether there is not.  As I said before, I do not think there is anything sacred about county boundaries.  In the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Minister seems to recognise that, because if it goes through and he has his way, then in no instance will the county boundary coincide with the constituencies.  Even if the Minister's case is well founded, I say that the law as it stands enables the Oireachtas to have regard to the county boundaries in arranging constituencies where that is necessary and to have regard to natural divisions such as lakes, mountains and rivers and that where it is necessary&mdash;does the Minister not agree with that?</P>

I propose to show what the law is.  The Article of the Constitution which we are now amending is Article 16, section 2, subsection (3) which says that:</P>
      <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
      <P>That is the Constitution as it stands. The Fianna Fáil Government revised the constituencies in 1959 and their Bill was challenged in the High Court by Senator O'Donovan in his personal capacity.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Again for the purposes of this argument, it does not matter whether it was in his personal capacity or in a political capacity but, in the interests of truth and accuracy, it was in his personal capacity.  In the High Court, Mr. Justice Budd heard the case on 13th, 14th, 15th, 20th and 21st December, 1960, and again on 23rd, 24th and 25th of January, 1961, and apparently delivered judgment on 20th February, 1961.  This is what Mr. Justice Budd held:</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959, s. 3, sub-s. 1 and s. 4 are repugnant to the provisions of Article 16, 2, 3º and 4º, of the Constitution because the form of Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959 is such as to produce substantial departures from the ratio of members of Dáil Éireann to the population of the Republic prescribed by the Constitution, causing grave inequalities of representation for which no justification or genuine administrative difficulty exists.</P>
      <P>So held Mr. Justice Budd.  He held further:</P>
      <P>that in enacting the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959 the Legislature, when revising the constituencies, did not have &ldquo;due&rdquo; regard to the changes in the distribution of the population as prescribed by Article 16, 2, 4º, of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I have been quoting from the case of John O'Donovan <i>versus</i> the Attorney General as reported in Irish Reports 1961 at page 114.  The operative and the most important words there are &ldquo;grave inequalities of representation for which no justification or genuine administrative difficulty exists.&rdquo;  The Government of the day created these inequalities without justification and for the purpose of political manoeuvring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was so held by the High Court and despite the fact that, during the hearing of that case, the judge was told by both sides that the loser would appeal to the Supreme Court, no appeal was ever brought.  The Minister since this debate began has quoted <Col N="512" /> time and again the case of O'Donovan <i>versus</i> the Attorney General as being the law governing electoral revision at the moment, although the Minister knows perfectly well that it is not the law governing it and he must have been so advised.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It decided no such thing.  I will deal with that later and put it down the Minister's throat.  It decided that the one-sixth tolerance approximately, for which no justification or genuine administrative difficulty existed, was unconstitutional and, with the greatest respect to the High Court, it was perfectly right so to decide.  As I say, the Minister knows perfectly well that that is not the law because immediately the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959, was held to be repugnant to the Constitution, the Minister's predecessor and his Government introduced another Bill to revise the constituencies and that was referred to the Supreme Court by the President.  The report of that case may be found in Irish Reports at page 169 under the title &ldquo;In the Matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and in the Matter of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961 (1).&rdquo;  The decision of the Supreme Court, in my respectful opinion, supersedes the decision of Mr. Justice Budd in the High Court and is now the law governing this.</P>
      <P>This is what the Chief Justice, Mr. Conor Maguire, had to say when dealing with this very section with which we are dealing now:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between <Col N="513" /> members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions. The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.</P>

Its decisions should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is manifest infringement of the Article.  This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted. This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In one rural constituency, 23,333 people may be entitled to a TD, whereas in another as few as 16,667 may be entitled to a TD, and that without regard to county boundaries, or electoral divisions, or townland divisions, or lakes, or mountains, or rivers or, for all we know, without regard to any other consideration other than the welfare of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is why I am opposing this Bill and why I intend to go on opposing it.  I want the Minister to deny that the law is not as set out in the Supreme Court judgment of 1961&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also advanced the argument in favour of this amendment that people in rural Ireland have difficulty <Col N="516" /> in making contact with their TDs.  Are we moving backwards or forwards?  Are our communications improving or getting worse?  Thirty and 40 years ago, when means of transport from one part of the country to another were not nearly as good as they are now, when roads were not as good and when we had practically no rural telephones, the people could contact their TDs and surely if they could contact their TDs then, surely the position has improved and this is not a valid argument in 1968 for seeking this extraordinary power to juggle around with the constituencies and constituency boundaries.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sure Deputy Booth is very well up in the highways and byways of rural Ireland and every constituency in it and, if he wants to tell us about it, he is quite welcome to do so when I have finished.  When the Minister tried to deal with the point raised by Deputy Norton, I thought he did not sound convincing.  He was asked why he could not amend the constituencies by having regard to electors rather than to population.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can only say that, when the Minister made his case against that, he sounded anything but convincing.  He seemed to suggest that the electoral list was in some way or other less accurate than the census.  I wonder is that so.  A great many more people take an interest in compiling the electors' list than in the census.  The census form is thrown into a house, filled up and taken away and is usually accepted whereas the electors' list is checked and rechecked and there are claims, objections and counter objections.  The electors' list is likely to be more accurate than the census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made the argument in dealing with Deputy Norton's point that the electors' list had to be <Col N="517" /> compiled each year.  That is something to recommend it because the Minister will remember that when we were dealing with an earlier part of the Schedule dealing with the 12-yearly revision of the constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I find it very difficult to believe that people have all that dislike to moving <Col N="518" /> from one county to another.  Really, the arguments that the Fianna Fáil Party in this House are prepared to adduce to justify these measures are amazing.  Deputy Collins, the last speaker on behalf of the Government, seems to think that there is some terrible objection on the part of the people of East Limerick to going into West Limerick, and <i>vice-versa.</i>  He made that argument before he sat down.  I think it shows the weakness of the Government case especially when one takes into account that in the Fourth Amendment, if the Government get their way, in any of the Twenty-Six Counties we will never have a county and a constituency synchronising or corresponding because every county will be cut up into a number of constituencies.</P>
      <P>I rose principally at this stage to put on record, once and for all, as far as I am concerned, the law relating to electoral revision as it really is and to assert that, for the proper motives, the Minister can do all the things that he says he wants to do, that the law as it stands allows him to have regard to county boundaries, to lakes, rivers and mountains, in arranging the constituencies, and that the Supreme Court is on record as saying that if he revises the constituencies on those considerations his Bill will not be held to be repugnant to the Constitution but, if the Minister gets his way, he will be able to create this huge tolerance or divergence, for no higher motive than political racketeering, gerrymandering and the rigging of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I find I have to deal with some of the statements made by Deputy Fitzpatrick yet again.  First of all, I should like to say with regard to Deputy Dr. Hogan that there are, of course, innumerable different possible solutions to the problem with which we are presented in trying to revise constituencies in accordance with the present requirements.  It all depends from where you start and I suppose it is only natural that Deputies should be inclined to start from their own constituencies rather than from others. It may very well happen that if you start from your own constituency you <Col N="519" /> may wind up with an insoluble problem in some other constituency to which there is no adjoining constituency available to solve the residual problem.  For instance, by starting in Tipperary you might wind up with an insoluble problem either in Kerry or Wexford and, as Deputy Dr. Hogan admitted, a solution of the Tipperary problem within the boundaries of the county leaves a residual problem in Waterford which he suggested would best be dealt with by adjustment with County Cork, particularly in view of the fact that County Cork would already be interfered with by an attempt to solve the problem in Kerry.  However, I agree that there is the possibility of dealing with the Tipperary situation in the manner in which Deputy Hogan suggested but not without effects outside the county, but it is quite possible that that might work out as the best solution in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, after all his arguing against what is proposed here, both by himself and his colleagues, on the grounds of principle, now maintains that the law enables us to do exactly what we are asking should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The motives are clearly set down, for the first time, in this proposed amendment of the Constitution. They are not set down in the present Constitution.  We are proposing to indicate quite clearly in the Constitution that this is permissible and that it is permissible in the circumstances which are mentioned in the Bill, that is, to avoid the breaching of county boundaries and to take cognisance of the existence of physical features and the extent and accessibility of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, having argued against the principle of doing that, Deputy Fitzpatrick tries to do a complete somersault and says it is not necessary, that you have unlimited scope to do this and that, in fact, the only difference is that we are imposing this limit of one-sixth <Col N="520" /> whereas there is not any limit imposed by the present Constitution, and he tries to maintain that it has been established by law that the Oireachtas is the authority to decide this when it is quite clear that that is not the position, that the 1959 revision of constituencies, in connection with which there was no suggestion of gerrymandering here, a revision of constituencies that was accepted unanimously by this House, was declared to be unconstitutional by the competent authority, the High Court, as the result of action taken by the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>The case was taken by a Fine Gael Senator.  His solicitor was a Fine Gael Deputy.  His senior counsel was a Fine Gael Deputy and his junior counsel a Fine Gael Senator.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks it is possible to get anybody to believe that this was not a Fine Gael action, that is his business. The judge indicated clearly that the phrase &ldquo;as far as it is practicable&rdquo; meant only so far as the census figures were available in sufficient detail to arrive at this mathematical accuracy of population per Deputy.  He stated:</P>
      <P>... there is no indication to be found in the Constitution that it was intended that any of the difficulties as to the working of the parliamentary system should be taken into consideration on the question of practicability.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>is about the only limiting factor.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Oireachtas would have to proceed on the basis of having regard to the areas for which census figures are available, but that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Now Deputy Fitzpatrick tries to maintain that it is permissible to take these things into account.  All the Supreme Court decided on was that the revision of constituencies made in 1961 based on this definition of the law by Justice Budd was within the terms of the Constitution.</P>

This really means that the Oireachtas have not got the authority to decide and that the courts have the authority to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I quoted it. I repeated what Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  Deputy Fitzpatrick wants the Government to revise the constituencies on the basis of taking account of these things.  He maintains that this is possible but he knows that an action could again be taken in the High Court.  What he wants after each revision of constituencies is an action in the High Court and a further action in the Supreme Court, very likely discovering after that that a new revision has to be made and that it also has to be referred to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If what Deputy Fitzpatrick says is true, why does he object to its being made clear to the people?  Why does he want the situation to be that each revision of constituencies must be decided <Col N="522" /> in the High Court and the Supreme Court rather than that there should be definite guidelines laid down, as we are proposing in the Bill, to make it clear exactly what can be taken into account and exactly what divergence from the overall national average can be permitted.  All we know from the Supreme Court judgment is that the five per cent divergence from the national average which was indicated by Mr. Justice Budd as being acceptable, was also acceptable to the Supreme Court and within that divergence the Supreme Court agreed that these practical things could be taken into consideration. That is all that is known.  It must be assumed that it is only when there is that maximum divergence from the national average that is allowed that constituency revisions would be held to be constitutional.  On that basis the injustices I have described would take place all over the country and we would have the position of 10,000 odd voters electing a Deputy in Dublin city and up to 13,500 in rural Ireland. That is the position that Deputy Fitzpatrick and his colleagues are so desperately trying to defend.</P>
    <P>There is no way of knowing what the Supreme Court would regard as a serious divergence from the national average, although by implication at least it accepted the general approach of Mr. Justice Budd.  There is no way of knowing what is permissible at present except what Mr. Justice Budd has said&mdash;that is the only thing we can take as being permissible at present&mdash;and there is an obvious need to write a definite provision into the Constitution so as to make it clear to the Oireachtas exactly what they are entitled to do and exactly what they are not entitled to do.</P>

It is clear Mr. Justice Budd held what the Government then proposed&mdash;the tolerance or divergence of 17 per cent &ldquo;for which no justification or genuine administrative difficulty exists&rdquo;&mdash;could not be tolerated and would not be tolerated and that the Chief Justice in <i>re</i> Article 26 of the Constitution and Electoral (Amendment) <Col N="523" /> Bill, 1961, made it quite clear that within reasonable limitation the Oireachtas was the deciding tribunal in revising the constituencies and in deciding upon a tolerance one side or the other of the national average, and decided that in doing that the Oireachtas could have regard to county boundaries, electoral areas, townland divisions, mountains, lakes and rivers. When the Minister quoted from the judgment of Mr. Justice Budd a few moments ago, he deliberately read portion of it and left out portion of it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I read out the last page.  The Minister commenced in the middle of a paragraph. What the courts will not tolerate and what they are determined not to tolerate, unless the Minister compels them to do it, is to allow a tolerance of one-sixth one side or the other of the national average for political advancement and political benefit.  I leave the judgment of Mr. Justice Budd in the case of O'Donovan <i>v.</i> the Attorney General and in the case of <i>in re</i> Article 26 of the Constitution and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961 to be read by anybody who is interested in them in <i>Irish Law Reports</i> of 1961.

      <P>It finishes up by saying:</P>
      <P>In the opinion of the Court the divergencies shown in the Bill are within reasonable limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was merely no more than an endorsement of the decision of Mr. Justice Budd because the divergencies there were the divergencies he indicated as being acceptable.  All the <Col N="524" /> Supreme Court did was to accept the divergencies regarded by  Mr. Justice Budd as acceptable, as applying in the 1961 revision of the constituencies.  The present legal position is that the only practical thing to be taken into consideration in revising the constituencies is the detail in which the population is available in the census report and such things as administrative boundaries or facility of representation are irrelevant. The judge made it quite clear that they were irrelevant and could not be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to make another speech.  I merely propose to read the paragraph of the judgment of the Chief Justice <i>in re</i> Article 26 of the Constitution and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961, which commences on page 183 of the <i>Irish Law Reports</i>, 1961, and leave the House to make up its own mind.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability, so far as possible, to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions. The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.  The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have.  Its decision should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article.  This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted. This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity <Col N="525" /> as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To justify the Court in holding that the sub-section has been infringed it must, however, be shown that the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the sub-clause.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Court the divergencies shown in the Bill are within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Court is of opinion that this ground of objection has not been established.</P>
    <P>For these reasons this Court decides that the Bill is in no respect repugnant to the Constitution and will advise the President accordingly.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make any comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from what Deputy Fitzpatrick has read that the position is not as he says.  I have legal advice to that effect.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has quoted the sentence: &ldquo;The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas...&rdquo;, and the concluding sentence of that paragraph: &ldquo;This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.&rdquo; This clearly upholds what happened in the High Court and makes it clear that the authority is not, in fact, the authority of the Oireachtas but that the Court may pronounce on the decision made by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there is no way of knowing what divergence may be allowed except what has been laid down by Mr. Justice Budd, a ruling which was not contradicted by the Supreme Court. That indicates a maximum divergence of approximately five per cent above or below, and that was not sufficient to avoid the anomalies and injustices that were created in 1961 and will <Col N="526" /> not be sufficient to avoid the much more extensive anomalies and injustices that are required at present and demanded by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Here let me observe straight away that although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties.  The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries.  Even if it did, the Oireachtas or the appropriate Minister could alter county boundaries.  No doubt it is convenient in many ways to use the existing administrative machinery; and there is nothing objectionable in a certain degree of adherence to the county basis of division provided that the dictates of the Constitution are observed.  But it should be understood that it is quite open to the legislature to disregard county boundaries altogether and to formulate a scheme of constituencies on an entirely different basis if that be necessary to achieve the required ratio.  No doubt the Oireachtas would have to proceed on the basis of having regard to the areas for which census figures are available, but that is about the only limiting factor.</P>
      <P>That is the law as it stands at present. It is a matter for the courts to decide, not the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The position so far as this proposed referendum is concerned requires very careful examination and attention.  Last week listening to the Minister going through the individual constituencies one by one caused me to have a good hard look at what the position would be in Sligo-Leitrim. Frankly, the position would be somewhat appalling.  Sligo-Leitrim has a long history of being associated and separated and chopped up and divided. If this proposal which will be put to the people later in the year should not succeed, I shudder to think whom we will represent, or otherwise.  Certainly if we look at the neighbouring county of Donegal and take the population at the 1966 census, we find that after we accommodate five Deputies in that county, they end up with a surplus of 8,500 votes.  Where will they go?  How will they be dealt with?  It is only too obvious to me.  This means that part of Sligo or Leitrim will have to be added to Donegal or the other way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the population of Sligo and Leitrim, and Roscommon and Leitrim, we find that these units, which were put together only a few years ago, will have to be torn apart and the whole thing looked at again.  I do not know what the electorate in that area can expect from their representatives, or how the representatives can hope to serve them well, knowing as the Deputy will know that at the next general election he may not be representing them, should he win or lose. He may be in a totally different area altogether.  I do not know how my Opposition colleagues view this matter but I should think that they, too, view it with concern.  I certainly am concerned about the loss of representation <Col N="528" /> in the whole of the west of Ireland. There is need for a sound representation of our rural areas.  Anybody looking at the percentage of the electorate in relation to the total population can easily see that one man one vote cannot, of itself, ensure equality of value in votes.</P>
    <P>The constituency which I represent with my three colleagues stretches from Charlestown to Bundoran, something quite close to 70 miles, and from Enniscrone across to Ballinamore, something about the same distance&mdash; roughly 4,000 square miles, with intervening lakes and mountain ranges. This will be extended further or possibly re-arranged.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves looking as far north as Ballyshannon, or even beyond it.  Will Donegal get a slice of Sligo-Leitrim and will a new constituency be carved out there?  A Deputy in that area would now find himself having to interpret the wishes of a Leitrimman, a Sligoman and a Donegalman&mdash;and, believe me, all three are as different as chalk is from cheese.  They all want to preserve and to stay within their own administrative boundaries.  This is the way they think and that is the way they want to be treated.  We know the present strictly legal interpretation of the Constitution does not permit that 1,500 people in Donegal be without some representation but there is not anything that can be done.  They must be added to some other area to make up a constituency.</P>
    <P>According to the 1966 census, the population of the Sligo-Leitrim constituency is 68,000 approximately. Taking a population of 20,000 for a public representative, that leaves us with 60,000 and so we are 12,000 short of a fourth Deputy in Sligo, according to the 20,000 level.  In Roscommon-Leitrim we find we are in an exactly similar position&mdash;12,000 short.  So, here we have a surplus of 8,500 in Donegal, a shortage of four Deputies by 8,000 in Roscommon-Leitrim and a shortage by 8,000 in Sligo-Leitrim. How can anybody deal with that area and that problem?  What will happen to Leitrim when these new boundaries <Col N="529" /> are reconstructed and shaped out as to three, four or five seats?  What about the cause and effect?  Will a Deputy today, even in Donegal, seeing the present position, have much interest in South Donegal?</P>
    <P>Again take East Sligo, South Sligo or parts of West Sligo.  Is it not a fact that probably some sections of those will find themselves in adjoining constituencies? What will happen with Leitrim?  Are those areas of Leitrim, now placed with Sligo and Roscommon, to be brought back and added to Donegal to create a constituency out of that re-arrangement or will they go across to Sliabh an Iarainn in Cavan to bring up the number?  What precisely will happen?</P>
    <P>What Deputy can be absolutely sure, from one election to another, that at each election, he is not representing possibly a new section and losing an older section?  I think that any opposition to this sensible measure of single-seat constituencies is blind.  If the Opposition are sincere in their love of their country, in their desire to do their best for their country, they will want to ensure that we shall have (1) some kind of reasonable years of representation of a group of people and (2) a reasonable assurance that Governments here in the future will be Party Governments rather than possibilities that one is even too frightened to mention.</P>
    <P>We see the cause and effect in other nations.  Even at this moment, we see the position that is developing in Italy.  There are something like 72 Parties there.  It may be the view of some that it does not realy matter; let us have all types and classes of opinion, let us have all these little views expressed here in the House, let us form it into one grand, happy little club.  No one can blame the other.  The people end up frustrated, disappointed and without hope or, indeed, with nobody to blame but these disinterested groups who have an opinion but, frankly, very little interest in the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>An examination makes the position very clear.  If these measures are not <Col N="530" /> accepted by the people, it means that, here in Dublin, we shall have three or four extra seats.  It means that, in the not too distant future, the Province of Leinster will have more than half the Members of this House.  Now, if there are those who think that is a good thing, then all I can say is that I beg to disagree with them.  I do not think it a good thing that this type of representation should take place, that the Province of Leinster should have in the not too distant future&mdash;if not, after the next general election, then possibly after the general election after that&mdash;73 or 74 of the 144 seats in this House.  Yes, I look across at my colleagues and I ask: &ldquo;What hope for the West, then?  Indeed, what hope for the rest of Ireland, barring Leinster?&rdquo;  This is the problem my colleagues and I west of the Shannon have to consider.</P>
    <P>I would ask my Opposition colleagues to look carefully at this matter. It may be that they are sincere.  I believe them to be sincere men who have an interest and a stake in their country and who want to see that our rural inhabitants, those who get a living from the land, will continue in future years to obtain a fair measure of Exchequer expenditure.</P>
    <P>If the balance of representation passes to Leinster, I do not believe the people of Leinster will have a terrible lot of interest in Munster, Connaught or Ulster.  I do not believe they would levy taxation with the interest of those areas particularly in mind.  I have been a Member of this House for the past seven years.  I know how they think.  I know what they think about us.  Believe me, it is not very complimentary to us.  For this reason I would issue a warning that if we wish to continue to make progress, if we want to come to this House with a genuine desire to further the aims of the country rather than our own personal aims, I see no reason, especially for the main Opposition Party, to oppose these proposals.  Indeed, watching the political scene as it develops, it will be a major step towards their own salvation in the future if they accept these proposals of the Government and give them their full support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Last week the Minister pointed out the different value of a vote as between city and country and, on a general average, I think it is something like 3.5 per cent greater in value in one case than in the other.  This alone clearly indicates that there is a sound case for tolerance in this matter of representation in rural areas as against urban areas.  Taking Donegal, the electorate as a percentage of the population in North-East Donegal is 62.5. In South-West Donegal, it is 67.4; in Roscommon-Leitrim, it is 64.36; and in Sligo-Leitrim, it is 63.3.  Comparing that with Dublin figures, we see that the number of electors per 100 of the population in Dublin county is 51.13. Apart from this divergence, there is the national average of about 3.5 per cent. This alone, I think, indicates that there are more people under 21, that there are patients in hospital, children at school and so on, who add to the population and tend to inflate it, not in a truly permanent way, but because they are passing through.  This tends to build up the city population.  I think this gives a general mandate for tolerance between city and country.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not mind traversing my own constituency.  I can do it quite well and I am not complaining about it, but, quite frankly, I cannot give the service I would like to give as a public representative.  I cannot easily traverse 4,000 square miles frequently, nor do I like sitting down in Tubbercurry and letting constituents come to me, as Deputy Ryan suggested last week.  He said that Fianna Fáil have spoiled the electorate, that they went to the electorate rather than let the electorate go to them.  I do not take that view at all.  Deputy Ryan knows little about country constituencies, if he thinks that somebody, perhaps living close to Bundoran, can travel easily to Tubbercurry. Knowing country people as I do, they do not always ring up and make an appointment; they just hire a car and come and, if you are there, well and good.  One must arrange one's business in a different way to accommodate their lack of understanding of what a Deputy has to do.  These are the electors and I hope it will ever be <Col N="532" /> the case that the Deputy will accommodate his people rather than have them wait for him and come and see him.</P>
    <P>It is good for a Deputy to go out among his people and see exactly how they live and what their problems are. He cannot see this sitting in his office waiting for them to come in.  Whether the voter is a farmer or a person looking for social welfare benefit, a Deputy does not know his background and does not know the heart of his case, if he does not go to see him, and consequently cannot very often reflect the circumstances truly as he should be able to do, when he makes representations on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The single-seat constituency proposal would improve this position considerably. Even then constituencies in rural areas would not be so small; they would be still large enough for a Deputy to attend to them and look after them.  We must consider the purposes for which a Deputy is elected and see whether they can examine the people's problems in the area and ensure that the area is adequately represented.  This cannot readily be done in large areas at present.  Smaller constituencies would give Deputies an opportunity to set up their organisations, collect information, meet constituents and really get down to work. The present position is farcical.  I know that if I get a letter about anything every other Deputy gets one also.  This means that not only will there be four letters from the Department but there are often as many as eight.  As ex-Deputy Sherwin would say, this is only codding the public, a lack of sincerity, an exchange of letters.</P>

      <P>Both are closely inter-related.  To come back to the question of tolerance, there is a substantial case for it and I think this measure should go through.  The rigid <Col N="533" /> figure of 20,000 of population is not truly representative.  In any urban area where the census is taken on a particular day, everybody in residence on that day is included.  That tends to inflate the population in certain cases. Another important point is that in rural areas marriages do not take place as early or as frequently as in urban areas and consequently there are not the same families.  There is consequently substantial argument in favour of this measure.  I hope it will go through, because I certainly do not know at this moment, if I am selected, what constituency I will represent the next time out.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1968: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to certain points raised by Deputies during the Committee Stage.  In relation to courses, other than university courses, which would qualify for grants under the scheme, I am having prepared in my Department a comprehensive list which will be published at the earliest possible date.  I am not going to wait on the actual passing of the Bill; I hope to have this fairly soon, inside a matter of a week or so.  Each course must be considered and evaluated in relation to what we hope to achieve. Our object is to encourage young people to pursue full-time courses of higher education equivalent in standard and content to university degree courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> In the light of this criterion, it is clear that courses such as accountancy, which involve apprenticeship allied to part-time study&mdash;which was the case made by Deputy Lindsay&mdash;could not be regarded as coming within the ambit of the scheme.  Deputy Lindsay made representations in relation to students following the BL course to become barristers.  Any such student who is doing a wholetime course of study and who would otherwise be qualified for a grant will be paid the grant.  In relation to students for the solicitors' profession a grant would be payable only if they were following a university degree course and would be limited to the duration of that course.</P>
    <P>The aid available to clerical students has also been referred to.  Grants will be available to enable such students to obtain their primary academic degree, and, if recommended by the college authorities, for post-graduate academic studies.  To extend the grant further in the case of that student would raise a number of issues, some of which would be related to the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>Regarding suggestions that the scheme should be back-dated, even for one year, I may say, as I have said already in Committee, that when progressive schemes such as this are introduced, the case is invariably made that people who have already started on their courses should receive the benefits of the proposed new scheme.  We must set a date for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must draw the line somewhere.  I have given careful consideration to Deputy Lindsay's request that any change in the requirements for participation in the scheme or in the grants available should be made only by regulation to be submitted to both Houses of the Oireachtas. While I appreciate the Deputy's reasons for pressing the point, I am still of the opinion that to accede to his request would add nothing to the scheme and would make it unduly rigid.  It is my desire to make the scheme as flexible as possible.  I believe this can best be done by direct representation to myself rather than circumscribing myself by regulations which might prevent me from doing what might be good in particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have all along stressed my desire to make this scheme a vital and flexible instrument for educational and social progress and I would be very loth to agree to anything that would inhibit it. The use of the statutory instrument has never been a feature of the scholarship schemes in this connection, so why introduce it at this stage?  I might also point out that neither is it a feature of many other statutory grant schemes.  The terms of non-statutory State grant schemes may also of course be varied without recourse to the Oireachtas.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that this scheme, which marks such a substantial advance in higher education, should not be subjected to the necessity of formal statutory instrument.  In any event, such an instrument, if it were to cover every possible contingency that might arise, would have to be so widely drawn as to be worthless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some objection was raised to section 7 of the Bill which gives the Minister for Education power to determine questions or disputes arising under the scheme.  This provision was also in the 1944 Scholarship Act.  It is necessary, as a matter of practical administration, that the Minister should be charged <Col N="536" /> with this responsibility.  It ensures uniformity of administrative decision which is important in a scheme operated by 31 local authority bodies. Of course, I need hardly say that the final arbiter of any legislation is the courts and not the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the nature of the Bill, it would not be appropriate that the words &ldquo;Local Authorities&rdquo; should be deleted from the title.  Local authorities will be providing substantial moneys towards the cost of the scheme and doing the administrative work at local level which it would be impossible for my Department to undertake.  The local authorities are therefore entitled to pride of place in the Title of this legislation.  As I say, it would not be practicable for the State Department to go into the details necessary, to examine means and the other work done by the local authority officers, home assistance officers, rate collectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a dangerous one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into detail about what particular officers will be responsible.  At least the information is available at local authority level to advise me as to who does or does not come within the ambit of the scheme from the means point of view. It would be impossible for my Department to undertake to administer work which will be carried out at local level. Therefore I feel that the local authorities are entitled to have a place in the Title of the Bill, despite the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has not acceded to everything that was asked for in the course of Committee Stage by way of amendment from me, nevertheless, I feel that, in view of his undertakings and statements now, the Committee Stage was worthwhile and that the discussions on the amendments <Col N="537" /> not alone evoked a certain amount of sympathy from the Minister but helped to instil in him the validity of the points we made, certainly the validity of some of the points.  I am still not satisfied that this scheme is a well thought out scheme because I am convinced that money and the availability of money was the predominant consideration.</P>
      <P>As I said in the course of the Committee Stage, if a scheme were brought forward here such as the one recommended by the Fine Gael Party of fee-paying in the first instance, followed by maintenance grants in the second, it would give uniformity and satisfaction.  As I said in a television discussion the other night, any scheme promulgated such as this, and indeed any other kind of scheme, should avoid as far as possible giving rise to dissatisfaction and irritation. The fact that this scheme begins in the next academic year, in October of the coming year, and leaves out all those people who would normally qualify and who are already in the university, does create irritation and dissatisfaction. While the Minister pronounces this as a progressive scheme, I do not see why the incorporation of these people within it, rendering it possible for them to get the benefits of the scheme, could in any way take away from the idea of progressiveness of which the Minister seems to be so enamoured, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not mention another subject that came up on Committee, the position of pupils from the Republic of Ireland who are attending secondary schools in the Six Counties. These would be pupils in the main from Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan and Louth and who were, certainly in Donegal, under the administration of the scholarship scheme in the past, allowed to do a special examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  I had intended to refer to this.  The only county which has a special provision in this regard is Donegal and we intend to continue that situation, to allow somebody from Donegal who has done the examination in the Six Counties to take a <Col N="538" /> special leaving certificate examination at another date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>While the position heretofore did give them the opportunity of availing of scholarships from Donegal County Council, I still think that having to do the second examination was placing an undue hardship on students.  It is bad enough having to do the examination once without having to do it twice, ecept perhaps in special circumstances in relation to the first one.  When one does, say, the GCE in Northern Ireland and secures levels in university subjects here comparable with those in the leaving certificate examination, I see no reason why the levels obtained could not be accepted by our Department of Education and by the Minister in the working of this scheme, and in fact I would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be just another cross-Border gesture, as it were, towards the recognition of standards.  If we are going to have it in the ESB in relation to units of power, surely we could have it in the Department of Education in regard to levels of education?  If the Minister does not see his way to do that, we must be satisfied with the fact that a special examination will be available to these pupils.  Again, this is cumbersome and expensive and calls for extra examiners, extra supervisors and so on.  I see no reason why the comparable levels could not be accepted from these pupils, provided that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course.  I am obliged to the Minister.  There is another aspect of this scheme to which the Minister has not referred, an aspect raised by Deputy Mrs. Desmond who initiated discussion on it on the last occasion, the matter of teacher training.  Since Committee Stage, an argument in regard to this has been brought to my attention, that the people in the teacher training college already are at least four honours people.  They have to be.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a point about people who will have to leave university this year because of their financial circumstances, even though they did have the necessary four honours.  It is rather a pity the Minister could not stretch a point there.  I also asked him what would happen in the case of those who got four honours but did not get Irish and I asked him, if they got Irish the next year, would they qualify?  The Minister has not commented on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the local authority grant, he referred to the fact that this was being included, as it was in 1967. Whatever was being paid would have to be continued.  I pointed out that this included an element in regard to those who were already in university and I asked him how he could take that into account without taking the other into account.  The Minister pre-dated the cash end of it but not the qualifications or the benefits.  This is not good law.  The Minister should have another look at it.</P>
      <P>He is doing away completely with open scholarships.  The Minister has not adverted to that at all.  We had a certain number of closed scholarships and a certain number of open scholarships.  It did not matter what the income was.  The extraordinary thing is that very many of these got very high honours.  Unless their parents are able to pay for them in future, they will not be able to avail of university education.  Mark you, a high income is not necessarily an indication of affluence.  Very often people with high incomes are not so well off at all, because of illness or some other disability, and these will not be able to send their children to university.  At the moment open scholarship winners are being paid for out of the local authority fund.  How will the Minister get around that one when the new regulation comes into force? He will have to get around it in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Mrs. Desmond referred to teachers and the <Col N="543" /> effect the new regulation will have on them.  They put the case much more competently than I can.  I go higher than Deputy Lindsay and I say the figure will be 100 out of 150.  A great many boys have had to go to training college because of necessity and not of choice.  Surely the Minister has some worry with regard to replacements? Those further down on the list might turn out to be better teachers but up to now that was not accepted.  The Minister now says that those with the highest honours might not necessarily make the best teachers.  We all agree with that.  But is there any danger of a lowering of the standard of teaching? The Minister shakes his head.  If the standard is lowered from five or six honours down to three, two or perhaps one, something will have to be done.  I agree that these people should get their chance and it would be a wonderful opportunity for youngsters who would not normally get a chance because they had not enough honours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but it is also good socialism to ensure that there are sufficient teachers available in the primary schools.  In a number of two-teacher schools, we cannot get even one teacher at the present time.  The Minister will want to ensure there is no draining away and no slowing up and no argument on the part of those who are faced with a situation in which the brilliant are going elsewhere and they are reluctant to take in the less brilliant, the result being that in a few years time we may find that for one year or two years there may be no teachers coming out because somebody felt they were too good to teach the people with the smaller number of honours coming in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with this question of teachers again, I see a great many difficulties in this.  It is true that in the past the vast majority of those who went into the teachers training colleges did so by reason of the fact that they did not have money to pursue longer and more expensive courses or, on the other hand, to take <Col N="544" /> advantage of the short course which still obtains in the training colleges in order to come to the salary stage quickly and assist their parents or the younger members of the family in pursuing certain educational courses. Others still went in as the quick way to earning.  We know from experience that a number of these people, of all the classes I have mentioned, were enabled to leave teaching altogether and to do something else more compatible with their academic objective or the way of life to which they thought they should fashion themselves.</P>
      <P>This scheme, commendable as it is in many respects, will make available to those people of this very high standard, as they all are of very high standard, many of the courses that were not open to them before and the grants will relieve them and their people of the hardship which was always there.  Accordingly, then, as Deputy Tully says, you are going to dig down further in the examination attainment level for candidates for training colleges.  While you would get the odd good teacher who might not necessarily be as of high an examination standard as another, by and large it will have to be admitted that teachers must be persons of stature in their community, persons who will be respected, persons who will have the confidence of parents and of the managers who employ them, persons whom the pupils of the higher classes, as they are coming to the age of mature examination of teachers, will respect, and these people of the lower standards in the leaving certificate group who will go into the training colleges should not be regarded with lack of confidence by parents or looked at askance by managing employers or, indeed, be the butt of nudging ridicule by senior pupils in their schools, because they were the kind of people who failed to get into a university.  That is a very bad label to have emerge for primary teachers at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, possibly, the only way the Minister can cure this is by himself and his advisers, as quickly as possible, in consultation with the people in the training colleges, bringing forward the time for initiation of the link between <Col N="545" /> teacher training and the universities so that there will not be any gap where this kind of lack of qualification might be the subject of ridicule.  Of course, once a teacher finds himself in possession of a complex of that kind and knows that he is being regarded as such, it must play merry hell with his self-confidence.  These are the kinds of things which I think the Minister should look at.</P>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of the Bill but the Bill goes only so far and in my view and in the view of my Party it is scrappy and there is an obvious cheese-paring element running right through it.  As I said on Committee Stage, to get rid of irritation, dissatisfaction and the anomalies which we have pointed out here, which have been pointed out by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, Deputy Tully, Deputy Dillon and myself, if there was a specific measure of taxation asked for in this House that would benefit all of our children, nobody would take exception to it and the people would meet it cheerfully.</P>
    <P>I hope that this works well.  I hope it will work better than I think it will. Before I sit down I want to make reference to another category that I mentioned on Committee Stage, that is, the person who in the 1967 leaving certificate examination got four honours in university subjects but did not have another necessary subject for the faculty of his choice and, if Latin be that subject, is doing it this year.  If he succeeds in getting it, will that person be enabled to apply successfully for a grant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Approving, I hope, of the suggestions I have made.  I do not know that there is much more to be said on this.  The best thing to do is to let the Bill through the House as speedily as possible and let it go to the Seanad so that all concerned with its administration and the making of the Order will be able to do so with all speed and that parents and leaving certificate candidates next week will know exactly where they stand in relation <Col N="546" /> to the administration of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, I welcome the Bill but have reservations to which I have referred.  The Bill is full of anomalies and will give rise to considerable irritation and dissatisfaction.  The Minister, in refusing to make these Orders the subject of a regulation to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas, did so in the interests, as he says, of flexibility.  I quite concede that there is validity in both arguments.  He is arguing in favour of flexibility.  I am arguing in favour of the Members of this House having a say in the way the money they vote is being spent and giving them ready access to making arguments.  However, we will have the Parliamentary Question.  I accept the Minister's statement in good faith that he is rejecting the idea of a regulation in order to give himself the maximum amount of flexibility.  In that flexibility I hope the categories I have mentioned, both north and south of the Border, will be included.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see any extension of university education being made available for all our people but there are certain ambiguities that I should like cleared up.  There is a provision here which distinguishes the student who is resident in a university city and the student who has to travel from a rural area.  The resident of the rural area is entitled to a higher rate of grant, as I understand it, than that available to a resident in a university city, but when we come to ask ourselves what will be the statutory designation of a person resident in a university city, we are informed informally by the Minister in the course of a discussion which took place on Radio Telefís Éireann that he included in the category of persons resident in a university city all those within a reasonable bus journey of the university city.  What is a reasonable bus journey and is it a journey on the municipal bus service or is it ten miles or 20 miles, or what area is it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is valuable to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that these are matters which require definition if unseemly disputation is not to take place thereafter and the perfect appearance of gerrymandering to emerge with a circle with a long bulge in it to take in some particular place where the Parliamentary Secretary is living or something of that kind.  It is not an easy task, I freely concede.  Although I endorse wholeheartedly what Deputy Lindsay said about flexibility, I could never see that there was any unreasonable restraint on flexibility if Ministers had power to make orders which had statutory effect unless cancelled by a resolution of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know in our own experience there are hundreds of statutes whereunder a Minister can make an order which has statutory effect unless cancelled. In my experience of this House, which now goes back 35 years, I do not suppose I have heard a dozen of such orders challenged by resolution. Nevertheless, the right to challenge such an order by resolution within 21 days does retain the ultimate control in Dáil Éireann.  On certain occasions which I distinctly remember it has <Col N="548" /> proved a useful check on the imprudent exercise of excessive discretion by a Minister for the time being.  Therefore, I would suggest that the Minister would determine how he will define these areas outside of which people would be entitled to the supplementary grant and inside which people would be entitled only to the residential grant.</P>
    <P>The second thing I want to say is that I believe all schemes of this kind are rendered better if they can be implemented without creating a local sense of grievance.  Very often these grievances, looked at from the angle of Oireachtas Éireann, are microscopic but looked at from the point of view of the county or the area where they exist, they become chronic sources of irritation which make people sour about the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has made a very great mistake in freezing the current contributions made by local authorities and requiring these contributions to be made hereafter annually.  It has the ridiculous effect of imposing an annual charge on a relatively poor county like Monaghan 50 per cent greater than that which County Kildare will have to pay or a county like Offaly.  These are two counties in which there is some of the best land in Ireland, whereas Monaghan is a county with predominantly small farms where the productive quality of the land is relatively low, the average holding small and the average income small.</P>
    <P>There again I think the Minister would do well to think again and see if he could not procure the general goodwill of all by a uniform poundage charge, if he does not consider raising the £230,000 or whatever it may be by taxation and simply wiping out the local contribution altogether.  I doubt very much if this device of the arbitrary freezing of existing contributions is a prudent procedure for it would seem to warn local authorities hereafter that they should not be enthusiastic in implementing optional schemes because, if they are, should the policy change they will simply be called upon to bear permanently a heavier burden than the less enterprising local authorities <Col N="549" /> who have in the past hung back and failed to co-operate as enthusiastically as County Monaghan has done in this case and as other counties may have done in regard to other schemes.</P>
    <P>We are passing this Bill from Dáil Éireann to the Seanad.  One of the objects of this Bill is to make university education available to a wider section of our people.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, as I had the privilege of saying at the Ard Fheis of our organisation five years ago, our ultimate aim is to make available the best we have in primary, secondary and university education to all our children without regard to the income of their parents.  That is a structure that cannot be developed in a day, but it is the aim, the goal, towards which we wish to move.</P>
    <P>I think it is a mistake to allow an occasion of this kind to pass&mdash;we are on the Final Stage and it is not appropriate to dwell on things we think ought to be in the Bill but we are considering now what is in the Bill&mdash; without making comment on what the consequences of this Bill, as it now stands after the Committee and Report Stages, are likely to be.  Its most important function is to multiply the number of university students in Ireland.  Now, I know, and I knew before I spoke, that in the discussion on the Estimate for External Affairs in this House I had certain things to say which I thought necessary to say.  I do not want to withdraw or qualify one single sentence that I then spoke.  I do not want to mitigate the abrasiveness of the language I deliberately chose.  But it is necessary that young people should know and understand what their elders are saying and thinking.  I fully appreciate that in dealing with these matters I caused many young students to feel that I and perhaps others of my generation were out of sympathy with their praiseworthy impatience for reform.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear&mdash;and it is necessary to make it clear so that the truth can be made to prevail&mdash;that I know the student body fairly well personally and vicariously.  The vast bulk of the student body of this country will, I would interpolate, Sir, never vote for me because they will never <Col N="550" /> have the chance; by the time they have grown to voting age or to participate in public life, it is highly unlikely that I will be seeking the suffrage of any voter; so there can be no suggestion that I am seeking to pacify future voters.  But I think it right that the truth should be made manifest to them.</P>
    <P>They will be quite mistaken in believing that the senior members of this Parliament of Ireland do not understand their yearning for reform, and their hopes to make this country a better country in which to live.  They will be quite wrong in thinking that any responsible member of this House believes that the majority of Irish students are irresponsible rowdies. They will be quite wrong in believing that any senior member of this Parliament of Ireland looks upon the student body of Ireland as reckless, or irresponsible, or capricious.</P>
    <P>They would be quite wrong if they did not understand that we who have watched liberty totter to the edge of extinction time and again in our lives, have got a high duty at whatever cost to warn the young that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance and that the road to servitude invariably leads through anarchy.  If in this House we speak out against those who would channel the glorious energies of the young on the road to anarchy in the hope that this will lead to Utopia, we must from our experience say: &ldquo;The road to anarchy leads not to what you hope for, but to the opportunity for unworthy men to impose servitude upon you.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are suddenly creating a great opportunity for a vast number of young people to become university students.  Is not that so?  Are we not entitled at the moment of doing that to tell these people that if they are receiving from their country a great opportunity they must have present to their minds the magnitude of their responsibility?  I think it is relevant. Sir.  Is it not relevant for us in this <Col N="551" /> House to say that nothing we can say to the young who are standing on the threshold of the universities will teach them wisdom, because wisdom is something that cannot be taught by precept. It is acquired only by experience.</P>
      <P>Surely we are entitled to say to them: &ldquo;Now you stand at the threshold of a broader education ask yourselves this question: `What is the purpose of your broader education?  Is it not fundamentally to stay free?  Is it not fundamentally to keep your country free and to see that your children and your children's children stay free?' &rdquo; Is it not right to say to them: &ldquo;We are opening the door of our universities to you all, but remember that within these doors there is an opportunity for immense advancement and progress not only for you individually but for the nation of which you constitute a part.  If you listen to the prophets of anarchy, they will take back from you in servitude the whole horizon of freedom that our ultimate aim is designed to give you all.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am certain that the vast bulk of the university students of this country, given an understanding of these fundamental facts, will cherish freedom and defend it with just the same enthusiasm and devotion as our fathers and grandfathers fought to get it. When I point the finger at the tiny minority who have suffered themselves to become the dupes of foreign hirelings, I do not reprobate the student body of Ireland because I am relatively old and speaking to the young. On the contrary, I am trying to make it clear that I cheerfully support this measure because I am confident that the vast bulk of the existing student body, and the new student body we are hoping to create, can be entrusted with the preservation of freedom, provided they are on their guard to ensure that the halls of the universities which it will be the privilege of future generations to build for their accommodation are not used by unscrupulous deceivers to generate anarchy designed ultimately to make serfs of the people we are now planning to make free men.</P>

    <P>I think this has to be said.  The <Col N="552" /> more we can communicate it to the rising generation of our people, the better it will be for us all.  In these times we are frequently told that the channels of comunication are breaking down between the Parliamentary institutions and the masses of the people, particularly the young.  We have a duty in Parliament&mdash;we are the elected representatives of the people; we are a select company; there are only 144 of us&mdash;to communicate and tell them that when we enter Leinster House we do not forget them, we do not misunderstand them, we do not cut ourselves off from our own children.  We are not all spectral beings who have no sons or grandsons to inform us of what young minds are thinking.</P>
    <P>It is useful to tell them that in this House no one is sacrosanct and those who threaten to undermine the institutions we are concerned to protect will be stigmatised for what they are but that the young are, to the knowledge of us all, the hope and future of this country.  We are mobilising our resources to place at their disposal the fullest opportunity our resources will allow in the confidence that they will fully justify the faith we put in them. If there are those who tell them we in Dáil Éireann do not understand the problems of the young, they would do well to ask themselves, of the 144 Deputies who sit there, how many have young of their own whose daily problems are the main preoccupation of Deputies of Dáil Éireann and, if they understand their own young, why should the young of the country proceed on the assumption that, in Dáil Éireann, the young are misunderstood? I do not think that is irrelevant to the measure we are now passing or to the interest Dáil Éireann should have in it or to the occasion of one step further along the road towards the ultimate goal which we on this side of the House have certainly set ourselves and to which I believe Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party wish to advance as well.  I am happy to find all Parties in this House on the road towards the same goal.</P>
    <P>I am deliberately passing over <Col N="553" /> detailed defects I may perceive in these plans here.  I accept them as one step at least in the right direction.  I passionately hope that those for whom these plans are made will realise that it is in Dáil Éireann, in the Árd Fheiseanna of the political organisations of this country and in the Executives of the political organisations that reform and change and development can be achieved in freedom and that their voices&mdash;the voices of the young&mdash;however strident, however indignant, however loudly dissenting, will be heard with respect and attention within the political organisations of this country and that it is there that educated and informed influence can effectively be brought to bear on a programme of reform.  If they will hear that and recognise the agents of anarchy for what they are, cheap frauds and base traitors to truth, then the passage of this Bill through Dáil Éireann will achieve an even greater purpose than the limited aim which the Minister claimed for it.</P>

      <P>Inside this House and in the country the provisions of this Bill have received, and deservedly so, great praise, because they considerably increase the number of scholarships available at post-secondary schools&mdash;universities, technical and other schools.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that, in one respect, they worsen the position in regard to one class of secondary student.  This class are represented by the day and boarding students who receive their secondary education, post-primary education, in schools and colleges in the Six County area. Heretofore, because of the fact that examinations for which they studied in Northern Ireland and the leaving certificate examinations here on many occasion clash, and this year do clash, and in the future will, too, in regard to the dates on which they are held, a special examination was set with the approval of the Department, which enabled these pupils, the students, to sit for the scholarship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about certain aspects of this Bill&mdash;I do not intend to keep the Minister long&mdash;which will give rise to a sense of inequity between various sections of the community.  Deputy Dillon was speaking about public authorities and the manner in which the requirements would be made for them to make certain contributions towards the cost of this Bill.  I want to refer, very briefly, to some of the individual inequities that will arise as a result of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students who have already all the qualifications for the benefits which the Bill proposes to give students and who are, at the moment, in universities will not be entitled to obtain any assistance under this Bill.  This will give rise to one situation which will pertain, certainly, in University College, Cork in respect of people who already have scholarships from Cork Corporation of £135 a year.  They will have £135 a year for having obtained a scholarship of a type similar to the one envisaged by this Bill but, because somebody was born two or three years later, he will get, within the ambit of this Bill, £175 a year in the same university for the same course.  They are getting different grants from public authorities. I think that is bad.  It is the sort of thing that could give rise to a feeling of injustice amongst the student body. If the Minister could, even at this stage <Col N="555" /> look into this matter, I should be very glad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon adverted to it, this scheme does represent an investment by the community in the young people of our country. I think this investment will be rewarded excellently.  I have confidence that there will be a response to it and that, by widening the range of people going into higher education, we shall remove anomalies that have existed heretofore and ensure the highest standard of entrant.  The community require that a higher standard of person shall go on to higher education. That person can have the fullest satisfaction of knowing that he or she is utilising his or her talents to the greatest extent.  At the same time, the community itself benefits from the utilisation to the highest degree of the talents of these young people.</P>
      <P>Equality of opportunity is a basic social principle.  It is one to which all Parties in this House subscribe.  I believe this is the most practical form of social justice one can imagine, where everybody, boys or girls, irrespective of their means, or where they live, can get the chance to go right to the top in whichever field their talents may lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend that this Bill is anything but the first step in this direction.  That is why it is deliberately framed in a very flexible way so as to enable the Minister for Education in the years ahead, according to the community's needs and the requirements of social justice, to adjust the requirements in regard to entry, in regard to means and in regard to the establishments that would be regarded by him as coming within the ambit of the Bill in respect of higher grants. Indeed, the debate itself and the numerous issues raised highlighted the fact that the Minister for Education must have flexibility under the Bill, or Act as it will be.  If, in the months and years ahead, Deputies have cases of injustice brought to their notice or marginal cases that should come within the framework of the Act, it is important that they should be able to <Col N="556" /> approach the Minister with the particular injustice brought to their notice and that the Minister should be able, at his discretion, to provide for what is just in the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The debate raises a number of issues on which I can give the House assurances.  One issue referred to by Deputy Cunningham, and earlier by Deputy Lindsay, was that in regard to County Donegal where heretofore people who sought scholarships and who had done the GCE course in the Six Counties had special examination arrangements made for them in order to qualify for scholarships here.  We shall continue that course in regard to County Donegal.  If there are GCE students in Donegal in the coming few weeks who will be doing the GCE examination in the Six Counties at the same time as our leaving certificate, they will have facilities to do a special leaving certificate at a later stage in order to qualify under our scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not confine that to County Donegal.  It also applies in Cavan and Monaghan and Louth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These counties have not required these facilities from us heretofore.  Donegal was the only Northern county that had or that sought this arrangement.  We shall continue to provide it for Donegal and if it is sought for other counties we can do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>What about comparable levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a reasonably flexible order made under the Act which will enable me, or a Minister for Education in the future, if we decide that there is an outside examination that equates to our leaving certificate, to adopt it for our purposes. The order will be flexible enough to allow that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Lindsay both mentioned specific cases that had been brought to their notice of persons who had got four honours in the leaving certificate last year and in one case had not got Irish and in another had not got Latin and who were doing <Col N="557" /> these subjects this year.  I have decided that this type of person&mdash;there must not be more than three or four of them in the whole country&mdash;should come within the ambit of the Bill and I can give that assurance that we will devise arrangements whereby these particular cases will come within the ambit of this year's higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Referring again to the question of having the GCE equated to our leaving certificate, looking further afield to Europe, it could become necessary to have European examinations of similar standards equated to our own.  I would retain that flexibility in the operation of the Bill in order to enable appropriate decisions to be made in such cases in the future.</P>
    <P>The question of bringing in people who are at university at present is, I am afraid, out.  Bluntly, it is a financial question: the money involved in bringing them in for one year would be £300,000.  Then where does justice stop or begin?  What about boys and girls who, through a lack of means, did not go to university last year?  By bringing in last year's university entrants you would be doing an injustice, one could say, to boys and girls who might have been at the university last year but for lack of means.  I think the best thing is to make a start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister confined it to those at the university who would qualify for the maximum grant, that would be a relief to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is out although all my sympathy is naturally in that direction.  We have made a start; let us continue. Another point raised was the question of open scholarships&mdash;I think it was Deputy Tully who mentioned it&mdash; which operate irrespective of means, 25 per cent in each county.  I am discussing this matter at the moment with the universities with a view to raising substantially the number of entrance scholarships they will have in the coming year.  These have no means test and they will now replace the open scholarships which existed heretofore. <Col N="558" /> We hope to raise substantially the number of such scholarships, which is very low at the moment, which universities will offer on an open national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They will be completely open, nobody excluded.  I hope to make an announcement on this very shortly.  Another major point that was made related to the question of teacher training.  I assured the House on a previous occasion I have had several discussions with the teacher organisations and with the managements of the teacher training establishments about this matter and I propose to have it incorporated in a higher education Bill which I hope to have before the House inside the next few months.  In this Bill we are going to affiliate teacher training establishments with the universities and we hope to incorporate by September or October 12 months a teacher-training course of university status so that every teacher, vocational, secondary and primary will do a graduate course through a combination of study between the training college, which will be an affiliated college of the university, and the university proper.  So the difficulties mentioned in the present position in regard to teacher training, will disappear.</P>

      <P>On the remuneration aspect, the recent salary tribunal report which equalises the salaries of all teachers has removed the anomalies and distinctions that existed heretofore between the three branches of teaching.  This should meet practically the whole&mdash;nothing ever meets the whole case&mdash;of the problem of remuneration to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean remuneration <i>vis-à-vis</i> other teachers; I mean <i>vis-à-vis</i> other professions. Surely there is no comparison between what they get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to this point again.  Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Tully spoke about the fact that the Department have a scheme for reducing the number of honours obtained by entrants to teacher-training courses compared with heretofore. I agree with this but I do not agree that there is necessarily an equation between higher honours status and the good teacher category.  Indeed, I am not relying on my own word for this; I have the word of the principal of one of the most prominent teacher-training establishments in the country that he is not at all satisfied that this equation exists.  Our ratio of 5.3 honours to every entrant, which is the average&mdash;in some cases, it is six or seven or eight&mdash;into the teacher-training courses is far above anything that exists in any other country in the world.  In fact if this will have the effect of even halving that, it will still be higher than that of Britain or any other European country in regard to teacher-training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakness of the system heretofore has been that economic circumstances have pushed into teacher-training people who are equipped mentally and from the point of view of character for some other form of higher education than teaching.  I am informed reliably that this has led to a lot of job dissatisfaction on the part of those teachers who felt, and rightly so, that their talents equipped them for another profession or another type of work which would give them greater remuneration.  Our honours ratio, therefore, in regard to entrance for <Col N="560" /> teacher training has been far too high. This has been dictated by economic circumstances and we are going to remedy that in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the honours ratio has not been dictated by economic circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, precisely because of what I am saying.  Student with high honours in their leaving cer tificates who heretofore have been pushed by economic circumstances into teacher training will now have the opportunity under this Bill when it becomes law of going to the university for another type of higher education; in other words their options will have been widened.  They will be able to avail of a technological or whatever other form of education they desire. Some of them may still wish to train as teachers from a sense of dedication, but at least they will have other options open to them.  It will be dictated not by economic circumstances but by what they think is the right course to take having regard to their talents.</P>
      <P>We had four times more applications last year for entrance into the training colleges than we took in.  Even if those with four, five or six honours who, heretofore, through economic circumstances would have been obliged to go in for teacher training, now avail of other opportunities, we shall still have a sufficient proportion of people of a good educational standard to go into teacher training.  As I have said, the good teacher is not necessarily the person with the highest number of honours.  It depends primarily on personality, on the ability to communicate and to get involved in the problems of his or her students.  However, within 12 months we should have the whole matter ironed out when teacher training has been induced into the university system and we have provided a basic training for all our teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else that arose in the course of the debate.  I should like to thank the House for a very constructive discussion. I think all Parties will agree this is a progressive measure which, <Col N="561" /> I would again emphasise, is just the first step along the road to complete equality of opportunity.  I am certain that the investment the State is making in education, in the region of £52 million, which is more than double the investment over the past five years, will be rewarded.</P>
    <P>We all realise that in a small country like ours the main assets we have are the skills and talents of our people.  I have sufficient faith in our people to believe that we have a great degree of intelligence, skill and talent, and that if we can devise an educational system that can absorb our people to the fullest extent of their abilities, then this surely is a praiseworthy goal for us to seek to achieve, a goal that can bring not only the greatest benefit to the individual but to the community as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Bill has not been noted for the amount of co-operation which has been received from the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary.  The Ceann Comhairle was in the chair when we postponed consideration of section 10 because Deputy O'Higgins was seeking an explanation of the implications of that section.  The Parliamentary Secretary undertook on that occasion to get the full meaning of this section and perhaps he is in a position to give it to us now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 provides power for the Minister to make regulations exempting from the Bill businesses of any particular class.  There is no power to exempt individuals from the provisions of the Bill.  The present intention is to exempt buyers of skein wool as a class from the provisions of the Bill.  Experience may show that there are other classes for which <Col N="562" /> exemption may be appropriate and it is therefore necessary to have powers in this regard under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked at the conclusion of last evening's debate whether the powers of exemption could be used to grant wholesale exemptions, in other words to nullify the Bill.  He was told that the point would be examined.  The Parliamentary Draftsman has been consulted and his view is that to make regulations effectively nullifying the Bill would be <i>ultra vires.</i>  Therefore, all orders and regulations made under the Bill must be made before each House of the Oireachtas and a Resolution by either House would suffice to annul any order or regulation.  Even if such an <i>ultra vires</i> regulation were made and even if both Houses of the Oireachtas failed to annul it, its legality could still be challenged in the courts. I think this information will satisfy the Deputy that the section and the point raised by Deputy O'Higgins brought undue alarm and dismay to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I referred to the consequences that might arise in Sligo-Leitrim, in parts of Donegal and in North and South Mayo.  The present population of Donegal NorthEast and South-West is 108,549 and to maintain the position in regard to three-seat constituencies, they obviously would have to get an injection of population from some place or other.  Indeed, for the Donegal people, this would be alien because they have always represented themselves.  If the <Col N="564" /> position is to be maintained, it is obvious that at least 10,000 or 11,000 of population will require to be transferred to South-West Donegal.</P>
      <P>In Sligo-Leitrim, we are concerned about this position and I do not think that it is only Deputy Gilbride and myself who have to be concerned about it because Deputy McLaughlin and Deputy Gilhawley should equally be concerned.  Certainly the people in Leitrim are concerned about it.  I am just wondering, knowing the energy which Donegal people can put into an election in a three-seat constituency, what would they do in, say North Leitrim, assuming that portion of Leitrim could well be added to the Donegal South-West constituency.  Certainly in many ways I am pleased that I am a bit more south than that.  Again, it might well be that a bit would be added from Sligo which would take in, with Donegal, portion of the town of Sligo.  Then we go more south to Mayo South and Mayo North.  At present the population in Mayo North is 50,315 and in Mayo South, 67,798. Again there is a picture to be looked at there.  How are these constituencies to be maintained?  It is an appalling picture.  No less than we in Fianna Fáil the Fine Gael representatives in the west of Ireland would do well to look at this matter and say clearly to the people whether they think this is the proper thing to do, whether they think this constitutional provision of 20,000 of population or as near as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the Title, I am not too clear as to what the position is.  At the very top of the Bill it is described as the &ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968.&rdquo;  Then we have: &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to Amend the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 46 (3) of the Constitution says that every such Bill&mdash;this being one of those such Bills&mdash;shall be expressed to be an Act to amend the Constitution.  That might be all very well and quite clear if we were likely to have but one Amendment Bill before the people.  As I see it, this Bill, if the provisions of the Constitution are to be adhered to, shall be entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution&rdquo;. Now, when we come to deal with the next Bill on the Order Paper, it, I gather, will also be entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution&rdquo;. I should like the Minister to give the House some indication as to what he proposes to put on the referendum ballot paper because I suppose what goes on the ballot paper will depend on the Title of the Bill as decided upon by the Oireachtas.  As I see it, if Article 46 (3) of the Constitution is to be followed, this Bill simply must be entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution&rdquo; and the Fourth Amendment must be similarly described.  I do not propose to say anything further at this stage but would like the Minister to clarify the position for us.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am doing no such thing.  I am discussing the Long Title to the Bill in relation to the point made quite properly by Deputy Fitzpatrick and to the obscure and confused answers given by the Minister.  I am pointing out that this situation has been created because, as is known, a proposal is before this House which if the Constitution is to be observed would result in a complete absurdity.  The people would be asked to vote on the same ballot paper for an Act to amend the Constitution and asked to vote for it twice.  The people could not possibly understand what is involved and this leads to a situation in which the Constitution itself is being disregarded by the Government.  That is what appears to me to be involved in this.  The constitutional provision is quite clear. If it means anything, it means that the issue to be put before the people is what the Constitution says it should be, and that is whether they are in favour of or against a particular Act to amend the Constitution.  What the Government propose to ask them is whether they are for or against something else, something entitled the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. That is not within the Constitution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is quite clear what has happened. The Government at the outset hoped to have this package deal and to include these two proposals in one Bill. But, as I say, public opinion, the free press and this House would not stand for that.  They had to run away from it and they did run away from it.  As the Minister says, they have now introduced two Bills and they are going to have two ballot papers, but they are going to try to achieve what they set out to achieve by christening one of the Bills the Third Amendment and the other the Fourth Amendment, as if that will mean anything to the people. If the Minister can call this Bill in the Short Title the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, surely he can put some name on it that will mean something to the people?  He can call it the Tolerance Bill, the Gerrymandering <Col N="573" /> Bill, or anything else.  Of course it is really a gerrymandering Bill but if he calls it the Tolerance Bill the people might know what he means.  It is obvious&mdash;and I want to put this on the record&mdash;that the Minister, having been chased away from his efforts to confuse the people by the package deal and the two questions in one Bill, has now come along and introduced two Bills; but on the ballot papers they are going to be like Siamese twins and it will be impossible to distinguish them.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have been notified by the Chair that amendments Nos. 1 and 2, standing in my name, have been ruled out of order. Without questioning the ruling of the Chair, I want to draw the attention of the House to this ruling.  I agree that the effect of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 standing in my name would be to retain multi-seat constituencies with the transferable vote.  The Chair has ruled this out of order on the grounds that the amendments seek to delete from the Bill the provisions which give effect to the Second Reading, that is, the introduction of single-member constituencies in lieu of the existing multi-seat constituencies.  I agree that that is the effect of the amendment.  I cannot help observing that another amendment&mdash;which, as far as I know, does not appear to have been ruled out of order&mdash;has a similar effect in that it proposes to retain a form of proportional representation&mdash;&ldquo;a form&rdquo; I say&mdash;in the form of a single transferable vote instead of the non-transferable vote assented to in the Second Reading.  I cannot see the distinction, in principle, between my amendment and the other amendment which, as far as I know, has not been ruled out of order.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Norton would allow me to explain the position to Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Chair considers that the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time was the introduction of the single-member constituencies in lieu of the existing multi-member constituencies.

Deputies will appreciate that the Chair must take all relevant circumstances into account in determining the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With regard to the amendment which has not been ruled out of order, I am not making the case it should be ruled out of order but I am making the case that all amendments should be treated equally.  The big principle in the Bill as understood by everybody in the country was the straight vote or the transferable vote.  Deputy Norton's amendment proposes to retain the <Col N="579" /> transferable vote and to throw out the straight vote provision.  With the greatest respect to you, Sir, and to the Chair you occupy, I want to go on record as saying that that is far more a principle of the Bill than the single-member constituency.</P>

      <P>The Chair was not queried when it ruled on four occasions that discussion on Deputy Norton's amendment was not appropriate to Second Stage and should await the Committee Stage.  One of the rulings was given in response to a case made by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins. Furthermore, the statements of about a dozen speakers on Second Stage contained a clear expectation that Deputy Norton's amendment would come up on Committee Stage: a number of these were front bench Opposition Members. Towards the end of the debate, they pressed the Taoiseach to indicate what his attitude to Deputy Norton's amendment would be.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment was allowed on Second Stage because it advanced a fundamental reason against the Second Reading, that is, that two referenda had already been held and that a third was not justified; the referenda in question included the issue of the multi versus the single seat constituency, that is, the principle of the present Bill.</P>

I submit, with respect, that it is crystal clear that the purpose of this Bill was the issue of the single seat, first past the post, straight vote issue.  There was no confusion at all about it.  I would <Col N="580" /> submit to you, a Cheann Comhairle, with respect, that that is an indefeasible principle&mdash;the combination of the single seat here with the straight vote&mdash;and that Deputy Fitzpatrick's submission must be acceptable to the Chair if Deputy Norton's amendment is to stand because, undoubtedly, there is the very same clash in basic principle, as on Second Reading, which has been passed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whether or not Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is taken.  It must be quite clear that this amendment is, in fact, a complete negative to the Bill, that there could be no question of the straight vote in multi-member constituences. It could not be operated.  Therefore, if the principle of the single-seat constituency were ruled out, there could be no question of the straight vote, whereas it would be possible to operate the transferable vote in the system of single-seat constituencies.  We shall have the same argument anyway.  It appears to me that Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is against the principle of the Bill whereas it would be possible to have the Constitution amended and retain the transferable vote.</P>
      <P>Tairgeadh an cheist: &ldquo;Go bhfanfaidh fo-alt 1 i bpáirteanna I agus II mar chuid den Sceideal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Question proposed: That subsection 1 in Parts I and II stand part of the Schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This subsection reads:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies, and one member only shall be returned for each constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the subsection which proposes to abolish multi-seat constituencies and I disagree with the proposal to abolish such constituencies and introduce single-seat constituencies because I <Col N="581" /> think the single-seat constituency precludes minority representation. Whether the minority concerned be religious or political it should, if it has sufficient support to warrant it, have representation in this House and should be able to have a representation here to speak on its behalf. It should not be driven underground or driven to use violent means of expressing views.  Indeed, the need for minority representation in the House is becoming more apparent day by day and year by year when we see Ministers trying to stifle free speech, to muzzle newspapers and prevent rate-payers and taxpayers from using the national television service to express their views.</P>
    <P>This goes yet one step further.  If this subsection is accepted you have a very substantial minority in any constituency being muzzled and denied the right to send a TD to this House to speak for it.  Then, if the views which that Deputy would have expressed here run contrary to Government opinion you will have that section of the community also denied the right to express its views on television and through the national newspapers, if the present Minister for Local Government has his way.  Therefore, on that ground an unanswerable case can be made for retaining constituencies of not less than three Deputies because this lends itself very strongly to proper representation being given to minorities whether religious, political or vocational.  If such minorities get a sufficient volume of public support behind them they are entitled to come into this House and express their views.  It would be good for democracy and good for the harmonious administration of the country to preserve that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage of these Bills we heard a good deal about the promotion of interest in politics and the stimulation of public views and political thought.  In my opinion, the abolition of multi-seat constituencies and the creation of single seat constituencies will remove political stimulation and prevent young people from taking an interest in political life.  This is because in a multi-seat constituency <Col N="582" /> you have competition within a Party for the right to represent that Party in this House.  If the single-seat constituency is introduced, supporters of a Party will have no such right; they will have but one candidate of their Party on the ballot paper and can either take him or leave him.  That is not calculated to create a healthy interest in political life.  If the present system has changed there will be very little incentive to a young man of ambition to interest himself in the political life of his constituency, certainly, with a view to attaining parliamentary honours.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, one of the greatest faults in the single-seat constituency system is that it is calculated to create the safe seat.  It is calculated to create a position in which the sitting member cannot be dethroned, in which he knows he has a safe seat.  This single-seat constituency, coupled with the measure that we dealt with earlier this afternoon, the tolerance Bill, lends itself to the creation of the safe seat and to gerrymandering.</P>
    <P>We have the experience of the safe seat in Northern Ireland.  There are constituencies in Northern Ireland where an election has not taken place for 40 years.  There was, as I informed the House on Second Reading and quoted from an editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i>, a situation where recently in the division of Lisnaskea, in order to make their voice heard at all, the Nationalist minority were left with no alternative but to refuse to contest the seat and throw their weight in behind another candidate.  I shall be told, I am sure, by the Minister, that that is a situation peculiar to Northern Ireland, a situation which does not arise here. However, the safe seat situation can be created here by the Minister and his Party or by any Party in power when they come to arrange the constituencies, with elbow room of one-sixth above or below the national average, where a population of between 16,000 and 17,000 may be entitled to a seat in one area, whereas it will take between 22,000 and 23,000 to be entitled to a seat in another area. That provision lends itself to gerrymandering, <Col N="583" /> to the creation of a safe seat.  There is nothing calculated to do more harm to democracy than the safe seat system which the Minister undoubtedly has in mind.</P>
    <P>Another point which obviously strikes one dealing with this proposal is that in this country an elector is inclined to seek the assistance of a TD whom he has supported and is not prepared to go to a TD he has not supported.  In a multi-seat constituency under the system we have here at the present time, it is most likely that an elector will have a TD of his own choice to approach if he has a grievance to be rectified or ventilated. If the Minister gets his way with this provision here, there will be in every constituency in Ireland a big percentage of people left without a representative. There will be people having to go to another constituency to seek the assistance of a TD who does not represent them; or electors will be driven to approach a TD against whom they have openly campaigned at the previous general election.  That is foreign to the Irish mentality.  It is foreign to our nature.  We are not inclined to seek the assistance of somebody whom we have openly opposed and tried to keep out of public life at the last election.</P>
    <P>The system we have here of multi-seat constituencies, not less than three, which has operated since the foundation of the State, has worked very well, has kept alive political activity and healthy political thought.  It has not, as the Minister has argued on Second Stage, led to the creation of numerous Parties or unstable government.  The contrary is the case.  Under the Irish system of multi-seat constituencies and PR&mdash;and I wish to stress the Irish system, because I do not think there is any system of PR exactly like it any place else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a matter of fact, in the <Col N="584" /> past ten years the number of parties has been reduced from five to three. I fail to see what case the Minister can make in favour of this proposal. The Minister and the Taoiseach have so far failed to make out any case in favour of the abolition of the multi-seat constituencies and the creation of single-seat constituencies.  We are down to this net point in subsection 1º, which reads:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies, and one member only shall be returned for each constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What minorities have we got in this country that need special representation as minorities apart from the representation of the three political Parties we have here at present?  This system, he says, gives these minorities representation.  The people are represented in the present Dáil by three political Parties and three Independent Deputies.  I do not know if any one of the three Independent Deputies considers himself to be representing any particular minority view.  Certainly I do not know of any minority that there is here unless Deputy Fitzpatrick is referring to religious minorities.  If so, there is in fact in the Dáil representation of religious minorities but these minorities have not deemed it necessary to organise themselves on the basis of minority Parties.  I should like to know what minorities Deputy Fitzpatrick is referring to as needing the special representation that this system is designed to give them, this system of multi-member constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick says that the system of multi-member constituencies which ensures representation for minorities and therefore encourages the formation of minority Parties is good for democracy.  Perhaps he will explain to us how a democracy could function if the situation which he envisages of large numbers of these minorities being represented here ever materialises.  How would a Government be formed if the basis of representation is to be the basis of minority sectional interests rather than the basis of political Parties putting forward proposals in the interests of the community as a whole and getting votes on the basis of those proposals?  I cannot see how the people are going to be able to choose a Government if the situation which Deputy Fitzpatrick foresees develops.  I admit that the system of election that we are asking the people to rid themselves of is designed to achieve that position, to bring about the position in which it will be feasible for people to organise themselves on the basis of small sectional groups and to obtain representation here.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of his remarks, Deputy Fitzpatrick presented this as the desirable thing.  He said that it would be good for democracy and I want to ask him how democracy could possibly function if the Dáil is to be composed of a number of people representing minority interests who may be in small Parties or may not, who might be just individuals who secured representation on the basis of being particularly interested in the well-being of particular sections of the community? Obviously the Government could only then be formed after an election because it will not be until after the election that the composition of the Dáil will be known and only then would these different individuals and small groups be able to get down to the process of bargaining among themselves for the formation of a Government.  Certainly there would be no time for the formation of any policy.  This situation, which both Deputy Fitzpatrick and I admit, is the objective of the electoral system we have would deprive the people of the <Col N="586" /> opportunity of choosing a government for themselves.  I quite agree that this all depends on the view we take of what is the purpose of elections, whether it is intended that at elections the people should choose their Government or whether they should just choose a debating society, people who represent different sectional views, and that the public should have no knowledge of what these people propose to do in regard to the conduct of the country's affairs and that they must just wait and see what emerges from the indeterminate situation which both Deputy Fitzpatrick and I agree this system is designed to bring about.</P>
    <P>Apparently Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks that this is true democracy, that the people should not choose the Government but that the Government should be formed behind their backs after the election is over.  We on this side of the House take a different view. We think the whole principle of democracy is that the people should be able to choose the Government.  For this reason we propose that this system which is designed to prevent that should be changed for the one we are proposing and which would make it more likely that at election time people would be able to choose their Government and after the next election be able to hold that Government responsible for their actions, be able to relate the performance of the Government to the proposals they put before the people at the general election which returned them to office.  Apparently Deputy Fitzpatrick is advocating that we should retain this system of election because it is likely to give rise to the type of Government that was described and favoured by the vice-Chairman of the Labour Party on a television programme last night when he visualised such a Government as a Government in which one section would be watching for the most suitable opportunity of pulling the rug from under the feet of the other section or sections who were colleagues of that particular Party in the Government.</P>
    <P>At present the Coalition that is in the process of gestation comprises only two Parties and apparently it is envisaged there will be only one Party <Col N="587" /> watching for the opportunity of pulling the rug from under the other Party's feet.  Deputy Fitzpatrick visualises a situation in which all these unspecified minorities will have representation and therefore a situation in which whatever Government, if any, it is possible to form after the election will comprise a number of these groups bound, as the vice-Chairman of the Labour Party said last night, by no sense of loyalty to one another but instead watching for the opportunity to pull the rug from under their colleagues' feet.</P>
    <P>It appears that if the situation which Deputy Fitzpatrick says is desirable does develop we will have quite an extensive amount of rug-pulling in whatever Government, if any, it is possible to form after the election.  We know that at present at any rate there appears to be a desire in some quarters to form this Coalition openly before the election and apparently there is a desire in other quarters not to form it until after the election.  In the circumstances that Deputy Fitzpatrick aspires to even this would not be possible because the groups would be too numerous for this arrangement to be made until they became aware of what the actual result was after the election.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to say that the change which was proposed would result in the creation of safe seats all over the country.  I cannot understand how he can say that because it must be obvious that it is the present system which results in the creation of safe seats.  It is obviously more difficult to win one seat in a single member constituency than it is to obtain one seat out of three, or one out of four, or one out of five.  In a situation in which it is possible to scrape up third or fourth or tenth preference votes, which may later be transformed into full votes, all over a large constituency with the object of eventually arriving by this dubious means at what is described as a quota, it is much easier for a Deputy, who does not do his homework either as a legislator or as representative, to win a seat.  It is, therefore, under the present <Col N="588" /> system that safe seats are created and, in fact, exist.  Some Deputies get safe seats on the basis of the votes given to their colleagues.  It is quite obvious that this is, in fact, partly responsible for the narrow victory of the element in Fine Gael opposed to this proposition.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious that under this present system, it is feasible for a Deputy not to do his work as a representative or as a legislator and yet to avoid the consequences of that neglect of duty at election time because of the widespread nature of the constituency and because he is required to get only the comparatively small amount of support, which is necessary under the present system, in order to retain this safe seat&mdash;a system which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, exists nowhere else and exists here because it was imposed on us in the belief that it would bring about the situation Deputy Fitzpatrick actually believes desirable, a situation in which government would be impossible.  These safe seats have been created under the present system.  It is only very rarely that Deputies, because of their neglect of duty and falling from grace as a result of that neglect, find it advisable, as Deputy Lindsay said, to migrate to &ldquo;fresh woods and pastures new.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having, first of all, made his case for the present system of multi-member constituencies on the basis that this system gives representation to minority Parties, and having put that forward as the main justification for the continuance of the present system, Deputy Fitzpatrick then went on to point out that this system has not led to big Parties and actually holds this out also as an advantage under the present system.  He wants to have it both ways.  He holds out the fact that the system is designed to give representation to minorities which organise themselves on the basis of their minority interest as an advantage and he also holds out the fact that we have not got splinter groups represented here as an advantage also&mdash;two exact opposites.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked me to give the reasons why we suggest the people should change their system of representation <Col N="589" /> from multi-member to single-member constituencies.  The purpose is to get rid of the many disadvantages and, indeed, the evils of multi-member constituencies.  First of all, I regard the second of Deputy Fitzpatrick's points as being the desirable situation.  It is not desirable that the people should be represented by a large number of small Parties because that type of representation effectively prevents the people from exercising their democratic right of choosing their own government.  It must be admitted on the basis of the arguments put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick that the system we propose of single-member constituencies is much more likely to give rise to election results which will make it feasible for a government to be formed with some prospect of lasting for a reasonable length of time; in other words, the system of single-member constituencies is more conducive to stability in government from election to election than is the present system, which is designed to bring about an indeterminate situation in which the only possible government is a government in which different sections will be always watching for an opportunity to pull the rug from under their colleagues' feet.</P>
    <P>The present system&mdash;we all admit it now&mdash;is designed specifically to encourage the formation of small Parties. I do not think that is desirable.  Instead, people should be encouraged to take a broad view of affairs, to try to appreciate the fact that in these modern times the interests of different sections are interdependent and that it is not in the long-term interests of any one section to ignore the interests of other sections. The people should be encouraged to form themselves into political Parties catering for the community as a whole rather than for narrow sectional interests. One of the main reasons, I think, for asking the people to accept this present system was because it was designed to create conditions in which they, the people, would be prevented from choosing their government.  It is likely to result in inconclusive results. It has all the defects that a somewhat similar system has in other countries, though no system, as Deputy Fitzpatrick <Col N="590" /> says, is as bad as the system we have here.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate the Opposition case; the present system makes it possible for a Coalition Government to be formed.  They have been basing their case on the theory that the only possible alternative to the present Government is a Coalition Government and that because that is so and because this present system is more likely than the proposed system to bring about a situation in which such a Government can be formed after the election, therefore, it would not be fair to change this system.</P>
    <P>In fact, I remember Deputy O'Higgins on Second Stage making the point that the people were entitled to choose a Coalition Government if they liked.  Of course, nobody can deny that.  The people are entitled to choose a Coalition Government if given the opportunity to choose it.  The fact is that although we have had Coalition Governments here the people have never voted for a Coalition Government because prior to this we have never had even an attempt made publicly to form a Coalition before the election. Now there have been, at least, some indications that one, or that some, of the many sections of the Fine Gael Party, desire to form this Coalition before the election and there has been the usual well-known pretence of the Labour Party that they are not prepared to form a Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They prefer to retain the present situation where the Coalition Government would be formed after the people have voted for separate Parties.  The appeal is to keep this system of representation of multi-member constituencies because it is designed to lead to situations in which the only admitted alternative to the <Col N="591" /> Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;a Coalition Government&mdash;would be likely to be feasible.  As I say, I fully agree that the people are entitled to choose a Coalition Government, provided they are given the opportunity to do it and if they are given that opportunity and if they do want a Coalition Government they will have a more effective way of choosing it under the system that we propose than under the present system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick sees the present competition among Deputies, sometimes Deputies of the same Party, in multi-member constituencies as one of the advantages of the present system. Again, that is another point of difference between our view and his view. We, on the other hand, think that the experience here has been that what this competition among Deputies representing the same constituency leads to is bad for public morale generally.  It leads to a belief in corruption.  Competition for the same votes among elected representatives and, as I have said, sometimes elected representatives of the same Parties, has resulted in a more widespread belief that benefits and services provided by legislation in this House are obtainable in accordance with the effectiveness of a public representative's representations rather than by virtue of statutory entitlement to these things.  All Deputies know that that is not so but because of the fact that they are all in competition for the same votes it just is not possible for any Deputy who might like to disabuse the people of this idea to succeed in so doing because in a multi-member constituency there is almost bound to be at least one of the public representatives who will try to create the opposite impression and who will foster this belief in the public mind that representations by political representatives are effective in securing these things provided by the State, which are, in fact, as everybody here knows, administered by public servants in accordance with laws passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, we believe that the establishing of single-seat constituencies instead of the present multi-member <Col N="592" /> constituencies will have the opposite effect and will be good for the morale of the public and will lead to a better atmosphere generally.  We think that the competition for votes which does lead, and has led, to this type of thing in multi-member constituencies is something to be avoided and the avoidance of which is one of the advantages of the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>It must also be obvious to Opposition Parties as well as to everybody else that, in so far as the genuine type of representation that constituents need is concerned, the single-seat constituency will provide better representation of that type because the Deputy who will be elected will have an area of reasonable size to cover; he will be able to know the problems of the area and he will, in fact, be able to look after matters of local importance requiring his attention better and more effectively because of the fact that he will have a smaller area to cover.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there will be more scope for new entrants into public life in the system that we propose.  In the new circumstances proposed there will be 144 separate single-seat constituencies and each Party proposing to form a Government and with a policy to put before the people to form a Government, naturally, will select in each of these constituencies the person whom they deem to be the best possible candidate to put forward their viewpoint and to obtain votes for it and to implement it if elected to the Dáil.  Deputies here know that there is not always that incentive existing at present, that there are bound to be individual Deputies who have not got colleagues in their constituencies and who have not got the incentive to search for the best possible candidate as their colleague on the Party panel at the next election, that, therefore, the present system does not necessarily produce the best possible candidates in every case at election time and that there is a possibility that the quality of representation here in the Dáil may suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I would imagine that if either of the Opposition Parties really aspired to become the Government on their own, they would welcome this <Col N="593" /> opportunity of making a more effective effort to gain a majority because the sole incentive in the whole Party organisation, including the candidate in each constituency, would be to win the seat.  In other words, there would be a complete effort over the whole country to get a majority.  There is always the possibility that there could be some dragging of feet in present conditions.  There would be a continuous new entry of good candidates&mdash; candidates considered good by their own Party organisations&mdash;under the system we propose.  Obviously a candidate who did not do well at an election, did not seem to make any impact, would hardly be likely to be chosen the next time and there would be scope for new candidates.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the system we propose, the elected representative would be isolated in the constituency.  He would not have anybody else to do constituency work for him.  If he did not do his work, he would be more likely to be replaced at the next general election than under the present system where the fact that he does not do his job can be concealed by the fact that some of his colleagues are particularly active.  In this way also there would be a continuous weeding out of Deputies who did not do their job and, therefore, more scope for the election of more effective Deputies. It is quite obvious the people would gain by being more effectively represented, because the Deputies would have more reasonably-sized and more easily manageable areas to cover; they would also gain by evenutally getting more able and effective Deputies in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Under the system of single-seat constituencies, there would surely be less confusion at election time.  It would obviously be possible for the people to make a clearer choice.  In each constituency they would be voting for one candidate representing each of the Parties.  There would not be any scope for second and third Deputies coming in on the votes of particularly popular men, whether it be the Taoiseach in Cork or Deputy Flanagan in Laois-Offaly. There would not be any incentive for Deputies who had become <Col N="594" /> accustomed to bringing in other Deputies on their surplus votes to try and get rid of them.</P>

      <P>Do not worry about Deputy Burke.  If, as in the case of Deputy Flanagan, the candidate whom he brings in with him carries more weight&mdash;probably because of that fact &mdash;at Party meetings and succeeds in swinging the majority opinion in the Party against Deputy Flanagan's opinion, which is to be the effect that this system we are proposing should be brought in, it must be galling to a Deputy such as that to see that, despite the comparative paucity of support his colleague obtains in the constituency, it is the view of that colleague that prevails over the views of those Deputies&mdash;in a minority in the Fine Gael Party&mdash;who really have confidence in the future of the Party and who really do aspire some time to form a Government of their own.</P>
      <P>The question of by-elections is another example of the advantages of the system of single-seat constituencies. It is not a question that has been adverted to very much here.  As I pointed out on the Second Reading of this Bill, when a commission was set up in Great Britain to consider the system of proportional representation and multi-member constituencies, they, being reasonable people, advised against it.  The most important argument they saw against the system was the disproportionate effort and expense that was required at by-elections.  The question of the cost of the proposed amendment of the Constitution has been mentioned here.  It should be quite obvious to Deputies that whatever cost will be involved would in fact be recovered very quickly in the reduced cost of by-elections, possibly within the life-time of one Dáil.  The effort and cost involved in by-elections would be much smaller than under the present system.</P>

      <P>The members own it and the majority are Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with the question of the disproportionate effort and the disproportionate cost involved in by-elections under this ridiculous system we have at present.  I was pointing out that when a commission was set up in Great Britain to consider this system of election they looked upon this as being a decisive argument against adopting any such foolish system as we have here.  Quite obviously, in fact, even in the emaciated form of the system we have a completely disproportionate effort is called for in a by-election where all the Parties in a particular constituency are trying to induce the full electorate of the constituency to go out to elect a fraction of their representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The people already have a certain amount of representation.  They already have two-thirds of their representation in the case of a three-seat constituency, three-quarters in the case of a four-seat constituency, and four-fifths in the case of a five-seat constituency. Naturally enough the incentive for the people to go out and vote at a by-election is not as great when they only have one-fifth, one-fourth or one-third of their representation to elect.  The incentive is not as strong as it would be if they had lost all their representation as a result of the death which caused the by-election.</P>
    <P>Under the system of the single-seat constituency, on the contrary, you would be asking the same people to go out and elect their full representation, and this would apply to one-third or one-fourth or one-fifth of the present representation of the constituency, so that the effort involved from the point of view of the different political Parties would obviously be much smaller. You would have a smaller section of the voters to get out out to vote and they would be going to the polls to elect their full representation rather than a fraction of it as at present.</P>
    <P>Of course the cost&mdash;and I was not referring to the cost to the political Parties, but it does apply&mdash;would be correspondingly smaller.  You would have only the necessary number of polling booths, and so on, and the staffs concerned that would be appropriate to the job in hands to man and finance.  We have had seven by-elections here in the life of this Dáil and the reduced cost of these by-elections alone would certainly go a long way towards covering the cost to the State of this proposed referendum.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there are disadvantages, both as regards representation of the people and as regards the fundamental purpose of the Dáil as the Legislature, involved in multi-member constituencies as such.  There are evils involved.  There are substantial advantages from both points of view to be gained from single-member constituencies as such.  There are disadvantages in the present system which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, exists <Col N="598" /> nowhere else but here&mdash;and that should be some indication in itself that this is not a particularly attractive system to people generally.  These disadvantages are involved in the present system and there are substantial advantages in the system of single-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>Those are the main reasons why we are putting forward this proposal.  We are asking the people to give themselves the normal type of representation, to give themselves the normal type of Legislature, and to give themselves a system which will make it reasonably possible for them to do what is inherent in the principle of democracy, that is, to choose a Government for themselves.  On the basis of the argument put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick the present system is designed to create a situation which will effectively prevent the people from choosing their Government because, if instead of being presented with candidates standing on behalf of broadly-based political Parties, they are to be presented with narrow sectional interests&mdash; and the system is designed as Deputy Fitzpatrick agrees to encourage them to make representation available to these narrow sectional interests&mdash;in those circumstances in which the result will be a number of small sectional groups or individuals, obviously the people will find it impossible because of the situation fostered by this system to choose a Government, and they will be deprived of their democratic right.</P>
    <P>The Government could well be formed only on the basis of whatever bargain it is possible to make after the election.  The policy will never have been put before the people and we will have the same type of unstable situation which we have seen in other countries.  It is because we believe that the people are entitled to an opportunity of avoiding that type of situation, which Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to see, that we have decided to ask the Dáil to give the people the opportunity of providing themselves with a more rational system of representation.</P>

The position is that we have a situation here which has <Col N="600" /> worked well and has given satisfaction. Why, then, does the Minister want to change it?  Why do the Minister and the Government want to change the rules?  I think the people of the country are highly suspicious of the proposal to change the rules for electing people to the Dáil and are quite satisfied that the only reason the Minister wants to do it is to destroy interest in public life in this country and to create here a one-Party State and a one-Party system.</P>
      <P>I say that minority groups&mdash;I said it in my opening remarks&mdash;whether they be religious minorities or political minorities, are entitled to a reasonable chance of getting representation in this House and of putting their views to the people from this House.  I say that is more important now than ever because we have a Government here who do not believe in free speech and who do not believe in giving people an opportunity of putting their views across to the people through the public press and over the national radio and television service.  That is why I say that it is more important than ever that minorities have a reasonable opportunity of coming in here and putting their views before the people instead of being driven underground or into illegal organisations or illegal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to listen to the Minister speak about the cost of by-elections. I came home from the Limerick by-election with one thought predominant in my mind and that was that, whatever the result, democracy had scored a victory.  It had been demonstrated that money and patronage and the activities of Taca stood for nothing.  We are not unconscious of the amount of money spent by the Fianna Fáil Party in the Limerick by-election. Consider the fruits of political patronage, political promises, which brought into that constituency people&mdash;non-professional politicians&mdash; whom we expect to see in these by-elections. Just like the familiar faces one sees at race meetings all over the country, one sees the same familiar faces popping up in these by-elections on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was demonstrated then that money could not buy unlimited votes. <Col N="601" /> It was demonstrated in Limerick that Taca was not supreme.  I think that is a healthy sign.</P>

He speaks as a man who is possibly in a minority in certain parts of his own Party but he has not my experience of being almost invariably a member of a minority.  He said he wants representation for political minorities.  I do not know of any such who are not already represented here. We have a group operating in the country under various names such as Sinn Féin, the Republican Movement and so on.  They seem to be all together.  They regard themselves as a political minority and have made it perfectly clear that they do not intend to seek seats in this House.  What they want to do is upset the whole system of parliamentary democracy as we know it.  That is the sort of political minority that deserves no consideration. I know of no other politically-minded people who form a recognisable minority of any sort.  Granted there are pressure groups in any form of society but I do not feel we should encourage the creation of pressure groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>What we should encourage, and have in fact encouraged, is what the Minister calls broadly-based political Parties.  In a broadly-based political Party, you have a group of people who are in general agreement on major matters of policy.  Certainly, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, you do not get complete unanimity of thinking on every conceivable matter. I believe that anyone who feels he is in a political or religious minority should join a broadly-based political Party and make sure that his own political views are given due weight in the deliberations of that Party.  It does not mean that you must have separate representation for every pressure group.  That is an element of disintegration in society which is most unhealthy and that is the element which has led to such enormous and long-standing political confusion in Europe, this proliferation of political Parties to which any proportional system is only too apt to lead.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has said that there has not been any proliferation of Parties here.  In fact there have been 12 different political Parties represented in this House already and the great danger of a still further increase in the number of political Parties has only been avoided because basically we have remained a two-Party system due to the aftermath of the Civil War.  That is the only thing that saved us from the dangers which have overtaken so many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear the plea that this will lead to minority representation, minority governments and so on.  It is worthwhile to look at the election results so far, from 1923 to 1965, as set out in the Report of the Committee on the Constitution at Annex II.  It is no harm to go back on the results.  In 1923 we had Cumann na nGaedheal forming a Government with only 41 per cent of the seats and 39 per cent of the votes.  In 1927 the same Party formed a Government with only 27.4 per cent of the votes and 30 per cent of the seats, a minority Government getting worse.  In 1927, only a couple of months afterwards, an election <Col N="605" /> rectified the position by returning one Party with 40 per cent of the seats but with only 38.4 per cent of the votes.  There you get government by minority.  It was the same in 1932 when Fianna Fáil formed their first Government with only 48 per cent of the seats.  In 1933, for the first time in ten years, since the formation of the first Dáil one Party secured 50 per cent of the seats.  It went down to 49 per cent in 1937 and in 1938, for the first time, a Party secured a majority in the House.</P>
    <P>The reason we have not had instability is that during those early years in particular we had a number of small groups which could hardly be called Parties which were so glad to get in that they did not want to see a government defeated and face another general election and so they either supported the largest Party or did not oppose it and so they retained their seats.  On to 1943 when a Government was formed with only 48 per cent of the seats; back to a majority in 1944 with 54 per cent of the seats and then on to 1948 and the first inter-Party Government when the largest Party in that Government got only 31 seats and 19 per cent of the votes.  Fianna Fáil could not quite recover the position in 1951 and formed a Government with 47 per cent of the seats.  In 1954 there was a second inter-Party Government when the leading Party of that Government secured only 32 per cent of the votes.</P>
    <P>Since then we had a majority in 1957, not quite 50 per cent, 49 per cent in 1961, and back to 50 per cent in 1965.  But Governments have remained moderately stable for two reasons, basically the old division between the two major Parties and secondly the support, or lack of opposition of the smaller groups and Independents.</P>
    <P>I agree that at the moment there is no danger of instability of government but the moment instability shows itself it is already too late to do anything about it.  That is the point which, above all, we must try to din into the heads of the Opposition.  It is no use saying: &ldquo;It is not dangerous yet.&rdquo;  Immediately it is dangerous, it is impossible to <Col N="606" /> rectify the situation.  I know that some people, particularly on the Opposition Benches say: &ldquo;You are just imagining danger.&rdquo;  You do not have to imagine danger.

      <P>Perhaps in due course somebody would enlighten us as to where they stand with him.  It is most confusing for everyone else.  I regard him as a member of a political minority within a Party, but I do not believe he should be separately represented. I think anyone who holds minority views should go into a broadly-based Party and try to get his views adopted there.  To have separate representation for individual pressure groups with sectional interests is completely against all my ideas of what a proper social policy should be.  As I said on Second Reading, it is no good having people saying that they are going to put up candidates in support of the preservation of the Grand Canal.  The preservation of the Grand Canal is in itself an excellent idea, but you cannot expect those in support of the Grand Canal to have a distinctive policy on social welfare, health services, external affairs, industry and commerce, tourism, posts and telegraphs, and the lot.  To my mind, the only people who have a right to put themselves up as candidates at a general election are the people who are members of a political Party who have a national policy which they propose to put into effect, if and when they are elected a government.</P>
      <P>This stress on representation rather than on the formation of a Government is essentially dangerous.  That is the basic reason why I am in favour of the single-member constituency.  That is something which gives a real chance of the formation of a Government with a coherent policy, a policy which is known in advance, and a policy which, at the end of the Dáil, can be judged on its merits or lack of same.</P>

The answer is he has not been codded; he just happens to be a realistic politician who can see that only by the adoption of single-seat constituencies is there any hope in the foreseeable future of Fine Gael forming a Government on their own, and he is supported by Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Flanagan, Deputy L'Estrange and many more of the Front Bench of Fine Gael, all the people who are actively engaged in political life as distinct from the political amateurs of the back benches. How can that be explained?  If this is a fiendish scheme to keep Fianna Fáil in power, we cannot possibly have codded these men who have been in politics a long time.</P>

      <P>You have taken the point of order, Sir.  The point to which I was going to advert was that this is the National Parliament and Deputy <Col N="614" /> Fitzpatrick's and Deputy Harte's conduct is disgraceful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been obstructed in every conceivable way and it is perfectly clear why, simply because what I say is inconvenient and distressing to those listening but, if any Deputy finds it distressing to hear either live or on the monitor, he is perfectly at liberty to withdraw and I will not feel insulted. When we get these smaller constituencies, it will be much easier for a TD to attend all the meetings he should attend in order to keep in touch with his constituents.  I am a great believer in keeping in touch with all groups in my own constituency, whether they are residents' associations or anything else. It is a very good way of keeping in touch with constituents, finding out what they are thinking and explaining Government policy to them.  That is an essential part of a Deputy's duty and in the present multi-member constituency, it could not be done.  Somebody wants to hold a meeting and wants all the local Deputies to attend but it is extremely difficult to arrange a meeting which all local TDs can attend.  And there will be holy war if some do and some do not.  That causes trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is far better to have one TD representing the area, one TD responsible and one TD to whom every constituent can come.  Deputy Fitzpatrick says it would be intolerable and quite against tradition, and everything else, that a man should have to go to a TD whom he opposed at an election.  That is utter nonsense.  I have been called on by constituents who opposed me.  Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to be of service to them.  I have never had any difficulty and, quite frankly, I do not think they find any difficulty in coming to me.  On the other hand, when people come to me and say: &ldquo;Please, Deputy, I want you to do something for me.  I voted for you at the last election&rdquo;, my first reaction is to say: &ldquo;I do not believe you and, anyway.  I do not give a damn whether you did or not.  All I want to know is if you are a constituent <Col N="615" /> and, if you are a constituent, I do not give a damn who you are or what you are.&rdquo;  That is the way it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not interfere and that is as it should be.  The idea that people are slow to approach TDs because they campaigned or voted against them is unadulterated nonsense. Very often, in a five-member constituency, the constituent will write to all five TDs and say: &ldquo;As a constant supporter of yours, I ask for your support in such-and-such.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I will come to that later.  We will educate Deputy Harte yet.  It is a slow job but we will continue it.  Let us get away from the idea that a Fianna Fáil supporter must go to a Fianna Fáil Deputy and a Fine Gael supporter to a Fine Gael Deputy. That is not the system in any country in the world.  There is no reason why it should be the case here.  It is far better that it should not be so.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with by-elections. The real snag under proportional representation is that, if a Labour Deputy dies, it is impossible to get another Labour TD to succeed him because the balance of voting will be against him.  In a single-seat constituency, if a Labour Deputy dies or retires, there is every probability that a Labour Deputy will be elected to replace him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember a great many things, but the main thing is that in a single-seat constituency, Labour will win a Labour seat.  Unless the Labour Party have done something dreadful in the meantime, they will be able to return another Labour TD in the particular constituency.</P>
      <P>Over the recent series of by-elections that has not, of course, been the pattern because, under PR, the Government have secured all except one. In many ways I think that is unfair, but that is the result because by-elections are fought as mini-general elections.  As the Minister said, a whole constituency is asked to elect a proportion of its representation at one election. It is much fairer, much safer, to have a single-seat constituency when it comes to a by-election.  If the majority in the area support the Labour Party, it will be a Labour Party seat.  If the majority support Fine Gael, it will be a Fine Gael seat.  If the majority support Fianna Fáil, it will be a Fianna Fáil seat.  That does not mean, of course, that the position will be that way forever, but it is far fairer and it does give far better representation. It also gives a far better relationship between constituents and their TDs.  A TD in a single-seat constituency will be in a much closer relationship; he will know his people and they will know him.</P>
      <P>Before I finish, I should like to ask any Deputy of any Party to have a shot at asking a man in the street here in Dublin or in the country what his constituency is, how many TDs has he got and the names of those TDs and where he can get in touch with them.  Some Deputies, including Deputy O'Connell, would be very surprised at the result.</P>

      <P>I am firmly convinced the single seat is the fairest system and I need only look around me here, when important votes are taking place, to see how many Deputies are absent <Col N="617" /> and I know the reason why some of them are absent.</P>
      <P>I have a constituency&mdash;the Lord between me and all harm; I do not know who drew it, but the fellow who drew it must have been 14 days in <i>delirium tremens</i> before doing so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It stretches from Youghal out to the bounds of Kerry.  It amazes me to hear the arguments put up here against changing the present system. For three years before the last general election, I had to travel a very great portion of this strange constituency of mine and I saw what was happening. One of my colleagues, one of the best Deputies who ever sat in this House, Deputy Pat McAuliffe, is missing today. Why?  Because he is trying to cover from Rockchapel to Youghal on his own.  He has to travel the whole constituency by himself in answer to a demand from one parish today and another parish tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I judge on what I see.  The task is impossible.  I have known that for the past 40 years.  In order to make this blooming constituency a five-seat constituency, they had to add a tail to it and stretch it from Youghal out to Rockchapel.  On one occasion I had to stay in Newmarket for a week in order to do my job of representing my constituents.</P>
