    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £49,197,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was discussing certain proposals of the Minister to help mountain sheep farmers.  I said there were extra grants for fencing also for re-seeding and I spoke about the extra subsidy for mountain lambs which has been increased from 10/- to £1.  This was news which was very welcome by the people concerned.  During 1968, mountain sheep made record prices. There can be no denying that.  The only fault such farmers could find was with the price of wool which dropped considerably, but this is governed by the world market and there is not much we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from an area adjacent to the Cork and Kerry hills and we have a number of such farmers.  I had the great pleasure of helping them to form their own organisation.  The Parliamentary Secretary, the late Deputy Davern, came down to Millstreet to meet them. They had been anxious to find out how schemes affecting them worked and the Parliamentary Secretary came to speak and to listen to them.  It is sad now to think that that man is not with us&mdash; a young, energetic man.  He is a great loss not only to our Party but to the country.  His readiness to come down <Col N="2413" /> to meet those people is the complete answer to the allegation that nobody in the Department will meet the farmers.  We had a full, frank discussion at that meeting and the Parliamentary Secretary took away with him a lot of knowledge as a result of which the schemes will work better.  One matter which came up at that meeting was the problem that before the subsidy can be paid on lambs, the animals must be ear-marked and all that.  Prior to then, the venues were arranged very often many miles apart and at that meeting the suggestion was made that the lambs should be marked at each dipping centre.  This was sensible because at those centres there are facilities for rounding up the animals and they can be caught easily.</P>
    <P>There is the matter of Cork Marts taking over International Meat Packers. Cork Marts are one of the best group of marts.  From a very small beginning they have grown from strength to strength and are a very progressive outfit, so progressive that they have undertaken, on a large scale, sale promotion of store cattle throughout England.  This has been a great success and I wish them further success in their new venture which has my personal support and I hope that all those others who have spoken about it will have their names added to the list of shareholders.  It is only right and proper that producers should have some say in regard to marketing.</P>
    <P>As we all know, 1968 has been a record year for beet.  The output per acre will represent a record.  Beet growing was not always popular.  Many years ago a great effort had to be made to get beet grown.  Now it is grown on a large scale.  We are producing too much sugar this year and, therefore, can expect that the acreage will be reduced next year.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the beetgrowers elections were held.  In each of the four factory areas the growers elected 15 members and from the 60 members thus elected formed the BGA Council of 20 members.  I was at the Mallow count.  If the system adopted were adopted in a general election there would be chaos.  None of the candidates&mdash;I am referring to those who <Col N="2414" /> were elected and those who were not elected&mdash;were allowed to see the ballot boxes being opened or the seal being broken or the votes being counted. The result as read out by the returning officer had to be accepted.  You could like it or lump it.  This is bad procedure. It would satisfy everybody if there were someone to examine the boxes or to ensure that the seal had not been broken and that votes were counted in a proper manner.  Everybody would have been satisfied if each candidate had been entitled to nominate one person to carry out this supervision. I hope that in future elections votes will not be counted with such secrecy.</P>
    <P>The 60 men elected selected 20 of their number to form the BGA Council but it now transpires that two others have been added to the council.  Formerly, the BGA had the right to nominate two members on the NFA grain committee and, likewise, the NFA had the right to nominate two members on the BGA malting barley committee. The position now is that two men have been added to the council whose names did not appear on the ballot paper in the election.  In the case of one of these men his name had appeared on the ballot paper three times in the past but he failed to be elected.  He was rejected on each occasion by the growers.  He is now on the BGA Council although not elected by the growers.  A statement should be issued to satisfy the growers.  Many more may be added without the growers being consulted. What was the point in having an election if two or three can be added afterwards, at will, from some other organisation?  The two men who were added are not very small farmers. They have the right to attend meetings of the BGA Council and must be notified of such meetings and have the right to speak at the meetings, although not elected by the growers.  It will ruin the organisation if people can come into it without being democratically elected.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal of plain talk that farmers should vote for farmers and not for politicians and so on but, the farmers having voted for each other, two men were added without the growers having any say in the matter whatsoever.  Views were expressed in <Col N="2415" /> the press and statements were made that the old BGA Council had misappropriated money in one way or another.  I should like to know how the expenses of these two new members will be met?  Will the growers be asked to pay the expenses they incur in travelling to and from meetings or will another organisation pay their expenses for attendance at BGA Council meetings?  This is a very serious matter and I hope the BGA will make an early statement on it.</P>

      <P>It would be very serious if the Dáil were elected and two Members were appointed whose names were not on the ballot paper.  I know that the Deputy does not grow beet. The growers are entitled to elect 60 members.  Now there are 62.</P>

      <P>There are, but they are not entitled to come in the back door.  There is a front door and a back door.  There is a proper method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wheat yield in 1968 has also been a record.  There is a surplus of wheat for our own needs.  The Minister intends to make certain changes in the coming year.  Obviously, he is anxious that there should not be too much wheat grown but that more barley would be produced.  It is clearly desirable that the barley acreage should be increased.  In this way imports of grain could be cut as we could use more barley here at home. The fact has often been stated that we can buy wheat on the world market <Col N="2416" /> much cheaper than we can produce it at home.  If we had adopted that policy our balance of payments would be affected.  The Fianna Fáil Party has always advocated wheat growing.  The people opposite have not.  At one time a member of the Fine Gael Party said that he would not be seen dead in a field of wheat.  I am glad that the farmers have responded and have grown sufficient wheat to meet our own needs and that we are able to use more homegrown wheat in the loaf than ever before.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that pig production is on the upgrade.  The number of sows and pigs has increased during the last 12 months.  Of course, smuggling across the Border continues and is very difficult to prevent.  No matter how well the Border may be protected, there are so many unapproved roads that a certain number will come in.  The point is that the smuggling of pigs upsets the home trade.  The Minister has now suggested to the Pigs and Bacon Commission that there should be a reduction in the weight at which pigs are killed.  This will probably reduced the income of pig fatteners but it is the only way to combat smuggling.</P>
    <P>This year has also seen an increase in the number of grants paid out for farrowed sows, piggeries, and so on. Fattening of pigs by feeding whey and mixed rations should be encouraged, rather than meal ration exclusively.  By this means the cost of fattening can be reduced, in some cases by £2 a head. This is something that I will be asking the Department to pay special attention to.  They should develop fattening by means of whey and investigate means of storing whey.  Experiments are being carried out which I hope will be successful and will have the encouragement of the Department.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is some uneasiness about the availability of shipping for stores and cattle generally to England.  One often reads in the newspapers that at a moment's notice a ship has been taken off the service and I would ask the Minister and his Department to keep an eye on this matter in order to ensure that sufficient shipping space will be available for normal shipping requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2417" /> We have been lucky that to date we have escaped the foot and mouth disease epidemic which scourged England not so long ago and thanks are due to the Minister, his Department and the farmers for co-operating in the measures that were taken to prevent the disease.  However, we must still be on our guard because this is a disease that could hit us at any time and if we experienced it we could lose the American market, something which we could ill afford to lose because it is increasing. If we had just one case of foot and mouth disease we would lose that market for three years.  The Department are aware of this and I would ask them to be very strict in regard to the enforcing of the regulations.  They should have no mercy on anyone who contravenes the regulations.</P>
    <P>In recent times members of the Opposition have been attacking the Minister quite a lot saying that he is arrogant or one thing or another and that he does not want to meet the farmers and talk to them.  We all know that, unfortunately, the position has arisen between some farmers' organisations and the Minister that there is no dialogue or meeting between them while others seem to have no difficulty in this regard.  It is a pity that members of the Opposition have gone out of their way to see that there will be no improvement in this situation.  This is an attitude that I deplore; it is something which should not happen because it is the duty of everybody here to help in this matter and to have normal dialogue, normal relations between the Minister and the farmers' organisations. Of course, we have various members of the Opposition, especially of Fine Gael, throwing the usual mud.  We have had Deputy L'Estrange accusing the Minister of doing all kinds of wrong things. I would say to Deputy L'Estrange or anyone like him that they should always think of the farmers.  I am referring particularly to people who have land to sell and who do their best to sell it outside the Land Commission.  It is Deputy L'Estrange's glee that he got good money for his farm when he sold it to a foreigner.  I think, however, that anybody who has land to sell should have the courage to sell it to Irish <Col N="2418" /> nationals.  The people who sell land to foreigners are those who at by-election times will bemoan the present policy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We all know where Fianna Fáil stand in regard to agriculture.  Their policy is that it should be subsidised, that milk should be subsidised.  Fine Gael, however, in their policy doubt the wisdom of subsidising milk and at the last Fine Gael Ard-Fheis their Leader stated that we spent about £6 per head for every man, woman and child on the subsidisation of milk production and to supply the British housewife with butter at an absolutely uneconomic price.  I would ask their Leader what would they do?  Would they withdraw the subsidies?  If they did they would certainly widen the gap between the income of people engaged in industry and those engaged in agriculture.  When he was addressing the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis on 14th May, 1968 the Fine Gael Leader again dwelt on the fact that there was no place left in Europe now except for the big 400-cow farmer.  The silence of his backbenchers at this statement was amazing, those who are always crying out for the small farmer, yet not a murmur was heard from them on that occasion.  That is now the Fine Gael policy.</P>
    <P>We have a different policy.  The Minister has introduced something for which I have always been fighting, a two-tier price system.  The small farmer cannot survive without being heavily subsidised and all our efforts should be directed to making as many small farms as possible economic units. This Government have been doing that and they have increased the piggeries grants, the farm grants and so on.  Even if a man has not got a large acreage he can still build up an income within his farmyard.</P>
    <P>This year we learned of the death of John Feeley, the President of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association. He is a great loss to agriculture in general.  He was the man who really represented the small farmer.  He was a man who did service in the troubled times and farmers are much poorer for his passing.  In conclusion, I wish the Minister well in his forthcoming visit <Col N="2419" /> to London.  We know that he will have a tough job there and will probably have tough bargaining, but we can feel confident that we are sending the right man who will not let us down.  Despite all the cries of the Opposition that the Minister should resign and so on we in Fianna Fáil are very proud to have him as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  We hope that he will be with us for a long time and we wish him every success in the years to come as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet.</P>

      <P>If a visitor were to take a seat in the Gallery now or if he had happened to enter the Gallery at 10.30 this morning what would his impression be?  He would look down and he would see no member of the Government present and only a few Fianna Fáil Deputies and he would come to the obvious conclusion that we must be dealing with some unimportant, routine business because so little interest was displayed in it.  It certainly would not enter his mind that the discussion taking place was on our major industry.  You can rest assured that he would not think that the industry about which there has been so much uneasiness and in which there has been so much unrest during the past 12 months was now, for one day, being discussed when the responsible Minister was absent and no other Minister present except a junior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Government to this discussion is a gross reflection on this House and the views that are expressed here, when we have not had the courtesy of a member of the Government present for this debate.  Who is codding who? Does everybody not know that in connection with such a vital industry any suggestions that are to be made are likely to be made at Taca dinners or somewhere else and that the views of the elected representatives of the people are not listened to here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a radical change in relation to debating agriculture.  Not only should we debate it in detail once a year on the general Estimate but we should have a sub-committee appointed here representing all Parties in this House to discuss agriculture periodically. The progress of this industry interests everybody, not only the farmer, the man in the rural area, but the man here in Dublin city.  Agriculture needs <Col N="2421" /> a great deal of assistance to keep going and that assistance is given to it by all sections of the people. Therefore, it is not true to say that it is only farmers who should be interested in the debate on agriculture or in agricultural development. Everybody has a greater interest in this industry than in any other. All the taxpayers who have to contribute towards the subventions which it is proposed to make to this industry have an interest in it.  The procedures of this House should be changed, and the place to make a start is in this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am maintaining here is that we should have a sub-committee of this House representing all Parties which would sit regularly and discuss the various aspects of agriculture, particularly the fluctuations in the industry that would arise over the year.  In this debate we are confined&mdash;or those of us who will manage to be accommodated in this relatively short debate&mdash;to discussing agriculture for a matter of 13 or 14 hours, and it is unlikely, unless something unforeseen arises, that we shall have another discussion on agriculture save at Question Time, and everyone knows the limitations of discussing any subject at Question Time.  Is that the way to treat agriculture?  I say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and we in the Labour Party are convinced that radical changes are necessary in relation to this industry, and in relation to the procedure of this House.  I shall not deal further with the second question in view of your statement, Sir, that it is not relevant to a debate on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to labour this point about the sub-committee a little longer&mdash;and I am mindful of the fact that in this debate time is very precious, and I do not want it to stand in the way of other Members who may wish to contribute to this discussion later in the evening.  This annual discussion here contributes very little towards the development of agriculture, particularly when so little attention is paid to it by the Government, which as I have <Col N="2422" /> already stated at the outset of my statement is self-evident.  If we want to see agriculture developing as our main industry we should have established here this sub-committee that would meet periodically, say, monthly, to discuss in an informal way the pros and cons of agriculture then obtaining, and make representations to the Minister and to the Government.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In the course of this statement the Minister has mentioned the setting up of groups, that he is awaiting a report from one group and that another group has made a report which is under examination. That is contained within this document. I am very sorry I am not able just to lay my finger on it at the present time, so that possibly, had the Chair known of the Minister's reference to the establishment of such groups he would have not ruled adversely on my suggestion that a group of Members of the House would be more conductive to formulating recommendations than a group of <Col N="2423" /> civil servants, members of Taca, or any other bodies.  That is the relevance of my statement here.</P>
      <P>I am not reflecting on civil servants at all.  I believe that the elected representatives of this House who meet agriculturalists from day to day are in a much better position to make representations than any group of people across the road here in Merrion Square who are confined to their offices for 11 months of the year, leaving out the month they are at the seaside.  That is not a reflection on these people.</P>

      <P>They are doing the job they are asked to do, but, in my opinion, the job could be done better by representatives of the Party here, and then we would be on the road towards developing agriculture and seeing that the £57 million the Dáil has been asked to approve in this Estimate will be employed to the best advantage.  Somewhere in the Minister's statement there is a reference, and rightly so, to ensuring that this money is put to the best use.  Are the representatives of the people here not better judges in formulating plans than people who, by virtue of their positions, are far removed from the practical side of farming?  Sub-committees are nothing new.  Deputy Esmonde who spoke here last night, and who is a regular contributor to debates on agricultural patterns, is a member of the sub-committee of the Council of Europe, so the Council of Europe has a sub-committee as also have local authorities, county councils and corporations. Why can Dáil Éireann not have a sub-committee?  Why not, in particular, have a sub-committee to make recommendations on agricultural matters?</P>

      <P>I was not listening to what Deputy Tully said but I am sure he said that we should not have a commission of the type that we had in the past year.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the NAC; otherwise I would not have referred to it at all.  The NAC is slowly fading away and is dying a rather peaceful death.</P>

      <P>We do not like to speak ill of the dead but I am sure that could be applied also to the dying and I do not like reminding the Parliamentary Secretary of what the Minister had to say last year about the NAC when he said that it was a healthy, vigorous body; that it was doing outstanding work in forwarding farming interests and he said that we should all look with anticipation to what would be the position in 12 months time when that body would have left its mark on agriculture.  However, this healthy, vigorous body lost itself rather suddenly and has steadily declined as if it were suffering from some kind of a disastrous ailment. Now, I understand that it is actually dead or, as I said earlier, just fading out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making this statement on the NAC, I must make it clear that I am in favour of a council of this type but not a council of the same composition as this one.  What was wrong with the <Col N="2425" /> NAC Council was that it was overloaded with politicians of a one-sided view and, irrespective of their integrity &mdash; and I am not questioning that&mdash;it did not come over well to the general public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry would take me to task if I were to reflect in any way on such an outstanding former Member of this House as Mr. P.D. Lehane of Cork who has been and still is associated with farming associations and farming development.  Why I refer to him is to make it clear that I am not reflecting on the personnel of the council but I am reflecting on the system under which this board was established. The board was dominated by the Minister.  It did not have the confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>We have various documents here and I appreciate one particular document that I have concerning the main activities of the Department.  This document is a very useful one and I compliment those who compiled it.  It is a great advantage to us to get a memorandum of this kind.  We get it from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and from the Department of Transport and Power and, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government will have a look at the document and send us one from his Department because we need it badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The dairying industry is the main industry to be discussed. The changes which are envisaged in that industry could be termed revolutionary.  I had occasion to refer briefly to one of the main changes in the course of a debate here recently on the mini-Budget.  I refer to the changeover from milk and milk production to what is termed &ldquo;the beef incentive scheme&rdquo;.  The farmer the Government want at present does not bother taking his milk to the creamery but lets the calves milk the cows.  He is the man who is considered as a new type of patriot&mdash;one who is providing cattle for export, thereby helping the balance of payments without any cost to the Exchequer by way of subvention. <Col N="2426" /> However, I remember when that type of farmer was derided and when we had accusations from the Government side to the effect that his land should be taken from him and that he should be removed from the agricultural scene.  Now, the wheel has turned and this beef incentive scheme is to encourage farmers at present engaged in the production of milk to change over to the system envisaged by the scheme and, instead of the farmer milking the cows, they will be milked by the calves.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that milk production and the selling of milk products is a problem but down through the years one would not need to have had great foresight or be termed a prophet in any way, to foresee the difficulties that would be brought about.  In 1964 we embarked on the calved-heifer scheme and I know it is an advantage with a scheme of this kind to have hindsight rather than foresight.  I think it is agreed it is responsible for this upper trend in milk production, particularly in north Leinster, Connacht and, I think to some extent, although I am not too conversant with the situation there, in Ulster.</P>
      <P>The dairying industry was confined, to a large extent, to the southern part of this country.  We sold our calves to people in the midlands and everybody was happy and, so far as subsidising milk is concerned, the need did not arise to any great extent.  I remember a time when the milk subsidy was, I am sure, less than £2 million annually.</P>
      <P>Did we make a mistake?  Was this calved heifer scheme soundly based, having regard to what has happened? During the past four or five years, we have seen slumps in the price of calves and in store cattle periodically. Was that due to the fact that our friends in the midlands and north Leinster regions had their own herds by virtue of participating in the scheme and that the actual financial benefits which were got from the scheme, and which are indicated here in the report, were not commensurate with the disadvantages that flowed from the scheme?  It can be and will be said that it has increased our cow population and that, in order to have increased meat, whether on the hoof or processed, for export, we need cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2427" /> Why did we not think about a beef incentive scheme five years ago when we thought of the calved heifer scheme?  If we had a beef incentive scheme at that time I think the position, so far as the taxpayer is concerned&mdash;the man who has to find the money for the subventions asked for in this Estimate&mdash;would be much brighter.  Our milk production would not have reached the heights it has reached.  We must pay the people proper prices for the milk because the farmers are responding to Government demands to increase production.  However, were these demands wise and justified? It would be too much to ask that the Minister and his advisers or that the Government would say: &ldquo;We made a mistake.  Instead of this calved heifer scheme in 1964 we should have thought of a beef incentive scheme&rdquo;. In our view, the Minister and senior executives of the day regard themselves as infallible and would not be expected to own up to any blunders.</P>
    <P>Now, we are told by the Taoiseach that this milk problem is a terrible headache.  He told us it will cost us 1/1d to sell the products of each gallon supplied to creameries.  That statement, to a large extent, is repeated by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. I do not want to go into further detail but I claim that the Government are responsible to a large extent for this blundering system that obtains at present.  I claim that their short-sightedness and their short-term planning is mainly responsible for that position. We now have our farmers with their milk parlours geared for increasing production year after year and producing a commodity which, in the words of the Taoiseach some time ago and of the Minister yesterday, cannot be sold except at a substantial loss.</P>
    <P>I welcome the beef incentive scheme. We are forced to introduce it even though it may be said that such a scheme is unlikely to provide additional agricultural employment.  However, I see no alternative.  I remember a time when, down in my part of the country, a beef bull would not be looked at.  The emphasis was on milk &mdash;the friesian, the shorthorn or some <Col N="2428" /> bull from a mixed strain.  Now the position is reversed.  We do not want any more bulls of that type: we want beef bulls.  We have got very mixed up in our priorities so far as this industry is concerned.  Our top priority four or five years ago was to increase milk production.  That was a mistake. If that industry were left to the Munster farmers&mdash;I am not looking for any special treatment for them&mdash;and if the Leinster and the Connacht people and those in Ulster carried on as they are, then the agricultural situation would be brighter and happier than it is today.</P>
    <P>I have stated here on numerous occasions that the small farming problem is very difficult.  It gets a great deal of lip service in the course of this debate annually and not a whole lot more during the remainder of the year.  I appreciate that it is very difficult to turn bad land into good land. We are trying to do that in some cases under the land rehabilitation scheme, meeting with limited success.  We have a great deal of rocky, mountainous land and we cannot just wave a magic wand and turn it into high productivity.</P>
    <P>The sooner we accept that we have a large percentage of uneconomic holdings&mdash;which are likely to remain so&mdash; the sooner we shall make some beginning in helping the development of smallholders.  Unless we are to weed out numbers and transfer their lands to their neighbours, unless we adopt that policy, which some people think we should adopt, of the Land Commission buying up as many farms as possible and neighbours buying land from their neighbours&mdash;unless we accept that that is the proper way to deal with the smallholders&mdash;we must come to the conclusion that small farming should be only a part-time occupation and we must try to provide some additional industrial activity, within his area, to help the small farmer to supplement his inadequate income from the small farm.</P>
    <P>In some parts of the country&mdash;particularly down in south-west Cork&mdash; some farmers have found an outlet, which has no direct connection with agriculture, namely, the farm holiday scheme.  Many farmers who let their <Col N="2429" /> houses or portion of their dwellings during the past summer seasons got great demand, particularly from continentals and English people.  That scheme has got off to a great start in West Cork.  I believe it will help at least a sizeable percentage of farmers to supplement their farm income and thereby enable them to make a living from their holding plus the additional income accruing from the other industry. If the Minister were present, of course, I should be asking him to bring forward, at Government level, the necessity to make grants available to farmers who engage in this scheme to extend their houses in order that they will be in a position to keep more visitors during the summer season.</P>
    <P>Farming sidelines are important.  Pig production is very important.  There was a time when a great many farmers and many cottiers kept pigs, the farmers in large numbers and the cottiers in small numbers.  There has been a rather peculiar evolution in the pig industry.  Despite pronouncements by the Minister and by various associations from time to time, the pig industry is not improving.  There was a big decline in 1966-67.  At the moment it is showing an upward trend; there has been an increase of five or six per cent in numbers.  We are told that the industry moves in cycles.  If that is correct it is not unreasonable to assume that a downward trend will set in again in the not too distant future.  Why are farmers not keeping more pigs?  I think the answer is because they are not getting a reasonable return.  If pig production were profitable it would not be necessary for anybody to talk about the advisability of keeping pigs in order to keep our factories going and our men in employment in the pig processing industry.  Despite improvements in price over the last few years numbers are not increasing and the only conclusion one can come to is that the increased costs in the price of feeding stuffs, plus other incidental expenses, outweigh the actual improvements in pig prices.</P>
    <P>I would stress the advisability of keeping the pig industry confined as much as possible to smallholders.  Pig rearing should afford a smallholder an opportunity of supplementing his income. <Col N="2430" /> The Government, however, seem to have lost faith in the possibility of smallholders supplying pigs in the quantities demanded because the latest trend is to establish fattening stations&mdash;pig house is obselete&mdash;which will take more than 3,000 pigs at a time.  What will happen?  The pigs will go, as has been repeated so often here, where the hens have gone.  If this trend continues pig production in the not too distant future will be confined to the big fattening stations in the same way as the poultry industry is now confined to a limited number who produce poultry and eggs not in tens or hundreds but in thousands, thereby ensuring that only relatively few people will benefit.</P>
    <P>Incentives have been given but, despite these incentives, we are not achieving the objectives we set before ourselves.  It is, indeed, difficult to understand why we have not been able to take our bacon quota on the British market.  When the quota was established we were agitating for a sharp increase in the quota; we thought it was too small.  We were afraid we would have a great deal of bacon left on our hands.  It is vitally important to have certain industries developed in rural Ireland side by side with pig production.  There must be processing plants for the produce.  I have time and time again stressed the necessity for the establishment of processing plants.  We have a processing plant in Skibbereen for horticultural produce. It is very successful.  It provides farmers with an opportunity of supplementing their incomes.  It provides employment both in the growing of the crops and in the industry itself, useful and gainful employment for men and women.  The prospects for the industry are much brighter today than they were when we were discussing the Estimate for Agriculture in 1967.  The position from the point of view of the marketing of frozen foods is good.  We hope it will continue that way.  There are also processing plants in East Cork, in Mallow and in Midleton and in Deputy Corry's area.  Deputy Corry, indeed, deserves a word of commendation. He was very keen on this policy of establishing processing industries. <Col N="2431" /> It is a sound policy.  It is a policy which is now bearing fruit.  Even outside his own particular area Deputy Corry has given a great deal of assistance. He helped to get the Skibbereen plant off the ground.  I like to give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal briefly with the desirability of increasing the subsidy to islanders engaged in butter production to make such production a reasonably economic project.  That scheme was approved by Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It was a scheme for which I had been agitating for a number of years and I was very grateful when Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, acceded to my request and introduced that much-needed incentive.  It has worked very well.  The cost is quite insignificant.  As there has been no change in the subvention since the scheme was originated, I should like to say to the Department that the time for a change is at hand.</P>

If we get a little more we would take it.</P>
      <P>The problems of small farmers have been referred to in the memorandum submitted to Members of the House by the Chairman of the National Farmers Association.  It is a rather lengthy document but it is one that deserves some consideration.  We must recognise the right of associations like the NFA and the creamery milk suppliers to a voice in the formulation of agricultural policy.  In this Party we have stressed this, amongst other things.  Our agricultural document is, indeed, very substantial and very bulky, and if I were to quote from it at length, and to elaborate on it, it would take more time than I am entitled to, in view of the limitation on the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to commenting on this document. A suggestion is thrown out here so far as small farmers are concerned about which I have been thinking for a long time.  I know it was one that was not likely to catch on too easily, but I am pleased to note that the chairman of the NFA has thrown it out for consideration.  It has to do with group farming.  It is accepted that smallholdings on their own are not economic. It is also accepted that additional incomes are required from outside sources such as farm holiday schemes or small farmers working in some industrial projects in the area, afforestation or some other schemes.</P>
      <P>We should think about group farming. It does not, if you like, do away to any great extent with the independence of individual farmers.  If ten or twelve smallholders join together in working their farms they can alter the farm structure completely.  They can alter the system of farming and possibly get the work done in a much shorter time, and get it done more efficiently. This is one way we see whereby farmers could have weekly hours of work, the same as other sections of the community.  At present, by virtue of the type of work involved farmers, and particularly small farmers who work their farms on their own, have a full time job, seven days of the week.  They must be there to milk the cows on Sunday as well as Monday.  In group farming that would not be necessary and the work on Sundays and other days could be rotated.  This would be a radical change and a radical suggestion, but I think it is worth examining.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested against this that in the case of nine or ten farmers their working capacity would differ and the size of their present holdings would differ possibly in some respects.  It has been asked how could they come together and agree on the sharing of the profits.  I believe it is possible to work these things out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now agreed that accountancy in farming is as essential as it is in any other type of business.  Farmers are becoming more book-minded in so far as the keeping of accounts of their activities and the working out of profit and loss are concerned.</P>
      <P>It is also pleasing to note that educational standards are improving in other sections of the community, and in the farming community as well.  Young farmers today are likely to view from a different angle many aspects of our farming operations, and they may consider obsolete some of the activities of their fathers and those who went before them.  I am not reflecting on those activities but we are living in changing times.  There is now no need for a man to follow a horse and plough, or two horses and a plough.  We are advancing in the provision of mechanical equipment for almost all farming activities so that the operational side of farming has changed, and changed very much.</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour this point further but I am pleased that Mr. Maher has thrown out this suggestion and I think it is one which should be examined.  The Labour Party are favourably disposed towards trying to formulate such a scheme and I am sure that our views are similar to the views of the chairman of the NFA.  We envisage a scheme covering people who are willing participants.  There is no question of forcing anyone into such a scheme but, by pointing out the advantages, and by giving the farmers detailed information of those advantages, we think it is possible to get groups to join together on a voluntary basis to help themselves and to help the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual for me to refer to our trading with the EEC in the debates that arise here from time to time because the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and the present Taoiseach as well, held out hopes from time <Col N="2434" /> to time of the bright future for all sections that lay before us when we entered this kind of heaven of a community of the Six European countries.</P>
    <P>The prospects at the present time are no brighter than they were when Deputy Lemass as Head of the Government first mentioned them in the House.  Judging from what has happened, it is reasonable to assume that if we become members of this community it will not be in the immediate future.  I have stressed in the course of previous debates that we should try to make better bargains with the EEC as it stands.  Why have we this adverse trading balance.  We have had a few explanations, not in any detail, given us by one Minister this year.  Our balances this year follow the usual pattern.  We buy £2 worth of goods from EEC countries for every £1 worth we sell them.  Could those whom we pay to represent us abroad not do any better?</P>
    <P>In actual fact the trend is the same this year again.  We sold £23.7 million worth of goods of one kind or another to the EEC countries and we bought £46.9 million worth of goods. We actually buy £2 worth for every £1 worth we sell.  Why an adverse balance of £22.9 million?  I notice a feature of this and I do not think I am going outside the debate in referring to it.  I am quoting from the Notes of the Main Activities of the Department for the current year sent to us by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, so it is entirely relevant to the debate.  I would prefer if a member of the Government had the courtesy to be present while the Dáil was debating this Estimate so that I could ask him why should we buy £24.6 million worth of goods from West Germany and sell them goods to the value of only £6.7 million.  We have an adverse trade balance with West Germany for 1967 of £17.9 million.  Why should that position exist having regard to the fact that £17.9 million represents almost three times the value of the goods we exported to that country?</P>
    <P>We as Members of this House require explanations for things such as this.  We are asked about them by our citizens.  Anybody who reads this is <Col N="2435" /> likely to come along to any Member of this House, as people do, to get an explanation.  We in turn are supposed to have full details from the appropriate Ministers or from governmental statements.  Why is this system of trading continuing?  We are a relatively small country and having an adverse balance of £22.9 million with the EEC indicates that so far as The Six are concerned, at the present time we are not benefiting from our association with them.</P>
    <P>On exports and imports, in the Minister's statement emphasis is put again and again on the importance of the British market.  He has stressed in almost every page of that document the importance of the British market. I am glad everyone is realising that the British market is so important.  Appendix VI of the Notes on the Main Activities of the Department for 1968-69 states that exports were £200.2 million in 1967 and our imports were £196 million, so that Britain is the country where our trading seems to measure up, where they buy from us as much as we sell them.  I believe that, unless we cannot get the type of goods we buy from such countries in other markets, we should insist if at all possible on countries where we buy certain commodities taking commodities we have in excess, and for export.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay very long on this question.  It is clearly recognised now that the Labour Party in pointing out a few years ago in the course of debates in this House the shortcomings of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement have been proved correct.  We do not take any pride or joy in being proved correct.  We warned the Government all the time that this Agreement needed further discussion.  It needed much closer attention and we said that it was completely out of place when a few days after Christmas this House sat on Little Christmas Day, which never happened since the establishment of the State, to discuss the terms of this Agreement.  It was a hurried document and hurried documents are not produced in the best way.  Unfortunately, we know that is the case in so far as this particular document is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2436" /> We had to face unfair criticism when the deposit charges were imposed by the British Government on Irish goods. We were told&mdash;I forget the exact quotation&mdash;that there were defects in this Agreement, that it needed improvement and that it should be remedied if possible. The Taoiseach as Head of the State went to Britain and got little or no satisfaction.  I claim he did not get satisfaction because this hurried Agreement enabled Britain to act as she did in imposing the deposit charges and they were legally entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of legislation we pass in this House in a hurried fashion, as we did in the case of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  It is only right that we from the Labour benches should again record that our observations on that measure at the time were quite correct and justified.  I am labouring this point now because Labour were accused, particularly by Fianna Fáil, of trying to sabotage the efforts being made by them towards having better and more productive trading relations with Britain.  I hope that, as a result of the visit of our senior officials over the past few days to Britain, something has been won for us and something has been salvaged; but having no statement on the outcome, so far, from the Government we are not in a position to know what has happened. We can only hope for the best. It behoves us in negotiating agreements with other countries in the future to be more careful than we were when we drew up the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>We have had what is known as a bumper harvest this year so far as wheat is concerned.  The Minister said that the wheat crop is phenomenal.  The year 1968 was a good year for wheat. The weather was favourable and the crop was excellent.  The production was higher than expected.  Farmers have reaped a record yield of about 35 cwts to the acre.  But what has happened? Naturally, we should thank the Almighty that the position was so and that the corn crop was such a success. That is only a reasonable thing to do. But how has it affected the consumer? As a result of this phenomenal harvest why has the consumer to pay more <Col N="2437" /> for the loaf of bread?  He has to pay much more for the loaf of bread, which has increased by 3d per loaf.  The taxpayer has to delve into his pocket and find the extra pence.  Is there not something wrong?  Are we forcing farmers to grow quantities of this crop for which we have no market?  We have to sell our wheat surplus, which is of millable quality this year, for animal feed at a loss of £1 million to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Why should we be issuing statements asking agricultural organisations to grow wheat when we know that we have only our own market for a limited supply and that any grown in excess of that quantity is going to be an imposition on the taxpaying public, the shopkeeper, civil servants, the farmers themselves, and the working men and women here in Dublin town or in any other part of the country?  We are told in the Minister's statement that no one could foresee last year that the wheat acreage would increase to such an extent or that the yield would be so high.  Consequently, when the bureaucratic side of the organisation were compiling their statistics, they wrote in a figure of £40,000, I understand, for losses on disposal of wheat.  This £40,000 had to be amended and instead of £40,000 in the Book of Estimates you have £1,040,000.  The calculations which led to that situation were badly thought out.  Do not be fooling with people next year by advising them to produce wheat when only a limited quantity is needed.  Many farmers who grew wheat in response to the Government's request this year would have grown barley or some other crop like beet or replaced it by something else that would be just as profitable to them and not be such an impost on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention that the proposal of Cork Marts to acquire a big interest in the meat packing industry is one that is welcomed by the Labour Party.  We support the idea and we wish it success.  It is a commendable effort.  It is a big matter to raise this money and to take over such a big industry but I am sure, judging by the past performances of Cork Marts Ltd., that they will not be overcome by this <Col N="2438" /> move which they are making at present and that it, too, will succeed in their hands.</P>
    <P>I want at this late stage of my contribution&mdash;I was waiting on the Minister's arrival to say this&mdash;to repeat with as much emphasis as I can the desirability of processing, so far as is possible, products where they are produced. I want to tell the Minister again that, despite statements made again and again that our bacon factories are not working to their maximum extent at the present time and that some of them are working at little more than one half of their potential output, we in south-west Cork, the area which is foremost in the production of pigs, are not satisfied and will not be satisfied, irrespective of what Government is here, until we have our own factory located in the midst of the area which produces 11 per cent of the pigs.</P>
    <P>That is a repetition of the statement I made 12 months ago on this question. Why should we contribute towards adaptation grants for factories in Cork city?  There are no pigs produced in Cork city.  You would not be allowed to produce a pig within a mile of Cork city.  By virtue of the farming activities carried out in the hinterland and in the district contiguous to Cork city, pig production is not carried on to any extent.  Why should the factories be located in the one place?  Why should grants be given to renew or replace the factories in an area where we were told already that the factories were working at little more than one-half of turnover? Why not build that factory in the area where you would be sure of getting your pigs and where you would be sure of getting a turnover irrespective of what size it would be?  I am satisfied you would be assured of getting the numbers required to keep the factories working fully and in the most economical way.  As well as helping pig producers in the area it would give us an opportunity of employment for many of our men and women.</P>
    <P>There is nothing parochial in this outlook.  We have all to judge things on a national basis.  We have to be very careful, if we are doing the job we are sent up here to do, to do it also on a constituency basis and on a local basis. <Col N="2439" /> As a Deputy from south-west Cork I believe it is imperative that I should make this justifiable claim which has been made by farming groups and voluntary organisations down in the constituency from time to time.  It is all very well to be given the excuse that there are many factories in Cork, that the pigs can be fattened down in Schull, Dunmanway, and other places and that if there was a factory there it would keep the Cork factories idle.  I do not grudge the Cork factories expansion and improvement so that they can provide additional employment.  But we have to live ourselves and, consequently, this case being made against the erection of a pig factory in what is the foremost area for pig-production in the country is not just.  We have the tradition there; and undoubtedly the claim to have the processing of pigs there is justifiable.  I want to impress that again on this House.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair of me to delay the House any longer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This industry affects every person in this country, irrespective of his vocation in life.  I consider it wrong that the debate should be compressed into a day or a few hours at the time of the Christmas Recess and that that is the only wideranging discussion to be allowed on agriculture for the next 12 months. That is completely out of place.  I want to recommend as forcibly and as vigorously as I can the desirability of making radical changes so far as the discussion of agriculture in this House is concerned.  I want to assert that we should have a sub-committee of the House to deal with agriculture.  There is no one more entitled to sit on a committee, to advise the Government of the day and the Minister of the day <Col N="2440" /> and to help in formulating agricultural policy than the elected representatives of the people.  It is not out of place to ask that that should be examined by the Minister and by the Government.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Opposition and Government in this country have more or less similar support.  If you combine the Opposition Parties and the Government it is 50-50.  Instead of making this debate one for scoring political kudos, with the Government trying to pick holes in the policy of the Opposition and the Opposition trying to find fault with Government policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My appraisal is an objective and a factual appraisal.  I do not want kudos.  I think that is no way to do business.  I believe that more benefits would accrue from sitting around a table with men like my neighbour, Deputy Corry, on a sub-committee. I would not confine the sub-committee to farmers.  As I said, I am of the opinion that non-farming interests are entitled to have a hand in farm policy and to ascertain if the money they pay by way of taxation is being used to the best advantage.  They could join the group I spoke of.  I think such people&mdash;and I take Deputy Corry, since he interjected in the debate, as one such person&mdash;sitting down around a table and discussing the various subheads would be a much better idea.</P>
      <P>I did not take up this book or deal with the various subheads here because to go through the various subheads in detail would take up too much time in a debate like this, but all these subheads could be examined in detail by a committee.  I consider that more useful work would flow from that committee than from this debate.  That committee would be a much more business-like operation than the type of discussion we have had in the past on this Estimate.  That is why I strongly support the formation of such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that I want to make it clear that I am not taking away from farming organisations in any way.  The members of farming organisations, like members of labour organisations, are entitled to get together to form unions <Col N="2441" /> or associations to make their case to those who have a function in determining agricultural policy, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. It is no pleasure to anybody in a relatively small country, with less than 3,000,000 of a population, to see such a division existing among those who are supposed to have the interests of agricultural development at heart.  I do not think any person here, irrespective of which side of the House he is on, is pleased that such should be the position. We are small enough and we have problems enough to try to get a better spirit of co-operation in dealing with such an important industry, a better spirit of co-operation between the Government, the Minister and the farming organisations.  There is room for the constructive efforts of everybody to develop this industry, to ensure that the people engaged in it get justice and get reasonable incomes and to ensure that the money given to the industry by the tax-paying public is employed in the best way possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy is a rural Deputy like myself and represents people who live and work pretty much like the people I represent.  He has gone very thoroughly into this whole question of agriculture and into the Minister's speech.  I appreciate that the Minister's speech is useful and also the other document which explains the various activities of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, if one had time to read and study them.  I must admit I do not always find the time, in spite of my best efforts.  With all the documentation that is flowing today from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, semi-State bodies and other places, it is not always possible to find time to study everything.  Deputy Murphy referred to the fact that the Minister was not in the House and he was a bit critical of the number of Deputies in the House this morning. He seems to forget that we are working in new time.  We are an hour ahead. We all find it a little bit difficult this year to get up in the dark of the morning and turn out.  We are not accustomed to it yet.  On this occasion I would be inclined to excuse the Minister and the Members of the House for being a little bit late because it is <Col N="2442" /> due to this new time.  We are all finding that problem.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's speech he pointed out that the present year was a boom year, that it was a year of great progress in agriculture. He stressed the increases in production under various heads, particularly such items as grain&mdash;an increased production of wheat and of other grain crops.  Most Deputies would agree that that was due, in the main, to the exceptionally fine year we had.  As other Deputies said, we should thank God for that.  He went on to stress that the farming community, the people engaged in agriculture, have got increased incomes as a result of this increased production.  It is true to say that many people, particularly farmers who have economic holdings of land and who have a sufficiency of capital, have had a very good year of it.  As a matter of fact, it is also true to say down through the years, generally speaking, people with economic holdings and farmers who minded their business and were reasonably lucky in their undertakings could make a reasonably good living.  But it should be borne in mind that we in the West of Ireland particularly, and in areas like south-west Cork where Deputy Murphy comes from, have a problem which is much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is a bumper year and a good year, the people in those areas gain very little from it because they have not the land or the resources to gain from such factors as an improvement in the weather, an improvement in prices or anything else.  Our people are always labouring at a disadvantage because of the smallness of their holdings.  It is quite true to say, as anybody who reads this document must be convinced, that people in such areas stand to gain very little from this Vote for Agriculture.  It is true that the amount of money is increased, but it will not reach the small farmers in the West of Ireland to the extent it will reach farmers in other parts of the country whose holdings are larger and whose resources are greater.  Therefore, I want to make the point that our people in the West of Ireland will still continue to emigrate, will still continue <Col N="2443" /> to go to England, as they have done down through the years.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that roughly 10,000 people leave the land every year.  There is a continuous drain from the rural areas to the built-up areas even in this country and on a much larger scale across to England.  Deputy John Fanning, when speaking here last night, pointed out that one of the problems Irish Agriculture is faced with is the problem of providing labour on reasonably large holdings of land.  We all know even small farmers must employ a certain amount of labour at certain times of the year, if they can get it. We have in this country at the present, as they have in other European countries and other parts of the world, the 40-hour week.  The county council worker, the teacher, the civil servant, all those people finish work on Friday night.  The farmer has not finished on Friday night.  He must continue to work Saturday morning, Saturday night, Sunday morning and Sunday night.  We know there is considerable unrest at present and for some years past because of the fact that a person engaged in other activities can have his 40-hour week while the farmer must work seven days of the week and very often 15 and 18 hours a day.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why we have such a drain from the land.  I do not know exactly how we are going to solve this problem, but this I do know: it is having serious adverse effects on production from agricultural land.  Because of the fact that so many of our young people are leaving the land, we find the situation today that it is nearly impossible for any farmer to engage in tillage activity particularly.  In olden days, and up until some years ago, even in the west of Ireland, as is also true of other mountainous regions, small farmers engaged in quite a lot of tillage activity.  Today, with the increase in wages, and now that time has become more valuable, we find that it is no longer possible to engage in putting in reasonably big acreages of tillage.  The majority of the people in those small holdings have now turned to grazing a few cattle or sheep, rearing them up to the store beef stage and then selling them to somebody <Col N="2444" /> from the eastern counties&mdash;from Westmeath, Meath or other parts of the country where the land is able to carry such type of animal&mdash;who is able to sell them off for beef for the export trade.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said here this morning that it was a serious loss to the small farmer that he had to sell the store beast one and a half years and two years old.  I agree with that line of thought.  It is the man who takes over that beast for the three months or the six months who has the real profit and that profit is at the expense of the poorer man from the small holding.  It is no wonder, therefore, it is from the west of Ireland and from the mountainous regions that the majority of those 10,000 people who leave the land every year come, and that you have so many derelict holdings in such regions at present.</P>
    <P>We also labour under the disadvantage of high freight charges in such regions.  You have very little export from ports like Ballina, Sligo and Galway, which in the past were used in a big way for the export of farm produce.  These ports should be utilised much more in an endeavour to bring about a reduction in trade charges on incoming goods and on goods being exported.  It is true that farmers in those remote areas are faced with heavy additional charges and, as I have said, they have to labour under that disadvantage. They have to sell their store beasts to individuals who can fatten them in a hurry at great advantage in a short period.  While such disadvantages are suffered in the West, the flight from the land will continue as it has done during many years past.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest it will be necessary for the State to subsidise transport into and out of such regions.  I appeal to the Minister to go into the whole matter realising the disadvantages those people labour under in the matter of freight charges generally, realising that those farmers have to carry that additional burden.  As a result, I hope the Minister will do something to subsidise freight charges into and out of such areas because at the moment they are competing with other farmers at a serious disadvantage on that one item.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2445" /> I do not think the seed potato scheme has been mentioned during this debate so far.  In North Mayo, and indeed in other parts of the county, people in the past engaged in the production of seed potatoes suitable for the requirements of farmers in other parts of the country.  As well, they had a lucrative market in some European countries.  Those who engaged in that type of farming had to conform to the highest standards.  Their lands were suitable for the purpose of seed potato growing.  They were under keen inspection by Department inspectors.  If it became known that any individual farmer who engaged in that activity had committed any offence in the way of mixing another variety with his main crop, he was immediately struck off the list; his produce would not be accepted anywhere and in all probability he would never again be recognised by the Department.  Such tight regulations were necessary, as we all know.  It is imperative that people of repute are engaged in this activity so that only top quality produce would be sold in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other that industry also has been declining.  I have said it was operated in my county and it was also carried out in counties like Sligo and Donegal and was a valuable sideline for the small farmers who engaged in it.  I am convinced that, due to some mishandling along the line, whether caused by strikes and other difficulties at the ports, the farmers over a period of a few years suffered losses on their sales of seed potatoes.  They were forced to sell some of these potatoes to the Corroy alcohol factory, which is now a glucose factory, at prices as low as £4 or £5 per ton.  This was a serious loss to those people.</P>
    <P>Having been a member of Mayo County Committee of Agriculture for a long number of years, I and my colleagues on that committee appealed to the Department to come to the rescue and subsidise these people in a crisis year.  They ignored our appeals and said that money could not be provided for such a purpose; in fact, they told us we were lucky to have the Corroy factory to take the potatoes and to give them anything for them.  Those farmers who had <Col N="2446" /> difficulty in disposing of their crop got out of that business, and this valuable sideline in the west of Ireland is going to the wall as other good sidelines have already gone.  That is a pity and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of the day, no matter who he is or from which side of the House he comes, should be alert and awake to these possibilities and should not allow a good industry like this, which is valuable not alone from the point of view of providing reliable seed potatoes for farmers within the country but also for the export market, to go to the wall.  Unfortunately, as I have already said, it is going to the wall.</P>
    <P>Much more could be done to increase production of sheep and lambs in the mountainous western regions.  I am convinced that much could be done to improve the quality of the herbage on these mountainsides with liming and fertilisation.  I believe that an improvement could be brought about in the quality of the herbage and I do not think these matters are getting sufficient attention.  It is true that we have agricultural instructors going around giving lectures.  They are stressing the importance of going into more and more sheep-farming and of increasing our activities in that respect.</P>
    <P>The proper steps are not being taken to utilise the resources available. Grants have been made for fencing in mountain regions where agreement was reached with the co-holders as to the areas each individual would fence and I believe that has been a success in some areas.  The problem is not being tackled on the large scale that is possible. There are still thousands of acres of mountain land that could be usefully developed if lime were applied.  Even if the lime had to be spread by helicopter, the result would justify the trouble in the improvement of the quality of the herbage for sheep and cattle because in many instances cattle as well as sheep graze there at some periods of the year.  While the situation is allowed to continue that the Department do not take sufficient interest in these matters and do not encourage people to take advantage of these schemes, the industry will be slow to expand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2447" /> In the course of his speech the Minister did not refer to the sheep experimental station in Creagh, in Ballinrobe, although he has referred to it in another document.  In my view it is worthy of mention in his speech introducing the Estimate.  This is an industry that could be expanded and developed, hand-in-hand with the store cattle trade for which there seems to be some future.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister to the interest being taken in the schemes with regard to pigs, sheep and oats which were initiated by the Minister. I have pointed out that the scheme for the improvement of sheep has not progressed and will not progress while things continue in the doldrums.</P>
    <P>It is well known that pig production is a declining industry in the west of Ireland.  The old methods have disappeared. As Deputy Michael Pat Murphy said the day of the old pigsty is gone.  One does not find now a farmer producing two, three or four pigs every three months, with the possible exception of a small cottier who does this as a sideline.  It cannot be suggested that there is any hope for the individual who is producing small numbers of pigs.  This is the day of the big unit and the fattening station.  There is a pig station located at Balla, County Mayo, which expects to be going into production at a fairly early date.  I should like to think that the venture will be successful.  I wish it well and have given it every possible support. I have encouraged farmers to invest in it.  It is of paramount importance that that venture should be successful.</P>
    <P>In that region there are bacon factories at Castlebar, Claremorris, Ballaghaderreen and in Sligo.  The pig station is approximately half-way between Castlebar and Claremorris. Apart from the benefits to the farming community in the area, there is valuable employment created in the meat processing business in both of these towns which is availed of by people in the town and the rural areas.  There is a good deal of male labour employed in the meat processing industry.  We in Mayo claim to be first in the field in <Col N="2448" /> that type of industry.  For about 20 or 25 years the bacon factories and meat processing factories have been engaged in canning and have exported their products to England, Europe and the USA.  Telephone calls are made from these towns to Amsterdam and various European countries and to the USA in regard to business deals involving large quantities of their products.  This is a very important industry.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the pig fattening station at Balla will have the effect of increasing production of pigs and the supply of raw materials essential for the processing factories in Mayo. It would be too bad if, after all the money that has been spent in developing these factories, the workers had to be laid off.  That is one of the worst things that could happen.  Not alone have the factories engaged in the processing of pig meats but poor quality reject cows and bulls and animals suitable for canning have found their way to the factory and have attracted a price twice the price that they would fetch if sold for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years there have been unstable prices for agricultural produce.  I suppose that situation will continue despite the best efforts of the Minister and his staff which, I may say in passing, I regard as a competent staff.  They are very competent not only in the offices in Dublin but in their work throughout the country.  I know this because I had dealings with them particularly in times gone by as an exporter and I know the value of their work.  It is easy to be critical but I value the services of the men and women working for the Department.  If it is at all possible they should be better remunerated for the great service they give.</P>
    <P>I know that unstable prices are a problem and I am sure the Minister is doing his best to find markets in other countries.  The bulk of our surplus produce must go to England for whatever the ruling prices are.  While through the different trade agreements, such as the Deputy Dillon trade agreement of 1948 and later agreements, we have succeeded in getting more stability, it is still true that due to the uncertain position in Europe and the uncertain position regarding <Col N="2449" /> our application for membership of the EEC we must continue to export most of our produce to England, which, of course, is an industrial country.  In my opinion Irish agriculture is pretty well at the crossroads and this must be a cause of anxiety to the Minister and to all of us.  We have seen the warning signs and we should take note of them.  The British Minister for Agriculture has told the English farmers that he is prepared to subsidise them more heavily so that they can produce more for the home market.  This is a challenge to us and we should read the writing on the wall.  It behoves all of us, particularly the Minister, to be on the alert.</P>
    <P>People criticised the Taoiseach when he went to England recently and came back, as they said, with nothing, but I felt it was his place to go and I am still convinced that it was his duty to have gone and it is his duty, as well as the duty of the Minister, to go there when our position is threatened in any way.  I hope that the clouds which I see on the horizon will clear away.  As Deputy Murphy said, it is important for all of us that agriculture should be prosperous, but these challenges do exist.  The British farmers have a market for their produce on the spot and their Government can afford to subsidise the farmers heavily because, after all, it is all internal spending, money spent at home.  They can argue that this will help to correct their trade balance. They have plenty of problems at the moment and, indeed, the £ is again in the doldrums and at a &ldquo;new low&rdquo;.  All this added up means that we as one of their principal suppliers of agricultural produce must keep on the ball and, above all else, try to keep down our production costs and improve our marketing methods.  The day has gone when you could put something into a sack, bring it to the dockside and have it shipped to England.  Now it must go in a package with brand names on it and so on.  The old standards were all right for the days when the British were starving, when foodstuffs were rationed and when they could not get enough to eat.  Those days have gone.  Now they are having <Col N="2450" /> cheese and butter dumped on them from various parts of the world and we must wake up and get down to the task of improving our marketing systems, to give them the best we possibly can with a greater use of brand names&mdash;such as Kerry Gold butter&mdash; and try to get right through to the consumer, the houswife in particular, in regard to providing good quality articles.  No matter what impositions or duties the British may put on we will regain some of the ground we have lost if we do this.  The Department should try to impress on the people the need for improving our marketing methods, our packaging and our greater reliance on brand names.</P>
    <P>In regard to the west of Ireland, it is a cause of concern to many to see the finest of our people leaving the land.  I know that small, uneconomic holdings of £5 or £10 valuation are pretty well out in the matter of competing with the bigger units.  There are, too, people with more favoured locations, people who are nearer the docks, people in Meath or County Westmeath, or people near Cork harbour, who can unload their produce there and have it transported to the British market quickly.  Whatever the solution may be for saving these people they are going from the land and will continue to go.  In the main last year was a good year for farmers generally but people in the west of Ireland and in many mountainous regions gained very little from the improved returns because they had so little in the way of crops, cattle or sheep.  There must be a reappraisal of the whole situation.  The position could be treated as an emergency by the Government and the Department before more of our people leave the land.  The Minister and some of his staff should visit the west of Ireland to examine the position and, if possible, try to find some remedy, some special treatment to get these people off the ground.  If these people go to a bank or to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for money and state that they are farmers with a £7, £8 or £10 valuation, or for that matter a £20 valuation, the bank or the corporation <Col N="2451" /> is not prepared to advance money to them because they feel that the risk is too great and that they might not recover the money lent.  A lot of our people have become accustomed to using motor cars and in rural areas the motor car is essential. The day of the push bicycle has pretty well gone and if our young people cannot have a motor car or an autocycle or some rapid means of transport they will go somewhere else, they will go to England.  We cannot afford to lose any more of our people.  A figure of 10,000 a year has been quoted in respect of those leaving the land, and the majority of those are from the west of Ireland.  I would ask the Minister to regard this as an emergency. An emergency such as this needs emergency treatment, and that is what I am asking the Minister to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Arguments have been put up here again on what was supposed to be a dispute with the farmers. There has been, over the past number of years, a fight going on between farmers who pretend to represent everything in farming and the ordinary representative of the producer of any particular farm commodity, the beet-grower, the creamery milk supplier, and others.  That is the root of this whole problem.  I remember, as a member of the Beetgrowers' Association, having each year not alone to deal with beet but to meet the millers on the price of wheat, to meet Messrs Arthur Guinness &amp; Co on the price of malting barley, and then to meet the Minister on one thing only, namely, feeding barley.</P>
      <P>Satisfactory negotiations were held with the Government each year except in one instance.  There came an occasion when the then Minister made an appointment to meet us on a Thursday evening.  At that meeting when we put up our arguments on the price of feeding barley we were told: &ldquo;Oh, there was another farmers' organisation in here with me last Tuesday.  They were responsible men; they were sensible men, not like you fellows.&rdquo;  As a result, the price the farmers were getting for feeding barley was cut by 8s a barrel that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> Rather than have two or three different farmers' organisations at the disposal of the Minister to be used as playthings by him, one against the other, a conference was held in Buswell's Hotel at which we handed over wheat and feeding barley to the NFA. I shall not deal with the manner in which they operated, except to say this. I have grown wheat on my land ever since 1914.  I grew no wheat for the last five years because the price has been bedevilled by the NFA on the one side and the millers on the other.  It was not until the agricultural committee of the Fianna Fáil Party met the Minister and straightened out the position on wheat that wheat has been made a profitable crop again.  I make no bones about that.  As time went on the fight became keener and we saw the result of it during the past few years.  There is very little use in anyone pretending that that fight is between the farmer and the Government. It is a fight among certain individuals seeking power, and nothing else, and they do not care what they make the farming community suffer while they are at it.</P>
    <P>Over the past 34 years we have been negotiating each year on the price of beet.  For a long time the negotiations were carried out by civil servants who were in charge of the Sugar Company. There was a change when Lieutenant-General Costello took over, and after the first year of negotiations we hammered out what is and should be the farmers' charter of freedom, namely, that the price of the farmers' product be based on the cost of production of that product plus a fair profit.  That agreement was reached in 1947 at a cost of £4,000 to the Sugar Company and £2,000 to the Beetgrowers' Association.  On that basis the price of beet was fixed every year from 1948 to 1965.</P>
    <P>In 1965 there was a change, and Lieutenant-General Costello came to me and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know you are entitled to an increase, but unless I get an increase in the price of sugar you cannot get it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggested that he come with me to the Minister, but he refused.  I told him <Col N="2453" /> he would have to do so, but it took a six weeks' strike on the part of the farmers to get what we were entitled to, 5/3d per ton increase in the price of beet.  This is one of the men who, to the joy of Deputy Murphy, complained of the Minister's appointment on the National Agricultural Council.  That man, who has a following here, entered into an agreement with us.  He said there was no money for either the farmers or the workers.  I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very well, we will sign for the present price of beet for the coming year on condition that you sign an agreement with us that any increase that you would give the workers during the next 12 months would also go to the farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He agreed on that.  He even agreed on 8/9d a turn and we gave him a reduction of 2/1d off the 8/9d.  He was a man who honoured an agreement.  Two years ago he paid us 6/8d a turn under the agreement, which was more than the price we had contracted for.  The following year there was a new General Manager who, after a bit of a row, paid us 3/- a turn.  That was the last year of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I know that the Irish Sugar Company have turned quite a number of corners this year and that they have arrived at a profit of £780,000.  There is about 10/-a turn, or nearly £500,000 due to the Irish farmer on the crop delivered to the factory.  I know that I gave them a scourging during the week on the quarter cwt of pulp that they had after 34 years, on the plea that there was not sufficient pulp from beet to enable the farmer to get the 1¾ cwt.  I referred to my little bible&mdash;the one to which I referred here the other day&mdash;and I established that the farmers' quota of pulp was cut by ¼ cwt, that being done on the plea that they could not get the 1¾ cwts out of the beet.  Forty-three cwts of beet pulp were exported for which £45,403 was obtained in the first seven months of this year.  I got these figures from the trade and shipping statistics for January to July of this year and anyone who wishes to read them for himself will find them on page 32 of the Journal under the heading &ldquo;Domestic Exports&rdquo;.  I know that there was a certain amount of collusion and <Col N="2454" /> I know that it paid them well and that it paid the Sugar Company well to get rid of the representatives that the beetgrowers had.  One would do a lot of manoeuvring to get £½ million and that is the amount that is due to the Irish farmers.  This money has been taken from the Irish farmers through the collusion between the beetgrowers and the Sugar Company.  I am stating this openly and they can make excuses later if they wish.</P>
    <P>In connection with an article published in the <i>Sunday Press</i> about six weeks ago, I again looked up this journal and I found we imported into this country during the first seven months of this year a total of 41,621 tons of foreign sugar costing £866,000 and then we hear a cry about our adverse balance of payments.  I should like the Minister, as the representative of the farmers, to investigate this matter very closely.</P>
    <P>How many subsidies are they drawing? Are they drawing one subsidy on cheap sugar and another subsidy on cheap milk at the expense of the Irish farmer and the Irish taxpayer?  This is what I want the Minister to find out.  I remember the Government setting their face against the production of beet or, at least, against the prices paid for it and when there was a curtailment of the acreage of beet and we found ourselves having to import 75,000 tons of foreign sugar.  That sugar was brought into this country at a cost of £12 a ton more than the price paid for the best white sugar leaving any Irish factory.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts and I was surprised to hear Deputy Murphy sneering at the representatives appointed by the Minister to serve on the National Agricultural Council.  Is there any man in this country today who, if he were asked to pick a man to represent Irish agriculture and its advancement, would not pick Lieutenant-General M.J. Costello?  Deputy Murphy knows it.  He knows also that he went down to his own constituency and in the town of Skibbereen, started an industry and found employment there for the boys and girls of whom he was boasting a while ago.  How many thousands of men did this man put into employment in this country not alone in the beet <Col N="2455" /> industry, which was fizzling out when he took over, but in the vegetable and processing industries as well?</P>
    <P>When I looked around me for a man who could and would be of assistance on any negotiating team when we were dealing with a pretty difficult team in the Sugar Company's negotiations, I took another man who had been selected by Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and that was Mr. P.D. Lehane.  Those are men who, we are told, were picked for political reasons.  Mr. P.D. Lehane was a Member of this House for seven or eight years and he always religiously voted against Fianna Fáil while he was in the House.  He is a man who, we were told, was picked for political reasons and put in.  He also was secretary of the Cork Farmers' Union and there were several representatives of that farmers' organisation on the Cork County Council.  Those are the men in respect of whom the Minister was pilloried and attacked because he had put them in there as his advisers.  I could pick as good a team of farmers out of the Fianna Fáil representatives in this House as one would find in any farmers' organisation.  If you want an all-round organisation then do as Deputy Murphy says: pick them out of the elected representatives here&mdash; men who can advise any Government or any body on the policy that should be adopted in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Honestly, I do not know what to do with Deputy Murphy and Deputy O'Hara.  Two years ago, I went to Tuam, on the borders of Deputy O'Hara's constituency, to purchase some of the potato processing machinery, that was lying idle there, for these Cork foods.  I went out and examined it.  What did I find?  Deputy O'Hara complained about the transport charges.  I found that the potatoes for the Tuam factory had to come from County Louth.  In God's name, if the farmers of the West cannot grow everything, surely to God they can grow spuds?  There is no reason why a vegetable-processing factory should not have, all around it in the surrounding counties, a prosperous lot of farmers producing the material for it. Deputy Murphy knows that the self-same <Col N="2456" /> thing applies to his factory in Skibbereen.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is wrong with those smallholders of the West about whom we hear all the noise.  The same year, Lieutenant-General Costello put two factories going in Cork county.  He put the Skibbereen factory going and he put one in Midleton.  They were both put going in the same year with the same amount of money, namely, a contribution from the Sugar Company in each case of £30,000 and £30,000 that the farmers collected and put up against it.</P>
    <P>Our factory in East Cork, in Midleton, paid the first year £17,000 in wages and about £15,000 to the farmers. This is its fifth year of production. This year, it has paid to the farmers for the crops produced and processed by them a sum of £300,000 and, for this year, the wages bill is £210,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy or somebody from West Cork got up and told us the position in regard to the Skibbereen factory. There is no good in pretending that we are growing something which you cannot grow.  Deputy Murphy comes from a constituency that is ideally situated for the growing of carrots.  However, last year, in the middle of our growing season, we had a rush from Erin Foods, Limited, that Skibbereen had fallen down and we had to grow extra in our own area of East Cork.  On that basis we grew, this year, something like 2,250 acres of peas for the factory which gave a net average profit to the farmers of £60, everything paid.  We went to an average of 4½ tons or £135 an acre.</P>
    <P>Let me point this out to Deputy Murphy.  The average tonnage of carrots grown for the Carlow and Mallow factories up to the time we started was nine tons per acre.  For the past two years, we have been producing anywhere from 16 to 21½ tons of carrots per acre.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy's little 25-acre farmer has had a factory put in by General Costello at his door and on five acres of carrots&mdash;that is on one-fifth of his farm&mdash;he will have a growth of 1,100 lbs.  These opportunities are there at the door of every farmer.  Why cannot the farmers take advantage of <Col N="2457" /> them?  Why is it that you find such a wide divergence between two factories established in the same year on the very same basis?  It is bad enough to see, as I did in Tuam, potatoes from Tipperary and Louth going into this factory in the West but, worse than that, I saw what we call &ldquo;spoiled potatoes&rdquo; taken out of the factory and thrown into a manure heap, potatoes for which the farmers in East Cork would give their two eyes if they had them for feed for cattle and pigs.  In the name of God, are we ever going to help ourselves?  I suggest we have to do a great deal of helping ourselves.</P>
    <P>I heard a complaint voiced about wheat.  Here is the position with regard to wheat.  As the Minister stated, we had the finest harvest this year than we had for many years past.  Our grain crops were harvested in tip-top condition. Is there any co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Industry and Commerce?  From January to July of this year 3,382,663 cwts of foreign wheat were imported into this country at a cost of £4,735,000.  That represents an increase of 54,000 tons of foreign wheat over the same period in 1967 and an increase in our adverse balance of £1,646,000.  I am reminded of the time when the brewers tried the same little game.  When we started in with our malting barley we found the malthouses could take the barley in for only a week and they would then close down.  They issued a notice, after being closed down for a fortnight, to the effect that, rather than disappoint their farmer friends, they would now accept malting barley at 50s.  The price we had agreed was 57s 6d.  I remember on behalf of the farmers of East Cork, having to pursue these bucks into the High Court where I got them decreed for the 7s 6d they were trying to rob from the farmer.  I should like the Minister to find out from his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the justification for importing in the first six months of this year an extra 54,000 tons of wheat adding £1,646,000 to our adverse trade balance.  These are illuminating figures.  These are the figures, plus the £800,000 paid for the extra sugar and the money paid for the imported ladies' clothing which are <Col N="2458" /> responsible for the Budget we had here a fortnight ago.  I have to give the facts as I know them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy complained about milk.  Now the in-calf heifer scheme was not brought in for the purpose of increasing the quantity of milk.  It was brought in to increase the number of cattle, particularly cattle for export. Advantage was taken of it.  The farmer who had 20 cows found that, if he put in 20 more, he would draw £15 a head from the Minister in respect of each of the 20.  He put in 20 more cows and he then found that he had not room for the calves he used to rear and the other livestock he kept because he was carrying 40 instead of 20 cows. Accordingly, the dropped calf was hunted off to the mart and we had the spectacle of these being flown to Spain from the Cork marts or being shot over the Border for Mr. O'Neill's subsidy.</P>
    <P>Again, we find in relation to the £15 subsidy for the in-calf heifer, that the gentlemen who drew the benefit of it were not the Irish farmers&mdash;or the Irish Government in having more cattle for export&mdash;but Mr. Craig's Orangemen in the North.  These are the bitter facts and there is no one in this House who does not know that as well as I do. The calves are dropped and then a row arises because the farmers have skimmed milk and nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputy Murphy to read Dr. Scully's report on the pilot area in West Cork.  We should read it and see what the farmers in West Cork are doing.  If he does he will be able to talk much more sensibly here on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the speech just made by my colleague from North East Cork, Deputy Corry, and say I do not think there was any necessity for some of the inflammatory remarks he made in the opening part of the address with regard to farmers organisations. &ldquo;Inflammatory remarks&rdquo; are the only words in which I can describe them.  In only one paragraph at the end of his speech did the Minister refer to Government-farmer relations, or Minister-farmer relations. I want to appeal today in a mild, <Col N="2459" /> quiet, calm way to the Minister to take another look at Minister-farmer relations or Minister-farmer organisation relations.</P>
      <P>I know that if I refer to Captain O'Neill I will not be appealing particularly to the Minister, but I think it took great moral and political courage for Captain O'Neill to speak as he did a few nights ago.  His speech was referred to by an eminent churchman as a statesmanlike speech.</P>

      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to do something similar at this stage, after a breakdown for two years in the relationship between the biggest farmers' organisation, the NFA, and the Minister and his Department. It would be very advisable for the Minister to bury the hatchet and say to this organisation that he is prepared to meet them without any pre-conditions.  The farmers and, indeed, the economy of the country cannot afford to have this breakdown existing any longer.  We are lucky that we have not to put up with civil rights demonstrations and disorders which they have in most other countries, and we should be more sensible in our approach to one another.</P>
      <P>Now more than ever a dialogue between the farmers and the Minister is absolutely necessary.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to bury the hatchet.  I suggest that in this season of peace and good-will as a first step he should resume departmental advertisements in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>.  Every Deputy in the House would be behind him if before Christmas he said as a first step in the direction of peace: &ldquo;We are prepared to resume giving departmental advertisements in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>&rdquo;.  In my opinion that paper gives an outstanding service to the Irish farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the big snags in farming today is the uncertainty about markets and prices.  I do not know if an arrangement could be worked out whereby six or 12 months beforehand the farmers could be sure of the price they would get for their products when it came to the marketing stage.  It is my belief that they are working very much in the dark at the moment and that there is a large risk and a large gamble in whatever branch of farming they are engaged.  Some system of contracts would be the answer.  This would be the only way in which they could be sure of the price of their products. There should be an arrangement in which they would know that if they delivered their produce on a certain date the processors could give them so much for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farming as a business should be much more attractive and much more profitable.  More often than not farmers are not making any money from what they are selling.  Last year was exceptional in that cattle prices remained steady throughout the year but very often that is not the case.  In that connection I am glad most Members who have spoken referred to Cork Marts Limited and the takeover of International Meat Products.  I want to add my voice in appealing to farmers to ensure that their names appear on the register of shareholders of that company.  It is true that this venture is being spearheaded by Cork Marts <Col N="2461" /> Limited.  It is also true that it is a national venture which concerns every farmer in the country.  Therefore, I am sure that an appeal from this House to the farmers pointing out to them that it is for their good, and for their future good in particular, to invest in this project will not fall on deaf ears.  I am sorry I found no reference to it in the Minister's long speech.</P>
    <P>Farmers are now becoming much more enlightened than they used to be. The advisory services are being more availed of through organisations such as Macra na Feirme and Macra na Tuaithe.  The idea of taking over International Meat Products is to be highly commended.  There is a danger that if we do not avail of this opportunity now some outside interest might do so. Time and again I have said that it is my belief that the industry surest to be availed of in any town or city is one connected with agriculture, an industry in which the raw material is got from the land and here certainly is one that has everything to commend itself to the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to the dairy industry except to say that one of the big problems of farmers is getting a reasonable price for their culled cows.  At the moment the price for culled cows is pretty high but it is very apt to fluctuate and, in fact, fluctuates greatly from one month to another.  I believe that here the national meat products factory will be one means of guaranteeing that there will be a good price for culled cows.  The farmers of today with the enlightenment they have are no longer prepared to carry cows that are not economic and, therefore, a good price for the animals they want to dispose of is a very encouraging thing and absolutely necessary to keep herds the way they should be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry made reference to Erin Foods and particularly to the Cork factories.  I should like to join with him in congratulating the management of Erin Foods because this year for the first time they are breaking even as far as their cash payments are concerned.  The development and extension of vegetable growing especially for the small farmers, is something that we should encourage and look forward <Col N="2462" /> to.  This year I gather we will have 10,000 acres under vegetables and that with rotational cropping means, in fact, that there are about 50,000 acres given to horticulture.  Indeed, it is true to say that those who are growing vegetables in East Cork at any rate have been very pleased with their work.  It was unfair of Deputy Corry to refer to the Skibbereen factory not being able to grow enough carrots for their needs because it is well known that the land around Skibbereen is not as suited to the growing of carrots as the land around Midleton or Fermoy.  It is also true to say that West Cork and the Skibbereen district can grow other types of vegetables of a much better quality and much more profitably than we can around Midleton and Fermoy. To make reference to Skibbereen falling down on the job and not growing enough carrots is, I think, going a little too far.</P>
    <P>One thing about Erin Foods &mdash; and I think this is why they made such a success of their business &mdash; is that they certainly went after the export markets in a big way.  It is a great thing for the economy that practically all their produce is exported.  I did not see any reference to Erin Foods in the Minister's statement and I think the Minister and the Department should encourage our small farmers to go in more for the growing of vegetables not alone in Cork but in other counties as well.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons I wanted to speak was to refer to the very serious situation developing for the farmers in southern Ireland because, as I see it, the south will be closed to all cattle shipments in the near future.  I wonder does the Minister and his Department realise the seriousness of this prospect because everyone knows that cattle, unlike parcels of goods, do not travel without suffering and if all the cattle of the south will have to travel to the North Wall, as I understand they will if the present proposals go through. I am quite sure that the farmers of the south will be in a serious financial loss.  I am also informed that the position at the North Wall is anything but adequate and that the conditions there <Col N="2463" /> sometimes are chaotic.  I want to make a special appeal today to the Minister and his Department to ensure that the cattle shipments that at present obtain in the south will not be interfered with.  The farmers of the south deserve that and it was for that reason that I rose to speak in this debate.  I know the debate is, unfortunately, too restricted and I do not want to interfere too much with the time of many other Members whom I know are anxious to speak.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the shortage of labour on the land.  It is unfortunate that 10,000 people are leaving the land each year.  It is also true that it is very hard for most farmers now to get anyone to stay and work on the land.  The reasons, of course, are not hard to find; they are economic.  The only suggestion I could make to the Minister is one I made a few years ago and that is that the present rate abatement per man for farmers of £17 is entirely inadequate. If we are to show that we are interested in keeping men on the land we should consider increasing the rate abatement allowance.  It has been £17 for some years and I appeal to the Minister to sympathetically consider having it increased to £25 or £30.  It would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the debate to the Land Project.  I believe the officials of the Land Project are doing a tremendous job.  Land which a few years ago was completely infertile is now crop producing.  I refer to this because I want to make a plea.  The Forestry Division are acquiring much land that could in present circumstances and with modern machinery be made useful arable land.  Before the Forestry Division are allowed to acquire any land there should be a report from the Land Project officer or some officer of the Department that it is suitable for forestry only.  This could be a very simple arrangement between the Minister and the Minister for Lands.  I referred to this a few years ago when there was not even the modern machinery that there is now for the <Col N="2464" /> reclaiming of land.  It is a shame to see land that could be made arable being planted and that, unfortunately, is still going on.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to restrictions on farmers in the haulage of livestock and farm produce.  There should be some way of helping the farmers rather than restricting them in the hauling of their livestock to the marts. We know that the gardaí have their job to do but one can see every week when marts are held a squad car harassing the farmers bringing cattle to the marts for themselves and possibly for their neighbours.  There is room here for a bit of commonsense so that these people will be given a chance.  Everybody in the House, including the Parliamentary Secretary, knows that CIE, who took on the job, are not capable of doing it satisfactorily.  In many instances their lorries and trailers are too awkward to get into farmers' places, whereas the local man, with his handy tractor and trailer, can do the job much more efficiently and cheaply.</P>
    <P>All Deputies who wish to speak on agriculture should be given the opportunity to do so.  It is important, therefore, that the debate has been restricted. For that reason I will conclude by appealing again to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;there is a different Parliamentary Secretary before me from the man to whom I appealed a few minutes ago &mdash; a sensible man, to ask the Minister before he goes home for Christmas&mdash;the season of goodwill&mdash;to bury the hatchet and show that he is prepared to do so by, first of all restoring advertising to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i></P>

      <P>I deplore the attitude of Deputy Murphy, as indicated at the outset of his speech, when he condemned the Minister for not being present.  I appreciate why the Deputy was so sour on this matter.  I have been here since 10.35 a.m. and I have noted that Deputy Murphy has been the only member of the Labour Party in the House during all that time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the large sum, £56.8 million, he has made available for agriculture this year, an increase of approximately £7.1 million.  Farmers, and agriculture generally, have had an exceptionally good year and indications are that 1969 will probably be the best so far.  Cattle, sheep and pig prices were good, milk production is still rising and is up on last year.  The grain harvest was exceptionally good.  All these things lead us to believe that the farming community have had an exceptionally good year. There is a definite reason for this: it is the Government's agricultural policy which is continuing to ensure that all farmers who work their land efficiently will share in the advantages of the growing prosperity of the nation.</P>
      <P>Of course, it has been the policy of Fianna Fáil Governments through the years to ensure that the farming community get their share of the national cake and nobody can condemn the Government or their Ministers for not having given a slice of the national cake to the agricultural community. The sum of more than £56 million this year is no paltry amount to give to any sector of the community, although I realise that at all times the agricultural community deserve their share because they contribute such a large portion to our exports&mdash;approximately one-third by way of beef alone.  Therefore, the agricultural community are an integral part of our economy and must be treated as such.</P>

    <P>There are a few points in the Department's and the Minister's policies with which I am not in full agreement. First of all, I should like to refer to agricultural workers, without whom our agricultural policy could not be implemented.  Though they participate so effectively in the agricultural economy, many agricultural workers are being abused.  They are not receiving the remuneration they deserve.  We have a tendency to put our agricultural workers into the lowest possible grade and I should like to see this eliminated.  As most people associated <Col N="2466" /> with agriculture know, these men have to be fully skilled.  If fully skilled men go to work in industry they will receive wages in accordance with their skills.</P>
    <P>On this question of farm workers, it will be said that there is the Agricultural Wages Board to deal with their problems.  I agree that it is the board's policy to see that agricultural workers get a fair wage and I draw the Minister's attention to it now so that he may ensure that the Agricultural Wages Board will do something urgently about this matter.  Skilled men on the land are entitled to the same level of treatment as those in factories and I will not be happy until they receive the same remuneration as factory workers.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take up this point in an endeavour to better the lot of agricultural workers.  For instance, I suggest they should be excluded from paying income tax.  Their wages are so small that the amount of revenue collected by way of income tax from this source is also very small. The buoyancy of the economy is not solely dependent on the money received from this source of taxation.  I know this is not entirely relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the growing of vegetables.  A lot has been done for other sectors of the agricultural community&mdash;the beet farmers, milk farmers, grain men&mdash;but we tend to forget too often, particularly in the constituency of County Dublin, that we have a large number of farmers with small areas of land, many of whom make their living solely from the growing of vegetables&mdash;carrots, sprouts, parsnips, cauliflower, potatoes and other small table vegetables.  These men do not receive any direct subsidies or any other form of relief from the Department, although they are the sole producers of their particular produce. <Col N="2467" /> Take a man in North County Dublin.  He produces a bag of potatoes and sells them at an average price of from £8 to £10 a ton.</P>
      <P>My business brings me into shops where potatoes are sold and I have seen potatoes that we sold at 10/- a bag being sold in these shops at 25/-a bag.  How can that profit be justified? The housewife is blaming the farmer, alleging that the farming community derive undue profits.  I want to make it clear to the housewife that between the farmer and the housewife there is a middle man who could actually be called a fiddleman from the point of view that he is deriving exorbitant profits from the farmers' produce. I gave the example of potatoes. Cauliflowers are another example.  The producer sells for 6/- a dozen and they are sold in the shops at 1/3d and 1/4d each.  This is a ridiculous situation. The producers, who should get the profit, are not getting it.</P>
      <P>I can visualise, particularly in North County Dublin, the acreage of potatoes decreasing.  First, they are too costly to grow.  The outlay, having regard to the rate of interest, is too heavy.  Labour is not available for harvesting.  Most important of all is the fact that the producer cannot get the profit he deserves. The amount expended, if invested, would produce more profit. This is the reason why I want to hit at the middle people, particularly those who sell from door-to-door, who buy vegetables on the open market.  The price is controlled by these people who can corner the majority of vegetables on the market and can regulate the price up or down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices for vegetables should be established. I suggested this before in the House.  In the case of potatoes there could be a fortnightly review of the situation or, in the early part of the year, the first weeks in June up to the last week in June, a weekly review and thereafter a fortnightly review.  I do not think the housewife would object to paying a steady reasonable price in order to allow the farmers a reasonable profit.  The housewife objects to shopkeepers taking as much money as they can out of her pocket.  The shopkeeper <Col N="2468" /> can charge what he likes.  There is no use in saying that people can go to other shops.  People who go to a supermarket or a local shop will buy potatoes there rather than go down the road to a shop where they are selling at twopence less.</P>
    <P>The price of beet, barley, oats, and so on is stabilised but is not stabilised in the case of potatoes and vegetables. The market tends to fluctuate according to supply and demand.  From my experience in the market I know that the law of supply and demand does not operate in this case.  There may be a demand and the price remains high.  In other cases the demand may decline but the price remains the same.  This position is created by the potato porters.</P>
    <P>We are gradually becoming capable of producing a great quantity of wheat per acre.  This development was inevitable. Even if the acreage did not increase, as it did, we would still be producing more per acre for the reason that there are new fertilising compounds, new methods and new varieties. We still use two main varieties&mdash; Quern and Atle&mdash;which ripen late in the year.  I recommended to the Minister to consider the question of introducing a variety that would ripen early in the year at approximately the time of the barley harvest.  This would be a great asset.  There would be a long day for cutting and a long day for drying and the bad effects of the dewy September mornings would be avoided.  The Department say that they are working on something but I should like to see it speeded up.  A variety that would ripen about a fortnight earlier would suffice and would be a great asset to growers and millers.  The millers would get the wheat in better condition and there would be no delay at the intake point. Positive action should be taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>There were many predictions that we would definitely have to pay a levy of up to 13/-.  My candid opinion is that we will have to pay a levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>When we are producing more I do not think the farmer will <Col N="2469" /> object to having to pay a levy from the point of view that he has got away with it for the last few years.  The only reason for the levy will be a good harvest. None of us can predict whether the harvest will be good or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Deputies over there were telling us that they could so predict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy will be necessary only if we exceed the quota rate. That will occur only if the harvest is good, in which case it can be assumed that the farmer will derive a profit.  I have been in contact with some of my neighbours who are not all of the same political views as I am.  They do not object to the levy being imposed because they can see that the acreage of wheat is increasing, that the yield is increasing and that there is no alternative to imposing a levy.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the last Estimate for Agriculture I pointed out that the intake points that we have at present possibly would be sufficient or good enough if they were all in operation. We found this year that some of the new points were in operation but that others were not.  I should like the Minister to do one positive thing about intake points.  There is a representative from the Department standing at the intake point, on and off.  He is not resident there.  He may have to deal with two, three or four points.  I would ask the Minister to have a representative of the Department standing there at all times that wheat is being taken in.  The reason is that this year the hagberg test for qualification has been brought up to 140 for potentially millable wheat.  There would be a greater number of border line cases.  In some cases where the figure is 140 the hagberg will be repeated and the wheat will reach only 139.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not alleging dishonesty on the part of the miller who takes the test but I am saying that there could be a discrepancy as happened before in the test.  I ask the Minister to set up a small prefabricated office in which he would have, say, a man and a girl, to carry out the hagberg test before it goes to the miller.  We have two of these down <Col N="2470" /> at the Alexandra Road and one on the south side and these points could be manned by three people or six people. They are three of the main intake points and by availing of them the farmer would know whether his sample would be accepted or rejected.  The farmer would have the advice of the Department and he would be able to say to the miller &ldquo;Well, the sample was passed by the Department and how can it fail with you?&rdquo; This is something which is essential to safeguard farmers this year because we are going to have a lot more borderline cases.  I do not think that the implementation of this suggestion would cost a lot.  The Minister might even do away with the Department official who may be responsible for two or three intake points and incorporate him into the running of these huts or whatever you might call them, for carrying out the hagberg tests.  It would be a good idea and it would safeguard both the farmers and the milllers.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Clinton bemoaned the fact that the calved heifer scheme was being abolished he said that adequate notice had not been given and he also said that it would entail a considerable loss for small farmers and small dairymen.  This struck me as being very peculiar because when I came into this House first I remember Deputy Clinton and other members of the Fine Gael Party decrying the mere existence of the scheme.  They said it was brought in solely for the big man and that the small man would not avail of it.  Yet when it is announced that the scheme is to be abolished we hear them saying that this will mean a loss to the small man.  It is evident that the agricultural policy of the Fine Gael Party is such that they themselves are bewildered about it and they do not know where they stand.  I was surprised that Deputy Clinton should have said this because he is one man who should know about the agricultural community.  Of course, it might have been a statement made just for the purpose of saying something contrary to the Department's policy.  However, they must work this out for themselves, it is not for us to run their affairs; we have it hard enough keeping the agricultural community happy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2471" /> I want now to say something about the warble fly.  I think the Minister is wrong in doing away with the scheme which should have been left for another year.  Sometimes farmers are inclined to be somewhat neglectful in regard to the warble fly.  It was open to them to report to the Department any time they saw evidence of the warble fly or traces of it in the cattle. This happened in a few cases and the gadfly is still hovering around.  If the scheme were retained for at least another year I am sure we would be completely free of this pest.  The Minister should reintroduce it.  Although the figures show that a relatively small number of cattle had warbles, I think that many cattle which we do not know about have them.  If the matter were investigated it could be that we would find that a larger number than anyone would believe is involved.</P>
    <P>In regard to the pig industry, the day of the small pig breeder of one or even ten pigs has gone and today the emphasis is on having large numbers of pigs. I agree that if it is possible to have large numbers that therein lies the profit even for the small farmer who can avail of the necessary grants.  It is from large numbers that they will derive profit and their livelihood.  One draw-back, however, is the cost of feeding stuffs and this has been a constant complaint by pig breeders.  This year we have an increase in cereal prices and this will lead to an increase in the price of pig feeding materials.  I asked the Minister before if it would be possible to introduce a scheme to subsidise the feeding of pigs.  The bonus scheme for sows is a very good scheme but I should like to see the introduction of a scheme for subsidising pig feeding.  Because of the labour involved in the rearing of pigs the profit derived does not compensate the breeder to the point that he can expand very quickly. A certain amount of expenditure would be involved in such a scheme but I would ask the Minister to see if it would be possible to introduce it.</P>
    <P>We have one big fertiliser factory which produces all grades and all types of fertiliser.  The Minister referred to the increased outlay in the growing of cereals and this is mainly due to the <Col N="2472" /> cost of fertilisers.  Every year the price goes up.  Every year the fertiliser factories introduce a new gimmick to try to persuade the farmers &mdash; which they do successfully &mdash; that the new fertilisers are stronger and better than the ones they had the previous year.  In so doing, they increase the tonnage price by about £3 or £3 10s.  This is a very successful business to be in.  These increases lead to an increase per acre of approximately £1 to 25/- if you top dress afterwards.  This is all putting up the cost of production for the farmer but these particular fertiliser factories can show a deficit at the end of the year to prove that they have lost money and that it is not economic for them to be producing fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one particular grade of fertiliser which was known as 8-6-16 which most of the farmers in north County Dublin used as a balance in producing potatoes.  The fertiliser factory did away with 8-6-16 and introduced a new grade known as 10-10-20 but this is not suitable for producing potatoes in our area.  I had requests from many farmers last year and even this year asking me to find out if it would be possible for the factory to produce 8-6-16 again because this compound was very suitable for the land in north County Dublin and also gave a better quality potato.  We are inclined to blame the 10-10-20 for blight in that it is of high nitrogen quality and does tend to grow the stalks on the potato considerably more than the 8-6-16.  The tubers are more open to blight when they are in full growth.  I wonder would it be possible to get these people to produce 8-6-16 again.  I do not think it was on the advice of the agricultural community or of the agricultural instructors that they went away from this but that it was purely a point of economics on the one side and a point of profit on the other side.  These people are putting up the price of these commodities every year without ever giving any consideration to the farmer's wants and needs.  If these prices continue these people will price themselves out of the market and we will be requesting the import of fertilisers.  This is something I do not want to see happening because these fertiliser factories are giving a considerable <Col N="2473" /> amount of employment.  This is our aim, and this is what I should like to see increasing.  However, I just make that point in the hope that the Minister will look into it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on the grant allocations for glasshouses to the horticultural sector of the community.  This glasshouse grant was introduced last year and was very successfully availed of in County Dublin.  It was a great incentive to the people there to go into a high acreage of glass.  The installation of heating made the glasshouses more adaptable to different commodities, tomatoes, flowers or even small vegetables. There is only one drawback I can see, that this grant has been availed of by people not solely engaged in agriculture or not in any way engaged in it. I know a few business executives: one has two acres of glass and another has three acres, and these people get the grant for it.  They are going to flood the market with tomatoes.  The result is that the ordinary farmer who is deriving his livelihood from glass and from agriculture generally is made out to be a very small man in the market. We have not the market for tomatoes. We can only eat so many tomatoes, and were it not that there was plenty of sunshine this year and that we ate a great deal of salad I do not think half the tomatoes would have been sold.  We have to look for an outlet for tomatoes and, consequently, we should consider whether we should give grants to business executives or confine it solely to farmers.  The Minister might argue that our purpose in introducing this scheme was to increase the acreage of glass in the country.  That is probably right, but I think the grant should be confined to those whose livelihood depends on agriculture.</P>
    <P>The facilities for marketing tomatoes are not adequate.  We shall have to go further afield and market our tomatoes better.  Our tomatoes are of good quality but we are a bit haphazard about grading and marketing them.  The sphere of agriculture is highly competitive, and if we are to stay in the production of tomatoes and other commodities and if we are to increase employment, this is a problem <Col N="2474" /> which the Minister and the Department should look into.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism of the agricultural institutes, and they have been condemned for not paying their way and various other things.  I want to compliment them for the research work they are carrying out.  The farmers have learned a lot from the agricultural institutes, most of whose work has come to fruition in the last few years.  A great deal of experiment and research are necessary in relation to the diagnosis of diseases, and so forth.  It takes a lot of time to find a remedy for these diseases.  At the beginning our agricultural institutes tended to be in the wilderness. They were proceeding very slowly. The evidence of their work could not be shown, but now it is beginning to show fruit and they should be complimented for this.</P>
    <P>This work involves a great deal of dedication, time, experience and money. They deserve whatever money we can afford to give them.  It is not wasted. Because people see commodities being pulled from the ground and thrown away, they think that commodity has been wasted.  I live beside the Agricultural Institute in Kinsealy, and I know well the work they carry out there is for the benefit of the farmer.  They are always open to requests to give advice. They have an open field day on which they give advice.  They are doing a tremendous job and every benefit which can be laid on for them should be.</P>
    <P>The only point I would make in regard to the agricultural institutes is that they should be limited as regards the amount of land they may purchase. Some years ago the tendency was that available land which came up for sale around the institute should be purchased. I do not think this is right.  A standard should be set as to the number of acres of land on which the institute can survive and make available necessary information and knowledge to the agricultural community. They should not be allowed to buy up all the land available around the country.</P>
    <P>It seems to be open to anybody to bring into this country any kind of dirt <Col N="2475" /> of agricultural machinery.  I see certain agricultural machinery which is an utter disgrace being allowed in here.  If there is a low enough charge for it the farmer will buy it because he is confined by his pocket.  The guarantee that goes with this machinery is not worth the piece of paper I have in my hand. I am talking about agricultural equipment, not tractors, lorries or anything like that.  There should be some means of seeing that this equipment is of better quality and that it carries out the job it is supposed to do.  The Agricultural Institute in Grange take out a certain number of machines every year and try them out but they take out the best of them.  The ones that are sent to the four corners of the country are brought in here and there is no check on them.  Some of this machinery would not scratch a henhouse, never mind scratch a field.  I have seen one working.  Although I myself did not buy one, I have experience of one type of machine which would not be suitable under any circumstances here but which was allowed into this country.  Being so dear, there should be some inspection of agricultural machinery to ensure that whatever is sold here is suitable for our agricultural purposes before it is allowed for sale on the open market.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department on the tremendous work being done under the Land Project.  I have always found the staff in that office very kind and understanding and anxious to assist people who could not raise the necessary capital for the drainage of their land.  In my county, a fine acreage has been made arable.  I hope to see an extension of that work because there are acres and acres throughout the country which can grow nothing but snipe grass, if some of it can grow even that.  Unfortunately, the farmers need somebody to drive them to avail of the grants and the facilities for the drainage of land.  A person should be appointed whose duty it would be to make known to them what can be done and how to do it.  If we leave it to the farmers, I do not think it will be done.  Our aim is to make as much land as possible arable and productive.  Certainly, the work being <Col N="2476" /> done under the Land Project deserves praise.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has taken over work in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and I am grateful for the courtesy extended to all of us by the civil servants employed therein.  Personally, I should like to see the dispute in relation to farming organisations solved, as no doubt would everybody else, too.  I do not want to see one person going on his knees to another person.  There should be common unity and common responsibility. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must treat the agricultural community as a unit.  Certain people cannot be phased out and expect a greater amount of latitude than others. I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to endeavour to heal the disunity in the farming organisations. I would also ask the farming organisations to put their own house in order and to get together in one specific body which will bring their views to the Minister rather than have the present situation of different bodies bringing conflicting views.  This is a situation which does not benefit the Minister, the farmers or the public.  In order to achieve this, the farming community will have to get together and heal up their own sores and wounds.  I am sure we should then have general harmony between the Government, the Minister and our various agricultural bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the time allowed for this debate is limited and as other Deputies also wish to speak I shall confine my remarks to one sector of the agricultural industry with which I am fairly familiar, the dairying industry.  It is vital that the record be put straight in relation to the role of the dairying industry in the national economy and, particularly, that certain misconceptions be cleared up.  In a general way, the Minister adverted to the economic and social arguments in favour of subsidisation of our major national industry.  It is essential that we should clear our minds as to the magnitude of this problem or whether, in fact, there is a problem of surplus milk production at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at a headline in one of our national newspapers this morning <Col N="2477" /> over its report of the debate on Agriculture here yesterday &mdash;<i>The Problem of Surplus Milk</i>.  This whole idea of over-production of milk is giving rise to serious concern in the traditional milk-producing areas.  I do not believe there is any justification for panic on this matter.  I do not agree that there is any danger from the present trend in milk production.  I believe there is not a serious problem.  There is a problem but it is not as serious as some people seem to think.</P>
    <P>According to the most recent statistics available, 110,000 farmers and their families are engaged is dairy farming and the direct employment in it is reckoned to involve approximately 350,000 people.  In the creamery industry and in the milk processing industry the most recent statistics indicate that there are approximately 8,000 to 10,000 full-time workers.  At present, the dairying industry contributes approximately £30 million through exports of dairy products and, of course, indirectly also because we cannot have cattle unless we have cows.  It is contributing to the cattle and to the meat export business.  It can be said, I think, without fear of contradiction, that the dairy industry is the foundation stone of our whole agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting exercise to examine how far State aid for the dairying industry can be justified.  The Minister adverted to the subject and, in a general way, said there were sound economic and social reasons for subsidising milk production.  The fact is the dairying industry is the only sector of our economy in which the targets set in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion have actually been reached.  No other sector of the economy has performed so well.  Milk production has risen to 520,000,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been cries of over-production and a good deal of &ldquo;ullagoning&rdquo; about surplus milk.  The plain fact of the matter is that this production of 520,000,000 gallons was envisaged when the Second Programme was formulated.  I took the trouble to check and I find that, when the targets were fixed in 1964, forecasts were made indicating that something in the region <Col N="2478" /> of over 500,000,000 gallons of milk would be the output in 1968.  That target has been reached.  No other sector has shown the same capacity for expansion and development as has the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>Total milk output is only one aspect of the whole problem.  Other factors enter into the picture.  The basic question we must ask ourselves when talking about surplus milk is whether or not our dairying industry is competitive in comparison with the dairying industry in traditional dairying countries.  It may be a relatively simple matter to increase milk production.  It is a problem to find new markets but, in the final analysis, the acid test of performance is whether or not dairying products can be competitive.  Here we have, indeed, a very satisfactory situation. Not alone have the dairy farmers achieved the targets set in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion but milk products are commanding premium prices on the export market. In the British market at the moment, and for the past year or so, the price of butter shows that Ireland is second only to Denmark.  It is interesting to note the market prices.  According to the latest figures I could get, Danish butter in the United Kingdom is commanding £337 a ton.  Irish butter is commanding £328 a ton.  British butter is commanding £320 a ton; Dutch £307 a ton; New Zealand and Australian £300 a ton and other countries also £300 a ton.  That shows that the quality of one of the most important end products of our dairying industry compares more than favourably with that of any other dairying exporting country.  As I pointed out, the price commanded on the British market is second only to that commanded by the Danes.  It is interesting to note in this context that the Danish techniques in butter manufacture are quite different from ours.  It is also interesting to find, in arriving at a picture of the effectiveness of the Irish dairying industry, that we are the lowest cost producers of milk products in Western Europe and the second lowest cost producers in the world, second only to New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are able to produce the highest quality milk products while, at the same time, having the <Col N="2479" /> lowest cost of production in Western Europe gives us a tremendous commercial advantage from the point of view of selling our products on the export market.  There has been dumping of dairy products in Western Europe and of collapsing prices for dairy products on the export markets.  Fears have been expressed in regard to the new British proposals for agriculture, proposals aimed at self-sufficiency, but I am quite confident that the Irish dairying industry has nothing to fear.  The advice I have given, and will continue to give, to dairy farmers who express anxiety with regard to the over-production of milk is to go on producing milk, to gear their farms up to the highest point of efficiency and to go on getting maximum output from their dairy herds.  As I hope to show, there are no grounds for fear in relation to the future for milk on the export market.</P>

      <P>The question of parliamentary review of the affairs of State-sponsored bodies is being kept under consideration by the Government. The problem is, however, a difficult and complex one and a satisfactory solution has not yet been devised. Any such review would have to be so conducted that on the one hand it did not trespass on the statutory control of the Ministers responsible to the Oireachtas for these bodies and on the other hand it did not interfere with, or curtail, the commercial freedom of the bodies in regard to day-to-day affairs which is so important in the operation of any business enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, where the State provides funds from voted moneys there is opportunity for annual parliamentary debate on the affairs of the State-sponsored bodies concerned.  In other cases opportunity for parliamentary debate arises from time to time when <Col N="2481" /> legislation in relation to State-sponsored bodies is before the House. The annual reports and accounts of State-sponsored bodies are also normally made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Under section 8 of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE are free to fix such charges as the Board thinks fit for any service provided by the Board.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, transport to the Aran Islands is already being subsidised with the aid of the annual grant of £2 million payable to CIE under the Transport Act, 1964.  The operating loss on the service will be £16,000 in the current year as against revenue of £23,000.  This is, therefore, one of the few miscellaneous services of CIE where the operating losses entail further subsidisation.  The annual grant to CIE has been fixed by legislation for the five-year period ending 31st March, 1969, and no additional subsidies are available to CIE which could be utilised to reduce rates and fares on the Aran Islands service.</P>

      <P>If total production of millable wheat is considerably above milling requirements a substantial levy on all wheat will be necessary.  If, however, the first 100 barrels from each grower were to be excluded from the levy arrangement circumstances could arise under which it would not be feasible to impose a levy on the balance which would meet the cost of the disposal of the surplus.

      <P>The initiative in determining the salary and conditions for an office under a local authority, including the office of Dublin city architect, rests with the local authority concerned.  My sanction is necessary, however, to the salary proposed to be applied by a local authority to any of its offices. Comparisons with outside employment are not necessarily a decisive factor in determining the appropriate salary for a local authority office.</P>
      <P>I have no detailed information as to how the present salary and conditions for the office of city architect compare with the salaries and conditions of architects in private employment in the Dublin area but they are the same as the salaries and conditions of the offices of Dublin city engineer and Dublin planning officer which are the only comparable posts in the local authority service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the question relates to the Ballymun Housing Project.  I explained to the Deputy in reply to his question of 12th May, 1966, the reasons why there would be no validity in apportioning the contract target price, as authorised by the Corporation, over the number of dwellings then being provided within a four-year contract.  In July of this year, the Corporation authorised the construction of 192 additional flats within the contract, which had included the substantial cost of building and equipping the concrete prefabrication factory.  The Corporation also decided to undertake a central city scheme using the same building methods and availing of the facilities of the Ballymun factory.  The Deputy will appreciate in these circumstances that, while one may make a crude calculation of dividing the contract target price by the number of dwellings being provided at Ballymun, the existence of other factors will ultimately be reflected in the true building costs.  I might say, at this stage, however, that I am satisfied that the costs of the flats at Ballymun are lower than the costs of corresponding flats provided by traditional methods.</P>

      <P>Payments resulting from the issue of notices under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are payable into the Road Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Roads Act, 1920.  The proceeds of the <Col N="2521" /> Road Fund, after allowing for administrative expenses, are allocated to the local authorities and may be used by them for purposes which include the provision of off-street parking facilities.</P>

      <P>The giving of signals by hand is well within the capabilities of the competent driver.  I do not propose to remove from the driving test the requirement that the driver should give a simple demonstration of his ability to use them.  I consider this a necessary feature of the test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to the purport of the Deputy's question. However, the following information may assist him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, is broadly based on the recommendations <Col N="2522" /> of the Commission on Driving while under the influence of Drink or a Drug, the findings of which were published in October, 1963.  Membership of the Commission included representatives of the medical profession and motoring organisations.  The Commission invited and received both written and oral submissions which included many medical viewpoints.  Following publication of the Commission's report public comment was invited before a final decision was taken on legislation to implement the recommendations. I am satisfied that all interested parties were given every opportunity to state their views and that these views were given full consideration.</P>
    <P>The form of breath, blood or urine test to be used will be recommended by the recently-constituted Medical Bureau of Road Safety on which the medical profession is represented.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána consider that, on the whole, the use of these containers for the regular removal of rubble and waste involves less inconvenience to the general public as well as less of a traffic hazard <Col N="2529" /> than the use of ordinary trucks.  Nevertheless, there have been some complaints about certain aspects of the operations and there have been discussions between the Garda, the corporation and the firms concerned, of whom there are now several.  The Garda expect it will be possible to solve the problems that have given cause for complaint.</P>
      <P>The particular point about the use of lights on the containers is a matter for the corporation rather than the Garda who have no direct powers in relation to it and who, besides, would prefer to see the containers removed at night where at all possible.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress an hour ago, I was endeavouring to put the dairying industry in its proper perspective.  I pointed out that the fact has been established that our dairy farmers are getting the lowest prices of any dairy farmers in Western Europe for their milk.  We are getting the lowest prices of all milk producers in Western Europe.</P>
      <P>Our dairy produce is commanding premium prices on the export market. I have given the figures in relation to butter prices on the British market. The price that is being commanded now for &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; butter is second only to Denmark.  There is the same story in relation to cheddar cheese. According to the latest figures, that I have been able to obtain, British home produced cheese is making £270 a ton; Irish cheese is making £245 a ton; New Zealand cheese is making £240 a ton; Australian cheese is making £225 a ton and imports into Britain from other countries are making about £200 a ton.</P>
      <P>While this situation exists, I believe that we have a tremendous commercial advantage in so far as the marketing of our dairy products going on the export market.  I believe that there is no need, as I have already said, for any panic measures to curtail milk production.  When an industry with a record of performance like the dairying industry can command these prices on the export market, we should continue to encourage our dairy farmers to improve their farms and to improve their herds thereby getting a maximum output from their farms.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries recently announced the new increase of 1d a gallon on the first 7,000 gallons and since he announced the new beef subsidy, the impression has been created abroad that it is important for many purposes that an effort should be made to curtail milk production, and that the idea of 1d on the first 7,000 gallons has been done with a view to encouraging larger milk producers from further expanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to present the facts in relation to the dairy industry as I obtained them from the official statistics and from the various researches that have been carried out.  I have advised dairy farmers in my constituency to continue in milk production and not to be misled <Col N="2545" /> by cries of over-production or the fact that the export markets are collapsing. I do not believe there is any need for fear at the present time.  As I have already pointed out, the increase in milk output in the last two years, which has been described as dramatic, was envisaged in 1964 when the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was being formulated.</P>
    <P>If the Government were doing their job and if the Minister and his Department were doing their job, they would have taken steps long ago to ensure that the capacity of our milk processing plants was adequate to cater for the increased milk output.  If this had been done, the appalling and completely indefensible situation that arose last May and June need never have arisen.  I am referring to the fact that millions of gallons of skimmed milk had to be poured down the drain because of the fact that the capacity of the processing plants was not adequate and that there had been difficulty in marketing skimmed milk powders. Admittedly, there was difficulty but those difficulties would not have arisen if a proper and flexible policy had been introduced to divert that milk into other products and despite the fact that last May or June, the market for skimmed milk powder had more or less collapsed and the price fell from over £100 a ton to as low as £40 a ton. A few months later, skimmed milk powder is commanding from £80 to £90 a ton.</P>
    <P>It is now extremely doubtful if we shall have adequate supplies of skimmed milk powder to meet our export market commitments.  That is particularly so in relation to the Mexican order negotiated by An Bord Bainne for in the region of £62, £63 or £64 a ton.  I am informed that An Bord Bainne are seriously worried about the adequacy of the available supply of milk powder to meet this order.  If this is so, it is a scandalous state of affairs. It indicates no planning and no initiative. It indicates very bad management if we allow this situation to develop.</P>
    <P>The reason for the recovery in price for skimmed milk powder is that, in the dairying countries, there was stock-piling of skimmed milk powder <Col N="2546" /> and, when the price drops below a certain figure&mdash;I understand the figure is around £40 per ton&mdash;skimmed milk powder then becomes the most economic source of protein for animal food.  As soon as the prices dropped on the Continent, the animal food compounders bought up all available supplies and incorporated it in the animal food ration with the result that stocks in Western Europe, particularly in the dairying areas, became eroded. The price therefore recovered.</P>
    <P>Our situation is that we may not be able to fulfil our market commitments for skimmed milk powder.  Surely this indicates that something is wrong here? Skimmed milk powder is dealt with at length in the recently-published report of a survey conducted by Messrs. Cooke and Sprague, two American consultants engaged by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to examine the question of the rationalisation of the creamery milk industry.  This report should have been issued to all Members of this House.  At Question Time a few weeks ago, the Minister said a copy of it is available in the Dáil Library.  As far as I know, every Deputy receives copies of the reports on all types of surveys.  The Cooke-Sprague Report has been eagerly awaited.  It is a very important document. It is deplorable that Deputies should have to queue up in the Library for it.  As a result of all that, I have had to depend on the study by the Irish Agriculture Organisation Society of the main recommendations of the Cooke-Sprague Report.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the problem product, as it is now known in the dairying industry&mdash;the problem of skimmed milk powder.  Prices are now recovering.  I have not access to Departmental information on this subject, but I want to go on record as saying that the outlook is excellent provided certain steps are taken to expand the capacity of the milk processing plants to convert the skimmed milk into powder during the 1969 season.  The prices for skimmed milk powder in the past few years have been very good but they dropped this year due to exceptional circumstances.  I gather that this is a cyclical event and that it will not recur for three or four years.  Recommendation <Col N="2547" /> No. 6 of the Cooke-Sprague Report, which I find here on page five of the Memorandum on that Report by the Irish Agriculture Organisation Society, says that in view of the strategic importance of dried skimmed milk powder in the evolution of the dairying industry it is recommended that the Government establish and maintain a price floor under skimmed milk powder at a stock-loss level of around £65 per ton.</P>
    <P>I understand that discussions have taken place between the Department and those engaged in milk processing and that agreement is about to be reached whereby this minimum floor price, this break-even price, this stock-loss price level of around £65 per ton will be guaranteed.  I understand a certain sum of money will be made available &mdash; whether by way of grant or loan I do not know&mdash;so that, when a situation occurs again such as that which occurred last May or June when the price dropped, there will be this fund which will be utilised to maintain the price of skimmed milk powder at this minimum level of £65 per ton.  On the other hand, when the price would go beyond a certain level, the milk processing company would repay the amount drawn from the fund when the price was low.  This is a very good idea.  It was discussed as long ago as two years and I am pleased the American consultants have brought it forward again.  I am also pleased that, in reply to a question I asked him a couple of weeks ago, the Minister announced that discussions had taken place and that a formula was being worked out.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to our external trading relations, particularly those with Britain, and certain suggestions were made in relation to the EEC.  I have often heard it said, and we are led to believe, and the general opinion certainly seems to be that our farmers lag behind the Danes and the Dutch and other farmers in Western Europe.  It is interesting to note, however, that butter production costs here in 1967 ran at £470 per ton whereas in the EEC countries butter production costs ran at £800 per ton and the butter which cost £800 to produce in <Col N="2548" /> these countries is being sold at £100 per ton on the export market.  I challenge anyone to forecast how long any country or how long the EEC can continue selling at £100 per ton butter that costs £800 per ton to produce. By an extraordinary coincidence in yesterday's newspayers we read that a meeting of the Agricultural Ministers of the EEC had decided to take steps in regard to butter production in the Community countries.  This, of course, is yet another argument in favour of our continuing to produce milk and continuing to encourage and assist our dairy farmers to produce milk as efficiently as possible.  We are the lowest cost milk producer in Western Europe and we can continue in production when others go out.  Another way of saying that is, of course, that our dairy farmers are getting the lowest price in Western Europe for milk produced for manufacturing purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, speaking recently in the mini-Budget debate &mdash; he spoke for a couple of hours; it was the usual tirade and the usual crossfire and, as usual, it was highly publicised &mdash; tried to defend the penny per gallon increase granted in the Budget.  He tried to argue that the income of the dairy farmer had increased this year; although yesterday, speaking on this very same subject of farmers' incomes and particularly those of dairy farmers, he admitted that costs had increased in the past 12 months.  When I spoke on the mini-Budget some weeks ago I spelled out these increased costs in detail in the same way as I tried to put the dairying industry in its proper perspective. Certain newspapers &mdash; one in particular; it was not the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; did not consider the speech I made worthy of even one line.  One of the ironies of debate here is that, if one starts to hurl abuse at a Minister, that will get the headlines in the morning papers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wholly serious and wholly in earnest in what I am saying.  I undertook a great deal of research in preparation for that debate.  I do not mind; I refrain from the temptation to seek headlines in this <Col N="2549" /> debate by abusing the Minister.  I make no apologies for what I say.  If my speech is as dry as dust and if anyone is bored he need not listen to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eugene Gilhawley brought in here the books the dairy farmers present to the creamery manager every morning and in those books the daily supply is recorded.  Deputy Gilhawley proved from the returns of several farmers that the average price of milk received by the dairy farmer in 1968 is down by one penny per gallon in his area.  I go even further.  My investigations in Limerick &mdash; I defy contradiction on this &mdash; indicate that the average price per gallon in Limerick from 1st May &mdash; the time the skim was washed down the Maigue, the Mulcaire and the other rivers &mdash; until October was back 2d per gallon on 1967 prices.  When one analyses the position it is easy to see how this occurred.  Due to the skim milk débâcle many creameries were accepting only half the skim and therefore 50 per cent of the skim was no price at all.  In the case of the 50 per cent accepted by the creamery the price offered was down by one penny per gallon in practically every case and, in some cases, by as much as 2d per gallon.  I put the minimum loss on skim milk at one penny per gallon.  In addition, on 1st July we had the increased Bord Bainne levy adding another five-eighths of a penny and the balance of the 2d is made up by increased costs of many kinds which dairy farmers and creameries have had to meet.  The Minister comes along then and tries to prove that the penny per gallon on the first 7,000 gallons which he awarded in the supplementary Budget will compensate the dairy farmers for the losses they have sustained in 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is ridiculous.  One penny per gallon on the first 7,000 gallons is only £29 and some shillings. Many of them will have to wait 12 months before they will receive the full £29.  Strangely enough, the very small milk producers on whose behalf this penny on the gallon was supposed to be introduced will have to wait a full 12 months before they get the benefit of it and the very large milk producers who between 1st September and now will have supplied 7,000 gallons will <Col N="2550" /> get the full £29 3s.  One penny a gallon on the first 7,000 gallons which was supposed to offset the losses sustained by the dairy farmers this year, is absolutely out of all reality and bears no relationship to it at all.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that I disagree with the principle of a two-tier price system.  I have spoken about this on a number of occasions here.  The first time, I remember, the farmers, my friends and my neighbours, were picketing the gate of this House.  The principle of the two-tier price system is a good one.  I have already said that one penny per gallon is totally unrealistic and totally inadequate to help the small producers, those producing 7,000 gallons or under.  It will not prevent the very large-scale milk producers from increasing their production.  I do not agree that production should be limited.  If the two-tier price system is to have any meaning at all, the maximum increase which should have been given on the first 7,000 gallons is 4d. That would have meant something to the small farmers.  In view of the fact that the limit was being put at 7,000 gallons it should have been possible.</P>
    <P>The two-tier price system calls to mind the late Mr. John Feely, God rest him.  The Minister and my colleague Deputy Clinton paid tribute to the late Mr. Feely.  I should like to endorse everything said in this House about him.  I knew him very well for a long number of years.  He sincerely believed in the small farmers, and in the preservation of family holdings, and his aim was to ensure the viability of the small dairy farms.  The two-tier price system is his brain child.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned &mdash; and I am prepared to stand over it &mdash; it was the brain child of the <Col N="2551" /> late Mr. John Feely.  I have made a note of a question trying to summarise what I have been saying in relation to the whole question of milk output.  Can the Minister, the Department, the Government and we in Dáil Éireann agree with a policy to curtail milk production? Is there any justification for panic?  I think there is not.  There are a number of reasons for this.  I believe we must continue to expand our dairying industry because a viable dairying industry is an absolutely necessary prerequisite for expanding our agricultural economy.  The second reason why we should not attempt to curtail milk production is that our dairy farmers and our manufacturing units have proved by their performance over the past four or five years to be among the most efficient producers in Western Europe.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in relation to the question of the larger milk producers, slighting remarks have been passed from time to time.  Is the large milk producer, who five or ten years ago had 15 cows and who now carries 40 or 50 cows on the same amount of land, because he has made the best use of the advisory services and the various other schemes available, and who through his own enterprise and ability is now able to carry double or treble the number of cows he normally carried, to be penalised now for his business enterprise and initiative?  I do not think he should be.  Of course, a colossal capital investment has been incurred by many dairy farmers in recent years in reorganising their milk production methods, in installing the most modern milking equipment, in erecting new-style cow sheds, and so forth.  We should hear no more this cry of over-production and surplus milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the performance of An Bord Bainne in our export markets has been outstanding since its foundation, I still believe, and all the information available indicates, that there is still considerable scope for increasing the export of dairy products.  It has also been pointed out in this report of the survey carried out by two American consultants that there seems to be scope for greater efficiency in the processing of milk.  This question of amalgamation <Col N="2552" /> and rationalisation as such is a broad one.  It would be utterly impossible to go into all the details even if I had three hours to deal with it here.  It has been generally recognised by all who studied the dairying industry, and particularly the creamery industry, that there is need for rationalisation and amalgamation.  We have had five or six different surveys and studies of this very question.</P>
    <P>I remember the first survey by the Department of Agriculture way back in 1962 or 1963.  We then had Dr. Knapp.  Then we had reports produced by the IAOS, by the ICMSA, by the NFA and by the Irish Creamery Managers Association.  Then the IAOS took the matter a step further.  They attempted to put this thing into practice and a considerable number of snags were encountered.  The IAOS suggested 19 groupings.  There were meetings held in various parts of the country and there was considerable opposition and a good deal of controversy. I am told that the Department of Agriculture and the IAOS did not see eye-to-eye at any stage in relation to this question of rationalisation and amalgamation of the creamery industry.</P>
    <P>It would appear then that despite the fact that we had so many surveys carried out the Department decided to bring in Messrs.  Cooke and Sprague, two eminent American consultants, and we find that the main recommendations made by those gentlemen merely confirm and are in fact broadly the same as the recommendation in the other reports which I have mentioned. They point out the urgency of proceeding with amalgamation; but I want to warn the Minister, as I presume he and his officials are now studying this Cooke-Sprague report and the whole question of amalgamation with a view to formulating new proposals, that it is vitally essential&mdash;I have not had an opportunity of studying the report except in a very condensed form and, therefore, I am not expressing a considered opinion on the views expressed by Messrs.  Cooke and Sprague except in so far as they made recommendations which coincide with those of the other surveys&mdash;that when the new <Col N="2553" /> plans for amalgamation are being formulated, or more important still when they are being presented to the country, the pros and cons should be spelt out and the advantages and the disadvantages should be spelt out as clearly as possible and in language as simple as possible so that every dairy farmer will understand the implications.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the reasons why the IAOS ran into difficulty with their proposal for the 19 groupings was the fact that no dairy farmer was able to say what it meant to him, nor could he find the information despite all the documents that have been produced. I do not know the answer to the question which every dairy farmer asks when the subject of amalgamation or rationalisation comes up for discussion: &ldquo;What is this going to mean to me?  Does it mean that I will get a penny or twopence a gallon more for my milk?&rdquo;  It must be spelt out in money terms.  Phrases like &ldquo;break-even prices&rdquo; and &ldquo;loss profit ratios&rdquo; mean nothing.</P>
    <P>I understand that certain costings have been produced.  It has been shown that with the larger unit a considerable saving can be effected, up to twopence a gallon in the case of butter production; but we must not lose sight of, and the Minister certainly must not lose sight of, the social implications of amalgamation.  This is a very important factor.  There is no use presenting a completed and finalised proposal and hoping that this will be rammed down the farmers' throats.  It must be spelt out clearly.  There must be due cognisance taken of the social implications. There are quite a number of social implications in relation to amalgamation and rationalisation.  What provision is going to be made in the case of Section D of this Cooke-Sprague report, where it is pointed out that 53.7 per cent of the cows in this country are in herds of nine or less?  How will we operate bulk milk collection by tanker from these dairy units?  Does it mean that there will be further displacement of people from agriculture and redundancy in the existing creameries?</P>
    <P>While it would appear that the question <Col N="2554" /> of the implementation of a programme of rationalisation is a matter of extreme urgency in so far as the future of the dairying industry is concerned, I want to say that I personally am not fully and absolutely convinced as yet and I certainly am not convinced of the urgency of a drastic programme of rationalisation.  I know of numerous examples throughout the country where rationalisation is necessary and obvious but we must proceed carefully.  We must spell out the advantages in simple language, in language the dairy farmer understands, what is going to be the increased profit to the dairy farmer, what increase in price will he get for his milk as a result of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Assuming then that it has been proved beyond all doubt that our dairy farmers can produce milk as efficiently as any other farmers in Western Europe and admitting that there is scope for improvement, for greater efficiency in the processing and finishing of our milk products, there is another factor that is vitally important. With an increased milk output, no matter how efficiently it is produced or at how low a cost, even in the case of first-class quality products, which I have already proved our dairying industry is producing, unless we have adequate markets and increased outlets for those products we will be up against serious trouble.</P>
    <P>First of all, I believe, and I have stated this again and again in debates in this House, that there is room for a lot of improvement in so far as the home market for milk products is concerned. While within their terms of reference and with all the various limitations they have, the National Dairy Publicity Council have done as good a job as they could, I am convinced that the Council is just not good enough for the job it has to do.  There is room for a good deal of imaginative thinking and of proper planning, room for a dynamic campaign to increase the consumption of milk and milk products here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Cooke-Sprague Report this question is gone into at length.  These consultants confirm and state quite clearly that in their opinion the consumption of milk and milk products on <Col N="2555" /> the Irish market could be considerably increased.  I do not agree with their recommendations as to how it should be done.  In fact, they contradict themselves.  It may be due to a certain amount of confusion, but in one section they would seem to recommend that the job of increasing consumption of dairy products on the home market should be given to An Bord Bainne and in another section they seem to suggest that this job should be given to the Dairy Disposal Company.</P>
    <P>I do not mind who undertakes the task but, in the light of the successful experience that Bord Bainne have had in market promotion in Britain and in 54 other countries to which dairy products are being exported, in my view An Bord Bainne is a proper organisation to launch and to direct an intensive, dynamic sales promotion campaign in this country.  The <i>per capita</i> consumption of butter in Ireland is among the highest in Western Europe but the <i>per capita</i> consumption of cheese here is one of the lowest, if not the lowest.  There is room for imaginative thinking and for research into presenting milk for consumption in a more attractive form by means of various types of drink.  There would seem to be considerable room for improvement here.  I am not being destructive but I believe that, as constituted, the National Dairy Publicity Council is not geared to undertake this type of campaign.</P>
    <P>Difficulties seem to be arising in the British market and I believe we are fast approaching the time when we will have to adopt a &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; policy with Britain.  I have here figures given to me by the Minister last Tuesday week in the Dáil.  It is interesting to note that for the latest year for which figures are available in relation to total imports of dairy products from different countries into the United Kingdom, while the sales of &ldquo;Kerry-gold&rdquo; butter have increased considerably and while our butter is commanding the second highest price in the British market, our total exports of butter to Great Britain in 1967 represented only 6.1 per cent of the total amount of butter imported into Great <Col N="2556" /> Britain; our cheese exports for the same period into Great Britain represented only 9.4 per cent of the total cheese imports into Great Britain.  Now, the British Government, under pressure obviously from the National Farmers Union, are attempting to apply quota restrictions to cheese.  Under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement of 1965, provision was made for increasing our exports of cheese to Britain. The extraordinary situation is, as I pointed out earlier, that our cheese is commanding in the British market a premium price second only to British home-produced cheese and there is increasing and growing demand for Irish cheddar cheese on the British market.  Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1965 we could still, in 1969, increase our cheese exports to Great Britain by a couple of thousand tons without infringing the terms or conditions of that Agreement in any way.  I hope the Government and the Minister will strenuously reject any attempt to restrict or to reduce our cheese exports or to prevent the British Government from giving us a small quota for cheese.</P>
    <P>If necessary, we will have to adopt a policy of getting tough in the sense that, per head of the population, we are Britain's best customer for industrial products.  On a comparison of the balance of trade between Britain and this country with that between Britain and other dairy exporting nations, there is no justification whatsoever for an attempt to reduce our small share of the British market for butter or cheese.</P>
    <P>In regard to skim milk powder, we had 24.6 per cent of the British market; for whole milk powder, 15.5 per cent; for chocolate crumb, 99.9 per cent; for fresh cream, 95 per cent; for condensed milk, 15.1 per cent and for other products 7.2 per cent.  There are certain products there for which there would appear to be little scope on the British market but in regard to butter and cheese, even under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, there is no justification for reducing our present exports to Britain; in fact, there is every argument for forcing the British Government to allow us an increased quota.</P>
    <P>In so far as export markets other <Col N="2557" /> than Great Britain are concerned, the best hope would seem to be in the Bord Bainne proposal for the establishment of special processing plants in the Far East where milk and milk products would be reconstituted.  I understand that this applies particularly to butter oil and milk powder. I understand there are technical difficulties in the way of direct exports, particularly of milk powder, to this region where, because of the climate and humidity, the products tend to deteriorate very rapidly but by having reconstitution plants at strategic points in these markets it would be possible to reconstitute the products and to prolong their life.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked for details of this plan.  I want to be fair about this.  I am not asking him, when replying to the debate, to give any information on these developments because, for obvious reasons of international marketing, we do not want to give any information to our competitors. I hope that Bord Bainne and the Minister and his Department will expedite this project.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in relation to markets for other milk products we are running into difficulty, and this applies to the American market for chocolate crumb. I understand that there is a Government inquiry going on into chocolate crumb prices.  The problem seems to have arisen because a considerable amount of inferior chocolate crumb was being dumped on the American market.  This has been hitting our exports to the US as well as hitting other dairying countries.  I hope when the inquiry has been held the matter will right itself. I believe also that there is a need to pay greater attention to research into the development of new products. There are two products in particular which seem to offer great possibilities, one is casein and the other is butter oil.  One particular type of casein, acid casein, obviously has very great possibilities because the market is there and also because the processing plant is not very costly and relatively simple machinery is adequate.  I understand that investigations are going on and that plans are being formulated with a view to developing this product for <Col N="2558" /> export.  I have the greatest confidence in the ability of Bord Bainne to find outlets for all the milk and milk products we produce.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress to the Minister the importance of ensuring that in 1969 there will not be a repetition of the deplorable situation in May and June last when millions of gallons of milk had to be poured down the drain.  As Deputy Dillon observed last week at Question Time, in the underdeveloped nations millions of people are living at near starvation level, or many of them dying of starvation, because there is a serious shortage of protein foods. Surely with all the international exchange of ideas and all the international organisations, it should be possible to devise ways and means of ensuring that countries like ours, with the soil, climate and natural conditions and the ability to produce products like skim milk powder in abundance, could channel these products to these countries?</P>
    <P>There is quite a lot that could be said about the dairying industry but because of the limitation on this debate I will leave it at that.  However, I want to reiterate that my advice to dairy farmers is to take no notice of any alarms in regard to the over-production of milk.  The best advice to give them is to continue to produce milk and to make their holdings and their methods of production as efficient as possible because the markets are there.  The markets are adequate and can be developed to cope with any foreseeable increase in milk output. In view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, is present I want to refer to something in which I know he is keenly interested, the question of co-operation. Today Deputy Murphy quoted the President of the NFA, Mr. T.J. Maher, in the address he delivered on 21st November, in which he advocated the idea of group farming. The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that group farming is the application of the basic principles of co-operation.  Deputy Murphy indicated that he and the Labour Party are keenly interested in group farming. Normally, I do not make a habit of being egotistic but I am happy to say <Col N="2559" /> that I pioneered group farming in this country because in 1960 I helped to organise a group of farmers in my own parish.  Unfortunately, that parish is in the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Gerry Collins.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are leaving the land at the rate of 10,000 per annum.  When a practical attempt is made to help the farmers, either large or small, we rarely hear about it. Group farming is one method of doing this.  It is a system which has many types of application.  The group with which I have been associated for the last eight years comprises nine farmers. On previous occasions when this Estimate was being debated I have gone into detail about the performance and the achievement of this particular group, which has been featured on television and written up in farming journals not merely in Ireland but abroad.  However, let us face it, with every day that passes the problem of preserving the small farmers' holdings is becoming greater and greater.  I have always held, and I still hold, that the <Col N="2560" /> small farmers can be kept on the land in Ireland.  The way to achieve this is by co-operation, or, as it is now being called, group farming.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear that the Irish Land Commission has recently initiated an experiment whereby instead of giving four distinct holdings to four migrants, they have given them a 200-acre farm which is being run on a partnership basis.  The farm is being worked as one unit.  I believe the answer to the problem, and the only hope for the preservation of the small family holdings in this country, is organisation. On a 200-acre holding it is possible to employ mechanisation and various other efficiency measures which it is not possible to employ on a small independent unit.  I am keenly interested in the idea of group farming. I believe it has exciting possibilities. I hope the experiment which was initiated by the Land Commission will prove successful.  I trust the Department which should, of course, be initiating these schemes, and which should be giving active encouragement to the promotion of this type of experiment, will take the necessary steps in this direction.</P>
      <P>Last year I deplored the fact that the Minister did not make any reference to the role of co-operation in Irish agriculture in the future, and even in this 30-page script nothing is said about the possibility of the co-operation of five, six or 10 smallholders&mdash; maybe they are neighbours&mdash;who farm as a unit, and yet retain their independence and their individual ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry stated today that there is vast scope for the application of this scheme.  There was quite a lot of sense in certain things Deputy Corry said.  He seems to have vast practical experience of the actual organisation of small processing industries in rural areas.  I am taking what he said today to be true.  I do not know the ramifications of the whole thing, but if his facts are correct, then there is hope for the survival of the small family farm.  If a smallholder with five acres in some part of West Cork is able to return a gross of £1,200&mdash;I did not quite catch what line of production he was in&mdash;I believe that with the application <Col N="2561" /> of co-operative principles the small family holding can be made viable and can be preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This should be a major aim in agricultural policy.  Let me say that the only serious attempt ever made to tackle this serious social problem in rural Ireland was made by Deputy James Dillon, when he was Minister for Agriculture, with the introduction of the parish plan for agriculture. The parish plan for agriculture was the outstanding social concept of modern times.  I said this before, that the more I study this whole question of rural life and the various psychological and social problems involved, the more I realise the application of the principles of the parish plan was the correct answer.  Unfortunately, that opportunity was missed.</P>
      <P>The modern idea is group farming, which is an extension of the general idea of the parish plan in agriculture. Without a proper specialist advisory service, it is impossible to have intensive agriculture or to have proper methods of co-operation.  I had experience over eight years of contact with group farming, and one of the biggest difficulties we found was getting proper specialist advice.  I remember the night a few years ago when a number of farmers decided to go into silage production. Seven had tractors, and two had not, and others had different types of machinery.  The problem was how to work out an equitable costing arrangement whereby I would use my tractor and the Parliamentary Secretary would use his harvester and somebody else would use some other machinery and so on.  We could not find a way of apportioning the costs equitably until a certain university professor spent two days with the group and finally arrived at an acceptable costing.</P>

I am not saying this in any derogatory fashion in relation to the competence or expertise of <Col N="2562" /> the existing advisory service, but I believe we look upon the agricultural instructors as being somewhat the same as GPs in the medical line.  They need specialist advice.</P>
      <P>In this context may I say we recently obtained an excellent publication from the Agricultural Institute, &ldquo;The First Ten Years.&rdquo;  The big objection I have to it is that the man who was deeply involved in the initial stage of it, Deputy James Dillon, is omitted from the personalities on the front page; otherwise, this is an excellent production. It contains a considerable amount of information.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foley said here earlier that today people do not realise the amount of valuable research work the Agricultural Institute have undertaken, and that people are being critical.  I have been critical of the Agricultural Institute, and I am critical of them today for one glaring omission. The Agricultural Institute, despite the fact that it has a Rural Economy Division, has economic test farms and has undertaken research into various economic problems and rural sociological problems, has done no research whatsoever into the application of co-operative principles to practical farming.  In other words, no research of any description has been undertaken into the possibilities of group farming.  Something should be done about it before all the small farmers have left the land.  There is so much to talk about in this Estimate that it is difficult to be brief, but I shall try.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the bacon industry which is one of the most important industries in the country, particularly in County Limerick.  Deputy M. <Col N="2564" /> P. Murphy dealt at length with this industry this morning.  He condemned the modern ideas and developments of pig fattening stations.  I do not agree with Deputy Murphy on this.  While I realise that difficulties have been encountered in a number of cases where co-operative pig production units have been established, there are other examples of where these have been very efficient and one of the most outstanding ones which comes to mind is the Glen of Aherlow Pig Producing Co-operative which was pioneered by local initiative and by local community effort.</P>
      <P>This has been an outstanding success and I had an opportunity recently of studying the figures for that particular enterprise as well as the returns from other co-operative pig stations. The basic problem seems to be one of management.  It would appear that where a co-operative pig fattening station is successful, there is always good management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, one will go hand in hand with the other. In cases where problems have arisen and where the returns have not been good, there has been high incidence of disease.  I believe that this basic idea of co-operative pig fattening stations is the best method of ensuring adequate pig production in this country and I sincerely hope that strenuous efforts will be made to tackle this problem of increased pig production.  This is necessary if we are to maintain the existing bacon factories in production and to ensure employment.</P>
      <P>There are many other factors about which I should like to speak but I shall conclude now and give someone else the opportunity of speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell must be out of ammunition by now.  One would think there was nobody in the country but him.  The most striking factor of this speech of the Minister's is where he states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech on the Estimate for Agriculture in May last year I referred to the setting up of a group <Col N="2565" /> to examine the various forms of State expenditure on agriculture with the object of ensuring that we are getting the best value for the money spent and that, in particular, an equitable proportion goes to the smaller farmer.  The report of the group engaged in this review is now almost completed and I expect it to be in my hands within a few months.</P>
    <P>This is something that Irish agriculture has been crying out for for some considerable time and I am glad to see, at long last, that the Minister is having some success and I hope that he will give relief when it is possible.</P>
    <P>We have got to the stage in agriculture where farmers in general are studying agriculture and they realise that the amount of money &mdash; £79,329,000&mdash;that is being spent on agriculture this year, is sufficient but there is the feeling in the country that farmers, and especially small farmers, are not getting the return for the money and one must always remember that two-thirds of the farmers of this country have valuations of less than £30.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer this evening to some matters affecting my own constituency but, first of all, I should like to say that, from listening to Deputy Murphy, one got the impression that the Minister had advocated wheat growing last year, more so than in any other year, for which moneys for the surpluses were not readily available. These surpluses occurred on account of the extraordinary harvest we had this year and to the fine weather in general.  From listening to speakers of both Opposition Parties, one would think that they predicted the good summer before it came at all.</P>
    <P>About two months ago, Deputy Murphy was invited to Wexford by Macra na Feirme to speak on behalf of the Labour Party but he did not turn up.  The reason was that he had no policy to talk about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, they had no policy, and this morning the Deputy produced a white document which, as far as I could see, was the speech of the President of the NFA to the annual general meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, it was Gerry Fitt's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Either that or the NFA speech: one or the other.  I think we are getting away from the basic principles. The drainage of agricultural land is the first basic principle of agriculture. It would be most interesting to know the average output per acre of our land.  There are quite a substantial number of productive farmers in this country at the moment but a lot remains to be done.  Even in my constituency, where we have an excellent band of men working in the Land Project office, there was a back-log of work up to this year.  I think they got some help in order to get it completed. Nevertheless, the amount of land they survey every year and the amount of land they drain every year shows a wide gap and something must be done to narrow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers in Wexford who, up to a few years ago, had been in tillage production swung into milk.  I am not blaming the price of wheat but I think the comparative price of barley and wheat is completely wrong.  There has been quite a substantial swing back to wheat but something will have to be done about congestion at points of intake.  We have seen farmers waiting outside mills for three and four days with their wheat.  If farmers could have their own dryers, with the assistance of a better type of grant, or some other system, it would alleviate the congestion at intake points.  The mills certainly will not be in a position to take in wheat and store it or to put <Col N="2567" /> up dryers capable of taking it in large enough quantities.  The only solution is for the farmer to dry it and he would need an incentive grant for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I have had numerous complaints from a number of constituents about the price of oats.  A number of farmers informed me that merchants will not offer even 1/- a bushel for oats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy get me a few bushels at that rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get the Parliamentary Secretary 100 bushelling 43 and they are not offered even 1/- a bushel for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall talk to the Deputy later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position in South Wexford.  Something must be done to alleviate the position.</P>
      <P>When the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, advised farmers 18 months ago to hold on to their cattle until the following spring, the Opposition at that time asked where would the farmers get the money to feed them over the winter period and raised all kind of objections to Deputy Haughey's advice. Time proved that that advice was sound.  Prices improved very considerably the following spring and have held their level ever since.  This year, cattle exports have been quite substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the beef subsidy. Consider the farmer who is getting approximately 1/- per gallon for his milk and maybe £25 subsidy per cow. The farmer is now asked to produce beef at a subsidy of £8 per cow. Thousands of small farmers have not more than two cows.  The Minister could put a ceiling at the other end and take the money from the upper bracket and possibly bring in the first two cows.  That would encourage the smaller farmer to go into beef production. What is the position of the farmer who has 20 cows and is supplying milk to the creamery or is wholesaling milk and who wishes to rear <Col N="2568" /> calves and to produce beef with ten of those cows?  Is it possible for him to get subsidy on the ten cows and still produce milk for the creamery with the other ten cows?  A great many farmers have been inquiring about this and I would be grateful to the Minister if he could give us that small detail when he replies.</P>
    <P>There was reference by the Minister to the setting up of a board for the promotion of cattle exports.  That is something we have been seeking for some considerable time.  There has been a feeling that enough was not being done abroad to encourage exports to countries other than Great Britain.  I certainly welcome this new board and I hope it will get moving as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to raise here the problem of sheep scab in North Wexford. It is particularly prevalent in that area and I believe the Department are not doing enough to tackle the problem. It is a difficult problem.  There are farmers who have dipped their ewes 11 times this year and they have not yet been cured.  It would be out of the question to dip ewes at the moment when they are heavy in lamb and the weather is turning frosty.  The scab has been spreading rapidly.  I have been told that dipping is not sufficient; it can cure the disease but, because it has been spreading so rapidly in North Wexford, dipping does not seem to be the solution to the problem.  Thousands of sheep are affected.  I believe it originated in the mountain areas; the farmers did not get all their sheep down at dipping time and I believe that is the reason why the disease is now so prevalent.  It is a very serious problem and I appeal to the Minister to give it all the attention he can command.  One farmer has 450 ewes.  He brought in 50 recently out of which four or five were affected and now the whole flock are affected. It is a terrible scourge.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to vegetable production.  This year the farmers in Kilmore who produced onions found themselves in the unhappy position that they could get only £32 a ton for their produce on the Dublin market. The reason for the low price was <Col N="2569" /> because the Department had allowed onions to be imported and stockpiled. Last year these farmers in Kilmore got anything from £70 to £90 a ton.  I believe our own producers are entitled to protection.  Some 500 tons of onions were produced in the area this year and I am informed that a considerable quantity of these onions was dumped because of the stockpiling of imported onions in Dublin.  Home producers could not sell their produce because those who sell them for them would not deal with them until they had disposed of the imported onions. These farmers cannot sell anywhere else except through the Dublin market. I understand the Department has now given a guarantee and I hope a similar situation will not occur next year.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years a great number of small farmers who used to produce blackcurrants have had to go out of production because there was no market available.  The price had fallen by two-thirds and it was no longer economic to produce blackcurrants. Lately the price has increased a little but the problem now is that, if blackcurrants are to be produced economically, irrigation is vitally important and irrigation can cost anything up to £500 an acre.  No small farmer could undertake such an outlay and I suggest some kind of grant in the region of, say, £150 an acre would help these farmers to undertake production again.  I hope the Minister will consider the matter sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke about group farming.  Those who should implement group farming are the county committees of agriculture.  Of course, some of these committees are an irresponsible lot, to be quite honest, and some of the members are not practical farmers at all.  Some have no knowledge whatsoever of farming. Responsibility for forming group schemes should, I think, be given to the instructors.  Such schemes would be well worthwhile.  Such schemes will have to be implemented if the small farmer is to survive.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Land Project and I want to go back to it for a moment.  In relation to the grants paid at present one must certainly take <Col N="2570" /> into consideration that they were increased two years ago from £30 to £45 per acre but, immediately that happened, the contractors put up their prices, and now we are back in the same position as we were when the grant was £30 per acre, as drainage is costing anything in the region of £25 to £30 per acre along with the grant.</P>
    <P>If the Agricultural Credit Corporation would make moneys available for this purpose at a reduced rate, we would have more land drained, and more work done by the Land Project, and we would not be wasting time because I know that some farmers&mdash; and I suppose it was the same down through the years although the percentage is not too big&mdash;will not go ahead with the work unless they get money out of the grant.  Considering the amount of land to be drained, and the rate at which it is being drained at the moment, it will take 100 years to do it all.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that at long last we are having a reappraisal of how the money is being spent.  I hope it will be published soon because, generally speaking, farmers are getting to the stage where they would like to know before they produce an article what they will get for the end product. Cattle possibly are the greatest example of this.  If the farmers are to produce store cattle or fat cattle in the future, and if the Minister's scheme is to be a success, they want to know what the price per cwt will be for the animal when they come to sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand that to implement such a scheme the money may have to be taken out of the £80 million and some other scheme may have to be knocked on the head but, if the farmers knew what price they would get for the end product, they would have <Col N="2571" /> no hesitation in going into the production of the article.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to hear that Deputy T. O'Donnell feels very happy about the milk situation in the future, so Deputy Coughlan can rest easy in Limerick where they are milk producers. Deputy O'Donnell assured the milk producers of Limerick that there is no fear for the future.  One must not be too sure of oneself.  I have an article here in the European Community Bulletin of April, 1968, which deals with the butter situation in the EEC at the moment.  It says:</P>
    <P>The common market organisation for milk was introduced in November, 1964.  Last July the Council fixed the common prices, which were scheduled to come into effect on April 1.  Stocks of butter were estimated at 150,000 tons on April 1 this year.  The surplus for the 1968-69 season is expected to reach 900,000 tons, that for 1969-70 130,000 tons, and it would be likely to continue to grow by 40,000 tons each year. The decision to sell cut-price butter to hospitals and barracks, and the related measures, should decrease the surplus by 140,000 tons this season. The subsidies involved will cost the Farm Fund $250 million in 1968-69, rising to an estimated $350 million a year for the period 1969 to 1972.</P>
    <P>So, in my opinion, the situation within the Common Market does not look too rosy.  The Minister said the position in Great Britain is not too healthy.</P>
    <P>In connection with cheese, the sooner some satisfactory solution can be found to the problem in the export of cheddar cheese the sooner the milk producing farmers in Wexford who supply milk to the cheese factory, which exports quite a considerable amount of cheddar cheese, would be in a position to know where they are going.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the twotier price system because although one penny does not seem to be a lot, the total amount of money involved is quite substantial.  If the small farmers are to be encouraged to stay on the land milk is one of the many items they can produce readily at a low cost.  Milk <Col N="2572" /> farmers in general, especially in the south of Ireland are, in my estimation, damn lazy.  Possibly some people may not agree with me about this but the counties Limerick, Kerry, Cork and Clare are supposed to be creamery areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In so far as the farming dispute is concerned, we would all welcome a solution to the problem and the solution rests with the farmers at the moment.  I am glad to see that Deputy Clinton at long last agrees, according to today's <i>Irish Times</i> anyway&mdash;they never misquote anybody of course, least of all Deputy Clinton I am sure&mdash;that until the farming organisations get together there can never be a solution to this problem. It is not so long ago since I heard him saying different.</P>

      <P>I certainly welcome the situation in which at last Fine Gael have seen the light and have said to the farmers to get together because they have been the leading light in the effort to try to divide the farming community for some considerable time. I hope to see in the near future, especially in the season of goodwill, farming organisations getting together and solving their differences.  I am quite sure that the Minister and the Taoiseach and their colleagues in the Cabinet will have no hesitation in meeting the farming community when the farming organisations have put their own house in order.</P>
      <P>I want to say a final word in connection with the Agricultural Institute. We have two branches of that dynamic institute in my constituency.  One of them is in Johnstown Castle and the other is in Clonroche.  In so far as Johnstown Castle is concerned many things are being done there.  Deputy Gibbons would agree with me in this. It is Government money they are spending and they are supposed to be in the limelight in so far as the agricultural community is concerned but I never heard of farmers skulling bullocks in the middle of winter.  Thirty cattle were skulled down there last winter or the winter before and they lost 14 of them.  Fourteen of them died because the cattle were skulled at the wrong time of the year.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure Deputy Dowling represents the housewives of Ballyfermot.  Before I sit down I want to explain something to Deputy Dowling before he gets up.  It is in connection with the wheat situation.  It concerns the amount of homegrown wheat which the millers are putting in the bread.  As I understand it, legislation does not allow any more than 75 per cent of homegrown wheat to be put in bread at the moment.  Legislation should certainly be introduced in this House&mdash;and I think it would be welcomed on all sides&mdash;to ensure that at least 80 to 85 per cent of homegrown wheat would be put in bread.  I suppose the problem would then arise that the loaf would be smaller and Deputy Dowling's housewives would be complaining. The loaf would be smaller in size but it would be the same weight. I want to explain this to the city Deputies.</P>

Remember that everybody is a taxpayer and this is a thing that the Opposition seemingly do not remember. They voted against the taxes being implemented so that surplus wheat could be subsidised and sold back to the farmers at the same price as feeding barley.  If they come into <Col N="2575" /> my constituency during the by-election I will tell the farmers of County Wexford that the Opposition voted against taxes, against the mini-Budget provisions, that would allow the Government to sell back over-produced wheat to the farmers at feeding barley price, and also the penny for the milk.</P>

      <P>Seeing that our time is limited to approximately twelve hours for this debate on our greatest industry and seeing that one individual saw fit to occupy one-quarter of that time in devoting himself to the industry generally, failing to consider that other people had a contribution to make, I have to be as brief as possible in order to stay within the realms of charity.  On such an Estimate as this we should speak of the foundation on which the industry should have been erected rather than indulge in the diversions to which we had to listen&mdash;I had not because I would not&mdash;for the last three and a half hours.  In my charity, I have to be as brief as possible and, therefore, will confine myself to those matters that most affect the constituents I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his whole approach to our greatest industry, has set about creating a great deal of trouble for himself.  He set about the division of the farming community, in which he <Col N="2576" /> failed hopelessly, and he then set about courting their patronage by word rather than deed.  While he spoke in one manner he acted in the opposite manner.  If the Minister were sincerely anxious to solve the problems which beset the agricultural industry he would gather around him in a friendly atmosphere the people directly concerned in that industry instead of antagonising them and trying to separate them and to set one against the other.  He has failed completely in this attempt.</P>
    <P>Now it is clear that he treats this House with the same contempt as he has treated the farming community. He came in here for ten or 12 minutes to deliver 30 pages of a Civil Service speech, gave us a whole harangue of figures which meant absolutely nothing and ignored the House from that minute to this.  Whether he is at a funeral or a wake, I do not know. This is the place where he should be. He has the impertinence to send in junior Ministers to take advice.</P>

      <P>Indeed, their names are all over the 26 Counties and they were well named on 16th October, and branded.  However, this all goes to show the farming community what the Minister thinks is good for the industry&mdash;the runaway tactics, sticking his head in the sand, the effort to divide and conquer.  As I have said, I want to address myself to the industry which concerns my constituency.  Forgetting the benefits derived from surplus milk whether in the form of whole milk, skim milk or powdered milk and the 3½ hours spent in talking about things that could never happen, I want to apply myself to a matter that can be of benefit not alone to the small farmer but to the industrialist and to the skilled and unskilled industrial worker. I have in mind the greatest facet of agriculture, namely, the bacon industry. This industry is of the greatest importance because of the employment it provides and its above-average export market.  I want the Minister to take notice of the importance of this industry.  He told us in his introductory speech that the pig population is increasing, that prices have increased and that everything is going as it should and better than was expected. He told us exactly the same last year and his predecessor, the year before, told us exactly the same thing.</P>
      <P>I want to remind him that his figures, which were obtained, I am sure, through the Civil Service&mdash;the Merrion Square approach&mdash;it may be the Ballyfermot approach next year&mdash; are not in complete agreement with the figures given by people who are most closely connected with the industry.  We must take into consideration that daily there is very large scale smuggling of pigs into the country.  Anybody who has any connection with the trade has no doubts about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want now to quote from a person of repute, the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  In his report he suggested that by providing a more reliable system of pricing related to feeding stuffs costs, and removing the fear that increasing production would depress prices, conditions could be created which would enable producers to expand their output in confidence.  He put his finger on the problem which faces the bacon industry and that is the costs and costings generally of bacon production. The Minister should apply himself to costings in the bacon industry.  He has allowed the prices for feeding stuffs to be &ldquo;gangsterised&rdquo; by certain people in that line because the Department's figures show the differing prices of those pig feeding stuffs and that there is a wide variation in different parts of the country.  Farmers in Dungarvan pay £34 10. a ton for pig fattening meal while the same meal is sold in Castlebar and Athlone for £40 a ton, in Wexford for £38 and in Kilkenny for £35 10. In Dungarvan sow and weaner meal costs £37 a ton but in the two western towns already mentioned, where the Department have been making a big drive to increase pig production, the same meal varies from over £40 a ton to £44; it is £44 in Castlebar and £42 per ton in Athlone.  In an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> the writer stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until some rational price structure for pig feed is introduced the schemes which have recently been introduced by the Department to increase pig production will have very little effect; despite the grant for sows and fattening <Col N="2579" /> units being doubled in the west, the farmers there still hold memories of 1965 as long as there is a £7 (19 per cent) difference in the price of feed between two areas of the country, to their disadvantage.</P>
    <P>How in the name of goodness can we have anything like an equity of price for pig production when a situation like this is allowed, with such a differential in prices between one producer and another?  It cannot be done and until the Minister stabilises the prices of feed stuffs, it will be very difficult if not impossible, to encourage pig rearing and bacon production.  That is fundamental.  You can talk about piggery grants, sow farrowing grants, bacon factory improvement grants and so on, but until you go from the bonham up to the day it is turned out&mdash; the boy from Ballyfermot would know nothing about bonhams, he might know something about crubeens on a Saturday night and he is showing the jowls of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You are a bit of a bloodsucker yourself but soon you will get your answer in Ballyfermot.  However, this is fundamental and the advisers who have been telling the Minister how to handle the bacon trade should find out what exactly is wrong with the industry.  The figures for killings have been falling, despite what the Minister said.  He has never yet mentioned that 2,000 pigs came over the Border every week.  Were it not for those 2,000 pigs you would have at least one or two factories closing down. For the Minister's information I want to quote again the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission where he says in reference to the year 1967:</P>
      <P>The year had been difficult and unsatisfactory.  Killings at 1,445,590 head were 12 per cent below the figure for the previous year, and were the lowest since 1960.</P>
      <P>That is despite the fact that the Minister and his advisers have been telling us there is no need to worry about the the bacon industry.  Further on in the chairman's report it is stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2580" /> The total number of pigs of all classes purchased for slaughter by licensed curers in 1967 was 1,445,590 or 12 per cent below the figure of 1,637,134 in 1966.  The amount paid for the pigs purchased by licensed curers in 1967 was £25,623,320 compared with £27,307,660 in 1966. In addition to pigs purchased on their own account licensed curers killed during the year 7,970 pigs for farmers and others.  In 1966 these killings amounted to 7,718 head.  In 1967 authorised pork exporters purchased 9,100 pigs approximately, mainly for export in carcase form. After reaching a record level of 1.8 million head in 1965, killings declined in 1966 to 1.6 million and the contraction continued into 1967.  The total kill in that year of 1.4 million was the lowest recorded since 1960.</P>

      <P>These are the figures and the statements of the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, which cannot be disputed, despite the evasive and misleading answers that have been given here by the Minister and his predecessor to questions which we have put down with regard to this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without holding up the time of this House, as some Deputies have set out to do, I should like to impress on the Minister one or two matters of importance about this trade.  We must guarantee, in advance, to the farmer a price for the finishing of his pig. This guarantee should not be like the one given in regard to food prices, where the difference between Dungarvan, Castlebar and Athlone is £7 and £8 a ton in the cost of feeding stuffs.  I do not know how the Minister or his officials can tolerate this situation for one moment because if they had the industry at heart the first thing they would do would be to make the production of bacon attractive to the farmer.  The only way to make it attractive is to make it pay. How it can pay with these variations in the prices of foodstuffs is beyond me, but the Minister has closed his eyes to the situation.  I do not know <Col N="2581" /> who is getting what out of the price differences between Athlone, Castlebar and Dungarvan; but somebody is, and it is not the farmer who is producing the pig for the factory.  If the Minister wants to put this industry into a viable position, which it is not now, he should rectify that anomaly, because the longer it goes on the worse it becomes.</P>
    <P>On top of that the Minister must guarantee the price.  There is a variation in price every day of the week. The prices at the different bacon factories are published in the daily press three days a week, and seldom if ever do the prices of all the bacon factories coincide.  The reason, of course, is that there is such a scarcity and there is so much smuggling over the Border every week that they are all trying to grab what they can in order to keep their factory open.  This is a problem the Minister has to tackle.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also go further afield to seek outlets for the finished article.  We in the Labour Party were laughed to scorn when we parsed and analysed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and forecast the repercussions it would have.  We saw the foundation on which it was laid, that it was absolutely fluid, and that it would end as it has ended now&mdash;and it did not take a Cassandra to forecast this.  We were the only people to point out to the Government and to the then Minister the faults and the defects in this Agreement.  Unfortunately, we were proved right.  Mr. Wilson, at one whim, cast the whole thing to the four winds of Heaven. The result was that the Taoiseach had to go cap in hand to London.  Indeed, there was no necessity for him to go because we all knew in advance what the result would be.  Like the drowning man, they will grasp at anything that passes their way.</P>
    <P>I shall try to curtail what I have to say although I could spend five or six hours on the various facets of this industry.  There is an enormous demand for carcase beef not alone on the British market but on the American market.  We are exporting from Limerick in a big way; we could do it in a bigger way, but I believe the incentives are not there <Col N="2582" /> which should be there for the export of dressed beef.  We all know the futility of tieing ourselves to the British market.  We have pointed that out time and time again.  There was a time when we used to hear from those benches: &ldquo;Blow up their ships&rdquo;. &ldquo;Burn everything but their coal&rdquo;.  All that ballyhoo has been silenced, and now we are putting our hands in our pockets and giving Britain a free loan of £25 million, no interest charge.  We will pass on that interest charge to the taxpayers of our own land.  The ordinary worker, through his cigarettes or his stout, will pay this interest.  Instead of putting our heel on John Bull, we are now taking him by the hand and pulling him out of the mess he is in. It is a great change from the days of &ldquo;Wrap the Green Flag Round Me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the importance of these two sectors of agriculture.  I could go on and cover the whole agricultural field but, as I have said, in charity I must leave a bit for somebody else.  I do not want to be like the boy and the nuts.  It is a very bad philosophy.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will be located between now and Christmas time, that the postman will find him somewhere around Donegal.  Maybe he will be in Bundoran taking some sea breezes and fresh air in an effort to clear his befogged outlook on the Department he controls.  Wherever he is I hope the views on his Department will reach him and that he will consider what has been said.  I hope he will remember one thing and one thing only: despite the figures and despite all he has said in these 31 pages, the fact remains that the people who get a living out of agriculture are dissatisfied and &ldquo;dissatisfied' is a very mild word but I suppose we have to be mild when facing the festive season.  Despite all the nonsense read here last night by the Minister, he should bear in mind the fact that the people whom he has tried to divide and the people whom he scorned not so very long ago and whose patronage he is now trying to succour verbally, but not by action, have won and beaten him and I hope this has taught him a lesson.</P>
    <P>Bearing these things in mind, I shall <Col N="2583" /> conclude my contribution and I hope that I have not held up the intellectual from the Ballyfermot region who is coming after me.  That will be something worth listening to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency, which is mainly an agricultural one, I wish to say a few words on this Estimate.  It is well known that this country above all others has to depend mainly on agriculture and it has been felt down through the years that, since Fianna Fáil came to power, they did not give enough consideration to and concentrate upon the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>Quite a lot was said about what had to be done to start industry in the towns and about the tourist build-up and so on but I am convinced that there should have been far more emphasis on agriculture.  If this had been done we would not have the flight from the land that is now taking place, even from good counties.  Since 1956, 109,000 people have left the land.  That should not happen in a country with a climate such as ours and with the success of our crops, where they are properly handled.  Certainly, there should not be the disregard for work on the land that has crept in among the agricultural community.  Naturally, we will have some poor seasons but nobody will put the blame for these on the Government.  At the same time, we believe that the things which really mattered were neglected.  The poultry industry, for instance, is at a very low ebb today and we have great difficulty in persuading people to go into the pig industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great difficulty, too, in many parts of the country in getting people to grow any farm produce except the basic minimum that is needed to keep the home going and some of them are not even doing that because they can often buy the produce cheaper.  The real kernel of the problem is that we have no proper marketing facilities for our produce.  If there are surpluses in certain crops, there is no way of absorbing them.  That, in my experience, is one of the reasons that prevents people from going into agriculture.  I know this from experience because I <Col N="2584" /> work on the land myself.  Not so very long ago the people marched from every part of the country to Dublin and we witnessed one of the biggest parades that we had in Dublin for a long time.  It was fortunate that everything went off so quietly on that particular occasion.</P>
    <P>That parade was due to the fact that the then Minister did not meet the farmers as he should have done.  Since then, we have had a change in the ministry but we are convinced that the rift still exists and many hard working people are asking themselves what is wrong when the able representatives of the farming community cannot reach agreement with the Minister.</P>
    <P>There should be an open door to these people and the Minister should be able to say to them that they should come in and discuss the matter from A to Z.  If it was not finished in one day it would be finished in two or three days.  We know from experience and from meetings that have taken place that these people are sincere and dedicated, that they are doing a job not for what they can get out of it but for what they can do for the farmers. I appeal to the Minister, seeing that this debate is going on in the closing stages of this year, to get this matter settled once and for all.</P>
    <P>There was almost a rift in the Government recently when the Taoiseach made one statement and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made another relating to the North but I believe that no matter what differences the Taoiseach and the Minister may have in that way they should come together and decide on getting this matter concerning the farmers settled.</P>
    <P>Farming is an occupation that the people of this country love but they need encouragement to follow it up. The Government should decide on giving guaranteed prices to the people who produce crops on their farms. Without this, the people will not work as they would like to work.  In good counties, of course, there will be guaranteed prices.  That does not arise in the west of Ireland and it is in those types of counties that every encouragement should be given because of the <Col N="2585" /> emigration drain.  If something is not done immediately to arrest the flow of people from those areas it will be too late.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the farmer's wife in this country was able to run the home on the price she got for eggs, fowl and pigs.  That day is gone.  Eggs can now be marketed at 1/- a dozen. Considering the high cost of feedingstuffs and the time and labour involved then, even if she received 2/- a dozen for the eggs, it would not pay her.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked about the subsidy on the beef cow or on the cow that is going to calve.  It is applicable only to the farmer who is not selling milk to the creamery.  That is a problem which we shall always have until this or some other Government decide to do what they should do and what is right and proper in this case.  I found that the one thing that encouraged people on bad farms was the subsidy on the calf and, also on the mountain farm, the milk subsidy which they would get out of the cow.  They were sure from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; that the cow would yield some money.</P>
    <P>The position now is that a person with a small farm and four or five cows will get an increase of one penny on the gallon of milk which he sends to the creamery while his neighbour, who may not be free to milk the cows and to send it to the creamery, and who decides to keep eight cows with sucking calves will receive a cheque for £48 in respect of six of those eight cows.  He is still better off than the small farmer who sends his milk to the creamery.  I always say that every smallholder should be given a subsidy on the calf.  If it is confined to the first five cows on every farm it would mean that some money would go into every man's home and that every man would have a chance of an equal share of it.  The danger in the heifer scheme is that the man who can well do without the money will come off best because he can afford to put in extra heifers and to let them calve and then he has good young cows for fattening up again.</P>
    <P>The Minister said more money is being spent on the land reclamation scheme.  That is good.  It is a very <Col N="2586" /> important scheme, especially in SligoLeitrim where there is a good deal of low-lying, sodden and heavy land.</P>
    <P>The smallholders scheme, introduced not so very long ago, is cutting across this other scheme now.  The £8 a cow is more or less cutting across it for the reason that a farmer has to make up to £700 to qualify under this scheme.  He can now go back to the dry cow instead of producing a greater amount of milk.</P>
    <P>A strong deterrent in relation to the land reclamation scheme is that many people have difficulty in getting their grant paid to them and have to go to the county council about it and then maybe to their Teachta Dála and the Department and they decide that it is the last time they will have anything to do with it.  If an inspector discovers that a farmer has done a reasonably good job he should not be tied to a few inches in depth or in width. The work is hard.  I should not like to see people held too rigidly to the rules provided a good effort is made to do the job.</P>
    <P>I must thank the Minister and the Department for a substantial local improvements grant to County Leitrim. It will bring about quite an amount of drainage work.  Some good plots of land will be drained which otherwise would not be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Considering how badly land is needed for the extension of existing holdings we should be careful to ensure that useful land will not be taken over for afforestation purposes.  If a small farm is being taken over by, say, the Forestry Division or the Land Commission we should always ask ourselves if the land could usefully be added to that of some local farmer to enlarge his holding.  Recently, I met two hard-working farmers who had rented a farm for 40 years and had it in good condition.  They went out one morning to discover a notice posted up outside by the Forestry Division to the effect that it was due for planting.</P>
    <P>In an area in which farms are so small and at a time when so much emphasis is laid on protecting the small farmer in the West the Government should, I think, move in and say that this land must be given to the small <Col N="2587" /> farmers in the area who are in need of it.  Imagine how these farmers must feel when they see ten acres of land being taken away from each of them for forestry, acres they have husbanded for 40 years and more with good results. It is difficult to imagine what they must think of our administration. I intend to raise this at the meeting of the local county committee of agriculture because it has been brought to our notice on a few occasions that, if there is a reasonable case made on behalf of such people, the Department will consider it sympathetically.  I intend to pursue this to the bitter end to see if the Department will consider it.  If proper action is taken in such cases that will help to keep the people on the land; but if we allow the land to be taken away from them and planted then they will just pack up and go.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the millions channelled into agriculture.  A substantial amount of money does go into agriculture but we must never forget that a large percentage of that money goes into salaries and wages.  In my area we have to pay 20 agricultural officers and, when they are paid and when other expenses are met, there is damn all left for agriculture proper. This is something that should be examined very closely to see if more could be channelled into agriculture direct.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have a very close look at the number of farms taken over by the Land Commission. He could play a big part in speeding up the taking over of farms and the subsequent division of the land.  People have been waiting 20 years for a few more acres on which to grow crops and some of these people have become old men waiting for land to be allotted.  Unproductive farms should be taken over and given to those who will work the land.  No one should expect people to work hard on an uneconomic holding.  On the other hand, the man who is given an extra ten or 20 acres is also given encouragement; he will have something to reap as a result of his labours.  Nothing annoys people more than to see land for which they are hungry taken over <Col N="2588" /> by the forestry people and planted with trees right up to their very doors.  That is one of the reasons why so many have packed it in and gone elsewhere in search of a livelihood.</P>
    <P>Feeding stuffs should be made available at a lower price.  When the farmer starts feeding around Christmas time he finds himself very short of cash indeed.  The ground wheat should be put on the market at a lower price than 37/- a cwt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing the consumers of the produce of our farms, it is only fitting that a Dublin city Deputy should say a few words on this very important Estimate.  The debate has been an interesting one.  I have taken a number of notes and I hope to be able to make a few points.  The Minister referred to the setting up of a group to examine the various forms of State expenditure on agriculture with the object of ensuring that we are getting the best possible value for the money spent.  This is very desirable. I hope the group will be truly representative. Such a group should be representative of all sections of the community and I ask the Minister to ensure that all sections, including housewives, are represented so that we may have the views of all.</P>
      <P>With regard to the problems of the housewife, it seems to me that from the time the produce leaves the farm to the time it reaches the housewife it increases substantially in price.  In fact, the increase is very often out of all proportion when one considers the effort put in by the farmer at the initial stage and his profit and the price of the produce when it reaches the housewife. It goes through the middleman &mdash;and in some cases he is called the fiddleman&mdash;who by many devices dictates the price structure in very many ways of farm produced foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the marketing of foodstuffs is something that must get prior consideration not only from the farming community but also from the Minister and the Department.  I believe the farmer should get a fair return for his labour, and a fair income for the amount of effort involved and the amount of capital invested in his farm.  The housewife in the city feels <Col N="2589" /> the same way, as would any reasonable person.  The unfortunate situation in relation to the housewife is that she has to pay the highest possible price for the foodstuffs that are produced, and which she cannot do without for the everyday requirements of the family.</P>
    <P>This woman is being robbed.  That is the proper word because no other word seems to fit the situation.  As we have been told earlier, when eggs are produced or sold for 1/- or 1/6d a dozen the housewife has to pay 5/-, 6/- or 7/- a dozen for them.  When I was a little boy I was often told the story about the goose which laid the golden eggs.  Judging by the price which the housewife has to pay for eggs, some of the hens are now in the same business, because eggs are very dear on this section of the community which is so dependent on eggs, potatoes and other produce.</P>
    <P>I often wondered why potatoes had such names as Golden Wonders but I do not wonder now because it seems that someone is on the gold standard so far as potatoes are concerned. Judging by the price some Deputies who represent the farming community say they are paying, and what the housewife pays, there is something wrong somewhere along the line.  It would seem that if a sack of potatoes travels 100 yards its price increases by about 100 or 200 per cent.  To me that is wrong, and it is a problem which needs examination by the farming community to help themselves, and also by the Department to ensure that the housewife is not robbed in the future.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the various Deputies representing the farming community demanding increases in the whole range of subsidies.  I should like to deal with a few little items.  The housewife in the city pays approximately 11/- for a lb. of decent fillet steak.  Not only does she pay 11/- for the steak, but she has also paid the farmer through taxation in one form or another for the purpose of producing this lb. of steak.  She pays taxes which go to offset his rates, to pay for his fertiliser, to assist in the reclamation of his land, to assist him with his silage pits, and his calf and <Col N="2590" /> heifer subsidy schemes.  I would think that the housewife almost owns the heifer.  It would seem that as she pays so much she has a fair share in the heifer on the farm through her efforts and the efforts of her family.</P>
    <P>A single person pays income tax if he earns over £6 5s, and a married man pays income tax over £394, but the farmer who produces beef, and who has already got a wide range of subsidies to assist him to produce it, does not pay income tax, and his rates are rebated to some degree.  Then the housewife is asked to pay 11/- or 11/6d for a pound of fillet steak.  I have made this out in my own way and, taking everything into consideration, in my reckoning this pound of steak costs about a guinea to the housewife because she has already made other payments by way of taxation.  She pays 11/- over the counter, and she has already paid taxation in various forms so she is paying about a guinea for the steak.  It must be borne in mind that this woman's purse has a bottom and she is scraping the bottom of the purse at the moment.  If further subsidies are to be applied, we must give consideration to the housewife in the Ballyfermot and Crumlin areas, which I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When I get in there I will look after their interests, and I will look after them here.  Of course, that is not the only problem.  There are also mutton cutlets, bacon, cabbage, turnips and other items produced by farmers.  The housewife has to buy them at very high prices after paying subsidies by way of taxation.  Special consideration should be given to that whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this committee should examine in great detail the expenditure on the subsidies given to farmers.  This year an estimated £80 million is given by way of reliefs to the farming community.  I <Col N="2591" /> hope that this committee can be used for the benefit of the farmers and the housewives, and that it will be able to assist in making some reduction in prices, so that the housewife may be able to obtain commodities at reasonable prices to which she will not object. I trust the Minister will speed up this aspect of marketing and do what he can to ensure that justice is done in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said some imaginative thinking should be done.  I agree. He thought more money should be piled in, but I could not agree with that until such time as I was satisfied that the money was being expended in the best possible way.  I have had some doubts about this, and I think the Department will have to spell out in great detail to the housewives of this city the details of the whole subsidy system, and indicate where the money is going, and how it is being used in order to relieve this tension which sometimes annoys and irritates the housewives.  Maybe I do not understand the problem, but I know that £80 million is an awful lot of money to be pumped into a system.  I would like to know at this stage, when it takes all this money to subsidise the agricultural industry, is there no such thing as an economic cow and, if there is, what would be the cost of an economic cow. From my reckoning of it, taking into consideration all aspects, it must be very substantial indeed.  It would seem that there is no such thing.  If this cannot be produced without the subsidy, we want to see where the subsidy we are paying by way of taxation goes to meet each individual case.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the farmer for looking for the best price possible I agree that the farmer should get a reasonable return for his money and for his effort.  The man who ploughs the field in all types of weather, who puts in the fertiliser, puts in the seed, looks after and cultivates the crop gets a very small price in comparison with the middleman or the &ldquo;fiddleman,&rdquo; or the gangster in some cases, who upsets the price structure for the housewives of this country.  On that basis perhaps the farmer is not getting what he is entitled to.  But it is not the <Col N="2592" /> housewives' fault; it is the fault of the individuals in between the housewife and the farmer.  I would say it is up to the farmer himself to ensure that the produce reaches the housewife in a more direct way.  Then the housewife would be only too happy to give him a reasonable price; the produce would be much fresher and the farmer could expect a better price than he is getting from this faceless man or men who are accumulating a vast amount of money by sitting at home or in a cosy office somewhere in this city or in other towns just raking in at the expense of the unfortunate farmer and the unfortunate housewife.</P>
    <P>I agree with the imaginative thinking which Deputy O'Donnell mentioned, but it must be directed the other way, too.  He must look outward as well as inward on this particular problem.  Deputy O'Donnell also mentioned the production of cheese.  I agree that this is a problem and it is a matter that causes me great concern not alone outside this House but also in this House.  It amazes me that the hotels and restaurants in this city and indeed the restaurant in this House have on their menu cards cheese at 2/- a portion. One pays 2/- for a 6d. or 9d. portion of cheese.  This is no way to advertise this very delicious product that we have in abundance here.  Some research should be done into our city hotels, particularly during the tourist season, and indeed into the restaurant here and other restaurants, to see that cheese is sold to the consumer at an economic and reasonable price and to see that he is not presented with a cheese board and presented with 6d. or a shilling's worth of cheese costing in some hotels 3/- a portion.  Two shillings is bad enough in our own restaurant. You do not get value for the money spent.  That is not because our product is not the best.  It is the best.  It is because of the price structure and because somebody is trying to force this commodity off the menu because it may cause them some little problem of storage or presentation.</P>
    <P>The presentation indeed is not always the best in the hotels and restaurants.  It is something we should give an amount of thought to.  The packaging and presentation is certainly <Col N="2593" /> very excellent when it comes from the factory.  I would say that the Minister should stimulate the consumption of this very important commodity by having a look into its presentation by the hotels and restaurants and the price structure.  Much could be done to encourage the consumption of this very acceptable product produced in an excellent way by our creameries in the various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will let us and the housewives know in some detail why groups of milk distributors in our cities, who I am told purchase milk at an average of 3/- a gallon, can sell it to the housewife at approximately 5/4d a gallon.  The housewives of this city are called on to pay an excessive amount for this commodity.  If my figures are correct, it seems an extraordinary amount of profit on a gallon of milk for the small amount of work that has been done. I do not want anyone to think that I do not want the workers in this particular trade to be well paid.  I feel they should be well paid and that a reasonable return should be given, but not an excessive return for the smaller portion of the service because the main service there is given by the farmer who has to house and feed and milk cows and store the milk until it is collected by the distributors.  I feel that this is another thing that should get priority in the Minister's examination of the subsidies and of the end product of the subsidies.  In that way he might relieve the burden on the housewives of this country.</P>
    <P>Earlier today we heard Deputy Coughlan, who thought it was very funny that a Dublin Deputy or a city Deputy should speak on this Estimate. I feel it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should know the views and the feelings not alone of Dublin city Deputies but also of the housewives of Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Drimnagh and all the other areas I represent. I am presenting their views and their problems and I do not think there is anything to laugh at in a city Deputy coming along to speak on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I feel it is essential that more city Deputies should come in here and make their voices heard in relation to <Col N="2594" /> matters which affect their constituents in a very real way.  The more the housewife is soaked by the middlemen or by individuals somewhere between the producer and the consumer the less will be on her table and in her purse at the end of the week.  We should be ruthless where necessary with people who are accumulating fortunes within a short space of time when we find that they are controlling rings which tend to force up the price of certain commodities.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I mentioned that the housewife was paying 2/- for 5 lbs of potatoes because she got them in a cellophane bag rather than loose. This cellophane bag costs 9d or in some cases 1/-.  This is robbery of of another type.  It is desirable that goods should be packaged and presented properly but the question of presentation and of the various places to which goods are diverted on the way to the consumer would bear examination. In many cases goods are deliberately diverted in order to be packaged in a way that will add to the finances of this group or gang.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the discussion of the 1d per gallon by people who had not the courage of their convictions, who now say it is too little but who did not think it worth their while to support the necessary Financial Resolutions to pay this 1d a gallon.  We must make it clear that their failure to support the necessary Financial Resolutions to provide the money could only mean that they did not agree that the producer should get this addition which the Minister saw fit to grant quite recently.  Whether it was enough or too much is a matter upon which I do not feel competent to adjudicate but must be guided by our very competent Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  That Minister had the courage to come in here and ask for the imposition of additional taxation for the purpose of giving the farmers this addition and the Opposition Parties, both Labour and Fine Gael, failed completely in their responsibility.  On that occasion they felt no responsibility to anyone, either to themselves or the farmers.  It is a <Col N="2595" /> clear indication that they do not represent the farming community. Otherwise, they would have supported this provision in the Division Lobbies. Whom do they represent?  This was an opportunity to show that they represented the farmers and were prepared to make the sacrifice&mdash;if they thought that was the term&mdash;of going into the Division Lobby to support the Financial Resolutions.  Must they sit on the fence at all times?  Must they always oppose the resolutions whereby money is made available?</P>
    <P>Of course, the 1d on the gallon was not the only feature of the Budget. There were also increases for workers which both Labour and Fine Gael failed to support.  When we hear them speaking today about the increases for farm workers and the farmers as a whole, one must ask where the money is to come from and, if it is to be made available by the State, who is to make it available.  Have they any responsibility? They seem to me to have no responsibility at all for anything constructive. They come into this House and try to give the impression that they were the groups who were in some way responsible but at the last moment they shirked their responsibility.  It took the courageous men of this Party to follow up that decision and to vote the money, whether it be unpopular or not.  Sometimes it is unpopular for a Government to impose taxation.  I am positive that the community as a whole are conscious of their responsibility to workers and to the farming community.  There has been no great outcry against the last Budget other than by a few crocodile tear-shedding politicians of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  The public as a whole are an intelligent public and they have accepted the impositions in the Budget and have shown clearly their acceptance of the Government policy and Government action.</P>
    <P>If our members were to desert the farming community in the way in which they were deserted on a recent occasion in this House, we would never hear the end of it.  When the Opposition run out of constructive criticism they rely on character assassination and other low <Col N="2596" /> forms of political manoeuvres that have been so frequent in this House in recent times.</P>

      <P>Like many other Deputies I feel it is time that this row, as it has been called, between the NFA and others should come to an end and that the farming community should come together and, in the interests of the housewives, present a comprehensive and balanced policy to the Government so that it can be examined in <Col N="2597" /> great detail.  It is regrettable that the farming organisations have not met the situation up to now by presenting a unified approach to this problem.  As a housewives' representative in the city and as a workers' representative, I would urge them to see that the interests of the farming communities and of the nation, which includes the housewives of the country, receive the consideration to which they are entitled. In this may well lie the key to the prosperity both of the housewives and of the farming community. It is regrettable that the dispute has been so prolonged.  Again, it is outside my scope but, nevertheless, I feel that the fault does not lie with the Minister, the Government or the Taoiseach. A unity of purpose is required such as we feel is required in everyday life in relation to long-term planning. In any sphere it is necessary that a comprehensive picture be presented so that one can see into the future in depth and in that way meet many of the problems and examine them on a long-term basis rather than a very short-term basis just to satisfy some particular groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unification at this stage is absolutely essential.  The longer the rift continues the more difficult it will be to reach a solution and the more people will be disappointed and hurt in the process. It is in the interests of the nation that there should be fresh thinking on the part of the farming organisations and when they do submit a comprehensive scheme no doubt it will receive the consideration of our very worthy and courageous Minister.  Some of the accusations that have been hurled across the floor from time to time by Front Bench members of the Fine Gael Party at very competent and capable Ministers, especially at the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, are very regrettable and hurtful.  This, of course, is not a new tactic; it is one of the tactics employed by character assassins in order to discredit honourable men and to colour the picture which they want to present to their flagging organisation in an effort to stimulate interest.  It is well known that when there is a collapse within the Fine Gael Party they are pushed into this type of disruptive action <Col N="2598" /> which has recently been a feature of this House.</P>

      <P>I should like now to deal with the question of exports.  We are aware of the wonderful efforts being made to export many of our commodities in recent times and the attention that has been given to the export of agricultural produce by the Minister and by the Government. Deputy Foley mentioned that the export of live animals and of carcase beef was very satisfactory in 1967.  In that year 620,000 stores were exported to Britain and the Six Counties.  This shows the efforts made to increase exports and to ensure that cattle and beef, whether in dressed or in carcase form, will be exported in greater quantities to Britain or to the United States.</P>
      <P>I hope that this very valuable market in the United States will be further explored as well as markets elsewhere in order to ensure that exports in the years to come will be increased and that we will have the necessary return to ensure the nation's progress.  It is interesting to note the development that has taken place in regard to the US market to which exports of boneless beef were valued at £12 million.  This is a market which should receive additional consideration on a sort of crash programme basis so that we can be well prepared for a long term market for whatever we have available.</P>

We are aware of the confusion which exists in the minds of Fine Gael Deputies and, indeed, Labour Deputies. We heard Deputy Coughlan lecturing us tonight in great detail.  Indeed, it would be interesting to know when he is lecturing again because I should like to hear his intelligent approach to agricultural problems, an approach worthy of consideration even by <i>Dublin Opinion</i>.  He dealt with the pig industry and bacon production and this is an item about which I should like to say a few words.  It is like the production of the cutlets and steaks about which I have spoken and which cost the housewife so much.  We should look at the route that these commodities take in going from the producer to the consumer, so that the situation which has developed over the years can be corrected, the situation which has caused the housewife of this city to pay so much for her rashers and bacon and even her Christmas ham.  The housewife and the worker of the city who pays income tax on earnings over £6 5s or, if he is married, on earnings over £294, should get consideration. These are the people who pay for the fertilisers that are used.</P>

I shall not deal with it in the depth with which Deputy O'Donnell dealt with it earlier on today, but there are important aspects of agriculture on which the people's views must be conveyed to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister, when he is replying, will deal with some of the problems which affect housewives and disturb city dwellers who feel they are being fleeced and that the subsidies are paid at random without any great consideration just because of pressure by particular groups or individuals.  I am not greatly concerned about subsidies, because I know that if the middleman, or, as I said, the fiddleman was eliminated the housewife would have the benefit of lower prices for these essential commodities.  While she has to pay high prices, the children or other members of the family will have to do with smaller portions than they would otherwise get.</P>
      <P>Coming back to Deputy McLaughlin and his bob a dozen eggs, I should like to have the name and address of the producer, so that we can arrange to have him called upon and in that way assist some of our housewives. As I said earlier on, when I was a little boy I always understood it was only the goose that laid the golden egg; now I am sure it is the hens because, judging by the price, the hens are on the gold standard along with the middlemen.</P>

      <P>Tomato growing is a very important section of the horticultural industry.  Irish tomatoes are probably the best tomatoes in the world. I prefer them to imported tomatoes and use them whenever it is possible to get them.  They are better value, and we should impress upon our people the necessity of producing more of them.  Like the cheese, if they are presented properly and at a reasonable price there will be a better do both for the producer and the consumer. I was down in Galway last August on my holidays and I noted the glasshouse scheme there.  I realised that, while this is a great scheme, there were a number of problems.  I saw some idle glasshouses, and since the State invested some money in them, I thought the problem was worthy of examination.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to let the House know that their criticism of my absence from the House today was totally misplaced, in that my absence was due to prior commitments to do with matters which appertained to the agricultural community and could not be put off. While I should like to have been here for the entire debate, I think the work I was doing this evening, that is, meeting the committee of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture prior to their annual meeting tomorrow, was important.  I met their executives this afternoon.  I spent more than three hours with them and I am sure Deputies will <Col N="2602" /> agree that this was time well spent, even though it did mean that I was not able to be here for a considerable portion of this debate.  Earlier today, too, we had a Government meeting and there was a responsibility on me as a member of the Government to attend that meeting.  I wish to apologise to the House for my absence but, at the same time, I wish to point out that my absence in no way reflected on the House.  I hope Deputies will understand that this was not of my making and that I regret more than they do that I could not be here.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had been attending the House in the way that every conscientious Deputy should, he would know that it was agreed by all Parties to finish tonight.  I have no control over the regulations of the House. As I indicated three or four weeks ago, it was my wish to have been present for this debate but various other business has seen to it that this did not happen and, therefore, I had no choice in the matter.  As I have said, the timing of the Dáil arrangements and my prior commitments in relation to agricultural matters in meeting representatives of the farming community of the entire country forced me to be absent during the debate.</P>
      <P>The contributions I have heard from the chief spokesmen of the Opposition Parties were anything but critical of the Department, the Government, the Minister or of agricultural policy and out-turn. My sympathy is with these men because of the fact that agricultural policy is going extremely well at the moment.  My sympathy is with those on the front bench of the Opposition Party, particularly the chief spokesman for the Fine Gael Party who had to refer back this Estimate and to try in some way to justify his Party's original dissatisfaction with the Estimate and all that goes with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to all of that Deputy's contribution, which was of some <Col N="2603" /> length, I came away with the feeling that he had little real criticism to offer. The putting down of a motion to refer back this Estimate is a most perplexing sort of situation for the main Opposition Party to find themselves in and I have sympathy for the man in trying to make a case where he knew there was no case to be made.</P>
    <P>In the following contributions, of which I had quite a considerable note taken, I can see little of any worth to comment on so far as criticism is concerned. Therefore, for the next hour or so, the proceedings may tend to be more boring than would be my natural bent.  This is not of my making but rather of the Opposition's making in not contributing anything worth while to talk about.</P>

      <P>He had not much to criticise, so he made the best of a bad job.  As I said, I have nothing of real interest to comment on because there was nothing of any interest contributed to the debate.  Deputy Murphy and others would, I am sure, like to have made some big case about agriculture; but he is at a loss because of the really satisfactory situation in which agriculture now is and due to the two very <Col N="2604" /> good years that agriculture has had, which, by some strange coincidence, came about with my advent to agriculture. Of course, that is supposed to have nothing to do with agriculture's well-being, but would have had all to do with it if it was not going well.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate for the Opposition that they have no case to make.  However, I shall have to take all the little points that were raised and try to make the best of them.  Deputy O'Donnell spoke about panic concerning surplus milk and said that our dairy products are at premium prices on the export market.  I say to Deputy O'Donnell and to the House that we are not panicking but, having said that, I depart from the Deputy thereafter in so far as marketing is concerned.  This situation in marketing has been brought about through no fault of our own but has been brought about entirely through the dumping of dairy products by much better off countries and by more highly industrialised countries than our own, in particular by some of the Common Market countries who are practically giving dairy produce away at present.  We have to compete in this sort of situation.  As I have said, there is no cause for panic but we would be less than realistic if we did not take recognisance of the realities of life.  We must realise that butter is being offered and sold at prices in the region of £100 a ton&mdash; butter that is perhaps costing £700 or £750 a ton to produce.  That sort of situation exists and it will not disappear overnight.  Regardless of what steps may be taken, a surplus of milk may build up.  There is an over-supply at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should remember that I did not say there were any signs of panic with regard to milk powder.  But I suppose it would have been only natural if I had been inclined to panic when I was told that milk producers in some parts of the country were pouring skim milk down the drain.  It is a shameful situation if a product as valuable as skim milk, which can, if fed to pigs in the right <Col N="2605" /> proportions, mean sixpence or 6½d a gallon to the farmer concerned, can be poured down a drain.  Apart from the damage that this would do to the fish, any farmer who can afford to do this should take a good look at himself and begin to ask himself if this is what the taxpayers of the country are paying for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that there are people in this country who are prepared to pour skim milk down a drain.  It seems very strange that something was not done with this buildup of skim milk other than pouring it down a drain.  If people take this madness into their heads it is a strange comment and a poor recompense to the taxpayer who is willingly contributing towards the support of this very important industry.  Whatever little experience there may have been last year of difficult conditions in the disposal of skimmed milk, I would hope it will have taught some farmers that they have in their own farmyards a more remunerative market than any at their disposal in recent years and one that cannot be taken from them overnight. I hope there will be a real effort by farmers' co-operatives and others to avail of the exceedingly attractive pigfattening grants scheme which I announced a considerable time ago and which, so far, has evoked about only seven genuine applications.  We badly need that attractive scheme in order to produce more pigs for an industry that can use them and that has a market for more than we are now producing and that, in turn, can utilise the skimmed milk in conjunction with one of their milk-processing plants.  The difficulty at this stage in regard to the disposal of these particular dairy products, and the ups and downs of the international market to which we are very much exposed, should ensure that, to the highest degree possible, we make use of native outlets for the by-products of the dairying industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pig-fattening is an outlet that should commend itself in this case not only to the co-operative enterprise but to the smaller farmers and the smaller farm <Col N="2606" /> members around that co-op. to go into the breeding of pigs to supply the central stations, to their own profit and to the general profit of all the people in that area.  I hope the lessons are being taken and that the new attractive grants scheme, together with a guaranteed loan available from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, will be followed up and that a real effort will be made to get more pigs reared, fattened or turned into bacon or exported for pork, for which there is also an additional market, rather than screaming our heads off about &ldquo;giveaway prices&rdquo; which we were doing some months ago.  Then, when the scare got really going, we found that the skimmed milk powder was not as plentiful as appeared for the reason that many farmers in milk-processing countries had found another way of converting their skimmed milk rather than, as heretofore, dumping it without thought into powder plants which had resulted in overflooding the markets to the detriment of all.  Deputy O'Donnell also said that the price of creamery milk was down because of the increased cost of the levy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was one of three reasons for the reduction in price the creamery milk suppliers received this year as compared with last year.  The other two reasons are that the creameries were unable to take all the skimmed milk and thus the price of skimmed milk was down and, thirdly, increased costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not take in the slightest from what I was about to say.  There are so many variations for various causes from one year to another as between herd owner and herd owner and herd and herd that this can happen regardless of price levels and price fluctuations.  There was clear agreement that, in the disposal of our dairy products, any loss accruing in foreign markets would be made up as to onethird by way of levy paid by the milk producers themselves which would be matched as to two-thirds of the loss by the Exchequer.  For every £1 that comes by way of levy, the Government contribute £2 to help Bord Bainne to dispose of these various products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness, that cost should not be <Col N="2607" /> used to justify an increase unless the farmers no longer want that sort of operation and no longer want Bord Bainne because, without the function of raising the levy&mdash;which the Board does, not the Government&mdash;there is little point in Bord Bainne's existence. The board would really be superfluous if this vital job of calculating the levy and asking for it from the producers and the Government were taken from them.  Producers should realise that, if there are bad years and good years on the selling market, then there does arise a cost factor by way of a loss which implies a levy.  They should take into account that, already, other people are committed to two-thirds of that loss in addition to all the millions already put into the creamery business in order to support the price being paid to the producers.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the fluctuations in the price of milk.  There are always exceptions which will prove the rule or disprove the rule.  This year, our dairy people produced 520 million gallons of milk as against 470 million gallons last year which, itself, was a record.  On the best calculations I can find, only 26,000 additional cows went into the herds during the past year and contributed to the total of 520 million gallons of milk this year.  If we take the national average yield, it will clearly be seen that the output from the same number of herds in 1968, which produced 470 million gallons in 1967, produced an increase of well over 30,000,000 gallons this year.  In other words, the same number of cows, possibly owned by the same herd owners, gave 30,000,000 gallons more of milk this year as compared with last year.  I am setting aside the 15,000,000 gallons the 26,000 additional cows would have produced.  Surely a Deputy who understands milk, and all that goes with it, must appreciate that 30,000,000 gallons additional milk multiplied by the price people would have got for it represents, in fact, a very substantial increase in the incomes of these farmers this year as against last year?  Even if there is set against it some of the costs that have begun to arise this year, remember these costs are not all applicable over the entire area of milk production <Col N="2608" /> because some of them did not come in until well through the season.  The levy did not come in until the month of July and this, in addition to the penny on the first 7,000 gallons from 1st September directed in a special way towards the smaller producers, and the increased yield of well over 30,000,000 gallons, has done fairly by these people in the dairying industry and there is no depth of propaganda that can get away from these facts, facts staring everybody in the face.  The sooner people give up this propaganda, which cannot be sustained by facts and figures, the sooner we will get some sanity into all walks of life where people are seeking more money for whatever their particular line of production may be.  The total out-turn was a record in itself.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all that this forms a basis to justify the argument that creamery milk prices are down.  This kind of thing cannot stand up for one moment.  The argument has no legs&mdash; good, bad or indifferent&mdash;and the sooner the people over there get wise to themselves the better it will be.  The sooner they deal with the factual situation the more appreciated they will become.  Let us look for a moment at the penny increase, the penny which has been sneered at, and realise that this penny is costing the taxpayers approximately £1.7 million in a full 12 months. Mark you, the day we reach the point at which the dairy industry, or any other arm of our agricultural economy, can sneer at a £1.7 million increase in agricultural income we will certainly be going places because £1.7 million is a fair few quid.  Even if you subdivide it and say it represents only £3, £4, £5, £6 or even £29 or £30, remembering that the yield has gone up from the same number of cows, due to the good weather and due, undoubtedly, to the influence of a good Fianna Fáil Government, it still represents good money and no one can laugh it away.

      <P>The Fine Gael Party are like the fairies or, as we call them, &ldquo;the wee folk&rdquo;; they are trying to milk the cows before ever they get into the byres at all, but they will not succeed because these cows gave well over an additional 30,000,000 gallons this year and that is a big increase.  Added to that is the fact that in the 12 months starting last September there will be £1.7 million more given by the Government from the Exchequer in particular recognition of the needs of the smaller milk producer.  This incidentally establishes for the first time a true differential in price support.  This is a policy decision by the Government. It is an indication to the bigger producers that this is the pattern that will be followed in the future.  We will no longer have the basis of support fought for on the costs of the small producer and then given without question to every producer, regardless of size, efficiency or profitability.  The sooner the big producers realise this is the pattern, the sooner they will get wise to the fact that going into milk on a huge scale is not our policy.  We will not continue to pour money into the production of milk on a large scale to the detriment of the taxpayers or to the detriment of the small producer.  Four-fifths of all milk producers are small. Four out of every five are under 7,000 gallons.  It is to these we are now determined to provide in an increasing way the assistance which has been given over the years, assistance to the tune of £26 million this year.  It is to these small producers we are now committed. We are not penalising the big milk producers.  We are merely warning them in a very definite way and, at the same time, saying to them that they should get into beef.  They can make it profitable.  Instead of giving them 1/- a gallon, as we are doing at the moment, for sending their milk to the creamery we will give them £8 for every cow and calf; that is the equivalent of giving them 4d a gallon to keep their milk at home.  We want to reserve in a very special way the milk market that is there for the four-fifths of the milk producers whose livelihood is derived entirely from the production of milk. Many of these have been producing milk for generations.  We want to reserve <Col N="2610" /> that market to them and we are going to concentrate the taxpayers' support more and more in their favour because they cannot go into beef and make a living out of it, whereas the big man can.  This is the trend and I hope it will be recognised and understood by those who can profitably engage on a large scale in beef production. Perhaps, they will take warning and leave the restricted market to the smaller producer for whom this is the only worthwhile farming enterprise in which he can profitably engage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  As I said in reply to a question a week or so ago, I have the matter under examination and, in my examination, I am taking into account a full review of the situation as it now is in regard to liquid milk production in the two broad areas.  I am examining very seriously the possibility of discontinuing the entire milk price allowance now paid on surplus derived from that area.  This surplus should carry itself within the trade in the liquid milk areas, and not be a burden on the taxpayer as it is now.  Likewise it should not be an encouragement to the over-production of milk in those areas to the detriment of the ordinary creamery milk suppliers to whose problems it has added.  It costs about £700,000 to the Exchequer and is a levy of approximately £200,000 on the creamery milk producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, we are examining this whole problem at the moment, and wondering whether this business of supplying the needs of the cities in question, Cork and Dublin, should not revert to its original position wherein the liquid trade catered for itself and was not supported out of public funds. As I say, it is costing £700,000 in subsidies, and it is costing the creamery milk producers almost £200,000.  This matter is being considered and we must seriously consider unloading this burden which is now being carried by the creamery milk producers and the taxpayers.  It should be capable of being carried by the trade itself.  They should regulate their supplies to their needs <Col N="2611" /> rather than allowing their production to reach the point where six million gallons more are being produced than are needed in the Dublin area.  This could in the normal way be manufactured by our processors in other parts of the country.  All these matters are being taken into consideration and whether there will be a complete change I cannot say at the moment.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  This extra six million gallons could be absorbed in so far as disposal was concerned by the milk boards in question. If there were a little surplus it should be capable of being covered and carried within the liquid milk trade instead of by the taxpayers and the creamery milk suppliers in increased levies.  That is now being done and it may amount to £200,000 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>

This year the levy was not capable of being operated but the principle was there that it should be paid.  The system proposed was not capable of being calculated until too late.  Next year if there is a good crop and a big return of millable wheat there will be a levy.  I will ask Deputy Clinton a question.  Which would he rather have&mdash;a year in which he gets no millable wheat through and pays no levy, or a year in which he has a phenomenal yield of millable wheat and takes a cut of 10/- in order to spread the loss incurred by overproduction? Which of the two is better?</P>

      <P>Listen to the figures. Last year we grew almost 220,000 acres and we produced 385,000 tons of wheat, paid for at millable prices. Some years ago we grew 420,000 acres and got 25,000 tons of millable wheat.  Which of the two years would the Deputy choose if he had the choice of paying the levy this year or having no levy to pay three years ago when he got 25,000 tons only out of 420,000 acres?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that a good year even with the levy would be far more profitable and attractive to the farmer than the disastrous year such as I have indicated and which happened not so long ago.  There is no comparison between the profitability of the two.  In fact, there was no profit in the year when 420,000 acres produced only 25,000 tons of millable wheat, but there would have been a huge profit this year even if there had been a deduction of 10/-.</P>

      <P>Will anyone say that £10½ million for 220,000 acres of wheat grown this year does not show a good return and a handsome profit.  Some of the people who talk for farmers and would like to tell you about the small farmers and how badly off they are this year have themselves drawn over £30,000 under this very good guarantee system that we have.  Do you think those people would not have gladly paid a levy rather than have unmillable prices paid for that if it was a bad year?  There just is not any comparison and Deputy Clinton well knows it.  We are not putting this levy into operation until after the event and only if there is a surplus of millable wheat produced.  Then, and only then, will one penny be supplied and if none is needed the entire residue, the entire balance, goes back and the farmers will not have lost one halfpenny on the transaction.</P>

      <P>I remember a time, Deputy, when there was no money of theirs to hold and if Fine Gael had their way there would still be none to hold because they would have none and the question of tests, acreages, millability, potential or otherwise, would not arise.  This is the simplified policy of Fine Gael in regard to this and many other matters.  If it causes any sort of bother at all, do not have it.  This is the way Fine Gael think, but it is not our way of doing business. We are merely applying the levy as agreed by the farmers' representatives, in fact proposed by the farmers' representatives, back in 1958, incorporated in the 1958 Cereal Act and now, for the first time, being capable of being applied if it is necessary in a sane, sensible, logical, statistical manner.  I take some credit for the fact that we have at last found a way of doing this. The farmers who are growing wheat will be delighted to know that we are not restricting their input of wheat, as some people would suggest; we are not putting them on contracts, as some of them feared; but if it comes to the point that we have to choose between the fellow with 800 acres or 900 acres and the fellow with five or ten acres, then I can assure you that, for the first time, we have devised some method of helping the fellow with the smaller acreage.  Again, it is not done to the detriment of the taxpayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the falling number is concerned, this means that in the case of potentially millable wheat&mdash;should we have any worthwhile quantity offered next year or any other year&mdash;there is a greater likelihood that it can be used for milling rather than when the falling number was at 130 or 120.  It is a well-established fact, I understand, that where you have the lower falling number wheat even mixed in a small quantity among the wheat of the higher falling number, that is up to 150 and under 160, it can spoil the whole lot.  Therefore, <Col N="2615" /> it is not sensible, and indeed it is really foolish, to mix very low quality wheat in with this potentially millable quality and also some reasonably high quality wheat because, when you do, you will use neither.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of talking myself out of it.  It is a question of being realistic to the point of accepting what is factual, what has been shown to be the case and what in the ultimate analysis is in the overall national interest.  There is no national interest being served by making three heaps of wheat&mdash;one unmillable, one potentially millable and one that is millable&mdash;and finding that the potentially millable is just a joke because of the fact that the unmillable has been put through it to such an extent that whatever might have been used of the potentially millable is now gone as well.  There is no point in that sort of caper and I do not think we should continue to do it.  We should move up the quality in order to be able to utilise to a greater degree potentially millable wheat.  That is why this has been done. Again, with the excessive increase in yields from 31 cwts per statute acre to the new all-time record of 36 cwts per acre, there is no grower who would give a hoot about the changes the Deputy would make much of at this time, coming on the heels of the greatest bonanza that has ever come out of wheat in this or any other country. That is what the farmers reaped during 1968&mdash;including the £1,500,000 that should have been collected. Because of the system that was imposed, however, it could not be collected last year but it will be collected next year, only if there is a surplus. Only if the harvest is good, only if the farmers have got the money, will they be expected to carry some of the load of the loss incurred in making feeding stuffs out of millable wheat.  It can be bought back at feed prices and it can be utilised for feeding profitably. This is why this is being done.  I think it is a very sensible arrangement and one at which the farmers, the wheat growers and all others in the business, <Col N="2616" /> cannot and do not take umbrage, provided they can be assured of getting anything like as good a return in the years ahead as they got this year.</P>

I did not impose the levy.  A levy was imposed under the Act of 1958 which was prompted by the proposals of the farmers' representatives in that year.</P>

    <P>We have this matter of the reorganisation of the creamery industry.  All I will say there is that a considerable amount of work has already taken place in the midst of the hubbub about how it should be done.  There are sensible, logical steps being taken by a number of our creamery producers in the country.  Quietly and without any fuss they are moving towards true rationalisation to the benefit of all.  All I can say there is we will do everything possible to try to help the acceleration of this where it is now being done.  From an examination of the further report we have recently received from the Cooke-Sprague people, together with what we have garnered from all the various reports of surveys and the work study done by my Department seven years ago, we would hope with the co-operation of the dairying people and the creamery groups throughout the country to make <Col N="2617" /> real progress in the coming year in regard to finding a fairly sensible overall pattern of rationalisation in this very important industry.</P>
    <P>There has been mention here of the gaps between farm prices and consumer prices.  While it is quite true that one can quote all sorts of differences between the price paid to the farmer and the price paid by the consumer in a city like Dublin, we ought to remember that, perhaps because of good advertising and publicity, our people have come into an age where they want everything packed.  They want it made up and looking nice; and, if you want that, you must pay for it.  You are going to pay an additional profit margin to whoever is putting on the wrapping, whoever printed the pack, whoever put the colour on and so on.  We must remember that when we start comparing prices.  At the same time, there are undoubtedly margins that cannot be justified and should not exist, but they do.  However, side by side with that, I deplore the people who get up and talk with some air of authority and quote, for instance, the price of a stone of potatoes in Donegal and then they will quote the price of a pound of potatoes here.  Who is codding whom? It is a great disservice to the farming community of my county or any other, that this should be put across as being authoritative in the sense that they quote dissimilar figures.</P>

Where is the difference going?&rdquo;  This is doing nobody any service but, in fact, is doing harm because it is creating doubts in the minds of the farmers who are selling and in the minds of the Dublin residents who are buying, and creating dissatisfaction at both ends in regard to a matter that is not as profitable as would be shown by the unfair, misleading comparisons that had been made and published with the intention, no doubt, of making somebody squeal somewhere and kick up a row about it, and all that based on wrong information, misleading comparisons which are a very dangerous thing to indulge in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the mountain lamb subsidy is concerned, Deputy Meaney suggested that lambs should be inspected for subsidy at the time of dipping. There are about six good reasons why we should not do this and one of the most important is that as soon as lambs are punched in the ears, they qualify. If done at dipping time, when dipped and wet, they are open to the danger of infection of one kind or another, not to mention the fact that to handle a lamb, particularly a mountain lamb, is some job but to handle wet lambs at the dipping tank is more than one could expect our fellows to cater for in any numbers on any given day.  Apart from that, I would say to the Deputy that if there are any ways by which we can improve the facilities that we have given this year and that have been generally satisfactory in so far as the administration of this scheme is concerned, we would certainly be open to consider suggestions but to do it at every public dipping tank on dipping day is not &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  It is true that we do a good deal of this at public dipping centres, even as of now, but cannot do it at every public dipping centre for various reasons of staff availability, uniformity of application of our inspection code.  These and other things preclude us from doing it in as many places as there would be public dipping centres but where we find that undue inconvenience is being caused, even under our system as operating during the past season, we will do our <Col N="2619" /> best to try to rectify that during the coming season if we get details about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy mentioned our adverse balance of trade with the EEC and particularly with the Federal Republic of Germany.  It is true that our balances of trade, particularly as published recently, giving the bald statistics, in national newspapers, are anything but healthy in so far as the Six are concerned and this is particularly noticeable in so far as West Germany is concerned but while one would be inclined to say to these people that if they do not buy more from us we will not buy anything from them, if we all did this all the time with everybody, we would very soon reach the stage where trade would become well-nigh impossible, that is, trade either on a continental or a world basis, and you would be certainly back to the old barter system with all the curtailment of freedom of trading that that would imply.  This is not to say that some effort in the direction of bringing to the notice of these people who are doing poor trade with us at the moment that we are not at all happy with the position but, far from it, are most unhappy with the situation as it has developed, is not well worthy of consideration and well worth making. Indeed, outside the EEC countries we have made this effort, saying to one country: &ldquo;If you do not buy some of our produce, we will not buy some of yours.&rdquo;  As yet, this has not had much effect in any build-up of mutual trade but there is no doubt that it did make the bees move, as it were, in the hive and there have been certain flutterings around as a result since then which I hope and expect may generate some new additional trading with this particular country.  As I say, we have done it only in one case so far but it has been worth doing.  To apply it generally would freeze trading to such a degree that probably nobody would benefit in the long run and it would tie world trade to such a degree that we would have gone back a century in time by that exercise and would have lost rather than gained as a result.</P>
    <P>Then there is, of course, the fact that if we were completely free to go into <Col N="2620" /> these markets and if there were no supports either from here or there for our agricultural produce, in particular, it is not clear that in all cases we would be just up to competing and might not have it all our own way if the gates were fully opened both ways. This must be kept in mind also when we talk about gaining access and forcing our way on the basis that we buy from them and they do not buy from us.  I deplore the situation where that arises, particularly in relation to the Six Common Market countries, because our trading has been going down and down.  In so far as the balance of trade is concerned we have been on the losing end, progressively, during these recent years and, short of gaining membership of the Common Market, it does not look as if there will be any great change, although we are hoping for some improvement, but I do not think there will be any really outstanding change short of our entry to that market as full members in due course.</P>

We have a number of things that I am sure Deputy Clinton is aware of. The brucellosis certified herds scheme has been available in all counties since June, 1965.  Under this scheme a farmer who clears his herd of the disease at his own expense and who satisfies the Department as to his management of his herd and premises, can have further tests arranged free by the Department and any reactors to those tests taken up at market value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This new scheme has not met with a great deal of success.  In fact, there has been very little response. Only a very few herd owners have, in fact, availed of this scheme.  However, we are considering a further scheme for herd owners outside the area where full-scale eradication is in progress.  Under this scheme a herd owner who discovers infection in his herd and who sends the animals for slaughter would get a grant payable <Col N="2621" /> when the herd is eventually certified to be clear of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage grant is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the actual percentage would be but it is intended to be an assistance for those people who are not yet within the overall scheme.  It is to help them to some considerable degree to get clear of infected animals where they are anxious to do it, to clear their herds.</P>
      <P>As a further aid for farmers in the main dairying and breeding areas, we have also the milk ring test.  I should say that one round was completed in the autumn and a further round will be completed in 1969. Herds found to be clear in each test will give very little risk.  It is hoped in the third round to organise special sales from these herds.  It is also hoped that further efforts in these areas will be of some considerable assistance in the eradication of brucellosis by these progressive herd owners even before the overall clearance scheme would have got to their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also heard much about farmers' organisations and we have had rather woolly talking, not only from the Opposition benches, I might say, confusing the situation as to farming organisation relations with the Government and with me, whereas the only difficulty in this realm relates to one farming organisation and to no other.  There is no problem about communication, discussion or dialogue with all organised farmer groups bar the NFA.  This should be kept clearly in mind and no confusion should be allowed to exist that there is any overall breakdown in communications between the Department, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and farming organisations, bar one.  In regard to that one, the situation has been and still is and will undoubtedly continue to be that the Department and the Minister are available to them in the same manner as they have been available to all other organisations over the years.  This is on the basis that if they have a problem and want to discuss it they <Col N="2622" /> come along to make their case and put their points and listen to the Minister's difficulties in the situation.  Then, having heard the case and discussed it, the Minister goes from that discussion&mdash; which in all probability will entail expenditure&mdash;and processes what he heard from the group and since, as I said, it will invariably involve policy or money he must go to the Government and there fight the case that he believes in or has come to believe in. He utilises the case that has been made to him by the various interests and tries to convince the Government to introduce something new or to increase something.  He may succeed wholly or he may succeed partially or he may not succeed at all, but having reached a conclusion whatever it may be, that is then conveyed back to the organisation or organisations and to the general body of farmers, informing them what has happened.  This is the situation and this is the system of our Government and of our democracy.  It is collective Government responsibility and neither I nor any other occupier of this Ministry has had or will have, unless we change the system radically, the power to sit down with any group and make decisions involving policy or spending. He must go back to his Government to get their consent.  This is available to the NFA.</P>

Although I have had four, five or six invitations in the last two or three months, and these invitations were in the final analysis invitations without any preconditions, I have had the sort of reply that I got to the last of these which I made last September. Some of the reply which I got to my invitation of the 20th September asking without conditions that I might meet the NFA and the ICMSA leaders together, has been published.  It contained seven conditions under which normality would be regarded as having been restored and which provided that there should be a categorical assurance from me on behalf of the Government that the seven conditions were being granted as a prerequisite to meeting. Obviously, there could not and would not be a meeting.  These seven conditions are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  Recognition by Government of the proper role of NFA&mdash;representing 130,000 farm families&mdash;in our society and under our Constitution as one of the most important instruments in substantially and materially aiding agricultural and general economic progress.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;always conscious of the authority of the Government and in the ultimate of Dáil Éireann in finally <Col N="2624" /> deciding on and sanctioning national agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>(c)  Immediate renewal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am not too good at reading this one because it is rather difficult.  However this is what it says:</P>
    <P>Immediate renewal&mdash;extraneous to the Minister's proposed meeting on the milk price issue&mdash;of NFA/Minister/Government negotiations in the nature of productive dialogue on the many issues which confront argiculture in general and farmers in particular&mdash;memoranda have been submitted to the Government, the Minister and his predecessor on these issues, the latest of which was submitted to the Taoiseach and the Minister on April 9th, 1968, prior to the 1968 Budget.</P>
    <P>(d)  Agreement on the necessary constructive meetings between the Minister and/or his officials and NFA Commodity Committees on problems and suggested solutions to same relating to all agricultural commodities individually and collectively.</P>
    <P>(e)  Constructive discussions between the NFA and the Minister on closing the &ldquo;income gap&rdquo; (presently £5 per week) between farmers and workers in other sectors.</P>
    <P>(f)  Ministerial permission to his officials to enable them to have free and frank discussions with NFA officials by mutual agreement on items of day to day importance.</P>
    <P>(g)  Recognition by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture of those selected by organised farmers for appointment to Marketing Boards, Commissions, Study Groups, etc.</P>
    <P>(h)  The abolition of discrimination against the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> by having general Departmental advertising restored in the Journal.</P>

      <P>I asked for a meeting on more than one occasion without conditions as a solution to the internal, inter-organisational strife that is the root cause of the problems of these farmers' organisations.  This is what I got back, and this is the last long bulletin I have got from this source.  It is very difficult to feel anything but baffled by the attitude of people here who should know better than to say that, broadly speaking, there is a row and that as it is Christmas there is goodwill about and there should be a reconciliation.  The reconciliation is there, and it will continue to be there under our democratic organisation.  All other organisations will be free to come to my Department and all other Departments in the knowledge that there may be no decisions made there because it is not within the competence of any Minister of any Government in this State to make such decisions on his own, whether he be with that group <Col N="2626" /> or any other group; in the knowledge that he is one of a number of people who control the matter, and that he cannot dispose of that responsibility by saying to anybody: &ldquo;Come in and I will make the decisions with you.&rdquo;  I cannot do this.  I have not the authority to do it.</P>
      <P>I could not do it because I could be rejected the following day by my own Government colleagues, and would that not be right?  Is that not the way our Government must operate?  If that is only appreciated, then there is nothing between the members of the NFA and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  This I have told to the leader of the NFA who, remember, I invited to a meeting within 24 hours of his election as president, and I invited him to a meeting again.  The last time I met him I told him as plainly as I could: &ldquo;I do not care whether you call it negotiation, discussion, dialogue or anything else, so long as it is within that context it is freely open to you or any other organisation at least to recognise that this is not of my making, that it is the basis of our Government, and that the whole system of government and of democracy in this country would have to be changed to make it otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I chide those who talk about this matter as if there was a war on with all the farmers' representatives in the country.  In fact, as I said earlier, I spent almost three hours in the deepest conference this evening with people really representative of the farmers, the executive committee, numbering nearly 30, of the 27 agricultural committees throughout the country, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. It was time well spent.  There was good contact with them and there were good relations with them.  I hope this continues as it always has been, so far as my predecessors and myself are concerned.  Only a couple of days ago the ICMSA were up here with me as they have always been over the years. Naturally, they make their case and, like other organisations, they will be looking for their pound of flesh, but they still come and still have contact with the Minister and there is no problem about it.  There are the other organisations in the country, whether they <Col N="2627" /> be sheep representatives, cattle representatives or whatever organisation they represent, they are all there available and I will be available to them, and they know this.</P>
    <P>I just want it to be plainly and clearly understood that in Ireland there is only the one organisation representing farmers who do not see their way to have the same sort of contact with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as every other organisation is prepared to have.  I only wish it was different; I hope the time is now arriving when it will be different.</P>

      <P>I am only sorry that due to these arrangements I have not had the time I should like to make a real speech about agriculture instead of talking about the carping criticisms made by the Opposition, who had nothing else to talk about, there being no real criticism of the Party or the Government at the moment.  However, there will be another day when we shall have more time to discuss this very important matter in greater detail than it has been possible to do tonight.  I can only say to the farmers that they had a great year, and may they have a very happy Christmas as well; I think they could not help it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde ever reads the Dáil Reports he will see that every Deputy on his side of the House referred to the commission. It is true that the Chair tried to bring the Deputies on the opposite side of the House to order but, in their usual manner, they refused to come to order.  However, I do not expect to have time to deal with the arguments with regard to a commission tonight because the Opposition have already made plans to deny me the right of adequate reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the laboured efforts of the Opposition to make it appear otherwise, it is very obvious from this debate that the volume of genuine dissatisfaction with the proposals in the Bill <Col N="2631" /> is small.  The dissatisfaction is not related to any general principle but it is related merely to minor details and the personal prospects of individual Deputies in securing re-election to the Dáil rather than to any fundamental principles of the scheme of the constituencies as proposed.</P>
    <P>In fact, I relieved the tedium of listening to the same type of allegations being made by one Deputy after another by watching the efforts of the Whips in the Opposition Parties to search out their Deputies from every nook and cranny in the House to persuade them to come in here and make a speech.  They were all handed the exact same brief.  There was an obvious effort to make it appear that there was in fact some widespread dissatisfaction with the proposals.</P>
    <P>In so far as it is possible to identify the actual criticism of the Bill from the mass of personal attack in which it was enshrined, I think it emerges quite clearly that the Opposition criticism is directed, not so much at what is being done in the Bill but against the Constitutional provisions that require this to be done.  The debate provided, as was to be expected, many examples of the double thinking that has become so natural to Deputies on the opposite side of the House.  We have contradictory statements being made in the same sentence.  We have had arguments that the new constituencies have been devised with consummate skill so as to benefit Fianna Fáil and to eliminate individual Opposition Deputies.  These arguments were combined with boastful claims that the result of the Bill would be to wipe Fianna Fáil off the face of the earth.</P>
    <P>The volume of real complaint, as distinct from personal abuse, is about equal from both sides of the House and this fact is an indication that the task imposed on the Government, as a result of the Fine Gael action in the courts in 1961 and the decision of the people on 16th October this year, has been approached in as fair and objective a manner as possible.  A number of Opposition speakers could not refrain from expressing their own <Col N="2632" /> personal satisfaction with the new constituencies in which they apparently expect to find themselves.  My assessment of the position as disclosed by the debate, in so far as it has been allowed to proceed, is that the Opposition are at least as well satisfied with the proposals as are the Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>I do not say, of course, that they have committed the unpardonable crime of expressing publicly their agreement.  I have accused the Opposition of many things but I have never accused them of agreeing publicly with any Fianna Fáil proposal.</P>
    <P>Of course, I must admit that it is difficult to see how a Bill proposed in the present circumstances could fail to arouse a certain amount of dissatisfaction particularly on the Opposition benches where the instinct of selfpreservation is so strong.  After all, the decision which the Opposition was responsible for the people making ensures that at least four Deputies representing rural Ireland who are here at present will not be coming back and the results of by-elections indicate that it is much more likely that these Deputies are at present on the Opposition side of the House rather than on this side.  Therefore, irrespective of the actual proposals that are in the Bill, it is inevitable that at least four Deputies from outside Dublin will not be coming back, since the total non-Dublin representation must be reduced by at least this amount under the Bill.  That is, of course, unless the planned migration of Fine Gael Deputies from rural areas to Dublin produces results.  I have not the full list of the potential migrants but I know that the O'Higgins brethren have been mentioned, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have been following breathlessly the exciting accounts of the ebb and flow of the bitter struggle between these wouldbe migrants and the local hopefuls for the four extra Dublin seats that have to be created and for the declared vacant Costello seats.</P>
    <P>I should like if it is possible to console those Deputies who fear they will become the victims of their own action in reducing rural representation so unjustifiably <Col N="2633" /> by reminding them that they might have lost their seats in any case.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that only four of the sixteen general elections we have had in this country have been preceded by a revision of constituencies the average number of Deputies in those sixteen general elections who did not return here for one reason or another after the general election was 33.  While I admit that this figure is somewhat distorted by the fact that there were 73 who did not come back in the 1927 election, still, the lowest number that did not return after any general election was 19 in the election of 1944&mdash;and that election was held within 12 months of the preceding general election in which there were 27 who did not come back.  So, I think it can safely be said, irrespective of the proposals in this Bill, there would in fact be a number of Deputies here who would not be coming back. Therefore, I think it should be possible for those Deputies who feel they are sitting for the last time in Dáil Éireann to console themselves with this knowledge that it is quite on the cards that they would not come back anyway.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the figures of previous general elections that the pattern of the number of Deputies who did not return has not been affected in any significant way by the previous revisions of constituencies and, mark you, most of them were made by Fianna Fáil.  I have no doubt whatever but that there will be no significant difference on this occasion either.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have commented on the short time it took to produce this Bill and, in that short time, I am alleged to have pored over maps, over the Census report and over the register of electors and this mysterious detailed information that is supposed to be available to the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to the past, present and future distribution of votes as among the different Parties in different areas. I am alleged to have done this with every Fianna Fáil Deputy, with every county councillor and with every cumann in the country and to have achieved a scheme that won unanimous approval from all these people. <Col N="2634" /> This, I think, would be indeed a remarkable achievement in such a short time and an achievement, I must say, I do not believe it would be possible for anybody to arrive at.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully alleged I went even further&mdash;that I was not satisfied to decide on the areas that were to be changed, particularly the areas that were to be changed from one county to another, on the basis of this detailed knowledge as to how the people voted in the past and will vote in the future, but that I also spent long hours, apparently, ensconced with the Registrar of Births and Marriages and Deaths in the Custom House conducting extensive research into his own genealogy and, by implication, into the genealogy of other Opposition Deputies and that, having discovered the areas from which his forebears originated, I selected that area of County Meath for detachment to the constituency of County Monaghan&mdash;apparently on the assumption that all his relatives who were extant in that area from which he had migrated would, if they were left in Meath, support their illustrious kinsman, Deputy James Tully.  I think it was a remarkable coincidence that, having made this alleged research, I discovered that this area happened to be the area of County Meath that was contiguous to County Monaghan. More remarkable, later on I was accused of having selected this very same area in order to injure Deputy Farrelly.  I was accused of that by Deputy Clinton who is, I appreciate, better acquainted with County Meath than with County Dublin.  Therefore, I was fortunate that this area affected both the Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>I did not, in fact, conduct any research into Deputy James Tully's genealogy but I did have some discussions about this remarkable allegation. What did I discover?  I discovered that this area was also the ancestral area of the present Minister for Defence.  So, here we find that this area apparently&mdash;it is a small area&mdash;affects the three of them.  That is indicative of the type of nonsensical allegation that has been made.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a number of Opposition Deputies during this debate upbraided me for being too precipitate <Col N="2635" /> in bringing in this Bill; for acting, as they alleged, unnecessarily and entirely on my own initiative, to change a satisfactory arrangement of constituencies for the sole benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party, However, in the usual contradictory manner of the Opposition, others have alleged I was anything but enthusiastic in bringing in the Bill.  For my own part, I accept the latter allegation.</P>
    <P>I frankly admit that I regarded the task of revising the constituencies and bringing in this Bill as a distasteful and undesirable one.  It has been done by me only under duress.  I can show that it was done under duress because from the very moment the 1966 Census of Population was published I was subjected to pressure, through Parliamentary Questions and supplementary questions from many Deputies on the Opposition side of the House.</P>
    <P>On 19th October, 1966, as reported in volume 230, No. 8 of the Official Report, Deputy Seán Dunne, my own colleague, asked the Minister for Local Government if it was proposed to revise the Dáil constituencies before the next election in view of the population changes since the last distribution of seats.  He pressed me at some quite considerable length with supplementaries on this matter and was assisted by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  Subsequently, on 13th July, 1967, Deputy Michael O'Leary asked a similar question and, again, on 6th April, 1967 Deputy Sweetman asked a similar question. On that occasion, I was pressed to carry out this revision of constituencies by Deputy L'Estrange, by Deputy Cosgrave, by Deputy Seán Dunne, by Deputy Clinton, by Deputy Reynolds and by Deputy Donnellan. Again, I was asked a similar question earlier by my colleague, Deputy Seán Dunne.  It was as a result of this pressure by Opposition Deputies that we decided we would either have to carry out the revision of constituencies demanded by the Opposition or else give the people the opportunity, which the Opposition also demanded in 1961, of removing what Deputy Costello described as &ldquo;this Constitutional infirmity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2636" /> I have described the Constitutional position.  I did that in my opening statement and no one has seriously suggested that revision was not inevitable. The Government did everything possible to avoid bringing in this Bill. It was because of the pressure to revise the constituencies that we decided to ask the people to amend the Constitution and that decision was in clear response to the demands of the Opposition in 1961.  I quoted these demands before and I propose to quote from only one member of the Opposition now and I do so because of a particular speech made on this particular Bill.  I quote from the late Deputy Michael Donnellan, volume 188 of the Official Report of 12th April, 1961.  Deputy Donnellan said:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was not man enough to submit the matter to a referendum so that the people might be given an opportunity of changing the relevant Article in the Constitution and getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>I regret the Taoiseach did not put this by way of referendum to the people.</P>
    <P>This was typical of the attitude at that time and, as I said, it was in response to that that we tried to avoid having to bring in a Bill on this basis at this particular time.  But, just as the interpretation of the Constitution, with which we must now conform, was established by a Fine Gael manoeuvre in the courts so the rejection by the people of the amendment of the Constitution, which would have made this Bill unnecessary and which they demanded, as I said, in 1961, was also engineered by the two Opposition Parties.  It is they who are responsible for this Bill, not I. I am bringing it in only because it was forced upon me by the Coalition and I am&mdash; I agree with Deputy Dockrell&mdash;completely unenthusiastic about it.  I will go further and say I do not know anyone in the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Taoiseach down, who is enthusiastic about it and who does not regard it as undesirable.  But the Constitution must be obeyed and this revision of constituencies has to be made because the Opposition have insisted on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2637" /> What is being done in this Bill has to be done, or something very like it, to comply with the law.  Admittedly, there is an infinite, or practically infinite, number of ways in which the rearrangement could be carried out.  I said that in my opening statement.  I also said that I think this is the least objectionable way.  That is the most I can say about it. I do not need any Opposition Deputy to point out that I do not like the idea of depriving the rural areas of representation to which they are fully entitled, even on the basis of the most rigid interpretation of any theoretical principle.  I do not like having to squeeze an unjustified four seats into Dublin.  I do not like having to bring in a Bill which must ensure that at least four of the sitting Deputies in this House will not be coming back after the next general election. I do not like having to take parts of one county and transfer them into another county.  Putting it mildly, I am not enthusiastic about pushing people around from county to county and constituency to constituency every five years or, as Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said, playing musical chairs with the people.  I am not enthusiastic about this.  I do not want to do it.  I am doing it only because I have to.  I am not enthusiastic about requiring Deputies and their political organisations to readjust themselves to new constituencies so frequently, as is likely to be the case from now on, and I am not enthusiastic about the distortion of votes as between the rural areas in general and the Dublin area, a distortion which is inherent in the present position.  But that is the law as laid down in the Constitution and as copperfastened by the decision made in the recent referendum.</P>
    <P>If we leave out detailed references to specific areas each Opposition speech was, I think, entirely predictable. Certainly, I did not need to come in here and listen to the debate to know what would be said.  Knowing, as I did, what has been the motivating force of the Opposition down through the years, I take it as the highest possible personal compliment that their hatred has now apparently become concentrated on me.  In fact, the more vicious and hysterical their personal abuse becomes <Col N="2638" /> the surer I am that I am on the right lines.  All the things that have been said in this debate were of course said before the Bill was published at all.  The allegations were obviously drafted in advance.  The Parties opposite&mdash;it is, I suppose, still appropriate to refer to them in the plural, although I do not see any very noticeable difference in approach between them&mdash;made these allegations of gerrymandering before ever there was any inkling at all of what was in the Bill. This was a safe thing to do because information indicating the inevitability of a great deal of chopping and changing of constituencies and the inevitability of parts of one county being attached to another county was available.</P>
    <P>It was known before the Bill was published that there were 24 of the 38 constituencies in breach of the Constitution. It was known they must be changed and it was known that the changes would inevitably involve the majority of the other constituencies. This was well known to the Opposition because this position was connived at by themselves.  It was well known that it was not permissible to exercise any but the very minimal amount of divergence in, for instance, adhering to county boundaries.  It was known even before the Bill was drafted that it was necessary for the rural part of the country to lose at least four seats and that these four seats must be squeezed into Dublin and this would involve a fundamental redrafting of constituencies. This disruption being, as it was, inevitable it was obvious that the Opposition could plausibly allege gerrymandering without having in any way to justify the allegation because they know these things were the inescapable result of the decision made on 16th October at the behest of the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>They have chosen to interpret the decisive rejection by the people of our advice to change the electoral system as a political victory for themselves. They will, I think, soon enough discover how mistaken they are but, taking into account their long experience of failure in elections, it is not surprising that the result of the referendum should have gone to their heads. <Col N="2639" /> They could not even contain themselves to wait to make these allegations until the Bill was published because, as I said, they knew the type of thing that would have to be done as a result of their monoeuvring in the courts in 1961 and the decision made on the referendum earlier this year.  But even in this they cannot be logical or consistent.  I think almost every Opposition Deputy dutifully repeated this allegation of gerrymandering, and highly skilful gerrymandering at that.  They practically all alleged that the end result would be a decisive change of Government. This is certainly a new definition of skilful gerrymandering&mdash;a scheme of constituencies that will result in a decisive defeat for the Government which makes the revision.  I would be inclined to describe that as anything but skilful gerrymandering.</P>
    <P>Shorn of the volume of personal abuse in which they were couched, the Opposition speeches boil down to saying that the Minister did not gerrymander, this was only because he could not do it, and he would have done it if he could.  I am satisfied that if a count were made of the Deputies on both sides of the House who are reasonably satisfied, and those who are genuinely worried for their own personal survival, the result would be about equal.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Dunne, that, in fact, it is not possible to gerrymander, that the knowledge on which to base gerrymandering is not available.  As reported in the Official Report of the debate on 27th November he said he did not see how it is possible today for any Party to say with certainty where their support will lie.  That is the position so far as I am concerned.  I thoroughly agree. Even if I had wanted to gerrymander I would not have had the information available to me.  However, so far from my wanting to do any of those things I agree with those Opposition Deputies who said that I was not enthusiastic about it.  I did not want to bring in this Bill at all.  It was forced upon me and the Government.</P>
    <P>In order to put the issues, if issues they are, between us in perspective it is necessary to distinguish the matters <Col N="2640" /> on which there is a basic agreement apparently, in so far as it can be gathered from the debate, from those matters which appear to be somewhat in dispute.  I think there are more of the former than of the latter.  The first point on which there is general agreement is the necessity for having a revision before the next general election, having regard to the population figures disclosed in the 1966 census.  In fact, it is obvious that this became apparent to the Opposition before it dawned on the Government side.  That is obvious from the Questions put down almost as soon as the census report was covered.  In fact, it appears that Deputies were waiting for the report of the census in order to demand just exactly what has to be done now.</P>
    <P>The second point which appears to be generally accepted is that the total number of Deputies should remain at 144.  There was not any complaint about that.  The third point on which there was general agreement&mdash;I do not say complete agreement&mdash;was that in revising the constituencies the maximum divergence from the national average of population per Deputy should be 1,000 above or below the national average.  I appreciate that Deputy Fitzpatrick sought to imply that we could avail of a much greater divergence than this, even after all our arguments during the referendum campaign, and in the debate on the Bills, but in view of the fact that the referendum was contested on the basis that that was the maximum permissible divergence, and that in the referendum the people decided to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, I find it hard to believe that this was seriously intended.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some other Deputies, notably Deputy Dunne, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, felt that no divergence at all was permissible, and are of the opinion that even taking four seats from the rural parts of the country and putting them into the Dublin area is still doing a savage injustice to the people of Dublin.  That view, I admit, was expressed very forcibly on behalf of the Labour Party by my colleague Deputy Dunne who alleged that we should have taken more seats from the rural areas and put them in <Col N="2641" /> Dublin.  He did not specify how many. Apparently the Labour Party did not go into the question in the same detail as did the Fine Gael Party, so it is an unspecified number of extra seats apparently which should have been put in with Dublin.  Generally speaking, however, I think it was agreed that this divergence of 1,000 up or down was acceptable.</P>
    <P>Another point on which there appeared to be general agreement, not complete agreement, was on the regional distribution of the seats.  It seems to be agreed that the maximum permissible under present conditions 30 seats should be allocated the western area consisting of County Donegal, the Province of Connacht and County Clare, 38 seats in Dublin, and 76 in the rest of Ireland.  As Deputy Donegan said, an eminent economist and statistician in the Seanad and an eminent surgeon in this House put forward their own scheme for this on the same basis as the scheme brought in. Both of them gave the same regional distribution of 30 in the west, 38 in Dublin, and 76 in the rest of Ireland. Here again, of course, Deputy Dunne is the odd man out.  He maintains that this allocation of seats was a vindictive attack on the fundamental rights of the people of Dublin, thus apparently placing his two eminent Coalition colleagues in the same category as the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is a wide measure of agreement in regard to the general size of constituencies, that is that the constituencies should return either three, four or five Deputies.  I do not claim there was agreement as to the relative number of constituencies of each different size there should be.  Apart from one or two Deputies, there was no real advocacy of larger constituencies or constituencies returning a greater number of Deputies.  Finally, although there were some Deputies who continued to bury their heads in the sand, there was general acceptance of the fact that the Constitution requires the breaching of county boundaries in many cases.  In this respect, as was to be expected, the point of disagreement relates primarily to the precise breaching which must be <Col N="2642" /> made and here, naturally, there are almost as many opinions as there are Deputies in the House.  Apart from individual complaints about their constituencies there were only two points of general disagreement that I could find in the debate.  The first was the relative number of three, four and five constituencies we should have, where the different sized constituencies should be located, and the degree to which the breaching of county boundaries was necessary.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with these points. With regard to the matter of breaching the county boundaries I have said that this is inevitable.  What I really intended to convey was that it was inevitable that, if we continue to operate the electoral system as it was in the past&mdash;if we go in to a greater extent for the grouping together of counties and if we get constituencies returning a larger number of Deputies, it would be possible to keep every county intact, although many counties would be united with other counties.  For instance, a possible arrangement which would avoid the dismemberment of counties but would involve much more multi-county constituencies would be this.  The three counties of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim could justify under the present provisions an allocation of ten Deputies without any breaching.  The two Counties of Mayo and Roscommon could be joined into a constituency returning nine Deputies. Clare and Galway would be somewhat over the national average but could be joined to come within the interpretation of the Constitution in a constituency returning 11 Deputies. Limerick and Kerry could be joined together in a constituency of 13 Deputies.  Tipperary and Waterford could be joined in a constituency of ten Deputies.  Cork County could return 11 Deputies as a single constituency.  Cavan, Longford and Westmeath could be joined together to return seven Deputies. Louth, Meath and Monaghan could return nine.  Kildare, Laois and Offaly could return eight.  Carlow, Kilkenny, Wicklow and Wexford could return 12 and Cork City could return six. Dublin County could return 11 and then that would leave 27 for Dublin <Col N="2643" /> City which could conceivably be one constituency or three nine-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that constituencies returning a number of Deputies of this order would be nearer to the situation that was envisaged by the inventors of the system and I admit that, in view of the decisive nature of the referendum result, I was drawn to this type of solution.  But I do not think that this type of scheme of constituencies was really an issue in the referendum.  I think the decision was in fact in favour of constituencies returning a small number of Deputies as now.  There would, I think, be many practical disadvantages in such a scheme of constituencies.  For instance, I am sure Deputies will have noticed that if we had Limerick and Kerry joined together in one constituency, as would be necessary to avoid breaching of boundaries in that area, we would have had already in the lifetime of this Dáil, three by-elections in that constituency although the Dáil has still something over a year to run its full course.  I imagine that most Deputies will agree that the people would be likely to become somewhat irritated by this almost continuous election activity.  I need hardly say that the last thing I would like to do would be to cause any disillusionment with such an excellent system.  In this type of arrangement which approaches the ideal of proportional representation Deputies might, for instance, be interested to speculate on the prospects of a deceased Deputy in Roscommon being replaced by a Roscommon candidate in a by-election in a constituency where the Mayo electors would outnumber the Roscommon ones by two to one and similarly in regard to the joining together of Clare and Galway and other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any doubt about my attitude to this question of the breaching of county boundaries or the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Although it is no doubt true, as Senator Dooge informed me in the Seanad, that these divisions were instituted by the illustrious King John at the turn of the twelfth century, we <Col N="2644" /> on this side of the House abhor the necessity to breach county boundaries in this way.  Deputy Barrett asked me why I have changed my attitude to this matter.  My only reply is that I have not changed my attitude at all but the people decided against me and I am compelled to do what I endeavoured to avoid.</P>
    <P>Apparently there is not complete agreement in regard to the size of the constituencies but I may say that the Government decided at the outset against the creation of any new, large, unwieldy five-seat constituencies especially in rural areas.  We decided, for instance, against the creation of a large, difficult to work constituency comprising practically the whole of County Donegal and similarly with regard to Kerry.  The decision not to do this involved in the one case additions to Donegal from Leitrim and in the other case additions to Kerry from Cork in order to retain two three-seat constituencies in these areas.  We decided also against the formation of what we looked upon as the suggested monstrosity of a joint Cavan-Monaghan constituency, which would be a long straggling one extending almost in the shape of a &ldquo;U&rdquo; around the Border of the Six County area.  I think it is only necessary to look at a map to see the impracticality of this suggestion and the difficulty that would be involved both for the people and for their Deputies. We considered an arrangement that would involve a suggestion that has been made here of a Kildare-Carlow constituency, but again the creation of such a long straggling anomalous type of constituency did not appeal to us.  This, in fact, involved the disruption of the whole population of Carlow which has been in a constituency with Kilkenny for quite a number of years and it seemed to us at any rate to be a less acceptable solution than the solution that was decided upon.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question I must refer to one aspect of the Opposition's contribution that I must admit puzzles me and that is the apparent unanimity in the Fine Gael Party that Donegal should have been made a five-seat constituency by the detachment of the Bundoran and Ballyshannon areas <Col N="2645" /> from it and their transfer into County Leitrim.  I do not know why there is this apparent concentration on Deputy O'Donnell's seat, why Fine Gael seem to be so anxious to take away a considerable portion of that particular constituency and convert the Donegal situation into a single five-seat constituency in which Deputy O'Donnell obviously would not secure his seat. Of course, it may be that he has been successful in this planned migration of Fine Gael rural Deputies to the Dublin area.  I know, because I was present, that he did during the referendum campaign advocate the type of solution that we have in fact adopted&mdash;the creation of an increased number of three-seat constituencies&mdash;on the basis that this would be a scheme of constituencies that would make it more likely that the people would be able to return a Government at election time.  I do know that his Party officially favours the creation of a situation in which it will not be possible for the people to do this, that they have this coalition mentality and that what they aim at is a situation in which there will be continuously indecisive results but I do not know that this was sufficient to justify this attack on his seat.  I admit he does not appear here as often as his colleague, Deputy Harte, but then when he does come he behaves himself and does not get himself ejected with such monotonous regularity.  In regard to this question of the number of three-seat constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He seems very short of arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we were attacked for the number of three-seat constituencies and, particularly, in rural areas. It was alleged that this was done in order to ensure a Fianna Fáil Government. This is a flattering tribute, of course, to Fianna Fáil policy and, in particular, to my colleague who has just concluded the debate on the Estimate for his Department, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  While accepting this unsolicited testimonial as to the merit of the Fianna Fáil policy, I have to ask why should an increase in the number of three-seat constituencies always benefit only <Col N="2646" /> Fianna Fáil?  Why should it not be conceivable that at some time in the future it might possibly benefit the Fine Gael Party or maybe, at some time in the more distant future, even the Labour Party?  I must admit I find it just as hard as apparently the Fine Gael Deputies themselves do to imagine their new agricultural policy, of a reduction in the number of farms so as to arrive at a situation where each farm would be capable of supporting 400 cows, ever being a popular policy in the rural areas but, at the same time, surely the fact is that three-seat constituencies will, as Deputy O'Donnell has said, facilitate people in electing the Government they want and we can only get that support from the people if the people want us as a Government.  So that this allegation that the creation of three-seat constituencies must ensure the return of Fianna Fáil seems to me to be an admission that Fianna Fáil will retain the support of the people and I am not going to argue against that.</P>
      <P>After all, it is agreed that, generally speaking, something around 50 per cent support is necessary in order to get two seats out of three and if the Opposition choose to assume that this will always be attained by Fianna Fáil and never by them, I will not argue about that, but it does seem perfectly clear to me that, under this system, the people will be able to return us when they want us and when they do not want us it will be reasonably possible for them to elect an alternative Government. The only real complaint I see in this is that by increasing the number of three-seat constituencies from 17 to 26 we are making it less likely that a Coalition situation will result.  But while the Opposition argue that this must always favour Fianna Fáil, they have also, in the same debate, been saying that there is a significant swing from Fianna Fáil.  Obviously, these two propositions cannot stand together.  One is contradictory of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I appreciate that there are many different ways in which the constituencies could have been revised.  We have brought forward one which we think is the least objectionable and there have been two alternatives put <Col N="2647" /> forward by the Fine Gael Party.  Both of these are also feasible.  I think they do not produce as reasonable a scheme of constituencies as what we put forward but I admit that there is room for disagreement on that and, as I have said, many other arrangements could also be suggested.  However, I assume that I am expected to comment on the two definite proposals that have been put forward by the Fine Gael Party, one by Senator FitzGerald and one by Deputy Hogan.  The main claim, strange as it may seem, that is apparently made for both of these is that they involve actually less transferring of people from one county to another&mdash; something that has been argued in the previous session of the Dáil, as being entirely irrelevant and entirely unimportant. But now the main argument put forward in favour of these two suggestions is that it involves less disturbance of the people from one county to another and from one constituency to another.</P>
    <P>The figures, in fact, do not stand up to investigation at all.  Senator FitzGerald's figures, for instance, do not include anything about the necessary transfer between Dublin city and county and do not take cognisance of the joining together, for the first time, of the counties Cavan and Monaghan and of Roscommon and an extra portion of Leitrim.  Neither do they take account of the detachment of Carlow from the present constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and its integration into a new constituency with Kildare. The figures that I gave for the transferring of people include the adjustment between the two separate administrative areas of North and South Tipperary and this has not been taken into account either.  In fact, if account is taken of all the disruption and if the figures for the scheme put forward by the Government and by Senator FitzGerald are compared on the same basis, there is disruption of a greater population under Senator FitzGerald's scheme.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Government's scheme is concerned, for instance, the Louth people who are listed as transferred to the Monaghan constituency are already there, as are the Leitrim people <Col N="2648" /> attached to Roscommon and Sligo and the Wexford people attached to Kilkenny and there is no disturbance at all involved there.  In fact, the Government's proposal, as I said, involves less disturbance.  The same applies with regard to the people of Waterford. They are already in the constituency of South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>As well as this, I think that the scheme put forward by Senator FitzGerald takes no account whatever of having convenient constituencies, that is, constituencies that it will be possible for Deputies to represent reasonably adequately.  The idea of having practically the whole of Donegal in one constituency, Cavan and Monaghan united, Carlow and Kildare and the constituency of Galway, Roscommon and Leitrim, is not, I think, very realistic.</P>
    <P>Again, I think the suggestion as a whole demonstrates the coalition mentality in the Fine Gael Party, the inherent belief that it just is not feasible for them to aspire to attain a majority involving, as it does, a decrease in the number of three-seat constituencies and an increase in the number of larger constituencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Hogan's suggestion, I have not had time to check it and in any case it is not very important but I am quite sure his figures could be shown to be just as incomplete as Senator FitzGerald's.</P>
    <P>In any case, while, as I say, we look upon the detachment of any part of one county and its attachment to another as objectionable, it is at least questionable, when part of a county must go into another, whether it would be more equitable to make this as small as possible and to make the community being transferred as insignificant as possible or whether it would be better to transfer a substantial number which will form a significant and sizeable community in their new electoral environment.  For example, in the case which is most familiar to Deputy Hogan, who went to the trouble of devising this scheme of constituencies, a Deputy residing in the transferred area actually succeeded in securing election with the result that the undesirable effects of this provision of the Constitution which requires this <Col N="2649" /> type of thing to be done and to which Deputy Hogan and others referred at such great length, were, in so far as the people were concerned, largely mitigated.  Similarly the election of Deputy Crinion undoubtedly helped to mitigate the frustration felt by the people in the parts of Meath and Westmeath which had to be attached to Kildare as a result of the Fine Gael Party's action in the courts.  Deputy Hogan agreed that Leitrim was obviously a problem area which would have to be dismembered in some way. In the way we propose in regard to Leitrim, the areas to be attached to the three counties of Donegal, Sligo and Roscommon are each a sizeable area and no elected representative for either of the three constituencies will be able to ignore with impunity the interests of the people of that part of the county which would be transferred.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the part of Clare which will be involved in the Clare-Galway constituency.  Fine Gael seem to be unanimous that it would be desirable to put a comparatively small part of Galway in with Clare.  It must be obvious that the solution we have put forward is in fact likely to result in four Clare Deputies being elected instead of three.  The area is sufficient in size for the people to return a Clare Deputy if they want to.  Here again there is no question of a small area of one county being submerged and lost in another.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Hogan's efforts have been largely wasted.  I have never denied that there were countless ways in which the requirements of the Constitution could be met.  It is quite obvious he has put quite a considerable amount of time, effort and study into the task.  He was able to go into considerable detail in regard to areas to be transferred from one county to another county.  He was able to specify the parts of Deputy O'Donnell's constituency which he thought should be transferred to Leitrim.  He was able to specify in detail the part of Deputy Donnellan's constituency he believes should be transferred to the County Clare.  It is obvious that he did take pains to acquaint himself both with the geography and demography of these far distant places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2650" /> I must say I found it rather surprising then that when he came to an area with which one would have thought he should be reasonably well acquainted and which would not have seemed to have demanded any great study&mdash;the area of South Tipperary and Waterford &mdash;he found himself completely unable to specify the areas that should be transferred.  He obviously set out with the best intentions in the world but when he came to this area he baulked at the last moment at endorsing the suggestion made by his colleague in the Seanad.  Here he did not see an obvious solution in a compact area like Bundoran, Ballyshannon or Gort.  He did not opt for the compact area specified by his colleague.</P>
    <P>In regard to the area to be transferred to make up Waterford to a sufficient level to justify four seats, the portion to be transferred was not to come from Carrick-on-Suir or from Clonmel or Youghal but from &ldquo;somewhere.&rdquo; I found it rather surprising that he had not got the same detail and it was some vague &ldquo;hinterland&rdquo; which was to supply the population of Waterford.  He did make some vague reference to Carrickbeg but not to Carrickmore.  Apparently, he ruled out Clonmel and Youghal.  He might as well have admitted that his Party had decided as Senator FitzGerald had said&mdash;and for obvious reasons&mdash;that the appropriate area was Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    <P>The House will understand that when a Minister for Local Government has to bring in a Bill proposing a revision of constituencies he cannot deal with it in the same way as Deputy Hogan did and he cannot say that the population required to make up a constituency should come from &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo;; he has to specify the exact electoral divisions and townlands that have to be transferred.  Much as I would have liked to avoid these things and adopted Deputy Hogan's formula of a &ldquo;hinterland from somewhere&rdquo;, I found that this solution was not available to me.  At least Deputy Hogan, and I suppose the Fine Gael Party, did put forward their own suggestions. I do not think they are as good as the <Col N="2651" /> Government's suggestions but I agree that that is a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>One thing which emerges from the suggestions they put forward is that they agree with our allocation of seats on the basis of 30 seats to the West, 38 to Dublin and 76 to the rest of the country.  The Labour Party do not agree with this but, although they have a more fundamental disagreement with the proposed revision than Fine Gael, they have been much less specific.  My colleague, Deputy Dunne, was the most specific of all Labour Deputies in dealing with this question.  The allocation of only four extra seats in the Dublin area at the expense of rural Ireland was described by him as a savage revenge on the people of Dublin.  At column 1282 of the Official Report for the 27th November Deputy Dunne said:</P>
    <P>Dublin constituencies are required in all cases to produce hundreds of votes in respect of every seat in excess of the national average, which is set out at 20,028 votes.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same column he says:</P>
    <P>He has tried to drag the number of voters on the register into every speech he has made as if it were relevant.</P>
    <P>After basing his whole case on this he says, of course, it is not relevant, although he is a member of one of the Parties that campaigned on the basis of one man, one vote.  In the next column he says:</P>
    <P>That means that many voters in excess of the national average are required in Dublin to secure a Dáil seat.</P>
    <P>Even after business had been interrupted for Questions Deputy Dunne still came back with this false allegation, this completely unsubstantiated allegation that more votes are required to elect a Deputy in the Dublin area than in a rural area and to allege that this was &ldquo;savage revenge on the people of Dublin&rdquo;.  At column 1339 Deputy Dunne said&mdash;this was after he <Col N="2652" /> had time to consider the matter during the interval for Questions&mdash;that the upshot of this specious argument would be that &ldquo;the people in Dublin City and Dublin County would have to pay a far higher price in terms of votes for Dáil representation than the rest of the country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What is the position? The position is that in the Dublin area the average number of voters in accordance with this proposal is 11,589 and the national average of voters per Deputy is 11,869.  For Deputy Dunne's information 11,589 is less than 11,869 by 280.  The average number of voters per Deputy in the West of Ireland is 12,365 as against the national average of 11,869.  That is 496 more.</P>
