      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £9,646,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The net amount of this Supplementary Estimate, added to the original Estimate for 1967-68, will bring the total net expenditure from the Vote for Agriculture to £49,683,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two items&mdash;Milk (Subhead N.1) and Meat (Subhead K.21)&mdash;account for the greater part of the additional sum now required, but substantial amounts are also needed for Lime and Fertilisers Subsidies (Subhead K.9); Bovine <Col N="2084" /> Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme (Subhead (K.12); Losses on Disposal of Wheat (Subhead K.20); Land Project (Subhead K.8) and in connection with the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 (Subhead L.1) which provides largely for expenditure on the special precautions necessitated by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain.  The gross total of the additional sums required under the various subheads amounts to over £11 million but against this it is now estimated that Appropriations-in-Aid will be £472,000 greater than the original provision and also that there will be savings on other subheads of the Vote amounting to over £990,000.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, my Department has, ever since the very serious foot and mouth disease epidemic started in Britain last October, been engaged in a massive and unremitting effort to keep the disease out of this country.  This was perhaps the gravest crisis which has confronted us in agriculture for many a long year.  There is, I am sure, no need for me at this stage to give details of all the various restrictions and controls that we have been operating.  The number of Statutory Orders made since last October is no less than 24.  They have affected every aspect of our economic life and have borne heavily on many people.  The effort and the sacrifices have happily proved worthwhile, and here I feel I should publicly acknowledge, once again, the co-operation of all our people, including our people in Britain, and their truly remarkable understanding of the seriousness and needs of the situation with which the country has been faced.</P>
    <P>The veterinary staff resources of the British Ministry were very heavily taxed during the outbreaks and I arranged to send to Britain at various times a total of 27 officers from the veterinary staff of my Department to work with the Ministry's staff in combating the disease.  The British Minister, Mr. Peart, has sent me a personal letter of appreciation of this arrangement and of the good work done by our staff in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have gradually cased the restrictions according as this was justified by <Col N="2085" /> developments in the disease situation in Britain.  I was recently able to announce further relaxations as a result of which trading generally may be resumed at marts and fairs on and from 29th February and the various sports which have been under restriction may be resumed as from 22nd February.</P>
    <P>As to the source of the outbreaks, the view is commonly taken that imported meat is probably responsible. The British Government have temporarily suspended imports from certain countries where the disease is endemic. The British Government have also decided to establish a committee to examine all aspects of the epidemic and the findings of this committee will be of great interest and importance to us.  We have thought well to bring to the notice of the British Government our concern lest a resumption of meat imports from certain countries might lead to further infection.</P>
    <P>The additional expense incurred by my Department up to 31st March in connection with the operation of our various restrictions and controls is estimated at £147,000.  This is, however, only a very small amount to pay to avert the economic disaster that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country would represent and I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is money well spent.</P>
    <P>Total Exchequer payments in support of creamery milk prices in 1967-68 are now estimated at £19.2 million, the highest figure ever recorded.  Five years ago the figure was only £3.2 million.  Of the total requirement of £19.2 million this year, £15,875,000 is in respect of milk production allowances including the special allowance for quality milk, and £3,300,000 is for payments to Bord Bainne.  The current rate of Exchequer support works out at an average of about 10d per gallon as compared with 8d in 1966 and 2.3d five years ago.  The total creamery milk cheque in 1967 is estimated at £51 million compared with £27 million five years previously. The average supplier of quality milk to a creamery is now receiving about <Col N="2086" /> £175 of his annual milk cheque from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The sharp increase over the years in the support for milk is a clear indication of the importance the Government attach to the dairying industry. However, it is necessary for me to say that the rate at which the total bill is mounting, as a result of the growth in production and the various increases in the allowances must cause some concern in relation to the fact that so high a proportion of the resources which can be made available for agriculture is now spent on one sector.  Another problem is that milk production has been growing in other countries as well as here.  Milk support is now costing the EEC some $800 million per annum and possibly more and the Community has a very large surplus of butter, some of which is being offered in world markets at very low prices.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £3,805,000 provided under Subhead N.1 to make up the total figure of £19.2 million required for 1967-68 consists of £3,573,000 for the milk production allowances, including the special allowance for quality milk, and £232,000 for payments to Bord Bainne in respect of export losses.  Three principal factors are responsible for this increase &mdash;the sharp rise in milk production in 1967; the decision announced in the 1967 Budget to raise the milk price allowance from 6d to 7d per gallon from 1st May, 1967; and an improvement in performance under the creamery milk quality grading scheme.  The bonus for quality milk was, of course, increased from 1d to 2d a gallon on 1st April, 1967.</P>
    <P>Preliminary figures show that deliveries of milk to creameries in 1967 were 473 million gallons, an increase of some 60 million gallons, or 14 per cent on the previous year.  Both in total and in the amount of the increase the 1967 deliveries represent an all-time record.</P>
    <P>Performance under the creamery milk quality grading scheme has shown a remarkable improvement.  When the original Estimate was framed it was thought that the proportion of milk <Col N="2087" /> which would qualify for the special allowance in the 1967 season would be about 55 per cent as compared with 48 per cent in 1966.  The returns for 1967 now show that the proportion qualifying for the quality allowance was as much as 66 per cent.  The total cost of this special allowance is now put at £2.54 million, or £652,000 more than the original Estimate.  Some of this increase is, of course, due to the rise in milk production but the major part is the result of the greater care which suppliers are taking with their production methods.  The doubling of the incentive by raising the rate of the special quality allowance from 1d to 2d per gallon last April was, I am sure, an important factor in producing the greatly improved results in 1967. I feel confident that with the very worthwhile bonus now obtainable for quality milk, the proportion qualifying for the bonus will continue to increase until the vast bulk of the creamery milk supply qualifies.</P>
    <P>The grants which I introduced last year to help milk producers to instal milk coolers are a further help in this direction.  While farmers have not so far availed themselves of these grants to the extent envisaged, experience up to the end of 1967 has been reasonably satisfactory.  Nearly 1,500 grants amounting to over £9,000 had been paid by 31st December and a sum of £20,000 is being provided in the Supplementary Estimate for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The increased exports of butter, cheese and other dairy products which have resulted from the rise in milk production involve an increase in the grant to An Bord Bainne in respect of the Exchequer's contribution towards export losses and subsidies.  The requirement under this head is now £3.3 million or £232,000 more than the original provision.  The grant is calculated at two-thirds of the Board's export losses and subsidies.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the question of the reorganisation of the creamery industry has been on the mat for a long time.  Various ideas were ventilated but nothing final or definite seemed to emerge.  On the recommendation of the National Agricultural Council, I <Col N="2088" /> made arrangements for a thorough objective examination of the question by two eminent US consultants.  Their report will be available in a few months and will, I am sure, be of considerable help when final decisions are being taken on this matter which is so vital to the long-term interests of the industry.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £4,900,000 is needed to meet the cost of the support payments on the record exports of carcase meat to Britain during the past year.  Exports of carcase beef eligible for support payments rose to an unprecedented level during the year and it is estimated that by the end of March support payments will have been made on 105,000 tons&mdash;representing over 400,000 cattle&mdash;at a cost of about £5,900,000.  Exports of eligible mutton and lamb during the year are estimated at 9,000 tons on which support payments of about £500,000 will be made, making a gross total of £6,400,000 in all on beef, mutton and lamb.  As against those payments, we will receive from the British Government, under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement, the average UK fatstock guarantee on 25,000 tons of carcase beef and 5,500 tons of carcase mutton and lamb.  The precise amount cannot be calculated until after the end of the British fatstock year on 31st March next; it will probably be something over £1½ million of which roughly one-half would be received before then and the balance early in the coming financial year.  The net cost of supporting the exports in question will therefore be nearly £5 million.</P>
    <P>I might add that there was also a very satisfactory increase in exports of boneless manufacturing beef to the United States, the quantity shipped in 1967 being 36,000 tons valued at over £12 million compared with 18,700 tons, valued at £6 million in 1966.</P>
    <P>The past year was, on the whole, a good one for the cattle trade.  Despite the gloomy prognostications emanating from various sources, the very considerable number of extra cattle carried over from 1966 were marketed throughout the year at reasonable prices and in an orderly manner as exported stores <Col N="2089" /> or as carcase beef through the meat factories.  I have already referred to the record exports of beef.  Our exports of store cattle to Britain during 1967 exceeded 600,000 head as compared with 391,000 head in 1966 and were it not for the disruption caused by the unfortunate outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain, the total for the year would have been very close to, and might well have exceeded, the level of 638,000 head envisaged in the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the support of beef, mutton and lamb exports, which is partly financed by payments from the British Government in accordance with arrangements made under the Free Trade Area Agreement, together with the guaranteed prices paid under that Agreement for our stores fattened in Britain have been powerful factors in maintaining the cattle and sheep industry in good shape during the past year, despite the big carryover of stock from 1966.  As Deputies are aware, I have also made arrangements under which any producer can have the beef export subsidy paid to him direct by my Department.</P>
    <P>So far as can be judged, the prospects for 1968 seem good.  There should be a good demand for our store cattle from British feeders and our exports of beef, both to Britain and the US, should be at a satisfactory level.  It is not possible, however, to be very optimistic about exports of cattle and beef to the EEC, so long as we are not members of the Community.  The high level of protection maintained by the EEC makes exports to the Community area completely unprofitable. For example, at the moment a levy of about £40 per head plus a duty of 16 per cent is payable on imports of cattle into Germany and Italy.  It is clearly impossible for us to surmount barriers of this order.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, I propose to set up a board with promotional and development functions in relation to export marketings of livestock (cattle and sheep) and meat.  The arrangements for the establishment of this body are well-advanced and I hope <Col N="2090" /> to make a more detailed announcement before very long.</P>
    <P>There is a small provision in the Estimate in respect of headage payments on fat cattle exported to Britain. This is intended to cover a small number of payments in respect of exports under the scheme in operation in the autumn of 1966, which were not finally cleared until after the end of the 1966-67 financial year.</P>
    <P>In order to help to provide an alternative outlet for pigs during the strike at bacon factories, which began on 20th October last, I arranged that an appropriate subsidy would be paid on exports of live pigs.  The subsidy was initially fixed at 80/- per pig but this was later increased to a total of 100/- in order to cover the extra transport and other costs arising.  When work resumed at the bacon factories on 8th November, I considered it desirable to keep this export subsidy in operation for a further couple of weeks so as to assist the disposal of the backlog of pigs with producers. In all about 3,600 live pigs qualified for the subsidy at a total cost of approximately £18,000.  The subsidy was paid through the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the amount involved will have to be repaid to the Commission from Subhead K.19.  I might add that in addition to subsidising the export of live pigs at that time I arranged that minimum guaranteed prices would be paid for a period after the strike, for pigs which exceeded the normal weight ranges for the top grades.  These two measures contributed greatly towards offsetting any hardship occasioned to producers by the strike.</P>
    <P>While, apparently due largely to the operation of the famous and mysterious &ldquo;pig cycle&rdquo;, the level of pig production in 1967 was lower than it was in 1965 or 1966, these two years were in fact record years and by comparison with other years the 1967 level was reasonably good.  It was not very much below the levels of the years 1961 to 1964 and it was higher than in any of the 20 years back from 1960. There is, however, considerable scope for increased pig production.  We have <Col N="2091" /> assured market outlets for all the pigmeat we can produce and there are guaranteed minimum prices for all the top grades.  At the moment I am having a special look at the position in regard to pig and feed prices and I am hopeful that it will be possible to make some adjustments which will give greater encouragement to pig production, especially in the West where increased pig production could do much to add to the income of small farmers.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £76,500 is required to meet the expenditure incurred this year under the Mountain Lamb Subsidy Scheme.  This scheme replaced the Wether Lamb and Hogget Ewe Subsidy Schemes which were introduced in the previous year.  The present scheme is in fact an extension of the Wether Lamb Subsidy Scheme and provides for payment to mountain farmers of a subsidy at the rate of 10/-per head on all good quality lambs of the Blackface and Cheviot breeds produced in mountain flocks.  The sale clause in the previous scheme for wether lambs was dropped in the new scheme and this made it possible to hold inspections in the mountain areas, mainly at dipping centres, thus facilitating the mountain flockowners. There were in all 550 inspection centres this year compared with 67 centres&mdash;all at sales and fairs&mdash;in the previous year, and some 350,000 lambs were earmarked for subsidy.  Another feature of the new scheme was the inclusion of a condition that all lambs presented for subsidy must be dipped. The insertion of this clause gave an impetus to the campaign for the elimination of sheep scab.  The cost of the scheme in the current year is expected to come to £176,500 of which all but £1,000&mdash;for penning and ear-marking equipment and other miscellaneous expenses&mdash;went to the mountain sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>The success of the scheme this year can be judged by the response of the mountain sheep farmers in presenting so many lambs for inspection and by the increase of about £130,000 in the amount of direct financial assistance which they received as compared with <Col N="2092" /> last year.  The scheme is providing a worthwhile stimulus to increased productivity in mountain flocks and by helping in the elimination of sheep scab, it plays an important part in improving health standards amongst mountain sheep.  I am having the results obtained this year examined to see if there are any changes which experience may show to be desirable in the future operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The gross expenditure on the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme is up by £587,000 on the amount already voted, the main reason being that the Department has taken up more reacting animals this year than had originally been anticipated.  However, this excess is very largely counterbalanced by increased salvage receipts, which bring the net excess expenditure down to £100,000.</P>
    <P>The extremely low level of warble infestation in the national cattle herd brought about by the success of the Warble Fly Eradication Scheme over the past few years has enabled us to discontinue the compulsory dressing of all cattle in the autumn.  It is necessary, however, to ensure that any cattle which show evidence of warble infestation in the spring are dressed so as to eliminate sources of reinfestation and complete the eradication campaign.  With this end in view I have made the Warble Fly (Notification and Treatment) Order, 1967, which obliges herd owners who have cattle showing warbles in the period from the 1st February to the 31st August to notify my Department. Such cattle will be treated free but a charge of 5/- will be made for the treatment of each warbled animal in cases where my Department is not notified.  The Order also prohibits the movement of cattle showing warbles unless they have been treated and certified by my Department.</P>
    <P>I regard the present stage in the campaign for the eradication of the warble fly as a very critical one.  If all farmers co-operate by keeping a close eye on their cattle during the specified period and by giving notice where warbles are observed, we can speedily bring about the final eradication <Col N="2093" /> of this pest.  On the other hand, indifference by farmers at this stage can only result in the re-infestation of their own and neighbouring herds and jeopardise the success of the programme.  I would, therefore, earnestly appeal to all herdowners to be meticulous in examining their stock frequently between now and next August and in immediately notifying the Department's district veterinary office if any evidence of warble infestation is observed.</P>
    <P>The provision of £18,000 in Subhead K.10 in respect of the Warble Fly Eradication Campaign is offset by a corresponding appropriation-in-aid in Subhead P (32) and (33).  Of this provision, £6,000 represents the cost of dressing animals for warble during the year.  The balance of £12,000 will be paid into the Warble Fly Eradication Account from which compensation is paid to farmers for any losses attributable to the treatment.</P>
    <P>The provision of £440,000 in Subhead K.20 relates to a payment to An Bord Gráin to meet the Board's losses on the sale of about 27,000 tons of potentially millable wheat of the 1967 crop as animal food.  Farmers were, of course, paid the millable wheat price for this wheat.  The amount will be recouped to the Exchequer by means of a customs duty on imported milling wheat.</P>
    <P>Flour millers purchased 203,000 tons of wheat from the 1967 wheat harvest at the full millable price.  This represented 90 per cent of the crop. Of this quantity 168,000 tons was fully millable, and 35,000 tons was purchased as potentially millable. Flour millers could not, however, use for flour milling all the potentially millable wheat bought at the full millable price: 27,000 tons had to be diverted for sale by An Bord Gráin as animal feed at a price in line with current feed grain prices.  These are about £17 per ton below the price paid to the growers for the potentially millable wheat.  This year the flour millers increased their use of native wheat in the grist from 37½ per cent to 55 per cent in order to absorb all <Col N="2094" /> the millable wheat produced.  If the 27,000 tons could have been used for flour milling, its cost would have had to be borne in the cost of flour. It is logical that its cost should still be so borne and the import duty is being imposed on imported wheat to meet it.</P>
    <P>A sum of £400,000 is required under Subhead K.8 to meet additional expenditure on grants to farmers under the Land Project.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that there has been a considerable reduction in the time taken to deal with applications, with the result that the number of grants falling due for payment has increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead K.9.  I am seeking an extra £610,000, made up of £150,000 for ground limestone, £430,000 for phosphates and £30,000 for potash.</P>
    <P>In the year to March, 1967, deliveries of ground limestone reached the record level of 1,565,000 tons. There were exceptionally high deliveries in the months of January-March, 1967, accounts for which were not received in time for payment in 1966-67 and had to be met from this year's provision.  Furthermore, in the present year consumption has proved higher than originally expected.  Increased usage of ground limestone is of course greatly to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The year to June 1967 was one of record application of all the major fertilisers&mdash;nitrogen, phosphate and potash.  This increased rate of consumption is being maintained in the present year.  It is very encouraging to see that the intensive publicity campaign we launched last year in association with other interests, including county committees of agriculture and manufacturers, has proved such a success. I am sure that nobody will object to the provision now being sought which brings the total of lime and fertilisers subsidies to almost £6 million.  Greater usage of lime fertilisers is an absolute essential for any worthwhile increase in agricultural production and I would urge farmers to expand still further their usage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> The scheme of grants for glasshouse nurseries was brought into operation in March, 1967.  As the scheme was a new one, our original estimate of its cost was necessarily a tentative one.  In the event, some 200 applications for grants were received and approval entailing grant expenditure in the region of £300,000 has issued for the construction of over 40 acres of new glasshouses and for the modernisation of existing units.  Not all this expenditure will mature for payment before 31st March, but to date claims for grants amounting to £80,000 have been paid, further claims to the amount of £20,000 have been received, and it is reckoned that an additional £50,000 will be required to meet grants falling due for payment within the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide the most modern type of houses and ancillary systems of heating, ventilation, irrigation, etc. in order to equip our glasshouse industry not only to serve the needs of the home market but within a short space to face up to competition in export markets.  I consider it a good sign that growers are prepared to accept this challenge and to contribute their own money in the ratio of two to one of that provided by the State towards the modernisation of their industry.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead D.10, I am seeking an additional £5,000 for the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme.  This arises because we are increasing the grant towards the administrative expenses of the Farm Apprenticeship Board and also increasing the provision for awards to apprentices.  These awards are £500 each and are paid to apprentices who complete their apprenticeship and pass the prescribed tests with special merit.  More young men than anticipated originally are eligible to sit for the final examination and so complete for the £500 awards this year.</P>
    <P>Under the Scheme of Instalment Credit Facilities for the Purchase of Dairy Livestock introduced in 1966, a special arrangement was made with the Agricultural Credit Corporation that loans issued up to 31st December, <Col N="2096" /> 1966, would be at a substantially reduced rate of interest, 2½ per cent per annum, the resulting loss of interest to be recouped by my Department. Extra expenditure of £4,000 was incurred in 1967-68 under that heading. A further £1,000 over the amount estimated was necessary to recoup the Corporation in respect of three cases of irrecoverable losses under sundry guaranteed loan schemes.  Accordingly, a further sum of £5,000 is provided under Subhead K.3.</P>
    <P>The provision of £2,600 in Subhead K.K.6 is to cover the travelling and subsistence expenses of the National Agricultural Council in the first year of its existence.</P>
    <P>It is now about a year since the Council was established and I should like to place on record my conviction that it has in that period fulfilled very effectively the purpose for which it was brought into existence, which was to provide a means by which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could discuss with representative members of the farming community the problems confronting the agricultural industry.  That this can be done in an unemotional and constructive atmosphere has been proved at every meeting of the Council held since its inception.</P>
    <P>Of course, as well all know, the Council has, from the beginning, been the subject of criticism by certain hostile interests in this country who have tried to undermine the confidence of the farming community in the Council.  These efforts have not succeeded and there is now a growing realisation among farmers and the general public that the Council has in fact shown itself to be a very useful forum which enables the farmers to bring their views to bear on the Government's agricultural policy and to influence it in a very direct way.  While on the subject of the Council, I would add that I have made it clear on more than one occasion that both the Government and I stand ready to work in close and constructive collaboration with all farming organisations for the benefit of Irish agriculture.  That is still the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> With the inclusion of the additional sums I am now seeking in respect of such items as beef and dairy produce subsidies, the total of State expenditure in relation to agriculture in 1967-68 is now estimated to be in the region of £69 million, of which about 38 per cent is for price support and the balance represents aids to increased productivity and reduction of costs. This record sum is much in excess of the amount estimated at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say something briefly about the general outturn for agriculture in 1967.  It was a good year.  A number of factors&mdash; principally the strong demand for cattle and beef in Britain and the United States, a record level of milk production and an increase in the tillage acreage&mdash;suggest that there was a substantial increase in the value of agricultural output and in income.  The weather was generally favourable, crop yields were good and increased prices operated for a number of products.  It was a record year for agricultural exports.</P>

      <P>That the Vote be reduced by £2,600 in respect of subhead K.K.6 &mdash;National Agricultural Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the amount in the Vote to cover travelling and subsistence allowances for the members of the so-called NAC.  This is a very small sum having regard to the size of the overall Estimate and even having regard to the size of the Supplementary Estimate placed before us here today.  It is certainly not on account of the sum we <Col N="2098" /> are objecting.  We are objecting because we feel this money is being provided to keep in existence what I think can fairly and can only be defined as a glorified Fianna Fáil cumann.</P>
    <P>As we know, it was set up at a time when the farmers were at war with the Government and at a time when ill-feeling and resentment were at their height.  I think any sensible Minister for Agriculture should have recognised that this was not a time to attempt to set up a national agricultural council that would be representative of all farm units in the country.  Unfortunately that was the time selected to do this.  What have we got?  We have a small body whose advice the Minister says he values very much.  I am sure some of them have good advice to give but they are a small selected group, a large percentage of whom have been picked by the Minister, and consequently they are suspect by the majority of the farmers who have no confidence in what they recommend.</P>
    <P>Many of the members of this body do not belong to any organised group of farmers and can speak only for themselves as individuals.  I am sure some of them, as individuals, can give sensible advice but they cannot claim to be qualified to represent the farmers of Ireland; and it is too bad, and very difficult to understand, that the Minister should want to keep in existence a group of this kind when their continued existence has the effect of preventing the setting up of a worthwhile National Agricultural Council with whom the Minister could work and who could be of immense value to any Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Until we get mutual trust and confidence between the Government and the farmers, no programme for agricultural development and expansion can hope to succeed.  At a time when the Minister should be making an all-out effort to bring that kind of relationship about, he is, in fact, asking us to provide money to keep in existence this small group of people when he knows their existence is resented by the majority of farmers. The present position is that in fact there is only one organised group of farmers represented on the NAC of <Col N="2099" /> their own volition.  The General Council of Committees of Agriculture were represented; they decided to withdraw but the Minister decided to keep those two people on, as he is entitled to do.  The Best Growers Association are there against their will and we have a position in which only the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association are there and have decided to be there.</P>
    <P>After that, there is a selected group of people and despite what the Minister says about how well they are working, I do not believe they are working well or that they will work well until the Minister has succeeded in getting the majority of the farmers of Ireland represented on the Council. He has said that he decided originally to select six of the people on this body. He said that there are many sectors, many interests in the farming industry which are not represented by organised groups and that he had to retain the right to put on the Council a number of people he himself could regard as being able to represent those various important sectors.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable and a plausible statement but it has not been borne out by what has happened.  The people selected by the Minister to be put on this body cannot be said in fact to represent the various groups the Minister had in mind at that time and it is a great pity the Minister is not trying seriously to bring about a change which could lead to a position all of us want to see&mdash;a position in which there could be wholehearted co-operation, confidence and enthusiasm of the farmers of the country to put into operation a progressive long-term policy for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Again on this occasion the Minister has more or less issued a sort of loose invitation to come in to those who have stayed outside.  Even the one organised group represented on the council at the moment are not satisfied.  They are looking for an independent secretariat. The ICMSA are not completely satisfied with the present setup.  There must be an independently-elected group to represent the farmers, with their own secretariat and their own advice.  It is only in that way that we shall get the <Col N="2100" /> views of the practitioners contrasted with the views arrived at in the Department, with consequent fair and proper solutions worked out for the various problems that are inevitable in this as in any other industry.</P>
    <P>If we get this body I have in mind, and which most people would like to see in existence, I do not for a moment suggest that everything will run smoothly, but the last thing I should like to see set up is a National Agricultural Council to fight the Minister or the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister and the Department of Agriculture and the farmers are natural allies who should be working together in the sort of relationship I have suggested, working together to get from the industry the maximum expansion, the maximum exports and the maximum income for themselves.  I hope we can arrive at that position soon but I fear greatly that we shall not arrive at it by keeping this small group in existence, a group who are more of an irritant.  I hope the Minister at an early date will decide to get rid of this sham National Agricultural Council.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;sham&rdquo;, I am not in any way belittling personally any of the members.  I know some of them. They are people I have an amount of respect for, but it really should not be called a National Agricultural Council because it is not even a pale reflection of what such a council should be.  It was set up by the Minister; it is his baby and he should be made to support it; and I am sorry we have not some machinery whereby the Minister could be surcharged for the spending of this money because the farmers throughout the country have revolted against this type of National Agricultural Council set up at a time when the farmers had begun to see some hope of progress.  The substance of our motion on this Supplementary Estimate is that the sum be reduced by £2,600 for the various reasons I have attempted to outline.</P>
    <P>Subhead D10 deals with the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme.  The scheme has taken a very long time to get off the ground and we are pleased to see in this Supplementary Estimate <Col N="2101" /> some evidence of progress.  The response early on was poor, perhaps because there was not enough information about the scheme.  There was never enough enthusiasm generally about it.  Here again we have the bones of a good scheme that should get every encouragement.  The number of people applying originally was quite small; I have forgotten the exact number but I think it was in the region of 30 applicants.  It is a four year apprenticeship period, and if the applicants reach the age of 21 at the end of three years, they are normally entitled to conclude and get, at that stage, a bonus of £500 from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not indicate the number of people he expects to qualify this year but I think it is in the region of eight or nine.  At least this gives them some sort of compensation for their efforts to become better farmers. There are many snags in this scheme which should be overcome.  An applicant is required to have spent a year at an agricultural college and he is also expected to have got science and agriculture in his intermediate certificate. This is a fairly stiff requirement for a small farmer and it is also extremely stiff for the sons of farm workers.  Farm workers should be encouraged to come into the scheme and they should be assisted in every way to come into it.  Today there is a much greater need for specially trained farmers and specially trained farm workers than ever before.  The whole movement today is towards more specialised, bigger units and consequently more people are required with specialised skills.</P>
    <P>Perhaps another fault may be that there is no provision in the scheme for specialised training in, say, machine milking large numbers of cows, in the working of expensive machinery, or in large-scale tillage.  You get these things in part on the farms that have been selected.  I do not know any of the farms that have been selected, but an effort should be made to provide specialists because in certain lines of farm husbandry, it is not necessary for a farm to be big to give people a <Col N="2102" /> living.  Pigs are an example and we will deal with pigs later in the course of the discussion.  This is an example where if you have an expert in pig production, expert in the most modern techniques and experience in relation to feeding, housing and husbandry generally, you can obtain quite a decent income from a small acreage. You have the same thing in the horticultural industry.  There is an opening here for small people and for providing a decent opportunity for the sons of farm workers.</P>
    <P>If a farm worker is to be enabled to send his son to a college for a year some assistance must be provided for the family because in most cases they cannot afford the loss of earnings involved by sending the boy, even on a scholarship, to the college.  The same difficulty arises with small farmers.  It is a big effort for a small farmer to send the boy for a year and then when he wants the boy home to work on the farm, he goes for three or four years of his apprenticeship to another farm. Everyone knows that when a boy leaves home, even if he is paid the recognised agricultural wage, very little of it comes home to the farmer.  In any event, it is a small wage.  Some sort of bonus would need to be paid to small farmers who make the sacrifice of allowing their sons to become trainees or apprentices.  The same goes for the son of the farm worker.</P>
    <P>At the end of this we have the £500; that is the reward at the end.  That is of considerable assistance to a farmer who is in a position to set up a son, either to bring him in, as some are prepared to do, as a partner on the holding, or make an effort to provide him with a farm with the assistance of borrowed money.  This is not the complete answer and a lot of the skill and talent which is developed through the scheme will be lost unless we are able to find some way of ensuring that the majority of these apprentices get farms of their own, or perhaps get horticultural holdings, or an acreage big enough to specialise in pigs or something of that sort.</P>
    <P>In 1960 I proposed a resolution at the Dublin County Committee of Agriculture which was passed unanimously <Col N="2103" /> and on which we had no comment whatever subsequently from the Department of Agriculture.  The motion was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this Committee of Agriculture, wishing to promote agricultural efficiency and hopeful of the contribution to this end that will accure from the successful implementation of the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme, is anxious to explore the possibility of participation in this scheme to the extent of providing one farm each year on a short term loan for one selected apprentice from County Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This resolution was forwarded to the Department of Agriculture at the time and we received no comment on it.  I will say this much, that they never said we could not do it.  I hope the Minister will make some comment on it.  It would give added interest in each county if the committees of agriculture were participating to this extent.</P>
    <P>I have heard comment from time to time that it is all right, that these people who are successful will be able to find money, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will provide them with money to buy land.  We all know that the corporation ceased to provide money for land some time ago, except perhaps for the purpose of consolidation. We also know that they never provided money for land for landless people.  This is something which is non-existent.  We know, too, that the banks will not provide money for the purchase of land unless a large proportion of the money is already available to the person seeking this accommodation. Therefore, I would be greatly afraid that much of the value of the scheme, which I believe is a good one and a necessary one, may be lost if we do not follow through and find some way of providing successful applicants with the means of getting holdings of their own.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this scheme which was loose&mdash;I do not know whether it has since been tightened up but I tabled a question about it some time ago&mdash;is in relation to the valuation of the various holdings.  A particular <Col N="2104" /> holding could be disqualified on valuation. It is not the intention, I gathered from the Minister's reply to that question, to deprive any of the successful applicants of this £500.  That, at least, we are glad to know.  I hope that the scheme will be a success and that the Department will continue to take an interest in it.  I hope that the further steps necessary will be taken to ensure its success.</P>
    <P>The next is subhead K.3&mdash;Payments to the Agricultural Credit Corporation in respect of Loans&mdash;and, in relation to that, the Minister outlined a couple of schemes on which there were losses. These losses were sustained on the loans provided in 1966 for the purchase of cows at very low interest rates and there was also a sum of £1,000 to meet losses inevitable in any sort of lending process of this kind.  Everything possible should be done to ensure that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are at all times in a position to meet the applications that come before them.  On the whole, they are doing a good job and my experience is that every application that comes before them is reasonably considered and fairly well followed through to ensure that the money lent is used to increase production and reduce costs.  It is very important that this should be tied to a planned programme of production in conjunction with the advisory services. The Agricultural Credit Corporation employ their own advisers; these advisers work in co-operation with the advisers in the Department of Agriculture and, because of that, I believe there is far less money wasted.  On the whole, the Corporation are working well.  It is a pity, though, that there is not more advisory follow-through.  It is quite right, of course, that every applicant who comes before the Corporation should not get a loan because, in some cases, that would really be only assisting farmers to get still deeper into trouble.  It would be quite wrong to do that.</P>
    <P>The next matter is the Land Project. The work of drainage is continuing in a fairly satisfactory manner.  There is still an immense amount of work to be done and it is only right that the work should be kept going and, <Col N="2105" /> if possible, accelerated.  It is extraordinary that, after all the work that has been done over the years under this scheme, there should still be so much land needing drainage, in particular, and fertilisation.  If we are ever to reach the stage at which we will get the most out of the land, we must keep on with drainage.  It is a pity, I think, that we have not got a special drainage board co-ordinating all drainage all over the country to ensure proper outlets in various areas.  Drainage done on quite a few farms does not pay the dividend it should because the outlet is not right and the benefit of drainage, therefore, has been nullified. Another problem is the absence of compulsion to make certain farmers give an outlet and do their own drainage. Some form of compensation to encourage farmers to provide such outlets might solve the problem for those farmers who are anxious to do drainage and cannot do it because of the absence of a proper outlet as a result of the reluctance, perhaps, of a neighbour or his inability to do drainage on his own lands for one reason or another.  There is need for a vigorous effort to ensure that anybody who wants to drain his land will be able to do it.</P>
    <P>The next subhead deals with the lime and fertiliser subsidy.  It is encouraging to learn that during the past year there has been an increase in the use of lime and fertilisers.  There is no more effective way of increasing production than by the more extensive use of lime and fertilisers.  It is a fact that about 50 per cent of the land gets no nitrogen.  This is deplorable.  A couple of months back, we had an announcement of an import duty of £3 10s a ton on imported nitrogen.  This was, apparently, necessary to protect the interests of home production.  We all want to provide employment at home and, as far as possible, employment should be provided at home, but protection should not operate to increase the price of nitrogen to the farmer.  If there has to be an import duty, then there should be a subsidy paid by the Department to meet this extra cost. Potash has gone up by 57/6d a ton. <Col N="2106" /> We have not been told whether this increased price will be met by a subsidy. There was an announcement a couple of days ago of a 7½ per cent increase in fertiliser prices generally.  Who will pay this increase?  Is it the farmer? If the farmer has to pay more for his raw material, then the advance made in the past year in the increased use of fertilisers will be nullified.  That would be a great pity.  If we want to expand production, more and more fertiliser will have to be applied to the land. The Government have, I think, an obligation to see that fertilisers are kept at the lowest possible price.  The Minister so far has not indicated how these increased costs will be met.  Perhaps he will deal with it when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prevention of diseases in livestock, no matter what one may think, a great deal of loss is taking place because of fluke and stomach worms in livestock, through abortion, and through cows failing to come in calf, for one reason or another. I think these things are not followed up as well as they should be.  There is not sufficient pressure on farmers to do the necessary dosing for fluke and various other infestations.  There is not enough specialist advice in relation to cows not going in calf.  This is the cause of immense loss and there should be more veterinary activity in this field.  I thought the Minister might tell us a bit more about how the brucellosis scheme is going and how far he hopes it to move in the future.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to hear that our estimates of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme are always wrong. We were wrong this year and last year. We felt we would not have to provide so much money and that more progress had been made in this field.  I would like to hear from the Minister if in fact we are getting further outbreaks. Are we getting breakdowns here, there and everywhere in the country?  If we are, is there any way this can be overcome?  Is there still a fairly strong nucleus of cattle with TB?  Can we always expect that this sort of breakdown will occur in spite of all our efforts at final eradication? How much of this cost is due to the periodical testing that must be done <Col N="2107" /> by the Department?  We should have a bit more information about this scheme generally, which no doubt was successfully carried out.  It would be a pity if the dregs of the disease still left in the country were the cause of further outbreaks through anybody's carelessness or neglect.  It is something that should be looked at seriously by the Minister to see what way it can be overcome.</P>
    <P>That brings me to subhead K. 19, Payments to the Pigs and Bacon Commission. Things are anything but happy in the pigs and bacon industry. The Minister admits that numbers are down but says they are not alarmingly down, that there is this sort of cyclic trend all over the world, that pigs are up one year and down the next.  That is not sufficient explanation for the present position.  The whole industry is not organised at all and there has never been a serious attempt to organise it.</P>
    <P>My personal belief is that pigs can be made to pay but there must be a proper and intelligent approach to the problem.  There is far too much in this country of the fellow who has one or two sows, who can get in and out like that.  He is in no way committed. He just decides: &ldquo;The price of bonhams is good.  I will get into a sow or two.&rdquo;  He does so.  The price of pigs comes down a bit and he says: &ldquo;To blazes, I will get out.&rdquo;  It makes no great difference to his income.  He has no great commitment to pig production. As long as we have this type of intermittent pig producer, we will have no stability in the industry.  The sooner he is put out of business the better for the industry as a whole.  Of course, what we should be doing is not really putting him out of business but bringing him into the business on a scale worthwhile.  Anything less than ten sows is not really a unit worth considering. If you can get that sort of man up to a ten or 12 sow unit, he is going to make money if he works intelligently, uses balanced feed and uses it cautiously, and if the feed is organised as it should be.  I know most of the small producers are buying their feed in retail shops a few cwts. at a time.  It is costing them anything from <Col N="2108" /> 10/- to £1 more per cwt. than the pig producer who is organised and can buy in a big way, buy at the right time and perhaps store.</P>
    <P>There has been no serious attempt to organise pig production.  Until we get to a stage where we have the Department, the curers, the producers, the Agricultural Institute, the Pigs and Bacon Commission working in co-operation to get the right results, we will never overcome this.  You will have ups and downs.  You will have factories closing, as they are at present, every second week of the year.  We are told we have excess capacity.  We all know that is true.  But we should have arrived at the time where we have a target in pig production and are able to say: &ldquo;We need this capacity&rdquo; and work up to that.</P>
    <P>The present position is most unsatisfactory. There is no serious attempt to establish a proper relationship between the price a farmer gets for his pigs and the price he must pay for his feed.  This is the only way to stabilise it&mdash;get the unit up to the right size and advice him on cheap but proper pig housing.  There is far too much expensive pig housing in the country. We must at least be in a position to say: &ldquo;You can produce a pig house of this size for this money.  We will eliminate ground draughts and give you the essentials.  It is not necessary to spend a fortune.&rdquo;  When we have a farmer willing and prepared to co-operate and to act on the specialised advice he gets, he should be enabled to get the necessary money to put his housing in order and arrange his pig feed.</P>
    <P>If all these steps are taken, you will not have the chaos that exists in the industry at present.  There is a big row going on about whey and lactose. I thought the Minister might tell us how it is going.  If a lactose factory is set up and the whey disappears as a by-product for pig feed, you are going to have far fewer pigs in the country.  A number of large units are producing a large percentage of the pigs produced in the country at present. They are using whey and using it economically.  On the other hand, you cannot expect the dairy farmers to <Col N="2109" /> take a lesser price for their milk because this outlet does not exist. There must be a serious effort in those areas particularly to ensure that this by-product is fully utilised for pig production.  It is time this was fairly well settled.</P>
    <P>We had this accredited herd scheme, a very good scheme.  We do not hear anything about it now.  We do not know to what extent it is being encouraged. If we are to get this grading and to keep subsidies on the export of pigs at a minimum, we must have top quality.  This thing should be encouraged more.  A would-be pig producer, a man going to go into this at the right level and in the right way, should be fully informed as to where he will get pigs of top quality.  In pig production, as in most other industries, unless you have the essentials right, you are going to lose money, not make it, and you are going to harm not only yourself but the country.  These are some of the problems I see in the pigs and bacon industry.  They are problems requiring the urgent attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The next one is Subhead K.20. There is nothing really much to be said on it.  It is to meet losses on the sale of unmillable wheat for which farmers are supposed to have got milling prices.  I see that this figure is to be fully recouped.  There is an appropriation-in-aid so that there is no loss incurred here for the Department.</P>
    <P>I said, earlier this year, that I believe an increase in the price of wheat is justified.  I think it is justified mainly on the grounds of increased cost of production and devaluation. If it was fair to give a certain price for wheat last year, then, in the new circumstances, the price of wheat should be increased to that extent.  It is disappointing, I am sure, to farmers who are producing wheat that there has been no increase in prices.  The acreage under wheat went up significantly last year but I think we could afford to have it increased still further.</P>
    <P>Subhead K.21 refers to the beef, mutton and lamb subsidy.  The Minister says that any farmer who wants <Col N="2110" /> this subsidy paid back directly to him can do so.  I do not know whether the details of this scheme were published but I certainly have not got them.  I have heard a good deal of criticism about the proposed scheme whereby the producer would have to wait for a considerable time for the balance of his money if he sent his cattle to the factory.  I am not in a position, unfortunately, to discuss the details of this scheme because, as I say, I have not got them, but I know that I have heard a good deal of criticism about the Minister's proposals in relation to it to the effect that it is not a satisfactory scheme.  What is wrong with it I am not able to say because I do not know sufficient about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the enormous increase in the export of carcase beef, both to the British market and to the American market.  That is something which I think we are all very glad has happened.  The one thing that is obvious is that the estimate of the then Minister for Agriculture who was negotiating the Free Trade Area Agreement with Great Britain was completely wrong.  It was said in this House at that time that we got almost everything we sought for agriculture in this Agreement.  As we know, we got 25,000 tons of beef agreed as our quota.  We know that, from July to December, in the first year of operation we had more than 625,000 tons quota export and we know that the figure has enormously been increased in the present year.</P>
    <P>As I say, while we have been very wrong in our estimates in making this Agreement, we all welcome the exports which have taken place.  We welcome the fact that prices have been high. I think this is nothing the Minister should blow about.  I do not think he has taken any step that anybody can see that has brought this about.  If he has, I should like to hear from him what it was.  I think it is due largely to the unfortunate outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, no matter what the Minister says.  If there are any other circumstances of which he is aware or if he can tell us what he or the Department or anybody else in this country has done to improve <Col N="2111" /> the situation, I am certainly not aware of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about the forecasts that were made and the wailing that was done about future prices.  I heard the Minister speak at the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. He said he was sorry to say he saw no great prospect of improvement&mdash;this was speaking for last year.  He was using the knowledge he had at that particular time.  He saw no circumstances of change in Europe.  He did not see that we would get any cattle into Europe.  He was right: we did not. However, nobody has given any reason, other than the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, why prices should be better in Britain last year than they were the year before that.</P>
    <P>Britain has not been allowed to export any cattle to EEC; neither have we.  Still, our prices are higher.  I should like to hear somebody explain it because it has never been explained to my satisfaction.  These were the reasons given.  Britain was exporting about 250,000 cattle to Europe.  We were doing the same.  That was shut out overnight.  There has been no change in that situation while the price of cattle has gone up significantly during the past year in Britain.  If that is not due to foot and mouth disease and to the fact that imports from the Argentine have been cut down or eliminated altogether, I do not know what the reason for it was.  I do not think the Minister can claim he has taken any extraordinary measures to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>We have been talking for years about setting up a proper meat and cattle marketing organisation here.  We are still talking about it.  We are talking now about a promotion board.  We are told we shall have the details about this promotion board soon.  I have always felt we should have such a body promoting the sale of live cattle but certainly that body should be marketing beef.  The Minister may have more information in that regard than I have.  He certainly has not done anything that I can see to give us the improved position in cattle prices he referred to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> Apparently the Minister is quite satisfied and very pleased with the position in regard to sheep.  I think he should not be happy about the sheep position.  Prices have been reasonably good but there is nothing exceptionally good about them&mdash;and the price of wool has dropped to half.  We are waiting now, for longer than I care to think, for the Minister to bring in a Wool Bill to improve the marketing of wool but nothing has happened. Farmers have had to take half price, and less than half price, for wool during the past year&mdash;and sheep numbers are down and still falling. That is not a position to be happy about.  It is certainly not a position I am happy about.  I do not know why the Minister feels so happy about the whole situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes reference to the mountain sheep subsidy scheme.  He says satisfactory progress has been made during the past year.  I hear a great deal of criticism of this scheme. I suppose no scheme will ever be brought into existence that will not be criticised.  I went to Dingle for a week's holiday last year.  I thought I was getting away from people who would know me but I was set upon immediately I got into Dingle about the scheme.  First of all, it was paid in the Dublin region, I was told, that week and they could not get it for three weeks because fairs did not happen to work in to suit it, and many of them said that they had to bring their lambs long distances&mdash;up to 30 miles in some cases&mdash;in order to get 10/-.  With transport costs and everything else, the feeling was that the game was not worth the candle and that there should be better organisation of inspections and more convenient inspection points where these people could bring their sheep for inspection.  I do not know to what extent this can be met but obviously some effort has been made to improve the situation, and I hope that in the coming year further efforts will be made to bring the inspections nearer to where sheep are normally kept.</P>
    <P>The grants for the glasshouse industry are very worthwhile.  This is the only way to attack the horticultural <Col N="2113" /> industry as far as production under glass is concerned.  It is well recognised in this as in many other branches of agriculture that one must be in it fairly big to survive and the only way many people would be enabled to get into it in a big way is by decent and encouraging grants of this size and sort. I have seen some of the glasshouses that have gone up as a result of this grant and I can say that they are making excellent progress and that they are able to get people with the right skill whole-time to look after these units because they are large enough to justify that.  This is the only way we can ever hope to compete in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the milk cooler scheme, the Minister, I think, expressed a little bit of disappointment that the response to this was not as good as he expected.  The Minister knows from discussions which have taken place here at Question Time during the year and probably from his contacts throughout the country generally that this is due to the fact that water is just not available in many of the places where farmers would be extremely anxious to avail themselves of these coolers in order to qualify for the quality milk bonus.  I think that more than anything else, this is due to the fact that there has been a general slowing down in the regional water supply schemes, in the payment of grants and in dealing with applications for water supplies generally.  The Minister could have a word with his colleague in Local Government in this regard and they could try to work together to meet the needs of milk producers who are only too anxious to avail of these grants.</P>
    <P>With regard to foot and mouth disease, I, like the Minister, would like to acknowledge our indebtedness to the people who made such efforts to co-operate in keeping this dreaded disease out of the country.  Many people made very big sacrifices in order to keep it out.  I have never seen before a greater appreciation, even on the part of city people, of what this would mean and the losses that we would be involved in if the disease hit this country.  A <Col N="2114" /> tribute should be paid to the people in our veterinary department here, and indeed to the administrative people as well, for the organisation they have set up and for the successful outcome of their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that at the moment there is a detailed investigation being made in England into the cause of the most recent outbreak and that we would be looking forward with interest to the result of this investigation but that it was felt at the moment that it was probably due to imported meat supplies.  As well as that, I know that at the next session of the Council of Europe, this will be on the agenda for discussion.  It is being put on the agenda by Britain.  We should express a view at that meeting and we should certainly put our serious concern before the Council of Europe.  Unless it can be shown that the origin of this recent outbreak was in Europe, there is not a great deal of point in discussing it at the Council of Europe, except that their policy, in my view, in many countries is not such as will eliminate foot and mouth disease.  It is a policy that will have it endemic all over Europe. It is a sort of partial slaughter and partial vaccination policy and I feel that this is a very unsatisfactory position and a position which we should oppose.  We should take the stand that the only policy in relation to foot and mouth that has paid dividends over the years is a slaughter policy and obviously greater precautions will have to be taken in the importation of beef in one form or another from countries that have foot and mouth disease always with them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the end of the various subheads but speaking generally about money being provided for agriculture, I hold that due to the fact that there is no progressive long-term agricultural policy and no properly planned investment programme, much of the money being provided is playing the role of social assistance and is not in fact having the effect of increasing production and reducing costs, which I feel are the essential things.</P>

      <P>We are being asked here for additional money for agriculture and we are being asked for it over a very broad field.  My contention is that some of this money perhaps might not be necessary if we had better organisation of our expenditure.  We are being asked for more money and we have evidence that output has not increased in recent years.  We have this position of stagnation which proves that we are not properly organised for the use of the money that is going into agriculture and that we are not getting an economic return for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only indicating that despite the fact that increased amounts of money are being provided every year our estimates are wrong and we have to come back looking for supplementary sums.  We have a position that in the past ten years we have had an increase in output of only 2½ per cent and this, in my view, represents a position of stagnation in agriculture that no Minister can be proud of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate of almost £10 million is a very big one, coming towards the end of the financial year.  Of course when one remembers that the whole Irish economy is based on agriculture, despite what many people would say to the contrary, it is not surprising that large sums of money are required to keep things going at the present time.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know whether or not <Col N="2116" /> there is a substantial saving on the calved heifer subsidy this year.  I imagine from my own observations, and from information I have got throughout the country, that the amount spent this year will be very much less than was provided in the original Estimate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the foot and mouth disease, comments have been made in this House and elsewhere at various stages regarding the steps taken by the Government to ensure that the disease was kept out of this country. Let me say quite categorically that we in the Labour Party feel that the Government were fully justified in taking the steps they took, and if it was necessary to go further, we have always stated that the full support of the Labour Party would be given.  It is scandalous to find people trying to get loopholes through the very necessary precautions and those who have deliberately broken the regulations have only themselves to thank for what happened to them.  Any of them who attempted to escape, and have so far escaped being dealt with, should be dealt with.  Unfortunately, we cannot say that this will be the end of the road as far as foot and mouth disease is concerned.  Apart from agriculture, very grave hardships were imposed on a number of people indirectly or on people who were not connected in any way with the agricultural industry, but all of them accepted the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí who had the unpleasant duty of policing the Border roads in the coldest part of the winter deserve the highest praise for the way in which they did their jobs and also the various officials, both high and low of the Department of Agriculture who saw to it that the regulations were carried out and tried to the best of their ability to see they were carried out also deserve our praise.  We are very grateful to them.  While people spoke about the fact that there was a comparatively looser set of arrangements and restrictions in Great Britain in regard to the disease, even though the disease was there, those people seemed not to be aware of the fact that while agriculture forms a very small proportion <Col N="2117" /> of the British economy, it is the keynote of the Irish economy and if the disease had come in here, the cost to the country would be something which we would be paying for and moaning about for the rest of our lives.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's speech this morning the cost here was £157,000, a comparatively small sum when one learns that Britain has to date, I understand, paid £158 million in compensation.  That does not represent anything like the loss which has been suffered by the farming community in Britain as a result of the disease.  I think also that what Deputy Clinton said with regard to making representations to attempt to have tighter controls internationally on the importation of meat carcases is correct. I understand that already representations have been made in Britain on this and from a television programme which I watched for some time last night, it appears that Britain is determined that they are not going to allow the Argentine to send in the type of meat which they feel certain caused the outbreak last year.  We all know that there are countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic but the fact that an outbreak such as the one which has just ended in Britain, we hope, was caused not alone by the carelessness of the people who exported it but by the carelessness of the people who subsequently handled it in Britain is something which should not be lost sight of.  I hope Britain will stand firm on the line which they have now taken not to allow Argentinian meat into Britain.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are a bit selfish about this because it means that the market for this year will be very greatly increased, and without being too critical, I think the fact that the outbreak occurred in Britain is the only reason we were able to bring off the increased number of cattle sales last year.  This is a matter we should face up to and there is no use codding ourselves and anybody else about it. The fact is that those cattle were sold but to try to make out that it was due to some special guardian angel this country had sent over to Britain <Col N="2118" /> seeking out markets is a little bit of a cod.  We must all face up to it that the outbreak, while we regret it, did good to us.  It is an ill-wind which blows nobody any good.  I hope that that ill-wind will not blow back on us.</P>
    <P>The milk problem is one which must cause great concern to the Government because the amount of subsidy required to sell milk and milk products has become a colossal burden.  Milk is the main basis on which Irish agriculture is built.  I live in a constituency where the milk stand has become a very common sight and where some years ago a very small quantity of milk was produced but where now practically every farmer depends on his milk cheque.  I wonder if something cannot be done to try to sell milk and milk products at home.  I am often surprised that the campaign which seems to be run so successfully in Britain, the pint campaign, does not seem to have caught on here.  No attempt seems to have been made to encourage Irish people to drink more milk.  I know there are other things which we have been encouraged to drink and which did not need any encouragement.</P>
    <P>I also know that in France some years ago a very foolish politician started a milk-drinking campaign.  As he was in a wine growing constituency, he did not remain very long.  At the next general election he moved on.  I understand that somebody here started a &ldquo;drink light beer&rdquo; campaign and he survived an awful lot longer than the fellow in France.  It seems to me an extraordinary thing that some effort has not been made to encourage people to drink milk.  If one speaks to housewives, it is not unusual to find them complaining about the milk bill, and talking about the fact that they use six or seven pints of milk per day, although there may be six or seven, or maybe more, members in that family and they never seem to realise that a couple of glasses of whiskey which they may also pay for during the week could in fact pay for all the milk.  I would suggest that the milk would be a far better beverage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> Reference was made to the EEC and to milk and milk products and it is only right to draw attention to the fact that the EEC are at present overproducing milk and milk products by two per cent.  I know somebody may come back with an answer that of course there is a guaranteed price, and if we produce and go into the EEC, we will get the guaranteed price.  There is still the situation that the EEC must continue to subsidise something which is being over-produced and they must of necessity reduce the subsidy.  This could put Ireland in a rather peculiar position in view of our dependency on milk and milk products if we are to become full members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any other outlet for milk products than the traditional ones, but I feel the Government could very well spend a substantial sum of money on research for the purpose of trying to find some way of using dairy products other than the way which requires a substantial subsidy to sell abroad.  I know it is necessary for the purpose of keeping our balance of payments right to sell as much as we can abroad but it does seem a little odd that so far the only thing we have succeeded in selling, and we are improving the sale of it, is something on which we are losing very large sums of money.  I am not an expert in this field but I am sure there are people who could suggest ways in which the money which is being paid by way of subsidy for milk and milk products could be used to produce something which would not require a very substantial subsidy and for which there would be a much greater demand.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I note that the Minister referred to the fact that he introduced grants last year to help milk producers to install milk coolers which would be a further help in this direction.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that quite a number of farmers are unable to have milk coolers because they have not ESB current.  I have had a number of discussions with the Minister about this when I tried to get it for farmers who are within three or four miles of a town, and attempted to get the Minister to extend the ESB current. <Col N="2120" /> The position was that they could not get milk coolers and the Minister suggested that they could use gas coolers. In fact, a man was sent to me who was to give me in detail how this could be done but it meant that it could be done only with the use of an engine and it seemed so complicated that the people with whom I discussed it said they would rather continue as they were.  I received one of the very long and courteous letters the Minister for Transport and Power sends out explaining things like this in detail.  It did not convince me or the farmers who are anxious to get current for the purposes of installing milk coolers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the export of beef, I asked the Minister on 13th February, 1968, column 886, Question No. 30 of the Official Report, if he would give me the average subsidy per beef carcase for 1967, the highest amount and the lowest amount.  I should have understood it myself but I thought he would have some details of carcase beef per 1b. Although this was published in the Official Debates, many people who have been talking about beef prices in this country did not seem to understand the significance of it.  I raised the question because it was brought to my notice by somebody who was in industry that one factory alone claimed to have got £40 to £50 per carcase subsidy from Britain for a period last year and this subsidy was going into the profits of the factory, not into the pockets of the producer.</P>
    <P>I put this question down at the request of the person about whom I am talking and I got this reply: In the month of January, the average rate of subsidy per 1b. was almost 5d; it was 4.7849d in January, 1967; in February, 5.5153d; in March, 5.5289d; in April, 5.8058d; in May, 5.0895d; in June, 6.557d; in July, 9.5035d; in August, 8.861d; in September, 7.1712d; in October, 7.4824d; in November 7.9932d; and in December .8134d.  I did a little ready reckoning and this represented a very substantial sum of money which I understand was paid to the factories who held on to that money and did not pass it on to the producer.  I was one of those who spoke and voted against the British <Col N="2121" /> Free Trade Agreement.  This was one of the points in the agreement which seemed to gain something for us but I think it is a bit of a cod that when it was included the benefits that were represented were collared by a group of people who were already doing very well.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister go a little further than he went in his opening speech when he referred to the fact that:</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware I have also made arrangements under which any producer can have the beef export subsidy paid to him direct or by my Department.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might go into detail and say how much can be paid direct to the producer.  As far as I know, very few of the producers are aware of any such arrangement.  I live in a county which consists of a substantial number of farmers and I believe they are entitled to the benefits of their labours.  I think it is a bit of a cod if people get only half as much for the beef that is sold and which they rear themselves as the factory gets by way of subsidy.  It seems to be out of the way and I ask the Minister to give us some details so that we can see if these people can get the subsidy that may be coming their way.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the Minister's statement that there has been a satisfactory increase in exports of boneless manufacturing beef to the US.  The Minister said the value of the amount had increased to £12 million compared with £6 million in 1966.  I wonder has there been any success in attempts to win back the American Army market, mainly for mutton, which was held by this country some years ago.  Had it not been for some difficulties about the EEC that market would not have been lost to us.  There must be some way of getting it back and I should like the Minister to say what efforts have been made and with what prospect of success.</P>
    <P>On the question of the EEC, we are promised a wonderful market.  Surely the fact is that at present there is a <Col N="2122" /> 9 per cent shortfall in the EEC for beef which the EEC countries claim they can make up in 18 months in Southern Italy.  If that is so, we face the same position with regard to beef so long as the guaranteed price is there. If they maintain the guaranteed price at the present level, and so long as the beef they are looking for is of the same quality as what we are producing, as soon as they find it will pay them better to reduce the price, we will find ourselves with a cheaply-priced product on our hands.  Beef exports represent the main single item in our export trade and the situation I have just referred to could have a terrible effect on our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been holding forth on pig production.  He said the market is there and he pointed out something rather peculiar, that when the strike was on in the bacon factories, he gave a subsidy and continued to give the subsidy afterwards.  My complaint is that he mentioned a very big figure.  He said that 3,600 live pigs qualified at a total cost of £18,000.  The dispute, which lasted some time, could have been settled in a matter of weeks at a cost very much less than £18,000.  I am beginning to wonder whether this sort of thing is the answer to disputes of that kind.  It is a bad thing to see the taxpayer paying for substantial subsidies to wealthy employers while they allow people to stay on strike instead of making an offer within a period of weeks.</P>
    <P>Whether it is possible to make pigs pay is a problem which has been disturbing the minds of great and small in this country during many years.  I had an interesting discussion on this problem a few week ago with an old gentleman and because of what he said&mdash;he knew what he was talking about&mdash;I will mention it here.  He said that long ago small farmers and cottiers were able to rear pigs, to feed them, though it took a longer period to do so, and succeeded in fattening them and getting them ready on the produce of the farms and the cottiers' gardens.  At the present time it is possible to bring in the pigs much more quickly, but in order to do so, the <Col N="2123" /> profit which should accrue to the producer is being spent on all types of balanced rations and what have you. The result now is that it is so costly to feed the pigs that those small people have got out of production.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to comment on that.  The man I spoke to knew a lot about the business because he had been engaged in it many years as a medium-sized farmer. He said it was still possible to produce pigs on the food produced on small farms and cottage gardens which would go to waste in normal times.  He said small farmers and cottiers should be encouraged to produce pigs not under a system of trying to beat the neighbours by having the pigs out a couple of days earlier but by fattening them in whatever time it took to do so. He said this would result in a positive improvement in the number of pigs produced.  He also said it appeared as if the Department of Agriculture were anxious to have the pigs better housed than the farmers because in many cases the regulations governing the building of pigsties resulted in the sties being better than the houses or cottages in which the producers lived. This may be an exaggeration but I suggest there is a grain of truth in it.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when we are pricing ourselves out of the bacon market by attempting to produce pigs in those modern sties, costing a lot of money, and on rations which Deputy Clinton said were beyond the means of the small farmer who could buy only in small quantities and therefore at top prices, when the big man could buy by the ton more cheaply.  I am passing that on to the Minister for what it is worth and I hope he will comment on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton was critical of the mountain lamb subsidy scheme.  I think it was a good idea, though there were numerous difficulties which all of us anticipated.  However, improvement has been made in the system of checking and I believe the improved situation will result in an increase in the sheep population.  I was rather surprised to find that after Galway the biggest sheep-producing county is Meath.  I had <Col N="2124" /> thought it would be some mountain area where a lot of sheep can be reared fairly cheaply.</P>
    <P>The Bovine TB Scheme has been referred to and it has been noted that though it should be coming to an end, it is still causing a certain amount of trouble.  I should like to know is it true that a certain strain of bovine tuberculosis has survived and that TB animals are appearing in herds which previously had been declared clear.  I found one thing peculiar about the scheme.  Two brothers lived together on a sizable portion of land and they were refused blue cards on the ground that their stock was intermingled.  Surely the thing to do was to have both men's cattle examined?  All it meant was putting the stock into two separate fields to have the job done.  A man had a cow grazing with one farmer and a mile away he had another cow with another farmer.  The two herds were referred to as intermingled, although there was only one cow involved.  A solution was given by one gentleman who said the proper thing to do was to put two farmers' herds, together, with the two cows, and have them examined.  It seems to me to be a senseless sort of situation.</P>
    <P>Mention is also made of the warble fly.  We know how we used to laugh at the warble fly inspectors.  They were the first political appointees.  They were regarded as being of a low grade but there were always people willing to pull the political strings to get the job but those days have changed now.  It appears from the Minister's speech that if a man finds he has stock with warble fly and reports it, he can have the dressing done for nothing, but if he does not report it, he is charged 5/-. That appears to be charging him 5/-for a very serious offence.  The same situation obtained with sheep dipping. It seems to me that anybody who, through sheer neglect, allows a continuance of a disease which could be wiped out so easily, and it appears to be almost wiped out, is guilty of a serious offence.  I suggest that stronger measures should be taken against those who deliberately neglect to do what they should do in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> Over the years we have had comments about wheat and I notice that the Minister has put down very definitely, and I am glad of it, the fact that the increased cost, because of the fact that 27,000 tons of potentially millable wheat had to be sold as animal food, did not fall on the Exchequer but was put on the import of foreign wheat and was therefore partly responsible for an increase in bread prices.  We should get that done still and we should know where we stand.  The Minister said that 90 per cent of the crop was taken into the mills and the full millable price paid for it.  That left ten per cent, which is still a pretty high amount. Some 27,000 tons out of 168,000 tons, which run to 17 per cent or 18 per cent, also had to be disposed of.  That was last year, when a relatively small amount of wheat was grown.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware that in the areas in which I travel fairly extensively there seems to be a rush to put in wheat all over the place, and if I am not wrong in my guess, we are going to have a tremendous amount of wheat going to the mills in the fall of the year.  We all know that when a relatively small amount of wheat goes in, it is reasonably easy to get it through, but when there is a large amount, it is amazing how much of it is unmillable.  That is one of the hazards.  I notice that the Minister referred to the weather last year.  I do not know whether he was claiming that the Government were responsible for the good weather but it was a great thing that the weather was clement and I would not blame him for taking credit.  I do not know whether the Government will be able to invoke the oracle for a good harvest this year, but if there is a good harvest, there will be a lot of millable wheat, and if not, there may be a very large amount which is unmillable.  Whether that is going to be paid for by taking it in first and then turning it back and putting it on to the price of imports and subsequently on the price of bread, I do not know but it appears as if there will be a big increase in the amount of wheat sown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> The Minister told us that there has been a considerable reduction in the time taken to deal with applications under the Land Project and that the number of grants falling for payment has increased substantially.  I do not know whether it is easy to please the Minister or not but I know that in Meath up to a few months ago, if somebody applied to have inspection work carried out, he received a reply saying that there was a delay of 12 months before inspection work was done.  Anyone who lives in the country knows that the time a farmer decides to do Land Project work, if his land requires drainage, is when it is flooded, and then he dashes off to have it inspected right away so that the work can be carried out as quickly as possible. However, he will be told that there is a 12 months delay.  Whether the Minister has whittled this down ten months or 11 months, I do not know, but I should like to hear from him because it appears to me that the 12 months was still in operation up to recently.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the man who does urgent work which it can be plainly seen has been done and it is unfair that that man will not receive any payment for that work.  I asked the Minister a question about this last year and he assured me that where it could be proven that the work was urgent and had been done properly, payments would be made.  I am not aware that that promise has been carried out and an effort should be made to have this type of thing dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the scheme for grants for glasshouse nurseries which came into operation in March, 1967, and said that there were quite a number of applicants.  I raised the point before, and I am now raising it again, that we are not utilising a certain type of heat which is available and which should be as nearly free as possible, that is, the steam from ESB power stations.  There is steam going out onto the neighbouring boglands which should be ideal for heating glasshouses in which fruit and vegetables are grown.  In Germany, they have utilised this sort of heat and they are <Col N="2127" /> able to produce fruit and vegetables very cheaply, but here it has not been done.  On one occasion a man from the Agricultural Association of Ireland told me that they would be against that sort of thing because it would react against farmers and market gardeners in other parts who were producing early vegetables and fruit, and particularly tomatoes, and might cause a glut.  We all know the difficulty there is in getting tomatoes in the early part of the year and the fancy prices that must be paid for them.  I do not think that the producers get anything like that price.</P>
    <P>Another point is that strawberries from the Channel Islands will also be flown in at fancy prices.  They could be produced here.  Nobody seems to be able to put up the money to erect the necessary type of glasshouse.  Surely the State could persuade Bord na Móna to invest some of their money in promoting this type of thing?  That might provide the necessary boost.  We are missing out badly because we are not producing the amount of fruit and vegetables which could be produced with a little effort and for which there should be a ready market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton stole some of my thunder in his reference to the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme and therefore I will be brief in dealing with this matter.  My organisation, the Federation of Rural Workers, is one of the bodies on this Board and we went on to it on the understanding that not only would farmers' sons be trained but also the sons of farm workers.  I am sorry to say that apparently the Board have no intention of letting the sons of farm workers get any such training.  With modern trends in farming, agricultural workers have now got to be experts in their field and there must be, therefore, training to equip those employed in agriculture on a far larger scale than there is even in industry.  Some of the technical schools are doing a certain amount of work in that direction.  Some are training young people how to operate and do running repairs on machines.  It is a little odd, to say the least of it, that farm workers are unable in the year 1968 to get any kind of technical training. <Col N="2128" /> Nobody seems to give two damns about it.  Nobody seems to think it is important.  I think it is important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton talked about training these potential workers to use modern milking machines.  Apparently that is not being done.  All apprentices should be taught how to use farm machinery to qualify them for whatever offers afterwards.  No matter what extra subsidy is required, both the farmer's son and the farm worker's son should be properly trained as apprentices.  It is no use saying that this training is open for them if they cannot provide the money necessary to get the kind of education required before such training.  If that is the position, then this scheme applies only to those who have money.  That was not our intention when we went into the scheme and, unless it is revised, we shall have to have second thoughts about it.</P>
    <P>As far as the £500 award paid to a person who has completed apprenticeship goes, at the moment in my constituency that would buy about three acres of good land if such land were available.  Possibly some liaison is required here with the Land Commission. Perhaps that body could get round this problem.  If an apprentice were guaranteed a certain portion of land on the completion of his apprenticeship, far more people would be attracted into the scheme than they are by the prospect of a lump sum of £500 because £500 does not buy very much at the present time.</P>
    <P>I said on a former occasion that the only way to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation was by proving one did not need it.  That was too harsh.  They are very strict, but they are doing a reasonably good job.  We cannot blame them for being careful.  The organisation of which I am secretary has invested substantial sums collected from people in the rural areas in the Agricultural Credit Corporation on the basis that by doing so, they are helping out those in the rural areas.  That is a good policy. The Government reduced substantially the amount of money made available to the Corporation a few years ago <Col N="2129" /> and that has had an adverse effect. The Corporation tried to get money in other ways, but it must be extremely difficult for them to get all the money they think could be usefully used by the farming community.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the NAC. When the NIEC was set up, I asked that agriculture should be represented. I still believe agriculture is entitled to direct representation on that body. I believe the NAC was originally set up in order to give a good excuse for opting out of representation on the NIEC.  Whether we like it or not, the position now is that it is ridiculous for any Government or any Minister for Agriculture to try to carry on while he is at loggerheads with a substantial portion of the farming community. I appeal to the Minister&mdash;I speak for myself only&mdash;to extend the olive branch to those with whom he is at loggerheads.  He said in his opening speech&mdash;it is a little weak and that is the reason I refer to it:</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the Council I would add that I have made it clear on more than one occasion that both the Government and I stand ready to work in close and constructive collaboration with all farming organisations for the benefit of Irish agriculture.  That is still the position.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister is as well aware as we are that putting that in his speech will not bring us one step nearer a settlement of this row, a row which has dragged on for too long and which has done irreparable damage to Irish agriculture.  I do not say this to score points, but I ask the Minister now to make an effort&mdash;through a third party, if necessary; certainly through someone respected by both sides&mdash;even now, at the beginning of a new agricultural season, to settle this difference and, if that effort is successful, I am convinced the result will bestow benefits on everybody, on the Minister, and on the country, which is my main interest.</P>
    <P>I am really filling in for Deputy M.P. Murphy who is unfortunately indisposed. I suggest an effort might be made in future to give us as close an <Col N="2130" /> approximation as possible of the amount likely to be required for agriculture. No matter what the excuse may be, it just is not good enough to come along in the month of March, on the eve of the Budget, saying that there has been over-expenditure to the tune of £9,646,000.  A substantial change like hat takes a good deal of explaining away.  I never object to money being spent on agriculture.  All I ask is that the best use be made of it and the estimate likely to be required should be given at the beginning of the financial year rather than at the close of it.</P>

      <P>Both Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully alluded to the quarrel, as they call it, between the Minister for Agriculture and the National Farmers Association.  As a farmer, and a member of the National Farmers Association, nobody is more anxious than I am to see that row, as it is called, settled.  What suits farmers in one area is poison to farmers in other areas and not worth a bean to them.  The farmer who grows grain is poison to the farmer who is feeding pigs because there is a constant battle over prices.  If the National Farmers Association are prepared to come in on a fair basis, no one will object to that.  I would like to know how Deputy Tully would feel if one organisation of workers started pinching what belonged to another organisation of workers.</P>

      <P>It is time it stopped.  We are not going to allow it as far as farmers are concerned.  The spectacle of one farmers' organisation heading in past a picket of another farmers' organisation fighting for a price for their milk was disgusting.  Use has been made of the National Agricultural Council in this matter.  A dog in the manger policy has been adopted by the NFA.  On the invitation of the Minister, we appointed two representatives of the BGA to serve on this Council. A campaign of vengeance has been carried on against us for over 12 months.  Now that we are entering a new year, I can say what are the <Col N="2131" /> results of that campaign on the ordinary beet-growing farmer.  It was taken advantage of by the Irish Sugar Company, who stated they did not know whom to negotiate with.  There were no negotiations on this year's price for beet.  For 34 years, there had been an allocation of surplus pulp of 1¾ cwt. for every ton of beet delivered to the factory.  That was cut&mdash;a simple thing but a mean thing&mdash;by a quarter cwt. per ton bringing it down to 1½ cwt. per ton on beet.  People may say that is nothing.  Here is how it works out.  The price charged for ration pulp was £15 per ton.  The price of the surplus pulp today is £22 10s a ton, a difference of £7 a ton and a cut of 1s 9d on the price of beet to the farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I want to say in passing that the increase amounts exactly to that agreed between the Sugar Company and ourselves two years ago-8/9d a ton on beet in respect of which the farmers have signed contracts this year at last year's prices.  The total cost of the interference of Deputy Clinton's bullock ranchers with the ordinary tillage farmers is that the beet growers have to grow beet this year at £540,000 less than they grew it last year.  That is a pretty hefty bill for one farmers' organisation to cost another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see what the objection is. As a nominee of the BGA, I served about four years on an agricultural council set up by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture.  I did not feel myself growing horns or being turned into a goat on account of that. In fact, Deputy Dillon was a lot more sensible on the council than he is when he comes in here.  He remained at the head of that council while it was in existence, until he went out of office in fact.  I did not see any objection to his acting as head of that council.  I certainly did not raise any objection to serving on it, nor did any of the other associations.  We had a few jokers from the NFA on that council, too.  They did not raise any objection to serving with Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture&mdash;whatever objection they have to serving with Deputy Blaney as Minister for Agriculture. Those are the things I want to look at.  It will be all right if those boys are prepared to come in and take their place and not interfere or attempt to interfere&mdash;as they are doing by bulldozing and blackguardism&mdash;with those farming organisations which are set up for one specific object.  We have been <Col N="2133" /> set up to protect the ordinary tillage farmer of this country.  The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association was set up to look after the interests of the creamery milk suppliers.  Let the bullock ranchers look after their bullocks and keep their noses out of our business.</P>
    <P>I am almost in agreement with a lot of what Deputy Tully said in regard to the meat subsidy.  If we wish to assist the ordinary small farmers of this country by way of subsidy and if we are to reduce, in some way, all those millions we are to spend on the milk subsidy, I suggest to the Minister that the subsidy be paid to farmers rearing calves aged from six to nine or 12 months at the outside.  In that way, you pay direct subsidy to the farmer who is rearing those cattle. Millions of pounds have been spent on in-calf heifer subsidy and a larger proportion of the calves were intended for the purpose of increasing our stock. We now find that a large proportion, even in the case of the dropped calves, are sent across the Border and the Northern Ireland farmer is the gentleman who is gaining the benefit of the in-calf heifer subsidy that is paid by the Republic.  It is time that that particular aspect of it were examined by the Department of Agriculture and acted upon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton found everything so much wrong.  He found some things that he did not agree with but he could not find what was wrong.  That was wishful thinking on his part.</P>
    <P>I should like also, if the Minister would give a little more attention to some matters towards which no subsidy at all is paid.  I refer now to the export market for processed vegetables.  That market has grown to such an extent that I do not think we shall be able to cope with it.  I should like the Minister to give a little more attention to that matter.  I have seen it grow, over a four-year period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that, in some cases, the subsidies could be increased.  Consider the position of a farmer with an increase of 7½ per cent in the subsidy for fertiliser, on the one hand, and a freight increase of 10 per cent on the other hand.  The Minister announced that there is to be no increase in the price of barley, wheat or beet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am dealing, on this Supplementary Estimate, with the increased subsidy for fertilisers and what general effect that has on the economy of the farmer.  I am suggesting that some of these subsidies should not be included in this Supplementary Estimate at all.  They should not be on an agricultural Estimate such as this but on an industrial Estimate brought in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce because the fertiliser subsidy, for example, is for the protection, safety and workability of the fertiliser industry in this country.  It is not there to protect the farmer.  As has been pointed out here already, I could bring in nitrogen today at up to £3 a ton less than what I have to pay here for my nitrogen. Therefore, for whom is the subsidy? It is not for the farmer.  It is not for agriculture.  That is the difference and that is the argument I am putting up on the whole matter.</P>
      <P>If we were dealing with the general Estimate, it would be possible to point out that there is the same thing to be noticed right through.  Nobody will pretend to me that the subsidy on farm buildings is not a subsidy for industry &mdash;because I know it is.  There is a big industry below at my hall-door living on it and delighted to have it.  I have no objection to that, provided the subsidy is looked for in the right Department and that we shall not be told: &ldquo;Oh, the farmers had to get £40 million, £20 million or £50 million to carry on&rdquo; whereas, in fact, half or three-quarters of it is a subsidy on industry and helping industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to carry that matter <Col N="2135" /> further except to say that if subsidies are not placed in the Estimates for the relevant Departments then, when I shall be dealing here with this Estimate next year, I shall have a different tune.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say a few words about the provision here for a vote of £2,600, under subhead K.6, for the National Agricultural Council.  I should like, at the outset, to endorse everything that has been said by my colleague, Deputy Clinton, regarding the National Agricultural Council.  As at present constituted, and in view of the strained relations between the Minister for Agriculture and a substantial section of the farming community, this National Agricultural Council can achieve no good and therefore I cannot see my way to support this provision of £2,600 towards its expenses.  The National Agricultural Council is not representative of the majority of the farmers, and while such a position obtains, the farmers can have no confidence in it.  The Minister to a large extent, I feel, has been responsible for the manner in which this Council has been set up. Certainly he must bear responsibility for the continuing bad relations between himself and the National Farmers Association.  The onus is on the Minister as the man who in the final analysis is responsible for agriculture in this country to hold out, as Deputy Tully has said, the hand of friendship to the NFA.</P>
      <P>Certainly it will not benefit Irish agriculture if we are to have a continuation of this situation where the Minister for Agriculture in various ways has shown his vindictiveness against one major farming organisation. I sincerely hope he will look at this problem more rationally than he has done in the past, that he will spare no effort to ensure that the wishes of a large organisation, representing a substantial section of the farming community, will be listened to and that he will go out of his way to meet that organisation and try to patch up whatever differences there are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important part of this Supplementary Estimate and the one in which I am most interested is the <Col N="2136" /> subhead referring to the subventions for the dairying industry&mdash;milk production allowances, marketing of dairy products, <i>et cetera</i>, subhead N.1. I am perturbed to note from the Minister's speech that he has thought it necessary to say that the total Exchequer Bill towards subsidising the dairying industry has been increasing.  The Minister states:</P>
    <P>However, it is necessary for me to say that the rate at which the total bill is mounting as a result of the growth in production and the various increases in the allowances must cause some concern in relation to the fact that so high a proportion of the resources which can be made available for agriculture is now spent on one sector.</P>
    <P>That is in the dairying industry.  He also points out that the subsidisation to the dairying industry has increased substantially in recent years.</P>
    <P>I want to point out, and to repeat what I have said here on previous debates on Estimates for Agriculture, that the present figure of £19.2 million which represents the total State subsidy to the dairying industry is fully justified, and it is justified in the sense that the dairying industry is the most important sector of our agricultural industry.  To put this subsidy in its proper perspective, we must bear in mind the contribution which the dairying industry makes to the national economy.  The dairying industry is the foundation of the agricultural industry. It provides a livelihood for over 100,000 farmers and their families.  It provides employment for several thousand workers in creameries and milk-processing plants and it contributes over £20 million per annum by way of exports of dairy products. Therefore the figure of £19.2 million is not by any means exorbitant or out of proportion.  Any money devoted to the developing of the dairying industry repays itself, both directly and indirectly, many times over.</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that there is a grave danger that the dairying industry might be about to enter a difficult period. There has been a substantial increase <Col N="2137" /> in milk production.  The figure last year, as the Minister has said, shows an increase of 14 per cent.  This creates many problems.  It created some serious problems last year by reason of the fact that the existing capacity of the milk-processing plants was inadequate to cope with this increase in milk production. The Minister in reply to various questions I have asked in recent months has informed me that the capacity of milk-processing plants has been extended and that he hopes that with the additional capacity, the milk-processing plants will be able to absorb all the milk produced during 1968.  There was an unfortunate situation last year when in certain areas the skim milk had to be returned to the farmers.  In a number of other cases it was disposed of by other means, and I understand that in at least one or two cases substantial quantities of skim milk had to be poured down the drain.  This is an unfortunate situation.  It is a situation which must not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated, as far as I can gather, that there will be a further increase in milk production this year.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not avail himself of the opportunity presented to him by this Supplementary Estimate to go into some detail regarding future prospects for the dairying industry, particularly the prospects of absorbing the increased production of milk.  He did not make any mention of what plans Bord Bainne have to secure additional export markets for dairy products to absorb the increased production of these products. I detect here in the Minister's speech a note of warning or a note of alarm&mdash;and this was confirmed in reply to a question of mine last week regarding the prospects of the dairying industry&mdash;that there is a danger that we might be running into difficulty in the matter of disposing of our milk production.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne undoubtedly have been doing a good job and I have always given them credit for what they have done.  I notice there is a sum of £3 million for payment to Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> In view of the situation which has been developing of late, that is, the substantial increase in milk production and the likely further increase in milk production during this year and in future years, I feel that the existing machinery&mdash;I am referring to milk-processing plants and the machinery for the export of dairy products&mdash;may have to be reorganised.  I have given this matter some thought in recent months.  It is a matter of very serious concern to the people in the constituency which I represent.  There is now a very strong case for the establishment of a national milk marketing board, that is, a milk marketing board whose functions would be much broader than the functions of Bord Bainne at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a milk marketing board which would take over the functions of Bord Bainne and the National Dairy Publicity Council and would handle all the arrangements for the disposal of the processed milk, the marketing of milk products, and which would handle the campaign towards increasing the home consumption of milk and dairy products.  Certainly the situation at the moment gives no grounds for complacency.  It would be a terrible tragedy if our dairy farmers, having taken the necessary steps and at very large expense to increase their dairy herds and to increase their milk output, should now be faced with the situation that there might be a possibility of all their milk not being absorbed in the existing milk-processing plants.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a new approach to this whole question of milk marketing and the marketing of dairy products but there is also another problem which has arisen in relation to the subsidisation of the dairy industry.  It is a problem which has been talked of occasionally, but of which I now have definite evidence, that is, the growing concern, particularly in the south of Ireland, with regard to what has now come to be called the take-over of the Irish dairying industry or the Irish dairy processing industry by some interests.</P>
    <P>Nobody objects to foreign participation in Irish industry.  Foreign participation in the Irish dairying industry <Col N="2139" /> has undoubtedly helped in a number of cases, but as I say, the people directly concerned with the dairying industry have over the past 12 months on numerous occasions expressed their concern to me and have expressed their concern in the press about the continuing participation by foreign interests in our dairy-processing industry and that this may now have gone a stage too far.</P>
    <P>I have seen figures recently in relation to the investment in a new milk-processing plant in the south of Ireland. I have seen according to those figures that the foreign investment in this new plant represents 22 per cent but that the foreign interests which invested 22 per cent exercise 80 per cent control in the whole organisation.  This has certainly gone a bit too far and it has given grounds for concern.  The Minister should look into it.  I see no reason why the Irish dairy industry, properly organised and with proper interests in its organisation, should not be able to participate up to 100 per cent in the promotion and administration of milk-processing enterprises.</P>
    <P>We have an outstanding example in my own neighbourhood of the Golden Vale Food Products at Charleville, which represents a co-operative grouping of 16 or more central creameries in Limerick and Cork.  There is, as far as I am aware, no foreign participation in that industry and as far as I know the same applies to Mitchelstown.  The Irish dairying industry is well able, if properly encouraged, to look after its own interests and is quite capable of availing of any opportunities for processing, for the establishment of new processing plants and so forth.  As I am on this point, and the Parliamentary Secretary is across the way from me.  I hope that the proposal for the establishment of a milk powder plant in Tipperary will materialise in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I have an interest in this because quite a considerable number of dairy farmers in East Limerick would be concerned with this plant.  I understand that a deputation was up this week.  I sincerely hope it will move ahead because certainly in the part of East <Col N="2140" /> Limerick which would be catered for by the proposed plant in Tipperary, there was a problem of a surplus of milk.  It was a problem by reason of the fact that existing plants were unable to absorb all the milk produced in the particular area.</P>
    <P>In summing up, I want to say that there has been a vast increase in the output of milk.  It was 14 per cent last year and it will probably be greater this year.  The Minister stated in reply to a question I addressed to him a week ago, although he did not mention it here today, that the capacity of the processing plants has been increased. He said that the capacity now available would be able to absorb all the milk produced this year.  As I said, I have now doubts about that.  I feel that a stage has been reached when a new approach will have to be adopted towards the dairying industry as a whole and particularly towards the processing and exporting end.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said earlier. I feel that a national milk marketing board is now the answer.  This does not in any way reflect on the work of Bord Bainne but the rapid growth of the dairying industry and the potential it has for still further growth necessitates a new national organisation which would be much more streamlined, which would ensure that existing processing plants are expanded and new processing plants established adequate to keep pace with this continual rise in milk production.  I want the Minister to let us have some idea particularly of his views in relation to the fears that have been expressed by people connected with the dairying industry regarding increasing participation by foreign interests in the Irish dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I note in the Minister's speech in relation to quality milk bonuses that the returns for 1967 now show that the proportion qualifying for the quality milk bonus is as high as 66 per cent.  I confess I am amazed at that.  I would be inclined to think that the figure of 55 per cent which was forecast would be more like it.  However, I accept what the Minister has said and I would also say that it is praiseworthy on the part of the farmers to have gone to such <Col N="2141" /> pains and taken such trouble to improve the quality of their milk, to the extent that it is now at the stage where two-thirds of the milk production qualifies for the bonus.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of great significance and it indicates that the time is not far distant when this figure of 66 per cent will rise to 90 per cent.  I would expect, if this figure of 66 per cent is correct, that in 1968 the figure could well have gone to 85 or 90 per cent.  This is significant particularly in relation to what I have been trying to say already regarding the problem of disposing of surplus milk.</P>
    <P>With the improvements in the quality of milk being produced, it is easier for our processing factories to go into the more specialised type of dairy product. I have always heard it said that there was an excellent export market for what are known as speciality cheeses, that is, the cheeses which would be regarded as luxury items.  The problem here has been that this particular type of product demands a very high quality milk.  Up to now many attempts to produce the various types of cheeses have failed because of the fact that our milk was not up to the required quality.  Now with the vast improvement in the quality of our milk, there must surely be further scope for research into, and perhaps expansion in, the production of the speciality dairy products, mainly cheese.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the proposal to establish a lactose factory in the South of Ireland.  I put down a question to the Minister a week or so ago regarding the same thing and he informed me that this was being examined, but, as Deputy Clinton pointed out, there is a question as to whether the establishment of a lactose plant would be a more economic proposition than the feeding of whey to pigs.  I understand lactose is a by-product of whey; I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary am I right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question now whether it would be more <Col N="2142" /> economic having regard to the national interest to produce lactose from whey or whether, on the other hand, it would be a better thing to feed whey to pigs.  Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on this matter.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister received a deputation a week or so ago from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association regarding the possibility of an increase in the price of milk delivered to creameries in the current season. There is no doubt that milk production has gone up substantially and dairy farmers' costs have also gone up substantially. I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the possibility of granting a further increase in the basic price as well as in the quality price of milk.</P>
      <P>I notice with reference to the total amount of grants paid in respect of milk coolers that the Minister has expressed disappointment with the extent to which these grants have been availed of.  He said that nearly 1,500 grants, amounting to over £9,000, had been paid by 31st December and a sum of £20,000 is being provided in the Supplementary Estimate for the scheme.  Deputy Tully made an observation, with which I fully agree, that dairy farmers in certain cases, and perhaps they might be more numerous than we imagine, are unable to avail of these milk cooler grants because they have not got electricity.  I would agree with Deputy Tully with regard to farmers in outlying areas that the ESB seem to be unbending in meeting the problems of these farmers. Certainly I think the Minister could look into this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some reference to the increased exports of butter, cheese and other dairy products and the Exchequer's contribution towards export losses and subsidies.  He did not refer to the problem which has arisen, or which we are told has arisen, in relation to the milk powder market.  Apparently there has been a substantial drop in the export price for milk powder and this is causing concern also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, provided the Minister ensures that the necessary steps are <Col N="2143" /> taken to increase the capacity of the existing processing plants, provided the right encouragement is given to the various co-operative creameries to promote further processing plants and provided the farmers are encouraged to produce milk, I believe that there is, despite the problems which now might seem to be there, a reasonably bright future for the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the lack of an intensive campaign to increase the consumption of milk and dairy products on the home market.  There is the National Dairy Publicity Council which has been endeavouring to do a good deal of work in this regard but I do not think its efforts can compare with the efforts of the Milk Marketing Board in Britain and we have nothing equivalent to the campaign to which Deputy Tully referred, the &ldquo;Drinka Pinta&rdquo; campaign in Britain.  This is another reason why I feel we have now reached the stage where our whole approach to milk marketing, milk processing, milk exports and various processing will have to be looked at in a new light and a new organisation established, call it a National Milk Marketing Board or what you like.  That seems to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Second only to the dairying industry, pigs and bacon constitute an important industry in my constituency but, unfortunately, since we had the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, one of our oldest established bacon factories was forced to close down.  This was a terrible tragedy not only because 100 men were disemployed but from another point of view: it is a terrible reflection on our agricultural policy that an industry which had been in production more than 100 years and which had been known in many foreign markets and had been renowned for the quality of its bacon products should have had to close down.  Mattersons had to close down because there was a shortage of pigs.</P>
    <P>The whole set-up in the pigs and bacon industry is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> Deputies who spoke this morning expressed various views about the economics of large-scale and small-scale pig production.  At the time of the closing of Mattersons last April or May, I submitted a memorandum to the Minister for Agriculture based on investigations I had carried out and research I had done.  In that memorandum I made a recommendation that the Department of Agriculture and the Pigs and Bacon Commission should explore the possibility of establishing further pig-fattening stations throughout the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary and I have a joint interest in this matter, he, perhaps, more than I because there is an outstanding example of a successful pig-fattening station in the Glen of Aherlow across the Limerick border in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency.</P>
    <P>The operation in the Glen of Aherlow is immensely successful and may I, while on the subject, pay a tribute to the present President of Muintir na Tíre, Father Purcell, through whose energy and initiative this fattening station was established? I am worried because though some of the fattening stations have been successful, others have not.  Almost a year ago, at the time of the closure of Mattersons when I submitted my memorandum, the Minister told me that the Department were surveying the entire question of pig-fattening stations; and I should like him to give us some information about the findings of the survey and to tell us whether the Department have made any decisions about the possibility or the feasibility of encouraging the establishment of further fattening stations.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather from investigations I have made into the problem of pig production&mdash;Deputy Clinton referred to it today&mdash;nowadays all the advantages lie with the larger producers, and the old idea of a small farmer or cottier fattening a couple of pigs at a time has become totally uneconomic. It seems to have been established that the ideal set up is individual farmers keeping two, three or four sows with the bonhams passing on to central fattening stations at the age of <Col N="2145" /> between ten and 12 weeks.  There they are finished and brought to the bacon factory.  I understand this is a good system.</P>
    <P>There have been sufficient examples to enable the Minister and the Department of Agriculture to make up their minds whether this type of enterprise should be encouraged.  I am satisfied from what I have seen of it, particularly from the example in the Glen of Aherlow in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency, that this is the correct approach to the expansion of pig production.</P>
    <P>At the outset of his statement, the Minister referred to the foot and mouth epidemic in Britain.  He correctly said it was the gravest crisis which has confronted Irish agriculture in many a year.  Fortunately, despite the great threat presented to us before Christmas, we have been extremely lucky to escape it.  Credit is due to all who co-operated with the Minister and the Department but a special tribute is due to the thousands of our exiles who voluntarily decided to remain in Britain during the Christmas period.  This was a great sacrifice on the part of our exiles to which tribute should be paid not merely in words but also in deed.</P>
    <P>For that reason I compliment the NFA for having undertaken the work of providing a special fund towards making grants to various emigrant welfare centres in Britain.  If the Government were to make some tangible practical contribution towards the various organisations in Britain catering for our exiles, in appreciation of the magnificent manner in which our exiles responded to the call at Christmas, it would be very well received.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two other points I should like to comment on. Deputy Tully and Deputy Clinton referred to the British Government ban on imports of meat from certain countries where foot and mouth is endemic. The Irish Government have indicated their views to the British Government. It has been scientifically established, as far as I am aware, that the recent epidemic in Britain was caused by a virus which was found in the bone <Col N="2146" /> marrow of meat which had been imported.  Therefore, whatever pressure our Minister can bring to bear on the British Ministry towards the continuation of this ban would be desirable.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's speech this morning, one gets the impression of the obvious, which is that the agricultural community will increase production if it gets the proper incentives and if the proper markets are available.  His statement indicates that there has been an increase in production in practically every farming activity during the past year.  This is as it should be and it must be good news to us.  However, a large part of the constituency which I represent is not able, unfortunately, to take part in this increased productivity.  As more and more information becomes available, it becomes more and more obvious that its activities are limited to dairying and perhaps pig-rearing.  I refer to the area which is called the Drumlin Soils which stretches across the north of the State from east to west coasts but varies in quality, the quality on the east side being far superior to that on the west where there are fewer natural advantages. Traditionally, agricultural work there has been of a dairying nature and of a pig-rearing nature and the science people are now confirming that this is the position and, worse still, that this must continue to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, any remarks made today urging the Minister further to develop the dairying industry are welcomed by us.  I am aware that the Minister and his Department are considering the question of a milk powder plant for the north-west area and that there have been some difficulties involved.  I hope some solution will be found to this problem.  The question of pig-rearing is one that amazes me.  We have heard so often about the up and down cycle and yet nobody seems to have the explanation for this.  The more I hear about it the more I am satisfied that the solution which I offered before in this House is the only solution.  I suggested that pigs should be produced on a contract basis between the producer and the processor.  This has been <Col N="2147" /> carried out successfully in regard to beet, by the beet producers.  I am not asking that the Minister and his Department should set about doing this; it is a matter for the farming community.  They should be able to undertake this work and see it through successfully.</P>
    <P>As I see it the marketing of pigs is chaotic.  In the village in which I live, I see lorries carrying pigs from Cavan to be processed in Sligo and I see lorries carrying pigs from Sligo to be processed in Cavan.  There must be something essentially wrong here.  I do not think that the competitive aspect of the market is such that it pays to bring those animals this distance.  In the long run, it is the producer of the pig who pays for all this.  By their own organisation, the farmers would be able to keep this money in their own pockets.  Arising from the research work that has been done in the Drumlin Soils, it is now becoming more and more obvious that water, which has been mentioned by previous speakers and which is of importance in the dairying and pig industries, is not easily available in this particular area.  Pumps must be sunk to a depth of 100 or 200 ft. which is a costly operation and added to it is the fact that the water must be softened.  This is a problem for the Department of Agriculture.  It is not sufficient to say that this is a matter for the Department of Local Government because the grants made available by that Department to the individual are too costly for him to undertake the work.  It has been suggested to me that if those grants could be pooled and made available to two or three people for boring, much more progress would be made.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech and to other speeches, it was disturbing to learn that markets may not be available for milk and milk products and that there is a push, particularly from the EEC countries, to unload extra butter on the world markets.  This is very disturbing news and it must be difficult to find an answer to it.  Having read something about this, one answer, which perhaps is a revolutionary <Col N="2148" /> answer, suggests itself to me.  Perhaps it might not be acceptable for a few years.  I read that the big American companies, in the hope of getting outlets for their milk products, have established factories in undeveloped countries.  There is one in the Lebanon and another in the Philippines and perhaps there are others throughout the world.  If this is the answer to the American problem, it should be examined and a decision reached in regard to whether it is an answer to our problem.  If it is an answer to our problem we should get into some of the undeveloped countries in the same way in order to get outlets for our dairy products.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a revolutionary suggestion and I can understand the use that would be made of it if the Minister for Agriculture decided before the by-elections, say, to establish such a factory in an undeveloped country. He would be asked: &ldquo;Why not develop it in this country?&rdquo;  But in all problems like this, in trade and commerce, we must have a very broad outlook.  This is not my idea, because I read it, but if there is anything in it, we should pursue it, make a decision and go ahead with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to congratulate the Department of Agriculture on the way in which they have dealt with the foot and mouth disease problem.  It posed a very difficult problem for them and the officials were very much overworked.  I should like to place on record that I received from them the greatest assistance and courtesy in any application I had to make.  I should just like to say also to the Minister that he would be foolish if he let himself be bulldozed into making too many relaxations.  He has adopted the right attitude and he should stand firm in order to protect our agricultural interests until we have definitely reached the safe margin, which all hope we will reach in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about grain prices.  The Minister announced recently that the price of barley and wheat would be the same as last year.  There are two factors I want <Col N="2149" /> the Minister to take into consideration here.  The first is that the OECD have promised 4,500,000 metric tons of wheat to aid developing countries which are short of food.  Secondly, the European Economic Community or, shall we say, Europe as a whole, find themselves in short supply of barley and coarse grains.  That shortage is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.  The Minister must be the first, I think, to admit that farmers' overhead charges have gone up considerably. They will go up further after 1st April when the increase of 15/- a week in wages comes to be paid; that figure will be increased to £1 in September, just at the commencement of the harvest. Those Deputies who come from grain constituencies&mdash;I represent the granary of Ireland, Wexford&mdash;will not be fobbed off with prophecies that greater yields and greater efficiency will offset any extra charge imposed on farmers.  That is really meaningless jargon and the Minister could safely increase the price of feeding barley by 5/- and the price of wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Grain subventions are covered.  The wheat problem is not as acute as the Minister believes it to be.  Surplus supplies of wheat, about which the economists were worried, have all disappeared. They have been bought up by mainland China and the countries behind the Iron Curtain.  There is not likely to be any great problem for the Minister in continuing the policy of wheat growing, a policy on which his Party used to be desperately keen at one time.  It was, in fact, the main plank of Fianna Fáil policy in days gone by. There will be a considerable shortage <Col N="2150" /> of wheat in the not too distant future. The demand will come from the developing countries when they are in a position to buy.  Some are gradually moving into that position.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister and his Department are correlating Irish agricultural policy to world agricultural conditions to the extent they could. There is an acute shortage of beef.  The Minister knows the reason why just as well as I do.  The total output of Irish beef exports would feed only approximately 3,000,000.  Because of the shortage, the price is high at the moment.  There is an all-out demand for beef because of the heavy slaughter of stores in Britain.  There is an all-out demand for finished beef because Britain cannot secure imports from the Argentine.  Unless we wish to revert to the position which obtained after the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, under which we promised to give the British all we had in return for no fixed price, though we were tied to certain deficiency payments which had obtained prior to that, we will have to take immediate steps to rectify the present situation.  The present policy is contrary to the direct advice we got from the OECD not to put all our eggs in one basket.  It should be evident to the Minister and his advisers that, prior to the onslaught of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom, the beef market was very shaky.  Prices were bad.  The outlook was uncertain. That situation is likely to recur unless the Minister secures an alternative market.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt fairly fully with the situation in his opening speech. He dealt very fully with the beef situation, but I see no hope in his speech in the event of conditions returning to normal.  There is no guarantee of our not having to meet again a severe slump in prices similar to the slump 12 or 15 months ago.  The Minister said it is impossible to get a market in the EEC because of the restrictive tariff; we would have to export against a 40 per cent tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 12 months ago, or later, very many farmers had to take £6 a cwt for cattle, for absolutely first-class stock. The price in continental Europe has <Col N="2151" /> ranged between £10 and £12 a cwt. This is the fixed price established over the past four or five years.  It becomes a simple exercise in mathematics.  If you sell a beast weighing 12 cwt at £12 per cwt, you get £144; you sell the same beast at home for £84.  You can pay the tariff and still not be at a loss.  It may be asked what is the sense in doing that; it is easier to send it to Britain. But you can gain something.  You gain an alternative market and, if you gain an alternative market, you ensure that the farmers will not be victimised again by having their prices forced down, which is what has happened over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister make another trip to Europe.  The country can well afford to pay his expenses and keep him there for some time, provided he can bring home some sort of interim agreement.  President de Gaulle told the Minister's leader that he would be happy to have an interim agreement with this country.  That is just another name for a trade agreement.  From my contacts in Europe, I am certain that it would be quite possible for us to get a market in the Republic of France.  At one time we were selling quite considerable amounts of beef there.  Many French people told me they did not know we could produce such fine beef. In fact, they never had eaten anything like it before.  The system in France is that they work the animals, milk them and kill them at a later date.  They go in largely for veal and second-class and often third-class beef.  I am sure there is a market there and the Minister should look into it.</P>
    <P>Even though there is not a really high profit concerned, at least it is an alternative market and an alternative market is the only thing that will ensure stability in selling to the British market. Our beef is always acceptable to Britain.  They have bought it and eaten it over the years.  They will continue to do so but&mdash;I do not blame them&mdash;if they can get it for half nothing, they will do so.  If they have to face opposition&mdash;opposition is the breath of life&mdash; it means you can get better results on the sale.  Yesterday when the question of beef prices was discussed here and <Col N="2152" /> it was suggested by somebody on this side of the House that the improvement in prices was due to the foot and mouth trouble in the United Kingdom, there was loud laughter from the Fianna Fáil benches.  I hope the Minister does not share in the illusion apparently shared by those sitting behind him that the price of beef is up to what it is and is going to be stabilised at that on the British market <i>ad infinitum.</i>  If he does, he is barking up the wrong tree.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk, the Minister rightly devoted a good deal of time to the problem of milk.  Milk is absolutely fundamental to beef.  There is no denying the fact, as other speakers have acknowledged, that milk is going through a difficult period.  The only possible way of feeding the starving millions in the world today is by some form of protein rapidly developed and rapidly transmitted to the different parts of the world.  The OECD recently published an article on world food conditions which gave the warning that agricultural production was going down in the developing countries and was not rising at a sufficient rate in the developed countries to meet the demand for food likely to come or for even what exists today.  It also mentioned the fact that in the developing countries the production of protein foods in the form of milk and beef was practically negligible.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House by reading out the statistics I have here. We are producing milk in excess.  Many of our co-operative societies are running into difficulties as a result and are unable to dispose of the produce. The Minister pointed out that subsidisation is high, but subsidisation is essential.  If you do not have a sound dairy industry, you will not have the livestock on which the economy of this country is virtually hanging and has been over the years.  For that reason, it is necessary that the Minister should take a look at the question of producing proteinised milk as rapidly as possible.  I agree his Department are studying the question, but there is not much use in continually studying the question when people are starving to death in many parts of the world.  We <Col N="2153" /> were recently represented at the UNCTAD Conference in Delhi dealing with this particular problem of trying to get milk products as quickly as possible into these different parts of the world.  It was unfortunate that the Minister himself was unable to attend, but it is understandable because he was dealing with the foot and mouth situation. I am glad to say that at least this country was represented in person by a Minister, Deputy Dr. Hillery, the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>All these factors considered, it is not unreasonable to suggest that without warning there may suddenly descend upon the developed countries of the world a demand for proteinised milk. If you are establishing one of these milk factories set up for the purpose of turning this milk into protein it is not a matter of turning on a switch and starting it overnight.  It takes at least two years to establish one of these factories.  A few years ago the world was full of wheat.  It disappeared overnight because of the demand that came from the different parts of the world. I suggest that this demand for proteinised milk is going to appear at any moment.  We are not in a position to meet it.  If we got a demand for proteinised milk at present, what could we do about it?  The simple answer is &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;&mdash;we could not supply it.</P>
    <P>Supposing tomorrow we got a demand from the United Nations to export tons of that milk to them, we could not do it.  What milk we are proteinising at the moment we are selling on the British market.  This brings us back to the old story&mdash;that the mind of the Fianna Fáil Government does not extend beyond the British market. That is why I say it is absolutely essential that Irish agricultural policy be correlated to world conditions.  If this demand comes, we have nothing to send.  We are associated with all the different organisations endeavouring to deal with the problem I am talking about, but we have nothing to offer. We may perhaps be able to send out agricultural advisers to tell the people what to do.  That may help the situation slightly but it does not meet and will <Col N="2154" /> not meet the demand that is going to come in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency we have a milk problem.  It is not peculiar to us and it is not anything different from any other creamery centre.  What has been happening is that the separated milk has been poured down the drain because there is no outlet for it, whereas the outlet is to manufacture it and send it where it will be used to stop people from starving.  The question of milk and beef is obviously one that is being dealt with within the Department. The policy appears to be to see if we can get through the financial year, if we can stop a catastrophic fall in the price of beef and if we can keep subsidising so as to keep the milk going and the farmers quite.  That is the agricultural policy of the Government.  It is not a policy in world conditions as we find them today.  It is time some wider thinking were introduced, some fresh ideas came through the doors in Merrion Street, so that we might have a long-term agricultural policy commensurate not only with the needs of our own people but with the needs of the people in different parts of the world struggling to exist in adverse circumstances and who very often have not got happy governmental control. The members of the Fianna Fáil Government should be prepared to listen to me when I say why they have not got happy governmental control. One of the reasons is that they have the straight vote.</P>

      <P>I have previously indicated that my decision to allow <Col N="2158" /> development on the frontage of Mount Pleasant Square will not seriously diminish the open space and that there is no question of the public being denied the use of even a small portion of open space to which they formerly had access.  In this connection I would refer the Deputies to what I said on 1st February when concluding the debate on the Estimate for my Department.  The relevant portion can be found in Cols. 231 and 232 of Vol. 232, No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report of the remarks of the President of An Bord Altranais to which the Deputy refers.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to preparations which could be regarded as poisonous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as a limited number of poisonous substances is concerned, provision is made in existing law that the sale of such substances by licensed sellers must be made in containers which the manufacturer supplies and with labels indicating the name of the substance, the name and address of the seller, the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; and the purpose for which it has been prepared, and with the additional provision that liquid preparations must be sold in bottles or tins.  I appreciate the necessity <Col N="2167" /> to extend the scope of these controls and provision exists in section 14 of the Poisons Act, 1961 under which the Minister for Health may make regulations controlling the sale, labelling, etc. of all substances which he declares to be poisons.  Comhairle na Nimheanna, the Council set up under this Act, have studied the whole question of poisons control and have submitted recommendations to me which, in effect, form the basis of a comprehensive code for controlling the distribution of those substances.</P>
    <P>Regulations based on these recommendations are being drafted at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will ensure stricter control on the availability of amphetamines, as they are now regarded as being of little therapeutic value and can in conjunction with other drugs lead to addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale by retail of amphetamines is governed by the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, which provide that the substances in question may not be sold by persons other than pharmaceutical chemists, dispensing chemists and druggists and registered druggists, and may not be dispensed except on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon.  However, as I indicated in reply to a question on 15th instant, I propose to strengthen the existing powers of control by making the unauthorised possession of these substances a punishable offence.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is not suggesting that there should be any restrictions on the freedom of the individual medical practitioner to have recourse to the medicine of his choice in any particular case.</P>

In subsequent legislation more appropriate designations were adopted, for example, &ldquo;therapeutic substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;medical preparation&rdquo;.  The latest statutory definition of the word &ldquo;drug&rdquo; is contained in the National Drugs Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, 1966.

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are in favour of the greater part of this Supplementary Estimate. We believe that money spent on agriculture is money well spent, that agriculture is our greatest industry and we want to see it progressing in the future and at all times.  We definitely have made our position clear in regard to the amount of money voted for the National Agricultural Council.  We are against that and at a later stage I will give the reason.  Let it be remembered that under this Government agriculture is at present in the doldrums.  Indeed, not for the first time under a Fianna Fáil Government, the farmers are becoming second-class citizens and are being victimised by the Minister who is making them hewers of wood and drawers of water.</P>
      <P>The Minister today spoke about the serious foot and mouth epidemic which started in Britain last October.  I want to say that we on this side of the House gave the Minister one hundred per cent support.  We thought he was reasonable in his efforts and in the action he was taking to keep this disease from reaching our shores.  At the same time, we must thank Almighty God for the fact that this disease did not reach our shores because during the month of November, when there were as many as 17 and 18 cases a day in Britain, as Deputy Clinton mentioned today, farmers were coming over from Britain and going to markets in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 9th December, Deputy Clinton instanced a case of a man from my own county who went over to Britain. He went to a funeral in an infected county, came back, crossed the Border <Col N="2170" /> and was not stopped to be disinfected and was not questioned.  Indeed, let it be remembered it was only when the National Farmers Organisation got volunteer workers and helpers and sent them up to the Border and started themselves to appeal to the people to have their cars disinfected, in order to arrest this disease, that the Minister really opened his eyes.  While credit is due to certain people we were definitely very lackadaisical during the month of November.  As a matter of fact, it was only in the middle of December, when the disease was on the wane, that we really took effective measures here to prevent the disease spreading.  We should all thank the thousands of Irish boys and girls who, on being appealed to, forfeited their holidays and stayed in Britain.  Our best thanks are due to those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the fact that our veterinary staff helped in co-operation with the British veterinary staff.  I am glad to see this co-operation: it is a good thing.  It is an awful pity we did not have it 30 years ago under this Government but perhaps it is better late than never.  The Minister stated he was recently able to announce some relaxations, as a result of which trading generally may be resumed at marts and fairs on and from 29th February.  We raised this matter a fortnight ago and the Minister behaved in a most vindictive way in regard to marts.  We know there was only one reason for it.  We know that the present Minister undoubtedly has energy which he can display at by-elections but if he would display the same initiative and energy in dealing with farmers' interests, then he could certainly do something worthwhile for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister on this particular occasion showed how vindictive he is.  He definitely demonstrated to the farmers and to the people of the country that he wants to continue the row which was started last year by his predecessor, Deputy Haughey, when he refused to meet the farmers' organisation and left them sitting for 21 days on the steps of the Department of Agriculture. Many of those people had marched 200 miles.  They did not leave their wives and families for nothing.  They <Col N="2171" /> left them because many of them were getting it hard to eke out a living because things were so bad.</P>
    <P>I want to know, and to put it to the Minister, if it was right to allow hunting and dog racing, to allow people to go over to rugby matches in Britain and come back here and to allow dealers in this country&mdash;the Minister knows this&mdash;to travel the length and breadth of Ireland buying cattle, why he could not allow marts to be fully and effectively opened until 29th February.  There was only one reason for it.  He still wanted to keep burning the fires he helped to light last year and to keep the bitterness going.  It is time the hatchet was buried in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in regard to the foot and mouth outbreak:</P>
    <P>The view is commonly taken that imported meat is probably responsible. The British Government have temporarily suspended imports from certain countries where the disease is endemic.</P>
    <P>We all agree with that.  I believe an important announcement on next Monday will affect seriously, one way or another, the price farmers will receive for their cattle in the next few months. If the British Government agree to allow in the Argentine meat, the danger is that the price of cattle here may slump as it did last year under this Minister, when the price dropped to an all-time low and when calves were given away, as they were in certain parts of the south and west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If cattle prices are good today, the Minister can claim very little credit for it.  That situation is due to the unfortunate epidemic of foot and mouth disease and the fact that the British Government has stopped the import of foreign meat.  If this ban continues, it will be a glorious opportunity for this country.  We know there was a time in the history of the Government when they had no regard for the bullock or for the British market.  They did not realise the importance of this.  Due to that fact, untold harm was done to the farming community, to the agricultural industry and indeed to the <Col N="2172" /> economy of the whole country.  If the British Government continue this ban, I claim that there is a glorious future for the cattle industry and for the farmers in this country if the Minister gets working and working immediately in their interest.</P>
    <P>We had a heifer scheme a few years ago and many of us on this side of the House found fault with it.  We think now that there should be a change and the Minister should give a different type of subsidy on calves to encourage immediately the production of more calves so that we will have more beef to export next year or in a year and a half to Britain.  The Minister stated that the view is commonly taken that imported meat is probably responsible for the disease spread in Britain. If the British Government continue this ban there is a glorious future for us and the Minister and the Government, in co-operation with the farmers of this country, should be ready to jump into the breach and take full advantage of it.  It is hard and it will be hard to do that unless you have co-operation and we have very little co-operation between the Minister and the organised farmers of the country at present, and nobody is responsible for that but the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the next paragraph of his speech the Minister claims that the additional expense incurred by his Department up to 31st March in connection with the operation of our various restrictions and controls is estimated at £147,000. Under that heading the Government paid for advertisements in different newspapers.  In newspapers that differed politically from this Government down through the years they paid for advertisements but there was one particular paper which is purchased by 95 per cent of the farmers of this country and is read by them, and, indeed, manufacturers of fertilisers, agricultural machinery <i>et cetera,</i> know the value of this paper but because the editor or people concerned with this paper had the audacity to criticise the little dictators in the Fianna Fáil Party the Minister used his power to keep Irish taxpayers' money from going to this particular journal and because they were not <Col N="2173" /> prepared to toe his Party line he used his powers.  He should not have the power to withhold taxpayers' money from any political journal whether it agrees or disagrees with the Government.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that this cost us £147,000 so far, and thousands have been paid to other journals and papers, I think it is a retrograde step and it illustrates the way the Minister treated this particular journal.  We cannot expect anything else from a man as vindictive as the present Minister whose sole aim seems to be to keep the farmers divided and to foment class warfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister on page 3 said that the total Exchequer payments in support of creamery milk prices in 1967-68 are now estimated at £19.2 million, the highest figure ever recorded.  We support the payment of this money to the people who are already producing milk but I think the time has come when the Minister and the Government should examine this whole question.  I think we are at the crossroads as regards milk production and, indeed, we may be at saturation point.  The EEC reports are anything but favourable and, therefore, I think that the Government should consider whether it is wise to encourage other people to stop producing beef, mutton, pigs, veal and other produce for which there is a ready market and encourage them to go into milk production.</P>
    <P>In my opinion we have reached a saturation point.  I was talking to a creamery manager recently and for milk powder he told me they were getting £120 a ton up a few months ago.  Now it is unsaleable and the price has dropped to £40 or £50 a ton.  In Land Commission places that have been erected cow tying has been put in for 16 cows.  I think it is unfair to the people who are already in milk production and the burden is a very big one on the taxpayers.  It is unfair to the people who are already in it if we encourage other people to leave beef, mutton or pig production and entice them to produce milk for which according to the EEC report the future is not too bright.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> The time has come when the Minister and the Government should give serious consideration to this problem. Let it be remembered that there is a shortage of meat and especially of beef throughout the world today and that we can produce the best beef and, I say, the best mutton in the world. There are markets for it and if there are, as there are in England, in Europe for the American forces and throughout the world, why should we try to entice the farmers to leave that?  It will be better for the country in the future if there is more emphasis on producing mutton, pork and veal because the markets are there and I think the taxpayers will not have to subsidise it to the same extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown a certain amount of anxiety here because in his speech he dealt with the rate at which the total bill is mounting.  He spoke about the sum of £4,900,000 which is needed to meet the cost of the support payments on the record exports of carcase meat to Britain during the past year.  We welcome that and as far as we are concerned we still believe, as I have stated, that there is a future in that direction.</P>
    <P>We have appealed on numerous occasions to the Minister to make that money available to the producers. Recently&mdash;about a month or a fortnight ago&mdash;a scheme was started. From the information I have received it is a complicated scheme and very few of the farmers or of the producers can avail of it.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the export of boneless manufacturing beef to the United States or to any other part of the world.  It would be much better if we had both the stores trade and the export of boneless manufacturing beef because the export of boneless manufacturing beef means employment for our own people in our own country and we have the other raw materials so that we are of necessity giving employment to our own people at home and, therefore, I think any money spent in that direction is money well spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the setting up of a board with promotional functions <Col N="2175" /> in relation to the export of livestock, cattle and sheep.  It is three years since the NFA, when they were on terms with the Government and with Deputy Haughey, contacted the Government and made a recommendation in this respect.  It is a fact that though we produce the best in the world, our marketing system is ante-diluvian. Therefore, a meat marketing board is necessary.  Deputy Haughey promised such a board in October, 1966.  He was speaking in the House. A month later, the Minister for Agriculture, speaking at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, promised it and told delegates that it would be set up immediately.</P>
    <P>That is 15 months ago and we find, on the eve of 1st March, 1968, the Minister telling us that arrangements for the establishment of such a body are well advanced and &ldquo;I hope to make a more detailed announcement before very long&rdquo;.  I should like to know what &ldquo;before very long&rdquo; means. Questions have been asked in the House during the year and we have always been told that arrangements for the setting up of this body are well advanced and that the Minister hopes to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.  Why the dithering? When the farmers marched on a particular day and were supposed to block the roads, the Government lost no time in arresting them, in bringing them to court and in putting them in prison.  When it comes to doing anything for the good of the farmers or of agriculture, however, the Government dither.  We are entitled to know now from the Minister what his plans now are and when he intends to finalise them.</P>
    <P>In relation to this board, if the Minister is to continue to put Fianna Fáil stooges into it as he did in the case of the NAC he will not get anyhere.  He should take a leaf out of the book of the British and the Northern Ireland Governments where producers are properly and justly represented on those boards.  If the proposed board is an effort to give more thousands to some Taca men and to Fianna Fáil Party henchmen and yes men, it will not do <Col N="2176" /> anything tangible for agricultural production or for our exports.  Now the Minister is being given an opportunity to give the premier agricultural organisation fair and just representation on a board.  When it comes to setting the board up, the NFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe and other voluntary organisations who are doing such valuable work should be given fair representation.  We do not want to see any more candidates going forward in county council elections, being defeated and then being put on those boards.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister began to realise that it is difficult to get farmers' co-operation if he continues to carry on as he has been doing.  The farmers can see through him.  They see what he has done in the past and I hope that on this occasion he will show a little more justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of pig production and he referred to pig cycles. During many years the small farmers and cottiers went into pig production as a means of helping them to increase their incomes.  Unfortunately, the rising prices of feeding stuffs in the past few years have made pig production uneconomic and it is hard to expect people to continue in any line unless they are getting a reasonable and fair profit for the hard work they put into it.  With the latest increases in the price of meal and other feeding stuffs, farmers in pig production cannot get that return.  It is easy to understand why people in pig production give it up when they see the cost of feeding stuffs and the cost of living go up and see no increases in the price paid by the factory.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister need not talk in terms of pig cycles.  He need not cod himself or try to fool his Department by asking them to look at pig cycles. The depression in the industry occurred when production was not profitable and increases in production occurred when there was some profit, no matter how small, to be made.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate everybody concerned, including the Department, in relation to the warble fly scheme. However, it must be remembered the <Col N="2177" /> scheme was begun on a voluntary basis by the NFA in co-operation with the creameries and the artificial insemination centres and it was at least two years before the Department of Agriculture woke up to the situation when the British Government told us they would refuse after a particular date to take our cattle unless they were free of warble.  It was only then that the Minister for Agriculture and the Department realised the necessity to clear cattle of this pest; it was only then that they took an active part in a scheme which had been started by the NFA, with their own money and with the co-operation of the farming community. It shows what can be done through co-operation.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Minister should have in every county an animal health committee&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;and greater emphasis should be placed on trying to rid cattle of warble fly, brucellosis, fluke and all other parasites and diseases which affect young cattle.  It is agreed that at least £10 million to £15 million is lost every year due to those diseases and because an all-out effort has not been made to bring home to the people concerned their own responsibility in the matter and the fact that they have not attacked those diseases at their early stages in order to have cattle cleared completely.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to wheat.  I do not know whether it is in order to mention the long delays there were last year outside mills at the delivery stage but I hope that improvements will be made this year.  Wheat acreage is now only half of what it was a few years ago.  We can remember when the people on the far side of the House were supposed to be the wheat farmers and they said that the people on this side were only in favour of beef.  I do not know what has happened since but there seems to have been a great change.  Certainly the fact that the Government have changed their opinion in regard to beef production and the value of the British market is good for the economy and for the people, but it is only right to point out <Col N="2178" /> to the Minister that the acreage under wheat is only little more than half what it was in 1954 and 1955.  Today the farmers, taking into account devaluation and the decline in the value of the £, are not getting in real money terms what they were getting 12 or 13 years ago for wheat.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is any section of the community which is asked to work today for less than they were getting ten or 12 years ago? There is no section which has been asked to do so by the Government except the farmers.  Last year we imported £24 million worth of cereals, which, if we had proper advice and a proper lead from the Government, could and should have been grown in this country.  If it had been produced here, it would have brought more wealth and given more employment to our people and would no doubt have helped our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a sum of £400,000 is required to meet additional expenditure on grants to farmers under the Land Project.  That is money which is more than well spent.  When that scheme was introduced many years ago, it was condemned bitterly by the Government, and we are glad to see that they now realise that it is a good scheme, that it is in the farmers' interests and in the interests of the nation to have land drained and properly fertilised and to make certain, as Deputy Dillon said when introducing the scheme, that two blades of grass could grow where previously only one blade grew.  I remember him saying in 1947 that at that time there was not even a thimbleful of ground limestone in the country.  When he started that scheme, he appealed to the farmers to avail of it to the full, and said that as far as he was concerned, he was prepared to help them in every way to have their lands drained and tested and to have the proper manures put on their lands in order that they might get the maximum production.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the exact amount of land that has been reclaimed but I think it is well over one million acres.  That was money well spent, despite the fact that this Government, and indeed the Minister, were loud in <Col N="2179" /> their condemnation of it at one time.  I am glad the Minister has been converted and now realises the value of the scheme.  We welcome the fact that additional money is necessary.  So many people believe in this scheme that there is a very long waiting list, and in my county people have to wait for as long as two years.  I wonder if the Minister could do anything to shorten this waiting period.  If farmers are willing to improve their land, it should be remembered that this is in the interest of the nation, because then they can produce more and by producing more, they can export more.  As the Minister and the Department have been pointing out for the past few months, we live by exports, and by exporting more, we can have a larger national cake and every section of the community can get a larger slice and thereby help the whole country.  I should like to see the waiting period reduced because if farmers show this initiative, they should be given the permission to go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The sum of £2,600 is required to cover the travelling and subsistence expenses of the National Agricultural Council in the first year of its existence. This sum should be knocked out of this Estimate because this body as it is at present constituted has done no useful work for the farmers.  It is putty in the hands of the Government.  As a matter of fact, it is being used by the Minister and by the political Party of which he is a member, to keep warfare going between the different farming organisations.  His idea is to divide and conquer and the vindictive action taken last year is still being taken and this Council is the vehicle he uses to keep alive the embers of that fire which he did so much to light last year.  If there is the slightest chance of this dispute ending, the Minister comes along and throws more petrol on the fire.  Recently when the NFA were prepared to co-operate in any and every way to help keep out the dread foot and mouth disease, the Minister again showed how vindictive he was. There was a sum of £147,000 for that scheme and not one penny of that was paid to <i>The Farmers' Journal.</i>  He showed his vindictive spirit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The NAC is being used by the Minister to keep this war alive.  We, on this side of the House, believe in the rights of all sections to organise.  We believe that farmers, or labourers, or anyone else, are entitled to organise in their own interests.  The Minister for Agriculture and his colleague, the Minister for Labour, are the servants of the people and it is the duty of the servants of the people to meet the people and have consultations with them.  It is no part of their duty to treat the people as some organisations have been and are being treated.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture by an overwhelming majority&mdash;I think, 48 votes to eight&mdash;called upon their representatives to withdraw from the NAC.  Fianna Fáil are members of these committees and it is quite obvious now that these committees have no faith in their own representatives on this body.  They were called on to resign.  They did not do so.  They now represent nobody.  To make a real farce of the entire situation, the Minister is himself chairman of the National Agricultural Council.  He prepares some scheme and, when he wants to get publicity for that scheme, he goes to the National Agricultural Council and tells the Council the Government have agreed to such and such and he wants to give the Council the credit for it: he tells the Council: &ldquo;We will issue a statement that the National Agricultural Council recommended so and so.&rdquo;  A week later the Minister makes an announcement and tries to put it across to the people that the National Agricultural Council are doing wonderful work for the farmers. It is no harm to point out to the Minister that in 1957 there was a National Production Council in being and the NFA had four representatives on it.  It was set up by, I think, Deputy Dillon.  I saw the names of the four representatives a few days ago; three of them were Fianna Fáil.  I do not know the political affiliations of the fourth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Minister is now using this National Agricultural Council to <Col N="2181" /> perpetuate the war he started between the farmers' organisations.  His aim seems to be to play one organisation off against the other.  I should like to advise the organisation that is in his pocket at the moment that, if the Minister succeeds, but he will not, in walking on or breaking up, the existing farmers' organisation, the largest in the country, it will be a very short time before he rids himself of the other farmers' organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the additional sums he is now seeking in respect of such items as beef and dairy produce subsidies.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>... the total of State expenditure in relation to agriculture in 1967-68 is now estimated to be in the region of £69 million....</P>
    <P>Last year the Government took a full page in the daily papers to point out that so much money was being paid in subsidy.  It is only right to point out that the farmers do not want doles or subsidies.  They want fair and just prices for their produce so that they and their wives and families can live in ordinary frugal comfort.  They ask no more and they seek no less.</P>
    <P>The yardstick by which any policy can be judged is the numbers of young people who benefit by that policy. Using that yardstick, one must admit that the policy of the Government in regard to agriculture has been a failure. If agriculture were progressive and if those engaged in agriculture had a reasonable income, there would not be the flight from the land.  There would not be emigration.  That is the pattern throughout the length and breadth of the country, despite the £69 million the Minister says is paid in subsidy. The Minister should be fair.  Included in that £69 million are the salary of the Minister and travelling expenses, the salaries of the officials of his Department, expenditure on county committees of agriculture, the salaries of agricultural instructors, poultry instructresses, the Agricultural Institute, the subsidy on lime.  With regard to the latter, the greater part of that subsidy goes to CIE.  Included in that <Col N="2182" /> £69 million are the Botanic Gardens, the Zoological Gardens and the subsidy to the British to eat our butter. Irish butter can be bought in Britain at 2/7d or 2/8d a lb, whereas the Irish housewife pays 5/- a lb.  Every lb of butter sent to Britain is wrapped in a 2/6d postal order.  That subsidy comes out of the £69 million.  We approve of all the expenditure except the expenditure on the National Agricultural Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine myself to two items in this Supplementary Estimate and I shall try to be as constructive and as helpful as possible because the Minister has a gigantic task in handling our largest industry and he needs not only the advice of his own officials but the advice of every common-or-garden agriculturist throughout the country.  Different types of agriculture are indigenous to different areas.  I do not want to be critical of the Minister or to support the accusations that have been made against him, but I would recommend him to take another look at the formation of the National Agricultural Council because the country is too small and the industry is too big to have conflicting bodies looking after it. I refer in particular to the differences that exist between the ICMSA and the NFA.  It is not an impossible task to bring them together and have some semblance of unity so they can all go the road together and face the difficulties on that road that are presenting themselves every day of the week. Without being critical or aggressive, I would ask the Minister to look at the situation again and try to reconcile those differences in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the oversupply of milk.  At present we are swimming in it.  We were swimming in it last summer and it looks as if we will have increased milk production this summer as well.  I would ask the Minister to direct his attention now to the subsidiary dairy industries, in particular the manufacture of cheese. From cheese we get the skim milk and the whey which we will be discussing later in relation to the bacon industry. There is a growing demand all over <Col N="2183" /> Europe for Irish cheese and I would ask the Minister to make available whatever money is needed for the expansion of this industry.  The demand is much greater than the supply and it is, therefore, up to the Department to see to it that this surplus milk will be diverted into something for which there is a demand.  There is a demand for cheese and as a result we will also have the whey for the supply of pig feed.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned hostile interests. I do not believe in that kind of talk at this stage.  There is no such thing as hostile interests.  If they are hostile, may be they have been provoked into their hostility.  You do not get people grumbling and fighting merely for the sake of carrying on an agitation.  They do so only because they think they have a legitimate case. If their fears were allayed, their hostility would disappear and we would have the unity so necessary in the running of such an important industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think sufficient money is made available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to do their job.  We all have had experience of what happens when claims are made on the corporation on behalf of the smaller farmers in our constituency.  We get industrious young farmers trying to set up a decent herd or trying to cultivate their land to the modern standards necessary in preparation for our entry into the Common Market.  Their applications have been refused by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I have had legitimate cases, in which I thought there would be no trouble in securing a loan from the corporation, turned down.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the exorbitant profits being made by the meat-processing factories. I read the reply to a question concerning the profits these factories have made and it dismayed me to find that for some months of the year they were getting over 9d. per lb. on the beef they processed, leaving out altogether the sale of that commodity.  When I made it up on the basis of an ordinary baby beef beast, averaging 9 cwt, these factories get a subsidy of £40 or £45 <Col N="2184" /> from the Minister instead of passing that back to the producer.  The Minister has promised to investigate the matter.  These people have become millionaires overnight to the detriment of the producers.  It is unjust and unfair. I hope the Minister will come down with a hard and vicious hand on that type of manipulation, where these processing factories are allowed to get away with that much subsidy, thus depriving the supplier of what he is justly entitled to.  I am not asking them to work for nothing.  I know they have heavy overheads and that they give good employment.  But there should be a fairer distribution than what there is at present.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the matter I am most interested in, the bacon industry. I have spoken here on many occasions on the decline of that industry. I have been assured by the Minister and his predecessor that there was no need to worry about the future of that industry.  Figures were thrown out to me purporting to show that the pig population was higher today than yesterday and would be higher again tomorrow. They can throw out regiments and legions of figures any day of the week.  Since Templemore there is nothing more deceptive than figures.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof.</P>
    <P>At one time we had four bacon factories in my own city, some of them working practically 24 hours a day.  Now we have two bacon factories and a lame one.  Not alone are the two not in full production, but one of them let 35 male workers go a fortnight ago because the pigs are not there.  If they are there, as the figures I was given would seek to show, the fact remains that not alone in my city but in Cork and Dublin these factories are either closing down or letting go their staff.  These factories have been brought up-to-date.  Some of them, established for generations, have re-organised themselves and brought themselves up to the conditions necessary for our entry to the Common Market.  The result is that while the machinery and gear are there to process more per minute, per hour, per day, we have not got the supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> If the Department had been alert, they could have seen what anyone with half an eye could see, that the bacon factories were being mechanised and were being brought up to handle perhaps two or three times the number they handled four, five or ten years ago &mdash;if the Department were alert, which they were not.  If they were, they would have said to themselves: &ldquo;In that case we have to do something else.  We have to increase our pig production.&rdquo;  Instead, they sat down idly on their haunches and did damn-all about it.  I want to say this without being critical.  I want to be critical, but at the same time, I want to be constructive.  I want to stress this point.  The Department, together with the Pigs and Bacon Commission, have failed hopelessly and completely.  I want to repeat something I said here in the past.  It is about time the Pigs and Bacon Commission was re-organised, the present one scrapped, and the members of it sent home to look after their own business if they are capable of doing that.  Let us get men with foresight and ability, men who are prepared to work, to constitute the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to be helpful.  I know something about the bacon industry and I want to advise the Minister on this. When cheese is processed, there is a liquid left which is called whey.  This is a first-class food for pig-rearing.  It is cheap.  The greatest expense in regard to whey feed is transport costs.  A gallon of whey costs between 1/2d and 3/4d, which is little or nothing.  You can get thousands and thousands of gallons of is every day from the cheese processing plants.  Delivery, transport and storage costs are the only expense.  I admit whey causes erosion.  Any pig producer who produces pigs in numbers from 200 to 300 upwards will tell you that whey causes erosion in the tanks, and they have to be relined every couple of years perhaps.  That is a small job and it is not expensive.  It is the only expense incurred in whey feeding, apart from the transport costs.</P>
    <P>In Limerick city, thousands and thousands of gallons of whey are thrown into the Shannon every day of <Col N="2186" /> the week by the Condensed Milk Company. You can see the whey mixing with the Shannon water, turning it white and flowing into the Atlantic Ocean.  If that is not the greatest waste of good fattening food I have ever seen, I do not know where to look for it.  It is tragic in a city like Limerick that this whey is not diverted into pig production. I attended a seminar a short time ago in Limerick organised by the Pig Rearers Association.  This matter was discussed at length.  Pig feeders from practically every county in Munster attended to give their views.  These pig feeders are men who rear pigs in hundreds and that is the only way to do it economically.</P>
    <P>These men were of the same opinion about the price of the pig compounds which have to be purchased from the different millers, and at at very handsome profit to the millers, but to no advantage, good, bad, or indifferent, but at a loss to the pig producer.  They are organising now to turn to this whey food.  God between us and all harm with regard to the Department of Agriculture where the bacon industry is concerned.  Factories are closing down every day of the week or, if they are not closing down, they are letting men go every day of the week because they have not the pigs to kill, and the work is not there.  The demand is there.  The Minister admits that the demand for bacon and pig meat is there.  We cannot supply the need.  That is why I would impress this on the Minister in the interests not only of the farmers but of all the workers engaged in the bacon industry.</P>
    <P>No city is nearer to the bacon industry than Limerick.  In the past, the Danes came to Limerick to learn something about bacon curing.  Now they have beaten us to the punch and practically wiped us out but the tradition is there in this industry.  God help the Department and the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  If this is left in their hands, I know where the whole industry will finish up.  I am glad the Minister said:</P>
    <P>At the moment I am having a special look at the position in regard to pig and feed prices and I am hopeful <Col N="2187" /> that it will be possible to make some adjustments which will give greater encouragement to pig producing, especially in the West where increased pig production could do much to add to the income of small farmers.</P>
    <P>He does not say when.  This is the Promised Land again.  We got it last year and the year before, and we will get it next year unless something is done.  I want to tell the Minister that if something is not done very soon&mdash;and when I make this statement, I do not want to throw out any threats of violence or anything else&mdash;with regard to the bacon industry, he will have a much more serious claim and case on his hands than he had with the National Farmers Association.</P>
    <P>In Limerick, we have men who are gone beyond any kind of retraining service or retraining education thrown out to walk the streets with their hands in their pockets, and go to the labour exchange.  Unless something is done, there will be an emergency on this issue.  I do not want to be destructive; I want to be helpful.  I am warning the Minister what will happen if this problem is not tackled with energy, courage and foresight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for my absence from the House but I thought Deputy O'Higgins was about to offer when I left.  The debate did not throw up anything unusual or new.  To a large extent, Deputies dealt on a critical note with the actions of the Minister where there was anything to condemn and with the actions of others if there was anything to praise.  This is fairly typical of the Opposition.  The NAC was mentioned, as was the cattle trade and foot and mouth disease, and I propose generally to say something on these particular matters later and, perhaps, a few words on matters of lesser importance that were also mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been contended by more than one speaker that the NAC is of no value.  In fact, the sole reason given for moving to reduce this Supplementary Estimate is the few thousand <Col N="2188" /> pounds out of the millions in this Estimate that it will cost to operate the NAC for 12 months.</P>
    <P>The first thing that should be pinpointed is that none of the people in the NAC, although many calls are made on them for attendance at meetings, is paid anything.  There is nothing in it for anybody, if that might be suggested by the viciousness of the attack made on these people and the attributing to them of political affiliations all of a similar nature, allegedly Fianna Fáil.  This is a very stupid line of attack and one known to those who made it to be untrue.  I shall not go around the NAC members and give their whole political outlook, but I shall say categorically that there are people sitting around the table of the NAC whose views are known right through their lifetime to be anything but Fianna Fáil, and I have no reason to think that since they joined the NAC, they have changed their outlook and are Fianna Fáil today.</P>
    <P>Out of the total membership operating at present in the NAC, I have nominated four.  Remember there are ten now sitting.  The other six were put forward by representative organisations so that the charge that I hand-picked these people and that the NAC is merely a tool of the Government and the Minister is without foundation. If there should be any foundation to that charge, then the charge is being laid at the feet of the three organisations who have each done their part in supplying two members, namely, the ICMSA, the Beetgrowers Association and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The fact that I have not put on the two further members that I have reserved the right to put on is for the very good reason that there is one organisation that has so far not joined the NAC, the NFA.  I have not added my final two nominees to the group because if the NFA were to put on their two representatives, they might really be duplicating the two I might put on leaving gaps in the all around competence of the body of 14 which I hope will be the total membership. <Col N="2189" /> Gaps might be left so far as specialist knowledge is concerned, and so I still reserve these two although I shall not do so for very much longer because there are elements in the NAC that need strengthening and I must shortly exercise my prerogative to aid those elements by appointing the additional members.  It would be better&mdash;and I would still hope for it&mdash;if the two from the NFA were forthcoming. When I saw what their particular specialist knowledge was in their own line of agriculture, I would then exercise my prerogative by appointing two others to bring the membership to the total of 14 I still hope to achieve.  If this does not happen, I may shortly add one or, perhaps two more members, as is the stated intention.</P>
    <P>I have been taken to task here today for foisting on the country an unwanted national so-called agricultural council&mdash;I think that was the description given.  The very Deputy who made this charge, Deputy Clinton was followed by little Sir Echo himself, Deputy L'Estrange.  It was Deputy Clinton who chided me at the General Council of Committees of Agriculture a year ago that I should get on with this more quickly than I was doing and set up a council.  He suggested at that meeting that if I did not get on with the task, he felt the General Council should set it up themselves.  As it turned out, I did set up the NAC shortly afterwards and why Deputy Clinton should be so short in memory now as to suggest it was an unwanted and uncalled for move when he himself was one of the first to call for such a body and to suggest that the General Council should sponsor its setting up, is something I do not understand.</P>
    <P>It should not go without notice here that this Council as constituted does represent a very good cross-section of the agricultural community.  Without wishing to be argumentative, I would say that so far as the organisations represented on it are concerned, they together represent more individual farmers than the one body outstanding that has not joined the NAC.  Yet, <Col N="2190" /> listening here, one would imagine that these other organisations count for nothing and represent nobody, that the ICMSA is of no account and the Beetgrowers Association is of no account, and the thousands of members who belong to both are of no account, merely because they belong to organisations other than that to which Fine Gael would like them to belong.</P>
    <P>Then we have the General Council of the Committees of Agriculture also, apparently, representing nobody.  As a politician and as an ex-member of a committee of agriculture in a county council for nine or ten years, I reckon that the two people from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture are more truly representatives of farmers than any of those who may be suggested at any time to go on such a council, because they are not only representative of their committees but, remember, they come from rural areas; they have been elected by what is mainly an agricultural and farming electorate.  If they are not representative of our farmers, then I do not think any other organisation of a voluntary nature can claim to represent farmers. If the elected representatives do not represent the farmers from whose areas they have sprung and have been elected to their councils and subsequently to committees of agriculture and then to the National Agricultural Council, then there is not any of us anywhere in any capacity who can claim to do so.</P>
    <P>So far as the individuals I have put on this committee are concerned, I will again challenge the Opposition that even the four I have put on out of the ten are not all Fianna Fáil and, in fact, have been known not to have been Fianna Fáil down the years.  Again, I will mention no names because this is so evident to Fine Gael that I do not have to state it, but it is quite true, quite evident and quite well known to them that of the four I have put on, I have not got a majority of them, never mind all of them, known Fianna Fáil supporters or, indeed, actual Fianna Fáil supporters, as far as is known of their careers up to date.  So it is not a Fianna Fáil dominated group by any means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> There are six elected by these three very reputable bodies of high standard, representative of a vast number of farmers, four put on by me for their particular special knowledge to add to the six already there and two of the four, at least, known to be other than Fianna Fáil all during their days.  Fine Gael know this better than I do.  Fine Gael should take note of it and not be castigating their own friends of the past merely to have a swipe at some of my friends today, all with the intention of knocking the NAC and trying as best Deputy L'Estrange can to stir up trouble and to attack the NFA and the NAC in this House, whereas his colleague, the night that he was with me on a television programme had the good sense to suggest that the matter should not be raised or discussed there at all as it would not do anybody any good.  Deputy L'Estrange does not seem to have that view but he should have a talk with the shadow Minister on his own Front Bench and he may be brought up-to-date.  I do not want any row in this House but the things that were said cannot be let go unchallenged and I still say that the few thousands of the total millions going into agriculture that go on the cost and expenses of running this council for the past 12 months is probably the best value for money of any of the £69 million we are spending up to 31st March.</P>
    <P>The cattle trade has been talked about here and, of course, we have the usual approach by the Opposition, Fine Gael speakers talking about the good prices of today and suggesting that it was only because of the disaster that overtook the British in the foot and mouth disease that we have these prices today and had such a good year. The fact is that were it not for the advent of foot and mouth disease in Britain, we would have had a better year because our supplies to Britain were badly curtailed in the past four or six weeks because of the outbreak. Our output to the British Market would have been higher and it had already gone to such a pitch that, taking our beef and cattle exports and the value received for them during <Col N="2192" /> the previous part of the year, the sum total, even with the slow down in the month of December, has all added up, despite that handicap in the last month of the year, to new record export figures both in volume and in value and this story that foot and mouth disease is the only reason that there are prices for cattle today is completely without foundation.</P>
    <P>I have been challenged as well, of course, to say what part the Government, the Department or myself may have played in any way during last year in these more happy circumstances of the cattle trade than in the previous year.  I would claim that our continuous advocacy from earlier than this time last year to farmers to sell their cattle when they were ready, if and when they would get a reasonable price and had a steady flow of output from the country, would be our best plan during 1967 and then we would not have a glut at the back end.  The months from April to August will bear out that what we advocated, in fact, was done and that the big carry-over from 1966 had been completely liquidated by the end of August together with the normal crop of animals that would have been ready during that period.  These were the things that really had the effect of leaving us without a surplus at the back end.  This, together with the expanded American market for boned cow beef, which is another very substantial and big contributor to the very lively and good trade we enjoyed last year.  It was not just the 200,000 or 300,000 cows that have been cleared out of the country that was important, or even the good prices paid for these animals. The fact is that this is a type of product for which we had no other market during 1967 and if we did not have a lively market in the States we would have had this type of product thrown on our own home market at bad prices, substituting for and taking the place of prime heifer or bullock beef and depressing these prices accordingly, the effect of which would have been felt throughout the entire cattle trade.</P>
    <P>In regard to the two things, then, to which I attribute the improvement last year, we feel we had some hand in them because the records are there from <Col N="2193" /> January of last year of our advocating on every occasion the clearance of animals as they became ready, not holding them over for bigger prices that might never materialise, the insistence that farmers should try to sell them regularly and to phase the supply month by month and thereby not only get rid of big numbers but avoid a crushing backlog such as might be pushed into the back end of the season, which is partly what happened to us in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Of course, if we were transporting ourselves back 12 months and discussing here a Supplementary Estimate 12 months ago, there is no doubt whatever that whatever was happening then or had happened in the cattle trade would be directly attributed by the Opposition to the action or inaction of the Minister for Agriculture.  Because of the fact that circumstances have changed, that the market has been good, that our exports have been at record levels, of course, the Opposition feel compelled to go out of their way to point out that the Minister and his Department and the Government have had nothing whatever to do with the improved situation.  It is the old story. If there is anything on which to knock the Government, then the Government are to be knocked right down the line, even including the bad weather.  Right up the line, including the bad weather, everybody, except the Government can be given credit for improvements.  This is typical, negative, Fine Gael tactics in this House and referred to by me merely to put them in proper perspective, lest there still may be anybody in the country who may be taken in by them.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease is a scourge which, so far, we have escaped.  We have escaped it by the diligence with which all of our people at every level, here and abroad, took heed of the warnings which it was the duty of the Minister for Agriculture on behalf of his Government to give from time to time.  People abided by the regulations made from time to time and had to put up with certain hardship, difficulty and inconvenience.  Nobody was more conscious of this than the Department <Col N="2194" /> of Agriculture and I who were charged with the ultimate responsibility of advising the Government when these things were to be done, how far we were to go, for how long these restrictions were to be imposed.  Ours was the burden to carry in that connection and we were quite conscious of the difficulties we were creating for people, but, in retrospect, it can be said that our handling of the matter is appreciated by the public as a whole.  If they had not appreciated that we were handling the matter in the way they felt it should be handled, they would not have given us the full and utmost co-operation we got.  This, I think, disproved any charges by the wild men of Fine Gael who merely want to have a swipe at the Government regardless of what is at issue, whether it is the question of these people who were inconvenienced, a number of whom are still inconvenienced and will be for some considerable time yet, or anything else, but Deputy Esmonde here said, in complete contradiction to what Deputy L'Estrange said, that he believed that these things had to be done in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange reckons that any restrictions up to now on marts and fairs, which have been removed as from today, were purely generated by vindictiveness or viciousness on my part against the NFA.  What it has to do with the NFA at this stage I do not know.  Perhaps Deputy L'Estrange knows more than I do.  When dealing with the cattle trade, the marts and the fairs, I am not dealing with the NFA; I am dealing with farmers in a very broad spectrum throughout the country.  Holding up on their sales and hindering them in any way is not something I would wish to do, and is certainly not something I would do merely to have a swipe at the NFA, or even at Deputy L'Estrange.  I would hope I am slightly more mature than that.  I just want to put it on the record that Deputy L'Estrange is not only talking through his hat but is talking out of turn and out of tune with the other Member who spoke from his own benches a few minutes before.  He was not here to listen to Deputy Esmonde and probably does <Col N="2195" /> not realise how contradictory he was in his speech in relation to what Deputy Esmonde said.</P>
    <P>To Deputy Tully, speaking for his Party, I wish to record my appreciation of his indication that his Party were behind the Government and the Department in anything we had to do and that they felt we were the best judges of the situation.  They were taking the view which is that shared by 99.9 per cent of the people regardless of their politics.</P>
    <P>In so far as the rest of the debate was concerned, there was nothing useful said here today, nothing that could really be of any value to me.  I was hoping that on this very large Supplementary Estimate, there would have been a variety of useful and reasoned contributions, either as constructive criticism or as suggestions which would be of use in the future. Certain information was requested. Brucellosis was mentioned, and for the information of the House the eradication of brucellosis is proceeding satisfactorily.  County Donegal will be declared brucellosis-free at a very early date.  Indeed, it would have been declared free but for the fact that the foot and mouth outbreak interfered with our testing, and, therefore, it did take a number of months.  The second round of testing in Donegal is practically finished and, as I say, in a very short time we will be declaring the area brucellosis-free.  In Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Leitrim the second round of testing is starting tomorrow, 1st March.  In Roscommon it is intended to commence testing later in the year.  In regard to BTE, there has been some breakdown so far as the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is concerned, and there is a special team investigating these breakdowns that have occurred to try to ensure that they do not occur in the future.</P>
    <P>The mountain lamb scheme was given scant praise and slight criticism, and was talked about with little knowledge of what is involved in the scheme.  One criticism was made by Deputy Clinton which could not have been correct, complaints he heard when he was in Dingle from hill sheep farmers who complained they had to <Col N="2196" /> take their sheep up to 30 miles to have them passed for this new subsidy.  He might well have been referring to criticisms that could have been made the previous year, because in that year the number of testing centres was not enough for the sales outlets, because the sale was one of the prerequisites for benefit under the scheme in 1966, and the number of centres at which inspections took place were very few. During the past year we set up no fewer than 550 inspection centres in 15 counties.  If it could be that people were 30 miles from any of these centres in such a prominently mountain sheep county as Kerry, then we would certainly need to look at the situation again.  However, I should think that in Dingle, in mountain country where there is a big sheep population, the adequacy of centres, certainly from a distance point of view, should not have been a real problem.  Lest we have in some peculiar way slipped up there, we will see to it that it will not happen again.  But the real point about this new scheme is that it is less restrictive than was the scheme last year.  It applied to all lambs of the mountain and Cheviot breeds, and the good quality that was presented and the fact that we paid out so much more money over and above what we paid out last year is a fairly true indication of the manner in which it took on as against the wether and hogget ewe scheme of the previous year.</P>
    <P>The accredited pigs scheme was discussed. This scheme was introduced in 1960 and its purpose was to combine and accelerate the effectiveness of the litter progeny testing.  The number of participants in 1964 was 155, but this had declined to 90.  There was a decline in the activity in the pig industry, and nowhere was this more noticeable than in the accredited pig scheme.  We have discussed the problem of the decline not only in pigs generally but in the accredited pig herds scheme, and proposals for the payment of financial inducements to encourage participation in the scheme are being further discussed with the very important Department of Finance without whom none of us in any Department can do any <Col N="2197" /> really effective work if it is going to cost any few shillings at all.</P>
    <P>The warble fly scheme was talked about in many ways but the nigger in the woodpile was Deputy L'Estrange. He had nothing but criticism to make of the Department and the Minister. He took the credit from where it belonged and, of course, gave it to the NFA.  He criticised us very seriously for making a good job of a scheme he alleges these people started.</P>
    <P>We should also record our appreciation of Deputy L'Estrange who recalled to our minds the part played by the NFA in regard to disinfection at the Border, a claim they do not make themselves.  Apparently, again, nothing was being done or could have been done if they had not started it.  This is an old ramp on the part of the Deputy and it is rather boring as well as tiring to have to listen to him.  Still, he keeps going in the hope that he can cause trouble even where no reason for trouble exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke about fluke. He was critical that we were not doing much about it.  We are.  We are trying to find ways and means of eradicating it as one of the prime loss causers in our herds as of now.  It is our hope that we can follow the eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis and warble fly with the eradication of fluke in our animals. We would hope to get to grips with fluke infestation and eradicate it.  It costs us a great deal each year in losses as well as in deaths of our animals.  It is a well worth-while job.  We have been fully alive to this matter for a considerable time.  A new committee was formed.  It is representative of the Department's research laboratory, the veterinary inspectorate of my Department, the agricultural advisory services, the universities, An Foras Talúntais and the Irish Veterinary Associations.  If Deputy L'Estrange heard that list read out he would say it was composed merely of henchmen of the Minister and could not possibly perform the job.  We shall leave that to him for another day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully wanted information on the Land Project in County Meath.  He wanted to know if we had improved on <Col N="2198" /> the 12 months time-lag between application, inspection, allocation and approval of grants under this scheme. The answer is that we have.  We have brought down the delay from 12 months, on average, to between three and four months.  Were it not for the diversion of some staff to foot and mouth disease duties, we would hope, at this stage, to have it somewhat lower.  It is our intention to try to reduce this time-lag and to make inspection as quickly as possible after initial application not only for County Meath but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are fully alive to the fact that, when a farmer fills up his application and sends it in, he has his mind made up to do a bit of drainage.  Unfortunately, this is usually in the depths of winter or in the very early spring.  He has in mind, a few months beyond that, breaking in a particular field, tilling it, maybe re-grassing it, and so on&mdash; all of which brings a great deal of urgency to his mind in relation to that particular field.  This happens so often that a time-lag of any number of months can mean the difference between his doing the job in the year he intended to do it and utilising his field or the possibility&mdash;if we do not do it that year&mdash;that we may put him off his stride and he may not follow it up the next year.  All of us who are anxious to operate this scheme to the fullest advantage of the agricultural community would wish to reduce the time-lag between the various stages of application, inspection, subsequent allocation of grants, inspection of the work and, finally, payment for the job done by way of grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell spoke about pigs.  He said that we might give him some results of the survey carried out by my Department on the pig fattening stations.  The informations we got on that survey must, of necessity, remain confidential.  That is the basis on which we sought the information.  If we had not sought it on the basis of observing confidence in relation to it, our hopes of getting similar useful information in the future would be very much reduced.</P>
    <P>Suffice it to say, having got the information, done the survey, and taken what lessons we could from what the <Col N="2199" /> survey turned up, we are of the opinion that it highlights a couple of things that may, in themselves, be weak in some of these stations as of now and, indeed, might help us to avoid similar weaknesses in the future.  One is that management is of the most vital importance in all of these large pig-fattening units.</P>
    <P>Anybody with any knowledge of pigs must fully realise and appreciate that&mdash;regardless of any of the other factors&mdash;the man on the spot, responsible for the situation, is a most vital person.  If the right man is not there, nothing else matters because he will not have a successful or a profitable pig-fattening unit.  Top-class management is essential: otherwise it cannot succeed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of co-operative efforts taking shape in different parts of the country, in addition to those that are already there.  The reckoning is that the local capital input, by way of subscribed capital, has been on the low side and, in some cases is far too low. The local input of capital must be much higher in the future.  If only £3,000 or £4,000 is local capital and the rest&mdash;maybe £100,000&mdash;is made up by various loans, it leaves the local members with very little personal commitment. Very often, a great deal of that small local capital will be subscribed by people in business rather than in farming and they will have merely an indirect interest in getting the project going.  They will not participate in any executive management of it.  They have no great knowledge of the business.</P>
    <P>Very small local participation in an effort means that there is no personal identification with it nor is there any feeling among a great number of people that to make a success of it is really obligatory on them.  If it goes well, fair enough.  If not, the attitude is: &ldquo;Why should one fellow more than another step out of line to try to put everything right?&rdquo;  This has happened in some cases and has brought expense and trouble on the heads of those who participated.  We do not regard it as fatal in all cases.</P>
    <P>We would hope that cognisance will be taken of this weakness and that <Col N="2200" /> probably up to one-third of the capital input, ideally, should be subscribed by local co-operative members rather than top-heavy borrowing which has been the pattern in a number of those efforts which we have surveyed to date.  There is, we believe, a future for this type of station, provided we have local participation of quite a considerably higher degree than we have had up to now, that we have an interested and vitally personally concerned group of people as a co-op running it from a committee point of view and that, above all, without fear or favour, the management is top class, first class and no second-rater need apply.  This is obviously what goes to make success in this particular job and we feel, and I have a very strong belief, that there is room for many more of these large central fattening stations in the country.  I would hope that they would avoid the pitfalls some of the earlier ones fell into and that in the future they would help to stabilise the pig industry by providing a ready and guaranteed outlet for the young store pigs coming from the breeders, without whose participation and without whose breeding, of course, we cannot have a pig industry.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as that, and therefore I would like to say that I regard large central pig-fattening stations as a very important factor in the future of the industry.  This is not to say, and should not be taken as indicating, that we are putting the private producer of small dimension out of the pig industry.  I do not think this is so; rather do I feel that the two require strengthening, that we should have more private feeders even down to quite a small scale but side by side with the private feeder, we should have a central fattening capacity of about 50 per cent of the total that are fattened, the other 50 per cent being fattened by the various small men who breed their own and feed them right through.  However, this is a matter which is being dealt with in our full consideration of the whole pig and bacon problem and about which we hope to be saying something more in the not too-distant future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde talked about grain prices, the price of wheat and the price <Col N="2201" /> of barley.  His main plea was that our wheat prices and our barley prices should have been increased.  As Minister for Agriculture, I certainly would feel very happy in doing the popular thing of inceasing the price of wheat and barley.  Nothing would be dearer to the heart of any Minister for Agriculture than to be able to walk in here and say: &ldquo;Prices are up by 5/- or 10/- a barrel.&rdquo;  The realistic situation, however, is that the price of wheat in this country is more or less in line with the price in that much sought-after community, the EEC.  We hear elements talking about how much more they are getting for other agricultural commodities there but here is one commodity for which we at this present time and for the past couple of years have been enjoying a price at as high a level as the Common Market members are obtaining.</P>
    <P>So far as our barley is concerned, we have been told by Deputy L'Estrange, and others who have the same sort of mentality, that the price was higher in 1948.  This is a long story.  It is a long time back and I am not, on this Supplementary Estimate, going to tell that story.  I think the main point is that we have come a long way in the growing of barley since 1948.  We have immensely improved our production, our yields per acre, our quality and our varieties.  We have learned a great deal in that time and our farmers are doing a very useful and efficient job in the production of barley today as against what was capable of being done in those days to which Deputy L'Estrange would hark back.</P>
    <P>In so far as the price of today is concerned, if one were to ask: &ldquo;Is it not justifiable that this price should go up as against last year's price?&rdquo;  One can point to the fact in regard to both wheat and barley, that the yield out-turn last year in both of these crops was certainly well above the normal average and that there is no reason why, given reasonable weather and a reasonable season, this high yield out-turn should not occur this year, and indeed why it should not be further improved.  This being so, then, we take <Col N="2202" /> a look at the situation and ask ourselves in all fairness does the price of barley require to be put up; does it require an added boost by way of support price to get it grown in the same quantities next year?</P>
    <P>Our belief is that it does not, and if that were not sufficient in itself, we have the undoubted related problem that arises that as you put the price of barley up, or indeed the price of wheat you also directly affect the cost impact of the feed that goes into the much talked about pig and this creates its own problem and ultimately must be paid for by increased Exchequer subsidy through the export of our bacon to Britain, on the one hand, about 50 per cent of our production, and on the other hand, increased prices to the consumer on the market which includes of course most of our farmers as well.</P>
    <P>Therefore we just cannot take it in isolation and say: &ldquo;Wages may have gone up; rates may have gone up; electricity may have gone up; and therefore the barley should go up,&rdquo; if the barley out-turn per acre is going up corresponding or greater in its return at present prices than is the added increased cost and having regard to the other repercussions that an increase in the price of barley would have.  These are the circumstances in which I have not been able this year to do as my predecessors have done, to come along and say: &ldquo;The price of barley is rising again.&rdquo;  It is not, but we still feel, and we hope, that the farmer will get more out of his barley during 1968 than he did in 1967.</P>
    <P>The interim agreement mentioned by our friend in Paris not so long ago with the EEC would be simplified by Deputy Esmonde into an interim arrangement; it would be in his estimation a trade agreement.  If only we had the President of France and Deputy Esmonde together for five minutes, it is quite possible that all the problems of the EEC and all its difficulties could be wiped away.  He has that belief. Unfortunately I have not.  I think it is a much more difficult situation, much as I would like to agree with Deputy Esmonde.  It would be a grand thing to know that all I have to do is go to Paris and stay there until I got a deal. <Col N="2203" /> Much as I might like a few days in Paris, if such a deal were to be presented to me, I would much prefer that Deputy Esmonde would take it and stay in Paris until such a deal were finalised because it would be too long for me to wait.  I would much prefer to be at home.  This, in my estimation, is a serious proposition. The best minds in this country and in the adjoining country and in other countries have been examining this situation of an interim arrangement with the EEC as pronounced by the President of France when our Taoiseach visited him.  It is still being debated as to what exactly this was about and Deputy Esmonde's interpretation of it, while it would be very popular, I do not think can be taken too seriously at this stage.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Clinton moving on to fertilisers.  He wanted to complain that fertiliser prices had gone up and that this was an increase in cost and he asked was that increase to apply in full to the farmers.  So far as I am aware, and I take it that my knowledge at this stage is good enough for Deputy Clinton as he asked the question of me, the increase applies in full.  It is not being abated in any way by a Government subvention beyond that which we are already paying on phosphates and potash and insofar as it takes place it will be paid by the farming community on the fertilisers they have got to purchase.  We feel in this regard that this increase is due largely to the effects of devaluation, that it was unavoidable and that its impact will not be of such a nature as will in any way reduce the import of fertilisers by our farmers during this current year. Indeed, far from it.</P>
    <P>We hope that the rising trend, which was apparent last year, will continue right through this year because indications in the first few months are that we are spreading fertilisers as much as before.  This will have the effect of displaying to our farmers as a whole that fertilisers, even though the price has increased, are still the cheapest commodity they can buy because so sure as they buy and utilise them, every £ spent on them, without making a plug for the fertiliser manufacturers, as they <Col N="2204" /> say, will bring back three.  I would say from experience that every £ spent would bring back two.  This is one of the greatest things in farming.  They get a very good return for every £ spent.  Therefore, I would advocate farmers to keep in mind the worth of fertilisers which they have found over the years and which greater numbers are finding out in the last few months, and to continue to spread fertilisers to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Clinton who talked about the effect of the stoppage of the importation of beef from the Argentine.  This is a matter over which we have no control, for, as I mentioned very briefly in passing in my introductory speech, insofar as we could make our views known to the British, who are the deciding factor in this matter, we have already done so in very definite terms, that until we know and are sure that they have taken steps to ensure that the foot and mouth disease, and any other disease, is not being brought in by this beef, it should be kept out and restricted in a very severe way.  As I say, we have made this known to the British Ministry and for what it counts, the position will be that they are under no illusions about what we feel about this and we are under no illusions that, apart from the disease, we would not be in the gold rush if the Argentinian meat were wiped out from the British market altogether.</P>
    <P>Imports from the Argentine to Britain last year were 118,000 tons of beef, which is roughly equivalent to 475,000 head of cattle.  This is a surprisingly low figure to those who may have thought that if only the Argentinian beef were kept out of Britain, we could regard the importation of our cattle in there as being equivalent to gold dust.  This is not so. Those are the figures for 1967.  This is not to be compared with the total importation into Britain, and even if the Argentinian beef were re-introduced into Britain, it would not knock us in any way, in my estimation. If it were, there might be a harder type of market, but we had to live with that in the past and I am sure we can continue to live with it, if we have to, in the future.  The only reason we <Col N="2205" /> would be against the importation of Argentinian meat into Britain is if it is proved it was a source of danger in regard to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  If it is not, then it is Britain's decision whether she brings in such meat or not.  So long as she continues to take our cattle at reasonably good prices, we do not mind where else she shops.</P>
    <P>There was then another suggestion which sounded so simple that one could almost believe it, that is, in regard to exporting cattle to the EEC countries, even against the present levies and duties.  I think it was Deputy Esmonde, again, who remarked that the price was £12 a cwt in the EEC and if you could buy here at £7 and get £12 there for a 12 cwt bullock, you would pay £84 here and get £144 there, and why could we not do it.  The facts are that you are not sure that you will get £12 in the EEC.  At this particular time, I would love to see anybody get £12, £9 or £8 a cwt in this market. You would have to add on a duty of £40, which is something Deputy Esmonde forgot about.  You would add the £40 to the £84 and 16 per cent duty, which goes on top of that, and there are also freight costs and certain veterinary costs, and naturally some profit for the man who is going to risk all this to shift his cattle there.  The fact is that you would not get this money there.  You could buy animals here under £9 but you are not sure you will get £12 a cwt there.  You have to pay the £40 duty, plus the 16 per cent, and if you drop below the 12 cwt, which you would have to do, because the general <Col N="2206" /> run of our animals here are not that weight, then you would be in real trouble.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Esmonde that if he went over there with cattle, he would probably stay in Paris, under the bridges maybe, and he would have sufficient time to work out a deal with General de Gaulle while he was there, but there is no use codding the people that there is something to be held out for them there.  Until some new arrangement is worked out and a very severe reduction in the levy of duties takes place and the member countries in the EEC are more interested in getting our cattle than they are at the moment, it is only a messing job.</P>
