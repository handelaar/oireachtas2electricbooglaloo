      <P>Apart from the question of the timing of our accession to the European Economic Community, it is the Government's policy to encourage and facilitate as far as possible the diversification of export outlets.  I can assure the Deputy that all opportunities for extending our trading relations continue to be intensively pursued.  I might mention that preparations for the negotiation of a trade agreement with Japan are under way and consideration is being given to the possibility of concluding trade agreements with some of the countries of Eastern Europe.</P>

These coins will have the same technical specifications and values as the present shilling and florin and will be used as such until Decimal <Col N="1633" /> Day, the 15th February, 1971.  Similarly, if it is decided to issue a 50 new pence coin, which would have the value ten shillings, this will be done before Decimal Day.  The other decimal coins to be introduced have not exact equivalents in existing coinage and will not be put into circulation until Decimal Day.</P>

      <P>The profits made by building societies in the course of their operations are chargeable to income tax in the normal way at the rate prescribed by the annual Finance Act.  They are, however, exempted by statute from corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>As regards the amount distributed as interest to investors in building societies all the Irish societies have voluntarily entered into an administrative arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners under which income tax in respect of these amounts is paid on a basis which secures that the society will pay income tax on the distributions partly at the standard rate and partly at an agreed composite rate and which is designed to produce the same amount of tax as if there had been no arrangement.</P>
      <P>The information sought in the second part of the question will take some time to be compiled from the records. If the Deputy will repeat the question in a week's time, I hope to have available the figure for which he has asked.</P>

      <P>The increase in the duties on tobacco imposed with effect from 6th November, 1968 added roughly 3½d to the duty content of an ounce of pipe tobacco.  The exact amount of the increase in the duty content would vary above or below that figure for different tobaccos.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my statement on 5th November the Minister for Industry and Commerce had accepted that there was a case for a further increase in price, unconnected with the change in the duties, to cover increased costs incurred by manufacturers as a result of the devaluation of sterling in November, 1967.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that notwithstanding his undertaking in reply to supplementary questions on 13th November a firm (name and address supplied) and its State-sponsored holding company are in direct competition with existing traders and have held meetings of customers all over the country to offer them their wares; and if he will take steps to ensure that such competition will not be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in my reply to the question on 13th November, the firm in question will continue to trade as a separate company offering the same range of services as it has offered in the past. Trading will continue through the established channels and groups of merchants who are established customers have already been assured by the firm that there will be no change in its distribution arrangements.  The intervention of the holding company was to ensure the continuation of the availability in this country, in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices, of certain chemical sprays of importance to the beet industry.  It was never intended that the firm should cease its normal commercial trading solely because it became a subsidiary of a State-sponsored company.  There is no intention that it will engage in any unfair competition throughout the country <Col N="1637" /> and, consequently, I see no justification for limiting its commercial freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that on 13th November he assured me in his reply that this firm would not compete with existing firms and that the take-over by the operating company was merely to guarantee the provision of certain chemicals for beet growers?  The Taoiseach's reply today is in exact contradiction to that of the 13th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy the company would continue the kind of operations they had engaged in and, when he spoke about competition, I answered his question in the context of this new company being a subsidiary of a State company which would not have any commercial advantage over a private company but must continue its present range of operation.  In fact, beet-growing farmers are always asking the Sugar Company to expand its range of services on these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The candidates for interview were selected by the Civil Service Commissioners solely on the basis of the qualifications specified for the position in the published regulations. The information as to their qualifications was, of course, supplied by the candidates themselves, subject to scrutiny subsequently on the part of the Civil Service Comissioners.</P>
      <P>Without knowing what candidates the Deputy has in mind, I cannot deal more fully with the matter but, in the light of what I have said, I cannot accept the implication of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there would appear to be a case for an examination of the basis of selection in view of the fact that at least one candidate&mdash;an energetic, fully qualified applicant with a B.Comm. degree&mdash;was not considered while, on the other hand, a person without any qualifications was?  Would the Taoiseach agree, in view of that, to hold any appointments until this appointment is examined?  We believe everybody should have a fair chance and that does not appear to be the case in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always proceeded in this House, and rightly so, on the basis that the Civil Service Commissioners are completely objective and operate without any outside interference.  On this occasion they advertised certain posts and they got some hundreds of applications, the applicants themselves setting out the qualifications necessary and other qualifications they thought might improve their prospects.  There was a screening operation, which is not unusual, and the screened candidates were then called for interview.  This procedure was followed meticulously in this case and, of the hundreds of disappointed applicants, I am sure many felt they were better men than those selected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Public service pensioners were granted an increase of five per cent from 1st August last.  The question of giving them further increases will be considered in conjunction with other matters appropriate to the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Post Retirement Increases in Public Service Pensions recommended that public service pensions be increased in future to offset increases in the cost-of-living subject to the increases being granted only when a general pay increase was being granted to serving personnel and to their not exceeding the amount of the general pay increase.  The recommendation was also subject in the case of contributory schemes, to the cost of increases being met, if necessary, by appropriately increasing existing rates of contribution from both employers and employees and, in the case of noncontributory schemes, by basing future pension awards on pay averaged over the last three years of service.</P>

      <P>The main gate leading to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park was closed on 13th May, 1968.</P>
      <P>This action was taken following the unauthorised removal of a sign post which had been erected at the main gate to inform tourists and the public generally that there is a motor car entrance to Muckross House and gardens further along the road.  Interference with facilities provided for the general public could not be condoned.</P>
      <P>The gate has been open since Wednesday, 27th November, 1968.  The sign has been in position, on park property, since Thursday, 28th November, 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of erecting the signs was to inform the public in general of the existence of a new approach to Muckross House and gardens.  It must be plain enough that the State has spent a great deal of money preparing this new approach to the house and gardens to make it available not only to the people who patronise side-cars and jarveys but also to people who wish to drive down there.  The purpose of the signs was to inform the public of this facility.

      <P>Evidently I have not got it across that the signs were erected in order to inform the public of the existence of a facility made available by the State.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the chartering by a committee of Cork citizens of the <i>s.s. Avalon</i> from British Railways for one round passenger voyage from Fishguard to Cork on the 23rd December, returning to Fishguard on 25th December.  It is open to anyone to operate shipping services to or from our ports and, accordingly, such services are a matter solely for the commercial interests concerned.  I understand, however, that the <i>s.s. Avalon</i> was not employed on the regular Fishguard-Rosslare service and that the arrangement mentioned will not affect the normal passenger services to Rosslare.</P>

      <P>No.  It is not something that would come within my functions.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he can give any information as to whether it is the intention of his Department to extend or abolish the present restricted 15-mile radius of non-licensed hauliers in the Republic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Under the Road Transport Acts the areas within a 15mile radius of the GPO, Dublin and the principal post office at Cork and within a 10-mile radius of the principal post offices at Waterford, Limerick and Galway are exempt from the restrictions on carriage of merchandise for reward.  There is no provision in existing legislation under which these areas could be altered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for the recent increase in rates and fares by CIE arises from increases in costs of labour and materials which would not be affected by organisational changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, does the Minister not agree that CIE is badly in need of reorganisation so that there could be some more streamlining and co-ordination in that company in view of the increase in demands on the public by way of increased fares and the need for subsidy by the public?  Does he not agree something should be done to try to bring this company more up to date and avoid any waste or loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the Deputy has not read the numerous statements I have made and CIE have made about organisational changes that have taken place in the last five years and in the previous five years and of the economies and increase in productivity of the service.  If the Deputy was to read the Pacemaker Report, 1963, which gives a detailed picture of the working of CIE and of its economic sections and uneconomic sections, he will find very useful information in that.  There may have been minor changes since that time in the problem of public transport but basically that Report still holds good as a basis for examination as to whether any major organisational changes would be fruitful.  If the Deputy would read that Report and the statement by the General Manager of CIE on the reasons for the increase in the charges, I think he would agree with me that no organisational <Col N="1656" /> changes would affect the position of CIE in that the railways cause the major deficit.  All railways in Europe are now losing money and the loss on CIE is not due, so far as I know, to any lack of measures of economy or reorganisation.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, there is a joint consultative organisation in CIE in which management and staff engage in discussion. The discussions include talks on minor grievances on the part of staff.  They also include proposals for the more economic working of CIE.  If the Deputy were to read the reports of these discussions he would find there one of the finest examples of communication between staff and management in order that the staff can give the management of CIE the benefit of their advice.  The discussions between staff and management take place all over the country at regular intervals and are an excellent example to private industry.</P>

The level of such compensation, which is based on length of service subject to a maximum of two-thirds retiring pay, is very generous and is not to my knowledge equalled in any other country.  I do not propose to introduce amending legislation to provide for an increase in the rate of compensation.</P>

      <P>Proposals to amend the CIE wages grade pension schemes were submitted to me at the end of February, 1968, in accordance with section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950. The proposals relate to an amendment of the interim scheme at present in operation for post-April 1963 pensioners, so as to provide higher pension rates for (a) male employees retiring on pay of (i) exceeding £14 15s 0d and not exceeding £15 15s 0d per week and (ii) exceeding £15 15s 0d per week, and (b) female employees whose retiring pay exceeds £7 per week.</P>
      <P>I have had the proposals under consideration, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, and I hope to finalise the matter as soon as possible but I cannot say now when I will be able to make the necessary Order.</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board submitted to me on 5th August, 1966, <Col N="1659" /> a scheme amending the Manual Workers' Superannuation Scheme, 1943.  In accordance with the terms of section 5 of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, I found, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, that the scheme, as submitted could not be confirmed until certain modifications had been made therein.  Further consultations on the matter took place with the ESB and the Minister for Finance and the ESB submitted revised amending schemes on 3rd October, 1967, and on 7th March, 1968.</P>
      <P>It transpires that it will be necessary to amend the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, to give effect to a proposal in the amending scheme that a manual worker may reckon for pension purposes one half of his service before entry to the scheme.  I hope to introduce the necessary amending legislation very shortly.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, informed the ESB that I will raise no objection to the board implementing with effect from 12th December, 1967, the terms of the proposed amending scheme on an interim basis pending the enactment of the necessary legislation and introduction of a scheme confirming these arrangements. The main benefit under the new scheme is that an employee with full service can now get a pension equivalent to half his annual wage in the 12 months preceding retirement together with a lump sum retirement benefit equivalent to one year's wages.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the amending legislation will also provide for improvements in the benefits of those members of the board's staff who were not eligible for supplementary allowances by reason of the fact that they were under 40 years of age on the date of passing of the 1942 Act.</P>

      <P>This year approximately 320,000 tons, dried, were purchased at the full millable wheat price.</P>

      <P>Is it the Minister's idea to get the farmers to grow less wheat next year than last year?  If so, would he not have thought a quota system would have been better? Thirdly, had he any discussions with any farmers' organisations before he announced this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to the levy goes back to 1958.  The Act of that year, the Cereals Act, made and provided for the application of a levy.  It was not done without due consideration and in fact the representatives <Col N="1665" /> of the wheat growers agreed to it&mdash;I would almost say they proposed that a levy in principle should be applied&mdash;and all I am doing, as recently announced, is giving effect to that which was then agreed.  The power is given in that Act and what I have announced is merely making it work, no more and no less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, if this cut of three shillings is made, wheat growers will be getting less than they were in 1954?  Will he agree that, if one takes the fall in the value of money into consideration, they should be getting more than £6 10s per barrel?  Will he agree that the farmers are the only section of the community whose incomes have not risen, comparatively, with depreciation in the value of money?</P>

      <P>Deputy, your friends agreed and proposed in 1958 that a levy of this nature should be applied. With all due respect to your friends, while they had a good idea in principle, they had not the wit to know that the way they proposed to do it was impossible.  I have now found a way to apply the principle that they then proposed and that is what we are doing, no more and no less.  The wheat farmers of this country are better off at the present time, if they get the same sort of returns as they have been getting this year, than they ever were before.</P>

    <P>With regard to milk for liquid consumption, there are statutory minimum standards of quality, the enforcement of which is a matter for the local authorities concerned.

      <P>Surely, if suppliers' associations themselves are prepared to spend their own money on creating an independent testing organisation and machinery, the Minister should provide a grant towards that?

      <P>An tseachtain seo caite bhí cúpla focail le rá agam ar an Meastachán i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  I would like to stress again, as I did last week, on this Estimate, the grave danger that has been caused to the national language by the bunch of hypocrites that are in this House at the helm who have built up in this country a hatred where there should be <Col N="1680" /> a love for the language.  It is about time we took control from those who are in it for what they can get out of it. We must admit, as I said last week, that no progress has been made in regard to the teaching of Irish.  It may be taught, but it is forgotten.  When going through the streets, the highways and byways outside the Gaeltacht, where can you hear the Irish language spoken?  It is spoken in the Gaeltacht and it was spoken in the Gaeltacht before a lot of that bunch took over the teaching or, as they say themselves, the furtherance of the language.</P>
      <P>I want to warn about the hatred built up against the language the people once loved.  Probably they loved it because it was the thing to do in the British times; but unless something is done to rescue it from the hands of those people who, I repeat, are in it not for love of it but what they can get out of it, it will die.  I would, however, stress that there are sincere enthusiasts.  I see one over there from Clare and I know he is sincere about it.  If we had more of his type we would have more of the language throughout the country.  So much for that.</P>
      <P>We heard about the doings of the Department, the great increases, the explosion as it were, but there would be no need for this explosion if we had not to catch up on the backlog, if we were not so far behind in comparison with other countries.  We need not clap ourselves on the back, because there has been a failure to deal with education as it should have been dealt with over the years.  It was suddenly brought home to us by the late Minister, go ndéanaigh Dia trócaire ar a anam, and we started to get on our feet and to get where we should have been many years ago.  Now there is a need for this explosion.  Is this explosion going to be at the expense of all other services throughout the country? There is a great deal to be done.  When one sees neglected boreens one wonders if the money available should be spent on putting them into proper condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing the money earmarked for this purpose which possibly could be as well spent otherwise.  I am pointing out the backlog that exists.</P>
      <P>Is it possible that free higher education will mean that the market for professional people will be flooded?  What will happen in that case?  I would welcome the development of career guidance so that, so to speak, a square plug will not be put into a round hole.  In that connection, I would stress the importance of vocational education.  Today, in many cases, the technician makes far more money than the professional man.  Will the professions be overmanned whereas the demand is for the technician who can play an important part in the development of the country?  This country may not be a land of saints today but it is possible that we have too many scholars.  I wonder is that a good thing.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the problem of the mentally handicapped child.  Anyone in public life comes across cases of mentally handicapped children almost every day.  Something should be done to meet this problem. There should be a crash programme. When the much maligned Coalition Government came into office the country was riddled with TB.  The Coalition Government took action as a result of which TB was eradicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it to show what can be done.  I realise that the problem of mental handicap cannot be eliminated but, at least, it should be possible to provide for some alleviation of the problem.  I have indicated how the inter-Party Government dealt with the problem of TB.  Something should be done to help families who have a mentally handicapped child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for having a school bus service arises from the closing down of schools.  While centralisation may be all right, there is a danger inherent in dependence on transport. Many of us remember that not so many years ago, during the war, there was not as much oil in the country as <Col N="1682" /> would grease the hinges of a pair of spectacles.  It is possible that a similar situation could occur again and could continue for years.  Please God, that situation will not recur but ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb.</P>
    <P>There is great dissatisfaction about the fact that some school children have to walk to school although a school bus may travel the same route half empty.  It is time that there was a revision of the regulations governing the school bus service.  Certainly, the school bus should not pass children who are walking to school.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the danger to children alighting from a school bus. This is a matter for the Department of Justice but I realise that it would not be feasible to have a member of the Garda controlling every school bus.  I would suggest that the Minister for Education would consult the Minister for Justice with a view to safeguarding children.  For instance, there could be a regulation to the effect that traffic may not pass a school bus that has stopped to allow children to alight.  It should be possible to have a flashing sign on the back of school buses indicating that children are alighting.  We should not wait until tragedies have occurred before taking preventive action.</P>
    <P>Appeals have been made for retrospective payment of grants in the case of university students who had entered college before the introduction of the grants scheme.  If such grants are justifiable in the case of one section, they are equally justifiable in the case of the other section.  Some students have had to work very hard during the vacation in order to earn the money to pay their fees.  In some cases the fact that they had to work overtime affected their health.  Great credit is due to those who did make this effort.  In my view there is a case for the payment of grants retrospectively.  I hope the Minister will not be prejudiced by the fact that students sat outside the gates of Leinster House in order to make their point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was a student himself.  Students are sometimes <Col N="1683" /> condemned for their capers.  There are eminent surgeons in my town whom I could remind of the time when they smashed brass door knockers and threw flour at respectable ladies, and so on.  The students of today are sometimes regarded as being worse than the students of yesterday because they march in the streets and shout and wear beards and long hair.  On the whole, while there may be a few &ldquo;odd men out&rdquo; the students in this country are a good type.  They should not be condemned because a few of them shout and may appear on television as a result of their escapades.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider the question of providing some form of assistance to those students who were already attending college before the commencement date of the scheme of university grants.  I stress this matter because I know what it is to have children attending college, the cost of clothes, the cost of living generally.  I am lucky to be in a city within a stone's throw of a college, but what about the unfortunate man who struggled hard and said: &ldquo;I will not have my child struggle as I did.  I will try to put him through college&rdquo;? There is a lot of hardship involved, and the Minister should reconsider this, especially for the western areas.  Money is not all that flush there as it would be in the other areas.  Even if it means some sort of test&mdash;I dislike the phrase &ldquo;means test&rdquo;&mdash;I put it to the Minister that the case is there for the student who is already going through college. I have been asked by these students to put their case.  I see their point and that is why I have put it here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the school, one would like to see more of the cultural side of Irish life having its place in the curriculum.  I have in mind the question of céilí dancing.  It is disgusting to go into a dancehall today and see a céilí dance being murdered.  There is nothing nicer or more enjoyable that foreigners or tourists coming here would like to see than céilí dancing. Before it is wiped out completely, like the Irish language, something should be done to foster it among our youth. I suppose the capering that the present generation indulge in is a passing <Col N="1684" /> phase, but many of us can look back on properly done céilí dancing.  I suggest the Department should encourage this by having it taught in our schools. I should also like to see physical culture in our schools.  One may say the curriculum is overloaded, but if we have not healthy bodies we shall not have healthy minds, and there is a great need for that today.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister, before it is too late, before it is buried completely by those who only want to commemorate it, to take the Irish language out of the hands of those at present in charge of it; to try to create a love for the language and eliminate the hatred there is for it today.  I appeal to the Minister to do all he can before the hypocrites bury it once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening my contribution on this debate I should like to recall to the minds of my fellow Deputies the Estimate debate we had here in this House two years ago.  Two years ago our debate on the Estimate for Education followed upon a long period of discussion, a series of symposiums, seminars, teach-ins, and what have you, the subject of which was invariably education.  At that time education was brought into perspective.  We realised at that time the basic cause of all our ills as a nation was the lack of attention we had been giving, up to then, to this subject.  We realised that our future, economically and socially, depended upon it, that instead of doing what we had been doing up to then&mdash; dividing most of the money among other Departments and forgetting about education&mdash;we should make education a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From this discussion and this new light which was thrown on the subject of education, there emerged a few basic truths, and while they have been mentioned often enough, it is perhaps no harm to repeat them very briefly. There was, first of all, a realisation that the social and geographical inequalities in education had reached frightening proportions.  Secondly, there came to light the fact that participation in education at the second level, at post-primary level, existed to four or five times a greater extent among one section of the community than it did <Col N="1685" /> among another, and that participation in higher education was 68 times greater among one section of the community than among another.  There also came to light the fact that by 1970 there would be a deficiency of 70,000 in the number of people with the necessary qualifications for industry, that is, at the junior certificate level.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, was the picture in 1966, and the Minister in introducing his Estimate at that time announced some proposals, and I would say without hesitation they were the first ambitious proposals of any kind that were introduced in this field since we attained freedom.  These proposals were: that fees for the purpose of post-primary education would be abolished, that is, in all schools that would opt for the scheme; that free school books would be introduced for 25 per cent of our people; and that free transport would be provided. While this scheme had its faults, it was definitely a step in the right direction. The case I want to make after two years is that these faults and the omissions which we pinpointed in that scheme still exist to a very large extent.</P>
    <P>In this regard, we spoke, in the first instance, about the lack of emphasis on primary education; we spoke about the failure of the scheme to make post-primary, that is, vocational or secondary education, possible for the really needy sections of our community; and we spoke about the means test for books which we considered invidious because it involved a division among the various social classes at the level of children and at the level of the classroom.  We were told that the number of comprehensive schools would be few and that a dovetailing of the facilities that existed already in secondary and vocational schools would substitute for comprehensive schools.  We talked about the vital necessity of career guidance at an earlier stage.  We also talked about the lack of emphasis on adult education.</P>
    <P>These deficiencies still exist.  At the primary level, I fully appreciate that this is something that has been actively considered and is something we all <Col N="1686" /> hope will reveal far-reaching changes in the very near future.  At this point in time there has been no change. Although money has been expended&mdash; I do not want to be unreasonable&mdash;we still have far too many structurally unsound and sanitarily unfit schools throughout the country.  It is rather frustrating for those acting on behalf of school managers or parents to experience the long delays that occur and the frustration encountered in getting accurate information in regard to carrying out repairs necessary to bring a school building up to a desirable standard to house young children for several hours daily.  Criticism is often made of school managers and no doubt is sometimes merited but, as I have said before, the Department is mainly and ultimately responsible for the condition of our primary schools.  We compare very badly with other countries where very little State aid is given to schools but where State institutions exercise more care in that an inspector or engineer inspects the school regularly and insists on proper standards. We do not seem to have anybody employed for that purpose.  That is why I say that in the last analysis the Department, and only the Department, is responsible and open to any criticism we may offer on that score.</P>
    <P>There is an almost total lack of visual and audio aids and of facilities considered necessary in 1968 and vital in helping a teacher to impart information to young people.  I admire teachers who are undertaking the difficult task of trying to do what I suppose the national school is designed to do in the first analysis, foster a love of learning in young people and feed their imaginative minds.  That must be very difficult in unfit surroundings.  Yet I know that, for the most part, that is what the teachers are doing.  There is a very small minority who are a hindrance and who still insist on the use of corporal punishment.  I am opposed to corporal punishment and totally opposed to corporal punishment for failure at lessons.  Only one or two cases have come to my notice but the Department has a function to ensure that this hindrance to fostering a love of learning and framing young minds to receive further education at second <Col N="1687" /> and third levels is eliminated.  I feel sure that the few who leave school associating school with something unpleasant cannot make the fullest progress possible at subsequent levels of education.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Coogan that there is a complete lack of physical education at all levels, including the national school level.  Everything indicates that this is a subject of major importance and will assume greater importance as we progress materially. Physical education is vitally important to health, especially in the cities and towns, and at present when people take less exercise through necessity than they did formerly the need for physical exercise and culture is very great from infancy to the completion of education and all through life.  There is also a very deficient school medical and dental service.  There are reasons for this and those of us who are members of health authorities have considered the matter at meeting after meeting. There is a shortage of dentists but there is no shortage of dentists graduating from our colleges each year.  The health of schoolchildren is tied up with the question of a good school health service and this is something that should be tackled far more intensively than is being done.</P>
    <P>In Cork, which I do not think is very different from other health authorities, we attacked the problem from all angles.  We tried to have a voluntary service in which parents brought their children to the clinics.  We then reverted to the school service and we found that with the shortage of dentists only children under ten years of age could be treated.  This is sadly deficient because dental health becomes of major importance after age ten when the final teeth are formed and when dental decay may appear.  We must take steps to cope with this problem properly because without a healthy body a child cannot meet fully the challenge of imbibing knowledge and education.  The Department of Education cannot afford to overlook this problem in which it should be deeply involved and it should maintain liaison with the Department of Health to ensure <Col N="1688" /> that the health of the children we are trying to educate is safeguarded. Unless a child is healthy it cannot benefit fully from the educational facilities provided.</P>
    <P>We still have the problem, though to a lesser extent as some progress has probably been made, of overcrowded classrooms.  I shall be saying a little more about pupils and teacher training later on and I know this is a problem the Minister has in mind.  I hope it is one that will be solved in the very near future.  Whatever may be done in the field of primary education cannot be fully effective unless classes are drastically reduced.  We have an ideal which still seems very far from reality of having special classes for retarded or subnormal children, those who because of a mental handicap are incapable of assimilating knowledge as well as normal children and have tended to be left behind up to now.  We do not seem to have done very much to bring them up to the level of the brighter pupils.  I know that something is being done and that individual teaching orders in some cases have provided special classes for these children, but tied up with this is the problem of speech therapy.  I was very surprised recently to learn from the Press that speech therapists cannot be trained in this country and they have to go to England to complete their training.  Elocution is a very important subject at all levels of education. Perhaps we have tended to regard it as the acquisition of an accent but, of course, it is not that.  It is very important for the fostering of confidence.</P>
    <P>So far, we have not recognised the need for elocution teachers.  Indeed, the system obtains whereby, if a school employs an elocution teacher, it does so at its own expense.  Very often we find that it is in the fee-paying schools that this service is provided but, of course, the service is just as necessary in non-fee-paying schools.  I believe that an amount of money, by way of increment perhaps, should be given to teachers of elocution at any level of education.</P>
    <P>On previous Estimates I have spoken on the Irish language and I do not <Col N="1689" /> wish to repeat what I have already said.  However, I should like to say that most of us in this country wish to see a situation whereby boys and girls leaving school could speak the Irish language fluently&mdash;that they would be able to speak it because they have a love of the language.  I am glad to see that there is a vast improvement in the methods of teaching Irish.  I notice, for instance, that reading is not introduced in the infants classes but, rather, it is introduced later on.  The children are taught, first of all, to understand the language, then to speak it and afterwards to read it, in that progressive order.  This was not so in the case of ourselves and those who followed us.</P>
    <P>However, we still have a long way to go towards making our national language more attractive.  This is something that we should apply ourselves to constantly.  It has a lot to compete with in a world which, shall we say, is growing steadily smaller but it is very vital that we retain our national culture, that we teach our national language and make it more attractive and that we make our books more attractive.  We should ensure that every step that can be taken is taken to teach the Irish language to our boys and girls.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provision of a library service in our national schools it is felt that this is at least one way of making up to children who were deprived of culture through no fault of their own.  We should apply ourselves to the improvement of the library service in our schools because we now have so many children at all levels of education who, through no fault of their own or of their parents, were deprived of culture in the home.  This, as I have said, may be through no fault of the parents who, themselves, because of economic circumstances did not have a complete education either socially or culturally.  I hope that the scheme which is at present in operation will prove to be entirely successful.  I hope, too, that the scheme to combat certain set-backs that children suffer from will also be successful.  I also hope that, as the schemes progress and some benefit is seen to accrue from them, they will be expanded and that everything <Col N="1690" /> possible will be done to improve the schemes without any unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the faults at the second level of education and I also referred to the need for career guidance. I have not changed my mind on these matters.  Career guidance is very important, particularly at the stage where a child leaves the primary school.  We have these facilities in our secondary and vocational schools but, of course, what happens in practice is that a child chooses either vocational or secondary education and he continues in whichever one he chooses, the parents having no way of knowing when he is leaving the primary school which system is the most suitable for him.  Career guidance is vital, particularly in the case of boys, a large number of whom leave school every year with a pass leaving certificate or, perhaps, with two or three honours in their leaving certificate; but, in fact, they are fitted for nothing in particular.</P>
    <P>We all go along with the idea of liberal education and we believe that education should be liberal in so far as is possible, but a pass leaving certificate or a leaving certificate with two or three honours does not qualify a boy for a university grant; in fact, it qualifies him for nothing.  This is poor compensation for the average boy.  Somewhere along the line he should have had career guidance.  So far, we do not seem to have any real appreciation of the need for such guidance.  Surely, if it is necessary in our comprehensive schools where there is a vast variety of subjects, it must be necessary for the child who is either at secondary or vocational schools.  Therefore, we might introduce it at second level.  The Minister may say that it is introduced at intermediate level but I believe that major upheavals could be avoided if it were introduced at the earlier stages.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, at this stage, I might be forgiven for asking a question.  I regret that I was unable to be here during the early stages of this debate, but I should like to ask a few questions about the new colleges of technology.  There appears to be confusion in the minds of most people as to the definition of a technical college and a college of technology. <Col N="1691" /> This was raised on the Estimate last year and the former Minister for Education, the late Deputy Donagh O'Malley, defined a technical college briefly as a place catering for second level education for pupils who had got the group or intermediate certificates and he defined a college of technology as one catering for third level education. However, it would appear that the present colleges of technology are defined as colleges catering for both second and third level education.</P>

      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister about something which concerns Vocational Education Committees and CEOs generally. What is the future of vocational schools?  We got the impression earlier on when this was announced, when the very welcome move was made towards the provision of the intermediate certificate courses in vocational schools, that all vocational schools would provide courses up to the leaving certificate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In large centres we have a situation where vocational schools will all go to the leaving certificate, particularly those which will specialise in what will be called the applied sciences leaving group.  In the smaller centres they will go as far as the intermediate certificate and, where we can, we will co-ordinate the two vocational schemes and give a comprehensive scheme in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having discussions on that at the present time throughout the country with a view to a comprehensive sort of approach, taking the whole country into account, providing for the junior and senior level and second level of education and co-ordinating that type, the two branches of post-primary, with the regional technical colleges.  Discussions are in progress at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something I was not clear about.  The future of the vocational schools seems to be hanging in the balance at the moment.</P>
      <P>I also said earlier that second level education was not making education available for the really needy section of our community in 1966 and precisely the same circumstances remain in 1968.  I would remind the present Minister, who has the problem of implementing this, of what his predecessor said in 1966 when introducing the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Education.  I would refer the Minister to Volume 225 of 30th November, 1966, column 1890, where the then Minister said:</P>
      <P>In the lower income group there will also be a number of pupils whose particular family circumstances will be such that even with the provision of free tuition and free books the keeping of them at school will still be a hardship on their parents.  When my scheme is in operation and I have had an opportunity to assess the extent of this problem, I shall have to see what special provision for such cases should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I appeal to the present Minister to pay particular attention in the <Col N="1693" /> immediate future to that matter.  I should like once again&mdash;and I have said this so often that I am tired talking about it&mdash;to draw the Minister's attention to the children of social welfare recipients.  I have in mind particularly children of widows who receive an allowance for their children until they reach the age of 16 years and who, regardless of the fact that these children would be continuing in full-time education, have this allowance, this element of their social welfare payments, withdrawn when the child reaches the age of 16.  This is contrary to all modern thinking.</P>
    <P>A child who has gone past the age of 16 and who may need further education should be treated as a dependant. While this is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, I would appeal to the Minister for Education to impress on his colleague the need for continuing this particular payment for a child up to the age of 16.  It seems ridiculous at this particular time, when we are trying to make education available to the more needy section of our community, that the neediest section of all are penalised financially for educating their children after the age of 16.  These particular people, our social welfare recipients, are our lowest paid income groups.  People who are trying to cope with the present spiral of living costs, trying to maintain large families on £8, £9, £10, £11 or £12 a week must find it extremely difficult to make ends meet.  They find it vitally necessary to send their children into some form of employment when they reach the age of 14 or 15.  Children of such parents who do not continue at full-time education courses are deprived of this education.  This is certainly a matter of finance and economics.  The Minister's predecessor promised that when this scheme was in operation he would look into this aspect of it.  Even at the time of the initiation of free post-primary education this need was seen and I would appeal to the Minister, if he is not already doing so, to address himself now to the payment of grants, or the giving of incentives of some kind, to the children of such parents who may continue in secondary education. Until this is done we cannot say <Col N="1694" /> that secondary education is freely available to the needy section of our community.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about another defect. This is the means test introduced for the issue of free books.  This test should never have been introduced.  A lot of money would not be involved in having these books made available to all children in the non-fee-paying schools. As an example of what headmasters or headmistresses of these schools have to face up to, I should like to instance one of the many schools involved.  I have a school in mind which caters, by and large, for children in the lower income bracket.  The principal of that school at the beginning of the school year 1968-1969 started a scheme.  She decided to ascertain the need in a big built-up area for free books by placing a box somewhere in the hallway at the entrance to the classrooms, in which box the pupils would place the notes from their parents commenting on their needs for free books.  As a result of this box being placed there for a week she received something like 173 requests from parents.  I am not suggesting that all those requests were genuine but she had no way of knowing that they were. In September of this year the Department issued to this school a grant, and I have been told to say this by the principal involved because it highlights the problem that exists, of £124.  On the basis of the cases made by the parents of the pupils involved this teacher reduced the number of pupils needing free education to the absolutely needy.  She needed £264 12s 6d to make free books available for the 44 who most needed them but she had 173 applications.  She had no way of making absolutely certain and of satisfying her conscience that the remainder of the applicants were not as deserving as those who got free books.  Certainly, she felt this was a terrible problem.  In fact, it was discrimination against the needier sections of the community.  The money arrived about 1st November but there was a time lag of about six weeks between the time children who could afford to pay for them received books and the time the free school books were made available.  That <Col N="1695" /> meant that those awaiting free school books were without the books for about six weeks.</P>
    <P>This type of discrimination must be wiped out.  The 1968-69 circular in relation to free school books mentions, for the purposes of the scheme, that a necessitous pupil is a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, the mother being a widow, and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Mrs. Desmond please let me have the particulars of the case to which she is referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Paragraph 3 of this scheme gives particulars of the amount on average which will be provided for each necessitous pupil for each year of the intermediate certificate course and for each year of the leaving certificate course.  I think this should not apply at all.  I am giving that case particularly because it existed and is now being rectified but it will not fully be rectified until the six-weeks time lag in the provision of free school books is wiped out.  This task should not be inflicted on principal teachers who feel they cannot discharge it to the satisfaction of their conscience.  I appeal to the Minister, among the next steps he will take to improve education, to abolish this means test for free school books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will exist a gap&mdash;it is a gap which it is difficult to close&mdash;between the types of extra-curriculum activities, and so on, in the fee-paying school as against the non-fee-paying school.  I remember making the suggestion, perhaps last year or the year the Minister announced the scheme, that if schools, for no reason other than exclusiveness, wanted to remain outside the scheme they should pay for it and that the payment of capitation grant to those schools should be discontinued.  Often these schools go in for physical culture, speech training, and so on.  These schools often teach subjects which are desirable within the scheme.  It is very difficult to generalise.  The aim should be to bring up the level of schools within the scheme to that which <Col N="1696" /> obtains in the fee-paying schools and, as far as possible, to wipe out the gap that exists at present between the schools where the pupils are paid for and the schools which have opted for the Minister's scheme.</P>
    <P>Most speakers have referred to free school transport.  I do not want to go into detail.  I would just say briefly that, like many schemes, the free school transport scheme has degenerated into a maze of regulations which most parents fail even to begin to understand.  References have been made to the school bus running half empty and passing children who are walking to school.  If a child is not qualified under the regulations to go in the bus then CIE and the driver of the bus are tied by the regulations.  The problem is not easily solved.  If we load up the bus there will still be the problem of children for whom there is no room in the bus.  Like schemes designed to make life easier, whether for children or adults, the fewer the regulations the better.  If we can keep the regulations so that they can be understood then we shall have the goodwill of the people.  When one tries to explain to a parent why his child is not allowed to go on the school bus one feels one is not getting through to the parent because of all the regulations.</P>
    <P>Another matter concerns the driver of the school bus.  This came to my notice at a recent Vocational Education Committee meeting.  A teacher applied to drive the school bus.  Our first reaction was that there might be somebody who really needed that employment but we discovered that it is very much part-time employment and that the wage for the job is about £5 9s 0d per week which would not constitute an adequate wage for a family that would be dependent on it alone.  School transport could be used for many purposes.  Take, for example, physical culture and games.  If these were placed on a firm footing, the school bus might be utilised to an extent that the driver would be employed for 40 or 42 hours per week.  The driving of school buses is an outlet for employment, an outlet which a person needing employment cannot avail of at present because the wages are so <Col N="1697" /> inadequate.  Perhaps some reorganisation of that service might be accomplished with that point in view?</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to teacher training. I should now like to ask the Minister a question.  Perhaps I should do so by way of Parliamentary Question rather than now, across the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister has he any evidence that the standard of those seeking teacher-training this year is any lower than it was last year or the year before that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my worry, too, but the feared attraction has not had the effect anticipated.  In the next university year we hope to have off the ground a basic university type course for teacher-training at all levels&mdash;primary, vocational and secondary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only year then in which this danger might have been anticipated and the Minister is satisfied there has been no lowering of standards this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Other speakers have referred to the extension of university maintenance grants to those already in university.  I understand both sides. I understand the students' case and I understand the difficulty involved for the Minister.  Those already in university have a case when one remembers that they now see students coming in in a slightly better position than they are themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, but I would like to think that the Minister might be able to meet the case of those students who are already in.  There are other problems which students have.  It strikes me greater involvement by students in management, and so on, might be a very good preparation for life.  It would foster a sense of responsibility. There is, of course, student unrest all over the world.  As Deputy Coogan said, some of it may be superfluous, but I was rather alarmed to discover that some recent agitation was designed to prevent a lowering of standards.  The students had a very good case.  If we do not maintain our standards, or even raise them, we will not be able to hold our place.  On the whole the claims made by the students would appear to be reasonable. Voicing their protest at the lowering of standards did result in an improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that money should be expended on research and that the talent and energies of those best equipped to do such research are devoted to that research.  From that point of view, I hope that the outcome, whatever it may be, of the proposed merger will be satisfactory from the point of view of the allocation of faculties.  I should like those in these faculties to be relieved of all this worry and contention at the moment because, if standards are not maintained, we will suffer in comparison with the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, his predecessors and his successors will be judged on the measure of their success and the extent to which education will help to break down the social barriers, plus the extent to which standards are improved or, if possible, raised.  With regard to gearing education to the needs of the future, some attention will have to be paid&mdash;more attention than has been paid &mdash; to adult education.  There is provision for grants but these fall far short of what they should be.  I remember <Col N="1699" /> an OECD survey team which pointed out that it would take 13 years before any upgrading in the level of education was felt in our labour force. The labour force, with an average age of 42 years, is the product of the deficient educational system of 30 years ago and their skills would not be equal to the tasks required of them today, through no fault of their own, of course, and we make the case that these people should be afforded an opportunity of retraining; they should not be penalised because they were the product of an unenlightened system of education 30 years ago.  This is something about which the Department of Education should be just as concerned as the Department of Labour.  The challenge is very great.  Any Minister prepared to meet it will have the goodwill of all and the blessing of future generations.</P>

    <P>Ní dóigh liomsa gur cheart cluanairí a thabhairt ar na daoine a chuireann spéis sa Ghaeilge nó a bhí ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ach táim suite cinnte dhe gur cluanairí iad súd adeireas go bhfuil grá agus gean acu don Ghaeilge agus ná cuireann de dhua ná de strus orthu féin oiread agus focal Gaeilge a labhairt le héinne.</P>
    <P>Anois, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do mholadh nó d'impí nó d'achainí a chualamar ón Aire. D'impigh sé ar Theachtaí Dála gan gríosadh a thabhairt do thuistí a bhíonn ag chur i gcoinne dúnadh na scol mbeag.  I gcead don Aire agus i gcead do lucht an Tigh seo deirim go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar Theachta Dála nuair a chuirtear toscaireacht <Col N="1702" /> chuige agus go n-iarrtar air freastal ar chruinniu na dtuistí ina Dháilcheantar féin gur ceart dó freastal air agus má bhíonn plean réasúnta acu gurbh é a dhualgas cuidiú leo chun a gceart a chosaint.</P>
    <P>Deir Airteagal 42 (3) 1º den Bhunreacht:</P>
    <P>Ní cead don Stát a chur d'fhiachaibh ar thuistibh, in aghaidh a gcoinsiais nó a roghan dhleathaí, a golann do chur ar scolaibh a bunaítear ag an Stát nó ar aon chineál áirithe scoile a ainmnítear ag an Stát.</P>
    <P>Is ag na tuistí amháin atá an cead a rá cá raghaidh a gouid leanaí.  Ní réitím leis an Aire nuair a dheineann sé impí ar mo leithéidse loic ar na daoine a chur anso mé má bhíonn plean réasúnta acu.</P>
    <P>Sul a ndéanfar trácht ar scoil a dhúnadh ba chóir dul i gcomhairle leis na tuistí agus gan a dhéanamh fé mar a thárla fé dhó i gContae an Chláir gur cinneadh idir an bhainisteoir agus an Roinn&mdash;cineál comhcheilge a bhí ann &mdash;scoil bheag a dhúnadh nach mór i ngan fhios do na tuistí.  Do chuireas in aghaidh dúnadh na scoile agus cuirfidh mé in aghaidh dúnadh scoile ar bith dá leithéid.</P>
    <P>Ansan do tháinig cigire.  Do chuaigh sé i gcomhairle leis na tuistí agus nuair do chuala sé glór na dtuistí do chuir sé a thuairisc fé bhráid na Roinne agus do mhol sé gan an scoil a dhúnadh.  Cad do thárla ansan? Tháinig cigire ón Roinn agus do mhol sé go ndúnfaí an scoil agus go ngéillfeadh na tuistí duine ar dhuine.  Cad déarfaí le cigire ón Roinn a raghadh isteach i scoil ar bith agus a labharfadh leis na leanaí boga óga a fhiafróidh díobh: &ldquo;Lámha in árda an méid díobh gur maith leis nó léi dul ar an mbus go dtí a leithéid seo d'áit.&rdquo; Ar son Dé cad a dhéanfadh leanbh ar bith ach an dá lámh a chur in áirde; fiú dá bhfíafraítí díobh ar mhaith leo dul go dtí an ghealaigh déarfainn go n-abróidís gur mhaith leo dul ann. Iarraim ar an Aire agus ar lucht na Roinne féachaint chuige sul a ndéanfar scoil ar bith a dhúnadh agallamh a bheith ann leis na tuistí agus má bhíonn tuiste ar bith sásta go ndúnfar <Col N="1703" /> a scoil i gContae an Chláir cé hé mise chun focal a rá ina choinne?</P>
    <P>Dubhairt an tAire gur mhian leo pé áit ina ndúntar scoil go gcuirtear saorthaisteal ar fáil do na leanaí nó mar a thugann sé féin air &ldquo;supervised transport&rdquo;. Ní thuigim cad is brí le &ldquo;supervision&rdquo; den saghas sin.  Bíonn an tiománaí i dtosach an bhus agus slua leanaí istigh sna suíocháin.  Ná bhíonn an tiománaí ag coimhead súil ar na bóithre cúnga, cásta, go mór mhór fé mar atá siad i nduthaigh Bhaiscne, ní bheidh sé i ndán dul isteach sa bhus gan é stopadh agus &ldquo;supervision&rdquo; a dhéanamh orthu.  Do mholfainn don Aire nuair a dúntar scoil agus nuair a bhíonn ar na leanaí taisteal ar an mbus 3 nó 4 mhíle ó bhaile socrú a dhéanamh go raghadh duine de na h-oidí amach sa bhus ar maidin agus duine eile um thráthnóna chun maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar na leanaí.</P>
    <P>Níl locht ar bith le fáil agam ar mheastacháin na bliana seo ach is trua géar liom nár cuireadh breis airgid ar fáil i gcóir na saor-leabhar úd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with one or two matters in connection with this Estimate.  I would like, firstly, to endorse, if I may, some of the remarks which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, made when speaking on this Estimate. Those who had the privilege of listening to Deputy Jones, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, or who subsequently read his remarks on the Estimate at present before the House, were impressed by the attitude which he adopted and the views which he expressed, and in particular the concern which was voiced with regard to the authoritarian attitude adopted by the Department. I wish to endorse what Deputy Jones said in regard to the need for consultation between the Department and the various interested parties in education. He expressed far more fully and with much greater knowledge than I can the concern which has been expressed not merely to him directly but to other Deputies.  He expressed the concern which has been voiced in recent months in many areas by persons interested in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular topic which I wish <Col N="1704" /> to deal with tonight, however, is one on which I said a few words last week on the conclusion of the debate on the supplementary Budget.  It is the position which has developed concerning the proposed university merger.  The time has come when the Minister and the Government should review the whole situation in this regard.  When this proposal was originally announced for a single university in Dublin there were many people attracted by the idea.  They were anxious to see some form of rationalisation and some approach to a co-ordinated effort between the two universities in the city with a view to avoiding, wherever it existed, overlapping or duplication of unnecessary faculties or facilities and a desire to achieve wherever possible any worthwhile economies.  However, there were certain other attractions in the proposals, such as a desire to get the best out of both universities and to ensure that university education in the city would progress on lines that would make available the best possible facilities for those anxious to use them and for those anxious to attend as students at either college.  The situation, however, has now changed considerably.  It is on this aspect of the matter that I wish to say a few words.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake, in a matter of this sort, to lay down as unchangeable the precise form of merger which the Minister has laid down as the only method whereby the single university can be achieved.  In the letter of July which he issued and in the decision to establish a Higher Education Authority it was clearly laid down that this decision was not open to discussion. Though those who are concerned with this matter realise that when public funds are concerned, when public expenditure is involved, the Government &mdash;I suppose in the last analysis the Dáil&mdash;have the final say as to how much will be made available, this is not entirely a question of money.  Indeed, in this matter the whole question of the future of university education in the capital city is involved and all that means for the nation.</P>
    <P>The decision to merge the two colleges in a single university is one way <Col N="1705" /> of dealing with the problem of university education but it is certainly not the only way of dealing with it.  As has been shown by a number of special articles, letters and discussions undertaken since this announcement was made originally, there are numerous ways in which this might be done.  It is not the function of any Deputy or, indeed, of this Party or possibly of any Party to specify or lay down the precise terms of the form in which that arrangement should be made.  The word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; has now taken precedence over every other consideration. It appears that a decision was taken by the Government to establish a Higher Education Authority with limited terms of reference, with a firm directive that only the form decided on by the Government is that which will be accepted&mdash;that the Authority were then authorised to carry that dictat or decision into effect.</P>
    <P>In this connection I consider it right to recall&mdash;indeed it is pertinent to consider it&mdash;that when this whole question was first brought forward for discussion in recent times, the Commission on Higher Education recommended against the decision which was subsequently announced by the late Minister for Education.  After that decision had been announced it was stated that a White Paper would be issued.  A White Paper has not been issued so far and after a lapse of more than 12 months the Minister's 6th July letter laid down a clear indication, a clear basis on which the Higher Education Authority should operate.</P>
    <P>Since then, indeed at the time the Minister's letter was issued, a large number of academics&mdash;a total of 467 members of the staffs of UCD, TCD, UCC and UCG&mdash;published a statement advocating four or more separate and co-operating universities.  When that announcement was made, or just at about the time that document was to be released, the Minister for Education issued his letter of 6th July.</P>
    <P>It is on that aspect of the matter especially that I wish to comment.  This Higher Education Authority&mdash;I said this previously&mdash;which consists of a number of distinguished persons, was <Col N="1706" /> hand-picked in the sense that it is not representative of and cannot speak for particular faculties, particular universities or particular colleges.  The members of it were hand-picked to perform a limited, defined function laid down by the Minister on behalf of the Government. Since then&mdash;this is where I think the Minister and the Government are mistaken and the Authority are mistaken, and this confirms the concern which has been expressed by Deputy Jones in respect of other spheres&mdash;the Higher Education Authority have met representatives of the two Dublin universities.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is generally known, but whether it is or it is not, I think the procedure adopted was quite remarkable.  When the UCD representatives met the Authority only two members of the Authority put questions to them.  All the others either had their questions channelled through the chairman or were, by expressed decision, prevented from asking questions. When the Higher Education Authority met the TCD representatives, the control was even more rigid: on that occasion the questions were, I think, all put by the chairman and it was made clear that questions should not be put except by the chairman and that if questions were to be submitted by other members they should be submitted in writing.</P>
    <P>One can understand the procedure whereby questions on a matter of this sort would be put through the chairman&mdash;it is probably a more efficient method of doing it and it might be more courteous to have questions put through the chair&mdash;but it is surely the wrong approach in a matter of this sort where you have people of distinction, as some of them are in their particular spheres, dealing with people of eminence in their particular spheres as representatives of the two colleges, to operate in a sort of silent atmosphere in which the approach is: &ldquo;That is the decision we are here to implement. We are going through the form of meeting them but we do not propose to ask questions.&rdquo;  Indeed it is clearly understood that this procedure has been decided on.</P>
    <P>That is not consultation in the ordinary <Col N="1707" /> way in which any representative body or group of people regard consultation as being effective and constructive or indeed realistic.  If a body of eminent people, as I have said some of these people are, whether they were hand-picked or otherwise, find themselves on this Authority, if they are to be of any use in advising the Government, if their advice is to be of a worthwhile character, it is surely sensible to suggest that a person sitting around and participating in or conducting a discussion by people of distinction representing the two colleges in question, should be free to ask a question and not to have either to write it out or put it through the chair?  The whole purpose might be lost.  No matter how quick a person may be he may forget what the precise question is, and by the time it is written out the discussion may have proceeded to some other point.  The reason I mention that is because I believe it shows the mentality which has been adopted in dealing with this matter.  This is a very important national question which in many ways transcends politics or political interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question which should be considered on a national basis.  Indeed, the significant feature of the document which was signed by members of the staffs of the four universities was that it included people who were known to be supporters of all political Parties.  Many prominent Fianna Fáil people signed it, many prominent Fine Gael people and, I have no doubt, many Labour people and, possibly, some not connected with any particular Party.  It is, therefore, essential that their views should be considered and their experience and knowledge taken into consideration before any final decision is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, a number of alternative solutions&mdash;some form of merger with separate and co-operating universities or a proposal such as that which has been laid down by the Minister as immutable.  The potential benefits of unification and co-ordination possibly lie in areas other than the <Col N="1708" /> concept envisaged in the merger.  There are a number of research institutions and bodies in this country and particularly in this city at present carrying on specialised research in particular matters.  There is the Agricultural Institute, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Medical Social Research Council and the Institute of Public Administration.  All these bodies at present are outside the universities. The question of linking these with the universities, the question of linking a body of considerable value to the community such as St. Patrick's Training College, the opening up of specialised teaching resources of the two Dublin colleges, the question of releasing places at present in Trinity College which are occupied by an excessively large number of students from outside Ireland&mdash;I know that efforts have been made in recent times to redress the balance in that regard&mdash; the question of bringing Trinity College, Dublin, more into the life of the community&mdash;and irrespective of what its historical position may have been I think there is a general recognition that it has a useful role to play&mdash;the utilisation of all these resources and facilities, and when I say &ldquo;resources&rdquo; I mean them in the broadest possible sense, and the question of providing the best possible system of university education particularly here in this capital city&mdash;all these are questions which must be carefully examined and considered before a decision is arrived at.  Indeed, when considering what the future needs may be, a great deal of stress has been laid on the college here in the centre of the city, Trinity College, and on the new facilities which will be available at Belfield.  Some people who have considered this from their experience of working in actual university life, who have studied the statistics and who are conversant and familiar with the problem, have come to the conclusion that instead of two separate colleges in Dublin it may be that in the future we will need a third university in this city.  That question, too, must be considered.</P>
    <P>In the proposals which have already been announced there are certain objectionable proposals from the point <Col N="1709" /> of view of making the best possible use of the resources available.  So far as economies are concerned, and I think this is the thing that originally attracted a number of people, the worthwhile economies are very few. With the possible exception of the faculty of veterinary medicine and one or two other relatively insignificant faculties or parts of faculties, there are no worthwhile economies.  Indeed, the situation that has developed is that almost every faculty, certainly all the major ones, are not merely substantially overcrowded but the problem is to get accommodation and to get extra facilities.  Undoubtedly in certain respects changes of administration could probably make better use of the facilities available, but the defect in the proposal announced is that it is proposed to transfer two major prestige faculties, Medicine and Law, to Trinity College.  This would leave a serious imbalance not merely in the prestige faculties but would denude the new University College at Belfield of a number of students who should have available to them the modern facilities which will be provided there.</P>
    <P>We believe that the correct approach to this matter at this stage is to re-examine the whole question, to approach it in a realistic, constructive fashion, in consultation with the representatives of the universities concerned. It is remarkable that the staff representatives who have signed this document represent the four colleges. It is true, and it may be said, that the Board of Trinity College are agreeable to the proposals.  That is understandable because some of these proposals go further than they ever anticipated and probably further than they might even wish in regard to certain aspects of the matter.  We believe that effective policy making should be done in consultation with the colleges concerned with a view to securing closer co-ordination of the facilities available in the city and that every aspect of the matter should be carefully and fully explored.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> Debate resumed on the following Motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the income tax code is in need of urgent revision in view of the fact that it now creates considerable economic hardship for the least well-off section of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy James Tully).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pleasure and a deep sense of responsibility for the importance and urgency of this matter that I rise to support the motion.  Let me say at the outset none of us objects to paying his fair share of income tax in this country.  We realise this money is essential to maintain the services of our country but we are entitled to insist that such direct taxation is apportioned in a fair and an equitable manner with due regard to the ability of the people to pay and that obviously it should be placed squarely on the shoulders of those people able to bear that burden.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that no section of the community should be singled out for preferential treatment, as is the position in this country, nor should a system be tolerated any longer which systematically robs the working class people of this country of a grossly unfair share of their hard-earned money, thereby causing frustration and very great hardship to individuals which in the long term stultifies initiative and effort towards maximum productivity and gravely endangers the economic welfare of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the working classes are carrying this country on their backs, that they are the real producers of the wealth of this country and that it is grossly unfair and the height of ingratitude to them for their sustained effort that they should be singled out for exploitation for so long, without relief or redress of any kind, since this system was introduced a number of years ago.  I rise here today to bring home to the Taoiseach, who is, I am glad to say, present, and to his Government in no uncertain terms that the <Col N="1711" /> unmitigated scourge of income tax is now a source of grave unrest among working people in this country.  It has become a fundamental issue of social justice which calls for immediate redress.</P>
    <P>The intolerable burden of income tax on the backs of the working class people in this country is causing widespread indignation.  They are seething with discontent and the situation is reaching boiling point.  If the Taoiseach and the Government fail to recognise this area of discontent in our country and if they do not bring about the relief we are calling for, they do so at their own peril.  The Government can no longer treat all the workers of this country caught up in the net of PAYE in the way they have been treating them&mdash;with impunity.  This kind of treatment of the working class people under PAYE has gone on so long without relief of any kind that it has got to come to an end.</P>
    <P>An opportunity will be presented to the Taoiseach very soon in the coming Budget to give the reliefs which we call for now.  The Government can provide in the Budget, as a first essential, a substantial increase in the personal and dependent relative allowances by increasing the ceiling of £6 10s for single persons and approximately £10 in respect of married persons to a more reasonable figure and to generally relate this income tax code to the steep increase in the cost of living and the fall in the value of money.</P>
    <P>This is something which the Government have failed to take into account for the past eight years despite the spiral of costs in the interim period. The Government will have to come down from their ivory tower and realise, once and for all, that to tax a single man, woman, boy or girl on every £1 earned above £6 10s a week is a national scandal, highly disincentive and frustrating and the cause of widespread hardship.  It is again patently unjust, and cannot be defended, to tax a married man on every £1 he earns over a sum of £10 a week.  Is it seriously suggested that £6 a week for a single worker and £10 for a married couple is sufficient to maintain them with the present high cost of living?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> Despite the steep increase in the cost of living it must be remembered the class we speak for here, the mass of our working class people, are caught in the net of PAYE and already contribute their full share towards the economy of our country.  They continue to pay their full share of indirect taxation of all kinds in respect of purchase tax and turnover tax, in rent and rates and indeed on all commodities of life in respect of clothing, foodstuffs, petrol, drink and tobacco.  All of us in the working class movement are paying more than our proportionate share of revenue by this indirect method without having to be fleeced directly under PAYE.</P>
    <P>The Government simply cannot burn this candle at both ends.  I want to assert in the presence of the Taoiseach that the burden of income tax deducted on a weekly basis under PAYE is no longer a painless extraction of money from the wage packets or, more appropriately, out of the pockets of the working class people.  Indeed, it is causing great hurt, great injury, deep and bitter.  We suggest that this rifling of the pockets of the working class must stop.</P>
    <P>Earned income allowance for a single person has remained static at £234 for a long number of years as has the earned income allowance for a married person at £394.  The dependent relative allowance of approximately £60 is being gradually whittled away by the application of a means test based on the income of the dependant.</P>
    <P>There are flagrant injustices in the present code.  The only reliefs granted in recent years were to the advantage of the mohaired executives earning in excess of £2,500 per annum.  There has been relief for the surtax-paying element only and no relief has been given to the ordinary working class. There are tax free allowances for the upper classes, the executive type to whom I have referred, in respect of the use of company cars and sundry expenses, but no relief is provided for the ordinary worker who has to travel to work daily, for whom some mode of conveyance is a necessity, whether it be a motor car, a motorcycle or a scooter.  There is no recognition of the <Col N="1713" /> cost of transport for our class but there is in the case of the mohaired class.  We must ask where the justice is in the system.</P>
    <P>There is no relief for married persons, for whom the high cost of living presents great difficulties, in respect of rent, rates and taxes and debts incurred through death, adversity or misfortune. There is no relief in the case of a single man living alone in respect of a housekeeper.  There is no allowance applicable in the case of a single person who may be obliged to live away from home and who must pay for lodgings and for travelling and other incidental expenses.  There is no allowance in the case of a worker for attendance at a university at night. This is an aspect which the Taoiseach should attend to.  Some relief should be provided for such people who are helping themselves and the country by their attendance at a university in their spare time.</P>
    <P>The allowances generally need to be increased as a matter of urgency to more realistic figures.  The existing allowances would not maintain a human being in even frugal comfort, would not provide a subsistence level of existence.  In fact, one would hardly maintain a dog on the allowances.</P>
    <P>This vicious system affects all our working class people, to whom great hardship has accrued.  Imagine the position of the poor unfortunate farm labourer who is obliged to pay approximately 7/- on every £ he earns over £6 10s 0d a week.  He pays this penal tax while his employer, the farmer, pays no income tax at all.  The farm worker is supposed to be full of energy and enthusiasm and to work every day, including holidays and Sundays, overtime, as the case may be. Is it seriously suggested that he should do this for the love of the farmer or for the love of the country, knowing that at the end of the week most of his extra earnings will go to the tax man?  Is it any wonder that agricultural production has been relatively static for a long period?  Instead of taxing these unfortunate people, would it not be better to give them a bounty, a slice of the colossal subsidies which are spent, or misspent, on agriculture? <Col N="1714" /> How much more beneficial would it be to give these people a real stake in the wealth which they create rather than penalise them as they are penalised under the income tax code?  A worker, whether he be a tradesman, a labourer, an industrial worker, cannot be expected to work harder in order to attain higher productivity, however attractive the incentives may be, if at the end of the week he has to pay additional income tax.</P>
    <P>This issue must be viewed in its broadest context as being not merely an individual problem but a problem which is increasingly affecting the welfare of the country.  The workers for whom we now seek relief realise that they are being called upon to bear an unfair and disproportionate amount of income tax as compared with the rest of the community.  One large section of the community is exempt from income tax.  The really wealthy section have ways and means of evading income tax.  They are not caught up in the tight mesh of PAYE, as are the people whose incomes to the last penny are known to the Revenue Commissioners. There are large sections of professional people who would receive for a half day's work fees amounting to the average worker's weekly wage.  They are not involved in the PAYE system.  It is a matter very largely for themselves to indicate their real income and I should think it is difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to ascertain their real income.</P>
    <P>Clearly, then, one section, the working classes, are being asked to bear the real brunt of the burden, a burden that has become too heavy, too inequitable and utterly unjust.  We are appealing to the Taoiseach tonight to apply the scales of justice and fair play in this matter.  A review is long overdue.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine why certain sections of our working classes are kept outside the PAYE system.  I refer to State employees such as forestry workers and members of the Defence Forces.  I do not understand why these persons should be categorised with higher civil servants.  It would be a great facility to them if they could pay income tax on a weekly basis rather than be called upon to pay large lump sums at the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> Income tax is something that we have come to accept.  We appreciate that it is a necessary and inevitable device, an essential feature of fiscal policy in all countries.  What we seek here is a fair apportionment of this direct tax.</P>
    <P>The movement that we represent was the first to laud the idea of PAYE and to prompt the Government to introduce it.  We little thought, though, that it would be applied in such a rigid, unimaginative and unalterable, as it would seem, way, with no regard for costs or the fall in the value of money. My own union was the first to propose this motion to Congress a number of years ago.  Congress made known its view to the Government and the Government brought in PAYE.  The same union which lauded it then condemns it now because it has failed to do what we expected it would do for the working classes&mdash;operate fairly and impartially.  Consequently, we make no apology now for condemning it roundly as an archaic and outmoded system which has not kept pace with the changing times, which is causing very great hardship and frustration to our working class people and threatens to destroy the whole economic fibre of the nation if it is not revised and revised very soon.</P>
    <P>I look forward with hope and enthusiasm to the coming Budget to bring reliefs to all those people for whom we are pleading here tonight.  The concessions in the past have not been for these classes.  They have been for the executive, sur-tax class.  We should now have regard to the real producers of the wealth of this country and give them a chance to avail of the productivity incentives and to attain the all-round productivity which the economy so badly needs.</P>
    <P>If we give the workers this encouragement we can expect them to respond and respond happily.  This is the topic of the day; this is a burning issue, and those who blind their eyes to this issue are living in an ivory tower.  It is high time they came down to reality and revised these figures upwards in accordance with present-day costs.</P>
    <P>With these sentiments I commend <Col N="1716" /> this Motion to the House with enthusiasm and with pride.  My colleague, Deputy Tully, will be replying for the Party, and we look forward to hearing the views of the Taoiseach as well.  I hope he will be able to give us some gleam of hope for a better deal for the people for whom we plead here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I very readily agree with Deputy Treacy when he says that income tax as such is a burning question and that it raises some resentment in the average income tax payer.  I think I can truthfully say that every income tax payer would look forward with eagerness and enthusiasm to any easement that would lessen his burden. When I refer to any income tax payer I mean not only the ordinary wage earner or salary earner or professional person who receives fees but even a Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners and the income tax collectors themselves.  Income tax affects everybody, and therefore any easement of income tax is one to be generally welcomed.  I believe any Minister for Finance would agree with the spirit of a motion of this kind.  However, he has to do his job to ensure that the expenditure that the State necessarily incurs in its various services will be met by a revenue income commensurate with that expenditure.</P>
      <P>Many points were raised during the course of the debate, and within Standing Orders I have only a limited time to reply.  Therefore, I shall confine my remarks to the major points that were made in the course of this debate. Changes in the income tax code, whether in personal allowances or in earned income allowance or in the rates of tax itself are primarily budgetary matters and, as a general rule, can be dealt with only in the context of the annual Budget.  They must be taken in the context of simultaneous demands for easements in taxation and demands for increased expenditure in various directions.  A Minister for Finance, even if he agrees with the subject matter of a motion like this, cannot outside the Budget period, indicate his reactions to it.  Certainly, he cannot indicate his positive support for such a motion, and invariably is in the position of having to oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that, at this stage, I cannot indicate to the House what the intentions of the Government are in relation to future Budgets, with specific reference to income tax, but I can say that the major obstacle in the way of a significant increase in personal allowances is the amount of money involved.  Let me give some examples: the cost of raising the single and widow allowances by even £10 and the married allowance by even £20 would be, together, of the order of £2.8 million in a full year; the cost of raising the child allowance by as little as £10 is estimated at £650,000 in a full year.  Therefore, the total cost of these increases, which I do not think would ease the lot of the taxpayer to any worthwhile extent, would be about £3,500,000 a year. That is a sizeable sum to be made up by way of some other form of taxation if we are to continue the State services at the present level.</P>
    <P>I suppose the single most acceptable relief that might be given would be a reduction of the standard rate of income tax, but the cost of this would also be very high.  For example, a reduction of 4d, say, from the present rate of 7s, as it is now, to 6s 8d would cost no less than £4 million in a full year, and a reduction of, say 1/-, which would be a significant reduction, would cost the enormous sum of £12 million in a full year.  The Minister for Finance put this in perspective when he was speaking on the Second Stage of this year's Finance Bill in the early summer. He said at column 1178 of volume 235:</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the fact that the Bill does not provide in any way for a general increase in personal allowances.  It is, of course, easy to make the case that these allowances have been static, or practically static, for a long time now.  Indeed, I myself adverted to that situation in my reply on the Budget debate.  The fact is that any improvement in the area of personal allowances would be very expensive indeed... I do not think the ordinary taxpayer would be at all appreciative of minor changes in these allowances and, if <Col N="1718" /> one were to contemplate doing anything significant, one could only contemplate that in the context of some fundamental restructuring of our total taxation system, such as the introduction of added value tax or a major increase in indirect taxation. It is not, therefore, valid to argue at length about the inadequacy of personal allowances without, at the same time, going to the root of the problem and suggesting where the major fundamental change should be made in our taxation structure to enable something significant to be done in personal allowances.</P>
    <P>I should like to put to the Labour Party, without any sense of rancour, that they are not being consistent with their usual policy of favouring direct taxation as against indirect taxation. It is unrealistic for them to put forward this Motion while at the same time they are pressing in many other instances for greater emphasis on direct taxation.  They know as well as everybody else that the increasing cost of State services makes it virtually impossible to reduce both indirect and direct taxation at the same time. They cannot seriously imagine that substantial relief could be given on the lower incomes by increasing income tax and surtax on higher incomes.  There are so many in the lower income groups and so few in the higher income groups that such a suggestion would be impracticable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party should remember also that, while the total amount taken in taxation has admittedly been increasing from year to year, much of the product of that taxation has been devoted to improving the lot of the least well-off sections of the community with which the present Motion appears to be mainly concerned.  Year after year this Government have increased the amounts payable to social welfare recipients and it can be claimed that these increases have been far greater than the corresponding increases in the cost of living.  Moreover, we have greatly extended the scope, apart from the level, of these social payments and, again, to the benefit of the least well off people.</P>
    <P>In other fields, in introducing free <Col N="1719" /> education at all levels, free school transport, free books where these are necessary, we have considerably reduced the expenditure which the tax-paying parent would otherwise have to meet out of income.  Quite recently we have provided income tax relief for the medical expenses of families and to that extent we have reduced their outgoings. This year we introduced special income tax relief to help meet the unusually heavy expenses that newly married couples face in the early part of their married life.  I think it must be admitted that it is the least well off sections of the people that get most benefit from the subsidised services such as housing and all these must be paid for.</P>
    <P>In effect, what I am saying is that, while we may not have been able to ease the lot of the poorer sections by increasing personal allowances under the income tax code, we have devoted a very substantial part of the yield of income tax to improving their standard of living in many instances.  Unfortunately, that tends to be taken for granted as if the State did not have to provide the cost in the long run.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised a point which I think I heard him mention before, the tax allowance for expenses incurred in travelling to and from work.  Deputy Treacy repeated that this evening.  No relief is allowed in respect of the cost of travelling between a person's home and his work in any case no matter what position a person occupies in a business or any other commercial organisation.  To use the tax definition, that expenditure is not &ldquo;wholly, exclusively, and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment&rdquo;.  In other words, the taxpayer does not begin to earn his income until he has reached his place of work and the cost of getting there is not incurred in the performance of the duties of his employment.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is approaching this from the viewpoint of a much discredited rule which has been many times condemned by members of his own profession, learned judges.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have in fact criticised it myself when I was affected by the application of the same rule. Nevertheless, one must lay down specific rules which must apply.  As Deputy Byrne knows, once rules of that nature are breached or modified a flood tide is usually loosed and the ultimate cost is usually far in excess of what may have been initially anticipated.  Travelling expenses between a person's home and his place of work are part of his living costs, part of the standard of living.  Naturally, they vary between one person and another, depending mainly on the choice of location of his residence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.  One cannot always dictate where a job will be but in many cases, I think the Deputy will admit, in firms where the job site changes from time to time most employers give certain allowances over certain periods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some do.  I think that in the case of building workers, who are usually most affected by changes in location, especially if the location is outside the immediate area of residence of an employee, a lodging or travel allowance is given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the labourers can be found where the employment exists.  If it were to be accepted that the cost of travelling to work should be included in personal relief for income tax there is, logically, no reason why other parts of the taxpayer's income which are used to meet what are to him unavoidable personal expenses, for example housing, clothing, education and so on, should not be eligible for relief also.  Apart altogether from the formidable and costly administrative problems that this would raise, it would result in a very large scale and, I suggest, haphazard extension of the personal allowances <Col N="1721" /> and, as I say, at a completely prohibitive cost.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully has said that a man who owns a building firm and who drives from his place of residence gets tax free allowances for his car.  He described him as the mohair executive &mdash;I presume he refers to an executive in a mohair suit but I would remind Deputy Tully that mohair is made in Ireland too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the implication by Deputy Tully is that these people get allowances for travelling from their place of residence to their place of business.  That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read the Deputy's remarks closely but I thought he implied that an allowance was given for such a man travelling from his home to his office.  Deputy Treacy did say it in a more positive way just now, the implication being that these gentlemen get allowances which are denied to the ordinary worker.  Of course, this is not true.  It is true to say that a person who has to travel for the purpose of his employment while actually in the employment is entitled to such an allowance.  In the case of a man who owns a building firm, for example, he gets an allowance for travelling from his office to the building site or, for instance, if he has to travel to some place to submit a tender or to view specifications for that purpose, but he would not be entitled to an allowance for travelling from his place of residence to his place of employment or his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne mentioned the allowance given for wear and tear of clothes in respect of certain employments.  One of the outstanding examples of this allowance would be in regard to mine workers.  However, these allowances are usually negotiated between the Revenue Commissioners and the individual or between the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of a group of individuals.  I believe that this allowance is currently being received <Col N="1722" /> by one category of workers.  The Revenue Commissioners are reasonably sympathetic to these claims but sympathetic only to the point that these claims can be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more in some cases.  I cannot remember the details.</P>
      <P>Deputy Patrick Byrne and Deputy Seán Dunne criticised the surtax reliefs that were given in the Budgets of 1967 and 1968.  This has been a difficult question for a long time.  I have come up against it personally in my capacity as Minister for Finance when the case was made to me&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash;that men of high calibre, technically and otherwise, on whose ability the successful running of a commercial business or industry often depends, would not be attracted to these positions in this country unless the tax allowances offered were at least as favourable as those given in the United Kingdom.  We found great difficulty in attracting such men to this country because the allowances were not as favourable as those in Great Britain.  At that time, I think the allowances given to people in the £3,500 class and upwards were less favourable than those in Britain and that was a factor that deterred the people of high managerial competence from coming here to help our industries and to replenish our fairly low quantum of managerial expertise.  I might say that the cost of the reliefs given was offset to a great extent by increasing the burden of surtax at other levels of income.  Deputies will agree that the amount of money this cost would not go very far in easing the burden of the lower paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, we have to deal with a very heavy industrial development programme.  With the aim of increasing employment opportunities and in order to attract the capital that we require for the expansion of our economy we provide grants and other incentives.  It would be rather negative to be spending this money unless we had the kind of technological experts who are required to make a success of this industrial development <Col N="1723" /> programme.  In addition, we have spent a lot of money in improving the industrial scene and in providing the other services we have, like the Productivity Committee and the consultancy services that the Productivity Committee make available to industries.  All these services have to be paid for; and all these services are manned by people who would not be attracted to them unless we could give them at least the same kind of reliefs as are being given in other countries.  We must be able to do this in order to attract these people and to retain them.  To refuse to apply these relatively inexpensive reliefs would amount to &ldquo;spoiling the ship for the ha'p'orth of tar&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully criticised a statement which he attributed to me when I was Minister for Finance, namely, that when wages rise income tax should rise also.  I am not quite sure of what he said but he said something like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be sure.  I have the document here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can quote it afterwards but I want to put it on record that what I did, in fact, say in reply to a debate on a motion of Deputy Corish's in 1966, which touched on the same general subject, was to the effect that, while regard must always be had to capacity to pay, the personal allowances were never consciously related to a minimum subsistence. The basic consideration that must determine the level of the allowances at any given time is a budgetary one.  This, I think, is what gives the income tax code its progressive nature whereby the tax liability increases progressively in line with income.  It would not suit the cause that Deputy Tully is pleading if, instead of that arrangement, there was a flat rate payable on every £ of income so that a man with an income of say £2,500 would pay only the same rate per £ as he would if he had an income of 5d&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the relevant quotation.  Deputy Treacy and some other Deputies referred to evasion.  There is evasion and this is one of the big problems with which income tax collectors have to contend and one of the big responsibilities of those who have to procure the necessary funds from income tax.  Any system of income taxation must for its efficient functioning depend, first and above all, on the honesty and the civic sense of those responsible for payment of it.  At the same time, it must be borne in mind that the income tax code includes provision to ensure that tax returns are in accordance with the requirements of the law, that false or incorrect returns are detected and that those who would endeavour to file false returns and so try to throw the burden on shoulders that could not bear them are visited with severe penalties. To ensure incorrect returns do not escape attention, income tax returns are carefully scrutinised by inspectors of income tax.</P>
      <P>In addition, the income tax investigation branch was established specifically for the purpose of dealing with cases of tax evasion.  Recently, in order to tighten up the system of scrutiny, we imposed an obligation on persons carrying on trades, professions, and other similar profit-making activities, to keep proper records.  That was introduced under the Finance Act, 1968.  As well as that, new and comprehensive penalty provisions in relation to false or incorrect returns were introduced under the Finance Act, 1963.  I can assure the House that the Revenue Commissioners do not hesitate to invoke these provisions where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am coming to the end of my time. There are other matters to which I should have liked to refer in the course of my reply but, as I have said, my time under Standing Orders is limited. May I repeat what I said at the outset? The spirit of this motion is one which would appeal to anybody paying income tax.  Because of the usual budgetary obligations a Minister for Finance is not in a position to indicate whether or not he proposes to accept such a motion in its spirit or in its letter and he invariably has to indicate <Col N="1725" /> to the House that he is opposed to the motion and that is, unfortunately, a position I have to adopt here this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at the line which the Taoiseach took here this evening as Acting-Minister for Finance.  He attempted to prove certain things had been said, or to disprove them, though he was not sure whether they had been said.  I have here the debate, which was available to the Taoiseach also, which took place in 1966.  I quote from column 294 of the Dáil Debates of the 23rd February, 1966.  The whole quotation, of which the Taoiseach gave part, reads:</P>
      <P>It is suggested that the rates in operation, to which I have referred, may be regarded as subsistence rates below which tax ought not to be collected from an individual.  I do not think it was ever consciously decided that these rates of relief were to be regarded as subsistence levels.  But, nevertheless</P>
      <P>This is the portion he did not repeat:</P>
      <P>&mdash;as Deputy Corish pointed out&mdash; there was in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation a recommendation to the effect that the principle should be recognised that income tax should not be payable on the income needed for minimum subsistence.  Deputy Corish said the Government ought to indicate their views on that.  Of course, the Government have done so&mdash;in the second White Paper on Direct Taxation, paragraph 28 of which says:</P>
      <P>It has always been recognised that income tax should not be payable on the income needed for minimum subsistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what this debate is about.  We in the Labour Party feel that there should not be a deduction from the wages or salaries of people whose wages or salaries are recognised even by the State&mdash;the Agricultural Wages <Col N="1726" /> Board, for instance&mdash;as being a minimum rate of subsistence level.  Yet, the Department of Finance make the necessary arrangements to have a certain proportion of these people's wages or salaries taken away.</P>
    <P>When trade unions are trying to negotiate wages, and have succeeded in negotiating, say, an increase of £1 for low paid workers, the taxman is waiting outside the door with his hat out. He collects roughly one-third of that £1 before it goes to the household of the unfortunate man who is credited with having got £1 a week, and who is accused in this House of having added to the cost of living as a result of that £1.  The State says &ldquo;We need this for the running of the establishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was a bit careful when he was giving figures on income tax.  There are a few points I should like to put on this in the short time at my disposal for the information of those who may not understand the PAYE system of collecting tax.  That system came into operation on the 6th October, 1960.  Therefore, we can take it that the year 1960-61 was the first year in which it was in full operation. In that year the net receipts from income tax, as distinct from sur-tax, amounted to £29,413,345.  The figure for sur-tax was £1,875,564.  In 1966-67, the last year for which I have a record, that £29 million had become £60,781,857 and the figure for sur-tax was £3,236,503.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave figures of the amount which he said it would cost the State if there was an increase in the allowance.  He said that, if there was an increase of £10 per year, under the system it would cost the State £2.8 million and for a married allowance of £20 he gave a figure of £760,000, a total of £3,560,000.  Where did the Taoiseach get these figures?  If he does a simple mathematical sum on the £2.8 million, which is less than £3 million, he will realise that that figure of £10 to produce that amount just could not be right.  I hate saying this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <P>If £10 a year would cost the State £2.8 million when it is allocated over all the single workers who are paying tax the figure which is shown for income tax collected for the year&mdash;£60 million&mdash; under PAYE could not be correct.  I do not know where the Taoiseach got his figures.  Perhaps at a later stage by means of question and answer we may be able to find out.</P>

      <P>The single man with children as well!  We shall have to find a wife for him!  I honestly believe this sort of thing is not good enough.  This is a serious discussion.  To introduce figures which just could not be correct is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the reduction of 4d costing £4 million and a reduction of 1s costing £12 million and the effect it would have.  Again these are figures which have been taken out of the air by somebody.  It is not good enough to toss them across the floor of the House and to say: &ldquo;That will knock the feet from under your argument: you cannot argue against it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggested that this Motion is in direct contradiction of Labour Party policy on direct taxation as against indirect taxation.  Again, I would take issue with him.  What we are complaining about here is not the system of taxation but the application of that system, the application of a system of taxation which says to the poorest wage-earner in the country that he is not entitled to any concession. The Taoiseach's argument here this evening was that, because a man travels by car from his home to work and must pay tax, insurance, for the upkeep of his car and for petrol to run it&mdash;because he is going directly to the job&mdash;it is no responsibility of the State and he should not expect anything in return for it.  He has double and treble tax to meet.  He pays his road tax.  He pays more than half of what he pays for petrol in taxation.  Along with that, he must pay income tax on it.  If the Taoiseach wants to defend that kind <Col N="1728" /> of system then he is welcome to do so, but I think we are perfectly entitled to comment on what he says.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach took me to task because he said I claimed that a man who travelled from his home to a job was taxed whereas, if the employer travelled from his home to the job, he would not be taxed.  I said that the man travelled from his home to the job, worked hard all day, travelled home again in the evening and usually had nothing all day except a flask of cold tea and a few sandwiches whereas if the man who employed him and lived next door to him travelled to the job, later on in the day, and travelled from that to his office and, on his way home, brought some of his business acquaintances for an evening meal, with all the trimmings, he could claim tax not alone on all his travelling but in relation to all his entertainment for business purposes.  This was stopped by the Labour Government in Britain. They have done many things for which they have been criticised but you will not find many people in this country, who know what it means, criticising them for doing that.  Similar action should be taken here.  I think it is all cod.</P>
    <P>Again, the Taoiseach showed he did not realise what the situation was when he said they should move nearer to their job, that it was their choice of home, that their choice of home affects the distance they have to travel.  I would point out that it was the choice of job&mdash;because there was no other job available.  I had this matter out with the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, who is not here this evening, on one occasion in this House. The fact that a man travels 40 miles in a car from County Meath to his work in the morning is not because he wants to do it but because there is no other employment available.  What would the Taoiseach have him do? Would the Taoiseach have that man stay at home and draw unemployment benefit?  Is that the answer to the problem?</P>
    <P>Surely, when a man makes an effort to try to rear his family and to support himself and his wife, he should get some consideration?  According to what <Col N="1729" /> the Taoiseach said here this evening, it does not matter: he should be like the snail and get a box and, when he is working on a building site in Finglas, he should move there and, when he is working on a building site in Ballymun, he should move there with his box and live in it and, if he has to go to work in Trim, County Meath, he should drag his box back there with him.  A man cannot take a house around in that manner.  He cannot get a house every time he has to move to a fresh job because he cannot get a house every time he applies for one. The whole approach of the Department to that problem is one which needs a complete change.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Taoiseach did not intend to suggest that we were blaming the income tax officials for their administration in this connection.  Nobody is blaming them.  They get a set of rules which they must abide by.  It is not their fault.  It is the fault of the Government and the fault of this House that allows this system to continue. Sooner or later, this matter must be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the worker here and how badly he is being treated. My goodness, even the old age pensioner, who happens to have a few pounds a week from his job, is taxed. Where is the justice in taxing a man of that age?  He is not taxed on his unemployment benefit but, as soon as he reaches the magical age of 70, then, if he has over £6 5s 0d a week, he is taxed on the balance.  Again, this is one of these things which I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>There are various types of pensioners. There are people on fixed incomes.  There are the small investors who invested their savings over the years for the purpose of being able to exist when they reached retiring age if no pension was due to them.  All of this is now taxed.  Every 1s over £6 5s is taxed.  I think that is wrong.  As the cost of living goes up, their income goes down.  Despite that, the tax is still applied to them.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which apparently the Taoiseach should refer to among all the things to be done with the money taken from the workers. He referred to free education, <Col N="1730" /> increases in social welfare, housing, and so on.  Has it ever struck the Taoiseach that one of the reasons the Government are not prepared to do very much about this is because they now have allowed the cost of housing and the cost of sites to rise to such a pitch that those who are attempting to house themselves find themselves stuck with this extra site cost because some smart fellow&mdash;he does not have to be Irish&mdash;can slip in and buy a site for half nothing and sell it at a fantastic price?  If the house is built, the cost of everything has gone so fantastically high, including the price of the money he borrows, that a man is put to the pin of his collar to pay all that.  In addition, he is told he may not take all that into consideration for tax purposes and that he must be taxed on his income.</P>
    <P>Many young people in this city who get married and build a home for themselves, thus putting themselves head over heels in debt, find that the income tax authorities insist on getting their pound of flesh instead of the Government's making some effort to encourage them to pay their way when they get married.  I was surprised at the encouragement given by the Taoiseach to the newly-weds.  I thought everyone realised, when that was introduced, that it was a cod because those who got married before 5th April were able to get as much out of the income tax.  Therefore, they do not really get anything out of that.  We can put it in the same bracket as the free travel to school and the free school books to which the Taoiseach referred.  This is not the proper time to debate it but, with regard to free travel to school, as the Taoiseach must know, it is not costing all the enormous amount of money which is suggested because it is helping a subsidy which would be paid to CIE anyway.  The net amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the figures.  The Taoiseach might look at them himself and, if he does, he will realise the bow is not as long as he thinks it is.  We should start issuing <Col N="1731" /> free school books before we start talking about it.  These free school books have caused more trouble than anything else.  I give full credit to the Government for what they are doing but they cannot claim to be giving free books when the amount of money is roughly half what is required.  However, that has nothing to do with this debate and I do not propose to pursue it any further.</P>
      <P>The big trouble about all this is that the Government have apparently made up their minds that there are so many lower-paid workers caught in the net it would cost too much to try to do anything for them and, in order to salve their consciences, the Government say: &ldquo;We need this money for something else&rdquo;.  I know the Government need money in order to run the State but I do not agree that that money should be taken from those who are not alone unable to pay but can barely exist on what they earn.  I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear some of the Fianna Fáil people talking about the grassroots organisation and all the information this organisation passes through the cumainn up to the National Executive. I wonder where the grassroots organisation fits in in all this?  Has the grassroots organisation of Fianna Fáil not brought to the notice of Fianna Fáil Deputies the fact that this system of taxation strips the lowest paid workers of money they badly need?  Something will have to be done about this.  The Taoiseach refuses to accept the proposal. I was looking over the debate which took place in February, 1966, and, because it was February, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, made the case that he would be revealing Budget secrets; it was too near Budget day and it was unfair to ask him to accept the Motion then. We put it in now in the month of November feeling that would give him ample time to do something.  All we asked him to say was that, as the Budget would be coming along in April or May&mdash;I hope there will not be another before then&mdash;arrangements would be made to make some provision <Col N="1732" /> for relief for those at the bottom of the ladder.  The Taoiseach says &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He and his Party will fight against any such relief.  I want to warn them.  This is a matter of such vital importance that, if the Taoiseach refuses to accept the Motion and proposes to go to the country early in the New Year, as he suggested the other night he would, he will be hearing plenty about income taxation and income tax before the election is over.</P>
    <P>This is a typical example of the way in which the Fianna Fáil Government are anxious to protect vested interests, to protect the moneyed classes and, at the same time, anxious to give the impression that they are also trying to help those who have very little.  The evidence that they are not prepared to help those who have very little is here tonight for all to see.  The system of taxation we have is producing something which I did not think it was possible for any Government to get away with.  Some years ago those who were working for hire paid nothing, or very little, by way of income tax.  In 1953/54 the unmarried worker paid £1 4s 7d tax and the married worker nothing. In 1954/55, the unmarried worker paid nothing.  The same situation obtained in 1955/56 and in 1956/57.  In 1957/58, he paid £6 12s 2d.  The following year, 1958/59, he paid £6 15s 0d.  In 1959/60, he paid £6 18s 4d.  In 1960/61, he paid nothing.  In 1961/62, he paid nothing because an alteration had been made and the Department realised they must try to keep things in line.  In 1962/63 he paid £3 11s 3d.  In 1963/64, he paid £5 3s 1d.  In 1964/65, he paid £15 19s 2d; in 1965/66, he paid £24 13s 9d; in 1966/67, he paid £38 11s 4d and in 1967/68, he paid £42 10s 3d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying prior to the adjournment, the important consideration in this matter is to secure the best possible use of the resources available and to ensure that the maximum advantage is derived from the resources available in University College, Dublin, and also in TCD. The new buildings and the facilities which are available at Belfield have special advantages in certain respects, but there are also available in Trinity College not merely a valuable library, which has been extended and improved very considerably in recent times, but a tradition which in certain respects, particularly from an external point of view, has advantages which can be utilised.  I do not wish to elaborate particularly on the special advantages of either college except to say that the overriding consideration should be to exploit to the full and use to the maximum advantage the special attributes of both colleges and to consider other institutions in that connection. I refer to the special consideration which should be given to the position of St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra.  I think special consideration ought to be given also to Carysfort College and to the Christian Brothers Training College at <Col N="1736" /> Marino.  Probably pre-eminent among all these is the special position of Maynooth College.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of this matter which seems to me to have been overlooked, or certainly not to have been given adequate consideration is the length of time which must elapse before traditions develop in any particular direction.  We are all aware of the long tradition in Trinity College. Even in so far as UCD is concerned the university has existed in one form or another since the time of Cardinal Newman.  It has existed in its present form for the last 60 years.  It is not possible to build up institutions of that character and to change their format radically overnight.  It is true that you can change the position legally.  You can alter its legal or even constitutional framework by legislation or by the passing of a constitutional amendment, but that does not provide what we wish to establish here.  It seems to me that the fundamental mistake being made in the excessive use of the term &ldquo;merger&rdquo; is that some illusory, imaginary condition will be created merely by the passing of legislation and by the enactment, if necessary, of a constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions are being made that those involved in the merger are interested only in themselves or that they have vested interests in the retention of the <i>status quo</i>.  I suppose there are a few people in either college&mdash;and indeed in that regard they are no different to people in any other walk of life &mdash; who are anxious to retain conditions as they are.  On the other hand, views have been expressed and people have come together and signed a document because they are concerned with, and anxious for, the future development of university education in this country.  Some of these people disagree fundamentally in many other ways, but all of them are interested in education.  I know that some eminent professors have expressed a particular view in regard to medical education.  It can be argued, and rightly so, that their views are entitled to consideration. Many other eminent medical people in both colleges, or indeed not directly concerned in either college, have expressed different views.  But from the national point of view and <Col N="1737" /> from the point of view which we are obliged to consider here what we ought to ensure is that the maximum use will be derived from the proper use of all our resources&mdash;financial resources, actual facilities like buildings and, above all, personnel.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that cannot be done if we get ourselves into a rigid position in which the dominant consideration is the word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; which, in fact, was not originally envisaged in the statement made initially by the Minister at the time.  In any event we ought not to allow ourselves to be circumscribed in regard to future action by allowing a particular word, or the implications involved in it, to dominate all thought in this matter.  The essentials of the whole question involve a rational and reasonable approach so that we may use to the maximum extent in the national interest all the resources available.  That is why I stressed at the beginning that it seems to me it was a mistake to indicate a definite decision or to suggest that there was no possible alternative to the lines laid down in that decision.</P>
    <P>In recent times the attitude adopted by the Department has caused concern. Not merely is that concern being reflected in the authoritarian attitude adopted in connection with the university question but also in connection with the articles published recently in <i>Studies</i>.  This has caused a great deal of concern in quarters that hitherto probably were not in some cases aware of and never expected an attitude to be adopted comparable to that expressed in the article which has given rise to so many opinions being expressed by people qualified to speak on this subject, who are concerned, in their experience, with different aspects of the educational question.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside entirely the propriety of a civil servant of the rank of Assistant Secretary&mdash;I described him last week as Secretary&mdash;it is a departure from precedent in this country that civil servants should express views that specifically do not reflect the views of the Minister or the Government.  It is well established practice here that in discussing Estimates or legislation, in the presentation of either a case or a <Col N="1738" /> viewpoint, whenever a civil servant expresses a view the person on whose behalf he expresses that opinion or viewpoint is the Minister for the time being or, as the case may be, the Government for the time being.  This seems to have marked a departure from that and that is the most serious aspect of it.  It displayed an extraordinary bias, a bias partly corrected or attempted to have been corrected at the end of the article, against religious orders who have made such a remarkable contribution here and, as shown in one of the articles, a contribution at great personal and individual sacrifices; a bias against academic distinction, a bias against consultation.</P>
    <P>To that extent, it conforms with the attitude adopted in respect of the decision laid down by the Minister and the Government for the Higher Education Authority and a general tendency towards a levelling down rather than an up-grading.  These are matters that evoked and secured a very quick response from different highly qualified persons to such an extent that people who in the past might not have been so aware became for the first time aware of many defects in the attitude of the Department.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects in it which are open to comment.  One suggested that all improvements have taken place in the last five years.  Leaving aside other political Parties, that was strong criticism of the Minister's colleagues; but the over-riding impression having read the article, which I did, is that it has a number of good points as well&mdash;it was not all on the debit side. However, having read the informed criticisms of the article by qualified people, I was left with the impression that some of the changes made are made merely for the sake of change and that a number of them have not been well thought out.</P>
    <P>That is why I suggest at this stage&mdash; I have no interest in or connection with either university in Dublin except to visit them on occasions to speak or to listen to discussions or debate&mdash;that the over-riding consideration which must guide our deliberations on this matter is to have the widest possible consultation with all interests concerned <Col N="1739" /> on an open and frank basis without laying down in advance predetermined conditions or a predetermined course of action, because we are now legislating for the present only. If, after the discussions which are undertaken, legislation is proposed, then it should be of a minimal character, laying down the broad framework, conscious that whatever we do or say now will not be the last word on this matter&mdash;that it is reasonable to assume and natural to expect that many of the decisions which might in present circumstances appear to be desirable and appropriate may not be appropriate and may, indeed, have to be altered or amended in five, ten or twenty years, because all experience indicates that university education and universities have long traditions, some valuable, some not so valuable.</P>
    <P>What we want is to evolve a system which will suit our needs now and, in so far as we can, the immediate future, and take appropriate action to deal with what we regard as the needs of the years immediately ahead.  It would be a mistake to imagine that whatever we do today will be the last word or the final settlement of the question.  This whole question has had a long history and anything we do can be regarded only as a continuing part of a historical process.  It is important that we should do the right thing and the best hope of our doing the right thing is in consultation on the widest possible basis, in a spirit of goodwill and without appearing to be authoritarian.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental mistake the Minister and the Government are making at the moment.  Because they have been so long in a particular position, Ministers or their advisers get into fixed attitudes, rigid approaches. As many questions are, this is a question that does not permit of a simple or easy solution.  Above all, where we consider the whole broad spectrum of higher education it is necessary that we should not be too rigid, that we should have a flexible approach and that we should approach it in a spirit that we are prepared to get what we regard as the best out of all those who have a contribution to make towards <Col N="1740" /> shaping a system that will serve the real needs of Ireland and the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister and his Department on the amount of money they have made available for education this year and to emphasise that the increase of £8 million which they have made available is an added incentive to those involved in education and to those who will benefit from education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to many speeches from members of the Opposition and members of my own Party, some of which were critical and others complimentary to the Department and the Minister.  I do not want to compliment or criticise but I want to speak about a few relevant matters which have grieved me and many sectors of the community regarding our free education system and our education system in general.  First of all, I should like to speak about physical education.  In my view the Department of Education have been dragging their feet considerably in regard to physical education. For the past few years we have been hearing that the Department are going to set up a centre in which PT instructors can be trained.  We are still awaiting this centre.  The Department and the Minister do not really realise the benefits of physical education and if they do then they must be condemned for not taking positive action in regard to setting up this centre.  Our PT instructors are as qualified as it is possible to be.  One cannot in this country become a qualified PT instructor because there is no place in which one can be fully trained by a professional man.  Most of them, in order to attain the standard they have, had to go to England or some of them to America. Most of them go to Loughborough where they take a fortnight's course or at their own expense a six months course to become PT instructors. Others are ex-Army men, qualified PT instructors, but who still go to Loughborough to get added experience. These men come back and take up positions as permanent instructors in our schools.  Most of the secondary schools have arrangements and facilities for PT instruction and these are <Col N="1741" /> being staffed by men who cannot be classed as professional PT instructors. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to avoid any further feet dragging by the Department and to take positive action on the setting up of a centre in which PT instructors can get fully trained so that we will not be approached as we have been time and time again by our PT teachers to have this centre set up.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in regard to this and that is the proposal from the Department to bring in a man from England, not an Irishman, to train these men.  I object strongly to this because they have had enough time to send one, two or three of our own men, at the Department's expense, across the water to become professionally trained men and these men could come back and train instructors in this field. There is no one to blame but the Department themselves for being in the position that we have no centre here. I would ask the Minister to take positive action on this as soon as he can. I know money was made available for it but nothing ever happened.</P>
    <P>The free books scheme was mentioned. We all know that free books are fairly easily available to most students if the schoolmaster can make a claim for free books.  Deputy Gerry Collins complained that the free books scheme was being abused in many ways and I am inclined to agree with him.  I feel that the books are not looked after by the pupils and that the concession is, perhaps, too lavishly given.  On the other hand, I do not agree with the point of view of some speakers on the opposite side that if we give out free books they should be redeemable because that might cause a situation where there would be 50 children in a class, possibly 45 books would be redeemed and there might be 55 in the following class.  Then you would have a situation in which one child would have an old book without a cover and the other child, one of the lucky ten, would have a brand new book.  However, in the case of a family I would agree that the books should be handed down to the next member of the family.</P>
    <P>The free books scheme should be <Col N="1742" /> extended.  There are certain sectors which now avail of free books and also free education, people who because of circumstances beyond their control would not have been able to avail of education if they had to pay for it. They can also avail of free books. There are other sections, people who are deemed to be in the middle class, people who own their own houses, people who are deemed to be well off but have probably very heavy commitments. This bracket should be included in the free books scheme.  If they have by their own initiative made strides to better themselves they should not be debarred from the free books scheme.  There is a certain amount of class distinction because some of the children say: &ldquo;His father is a blue card holder.  He is entitled to free books.&rdquo;  The extension I suggest will eliminate that among the children and also among the teachers.</P>
    <P>We are coming to the stage in education when we will have to provide some kind of a hot meal for children who travel long distances.  I know of children who travel from County Meath to Blanchardstown school.  They have to travel a very long distance and leave their homes at ten minutes to eight in the morning.  The Department's attitude is that they probably could go the other way and would perhaps not have to travel as far.  Those children travel to the vocational school.  Their desire was to attend a vocational school and not a secondary school so the distance they have to travel is by no means of their own making.  From their home to the vocational school happens to be longer than that to the secondary school.  Those children should be provided with a hot meal or some type of dispensing machine should be made available in the school from which they could get hot soup. I know they have this in some schools and at break time the children can go to those dispensing machines and obtain hot soup or some other hot drink.  The Department could bear that in mind in regard to this school.</P>
    <P>With regard to our national schools, I want to mention Castleknock school in County Dublin.  This school is in <Col N="1743" /> a very bad condition.  We approached the Minister to build a new school and we know it is on the way but on those dark mornings there is no light in the school.  I know that plans for a new school are being prepared but the children still have to attend the school. The headmaster arrives before the children and he has candles lit by the time the children arrive.  How primitive can you get in this day and age that you have candlelight in a school as near to Dublin as Castleknock?  If you want to see the candlelight you have only to go there at five minutes past nine in the morning.  Even a temporary measure, some kind of ESB installation or even gaslight, would assist the school for the few winter months.  The children should not be obliged to go to a school where they have to study practically by candlelight in this day and age. Something should be done about this.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with industrial schools and the Department's attitude towards them.  I know the late Minister for Education, Deputy Donogh O'Malley, set up a committee to look into the working of those schools and see what could be done about them. The unfortunate thing about this is that the committee have not issued a report yet and we have no idea when it will be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good.  I understand that this report is so complicated that we will have to get explanatory notes at the bottom of every page to illustrate what has been done.  While I agree that a certain number of intellectuals should be on such committees surely the people who would know most about industrial schools and reformatories are the people involved in the teaching and running of them?  I know that some of those people were consulted but their views were not appreciated as far as I am led to believe by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one particular industrial school in mind and I am going to stress a few figures in regard to it. I refer to Artane industrial school whose life seems to be in jeopardy. This school, whether it is going to stay in existence or not, has served the <Col N="1744" /> city very well.  It has also served County Dublin and the children from all over Ireland.  Those children have been maintained, clothed, looked after, fed and educated by the Christian Brothers in Artane industrial school. The Brothers are in receipt of a capitation fee of £4. 2. 6. per child for feeding them and also keeping their own house in repair, paying their own staff, paying the manager, the deputy manager and the teaching staff. In this day and age £4. 2. 6. might keep the child for a week but I do not think it would clothe him and it certainly would not maintain the school, pay the lighting, heating or other facilities which the Christian Brothers have to install in the school.</P>
    <P>The manager in an industrial school in this country gets nothing.  There is no allowance either for him or the deputy manager.  The teaching staff get a capitation grant on the average attendance in the school.  The principal of the school gets nothing.  In most schools of this type there is a band but the bandmaster gets nothing.  The woodwork instructor gets nothing and the cook gets nothing.  The farm workers are usually paid out of whatever profit is available from the farm. Usually in those schools there is a fair slice of land attached to them.</P>
    <P>The housemaster gets nothing.  The general maintenance of the schools, the heating, lighting, repair work, or anything else which is done must be met by the Christian Brothers.  No allowance is made by the Department.  I would ask the Minister not alone in reference to Artane, but in regard to all industrial schools and reformatories, even prior to this report coming out, to try to give a bigger capitation allowance to those schools, particularly when he realises the difficulties under which they have to work.  Expenses are increasing daily.  They also have to procure outside staff, laymen to give instruction in whatever trades the children are taught.  A bandmaster has to be a qualified man and has to be paid out of the Christian Brothers' own funds.  There is no allowance from the Department for this.  It would greatly help those schools if the Minister could take a look at this whole matter and make some specific allotment to them <Col N="1745" /> by way of increased capitation grant. Those schools usually have large groups of children and many of the schools have a lot of expenses.  If the Department could be a little more lenient as regards heating, lighting, repairs and so on it would ease the burden on the industrial schools.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between industrial schools in England, Northern Ireland and here.  The manager in Northern Ireland starts with a salary of £1,760 and the deputy manager £1,600. The teaching staff are paid according to qualification plus £100 for specially equipped schools, plus, possibly, a further £300.  They work an average of 15 hours a week.  The principal teacher gets £1,600, the bandmaster £1,300, the woodwork instructor £1,000, the cook £12 12s. 6d. a week, the housemaster £1,500 and the farm workers are paid according to the scale.  If those figures are compared with ours it will be seen that we are neglecting a sector of the community who have looked after the less fortunate members of the community, the less fortunate children, down through the years.  It is time we took a good look at our industrial schools and made up our minds whether we are going to keep them on. The Minister should do something further for them.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised in this House of boys and girls who pass the leaving certificate examination at 16 years of age and who wish to enter the university but who cannot be given the grant because the minimum qualifying age is 17.  The students have to repeat the leaving certificate examination in the following year and there is the danger that they may fail the examination because of having to do a new course&mdash;the course changes from year to year&mdash;or that they may not get the necessary four honours and therefore will not qualify for the grant.  I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister about the case of a girl who had obtained six honours in the leaving certificate examination but could not qualify for the university grant because she had not reached the minimum age.  I would ask the Minister to expedite a decision on this matter because there is grave <Col N="1746" /> concern about it.  Numerous cases have been brought to my notice.  I should like to receive some indication from the Minister that the scheme has been revised.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has dealt with Deputies.  He has always been co-operative as far as I and Deputies on this side are concerned. He is making a good job of the Department.  Education is essential to the national economy.  If we have not education, we have nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate has taken on a new importance since the introduction of free post-primary education which is a welcome step on which there is general agreement.  It is to the everlasting credit of the former Minister for Education, the late Deputy O'Malley, that he was not afraid to say that he would adopt whatever good proposals were put forward for the provision of educational facilities no matter by whom they were put forward or from what quarter they came and that he would not apologise for adopting that course.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken on this Estimate have referred to the question of the closing of small schools. Parents should be consulted in every case where it is intended to close a small school as they are the first educators of their children.  From an educational viewpoint, the larger school may appear to be the better proposition but I am sure that every Deputy could point to instances where not too long ago children from small schools fared very well indeed in open competition for scholarships with pupils from five-and six-teacher schools.  It is also true to say that in many rural areas the local primary school teacher is an unpaid public representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the decline in the rural population it is necessary in some instances to close rural schools but I would appeal to the Minister to have recourse to this action only as a last resort and <Col N="1747" /> then only after very careful consideration and consultation with the various interests involved.  I believe that the position up to the present has been that if the officials of the Department had the school manager on their side, in many instances, they went ahead without consulting the people who should have been consulted all along the line.  While the Minister assured the House last week that he was now proposing to have that type of consultation, I hope it is not too late and that some of the problems that have arisen as a result of lack of consultation will be as readily solved as the Minister hopes.</P>
    <P>The school has been for long an institution in every parish.  The closing of rural schools is an indication of a dying community.  The closing of a school is resented by the people in the locality affected.  The idea of centralisation can be pushed too far.  It is hardly realistic that people living in Dublin should decide an important question of this nature.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a situation that has arisen in Wicklow.  The Minister is conversant with the case.  My colleague, Deputy Michael O'Higgins, raised the question of Kilmacoo National School in this debate.  The Minister said that he intended receiving a deputation from the area.  The deputation, accompanied by three public representatives from Wicklow, met the Minister.  Arising out of the discussion that took place my impression was that the Minister would send a representative from his Department to Kilmacoo to discuss with the parents there the question of reopening the school as he was very perturbed because a strike had been in progress there since September. I am open to correction by the Minister if what I am saying is wrong but I felt that the Minister told the deputation that if, when the case was put before the parents and the circumstances in regard to securing teachers was explained to them, the Minister would leave it in their hands as to whether the school would be reopened or not.</P>

I think the members of the deputation told him they were prepared to have the school reopened under those conditions, but now it seems that somewhere along the line something happened and these people are now being told that the school will not be reopened in spite of the assurance the Minister gave them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to transport facilities, I think it is reasonable to say that there is not a constituency in the country where transport to both primary and post-primary schools causes more problems than in Wicklow. Children still have to travel considerable distances to the various pick-up points, and in a number of isolated areas it is impossible to get more than eight eligible children, that is, children who are over the required two miles, for some of the post-primary schools. In these cases there is a genuine need for transport, and I would appeal to the Minister to provide the transport even though in many instances there may be only seven or eight children in the district who would qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy <Col N="1750" /> would give me particulars, I could help in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will send the particulars to the Minister.  Every Deputy seems to have mentioned the problem of half-empty buses passing children who are only a few yards inside the two-mile limit.  I can understand fully that no matter what limit the Minister sets there will always be somebody just a few yards inside it.  In most of these cases the Minister is prepared to have CIE issue tickets to these children, but to my mind the fare charged by CIE is too high.  At the moment the charge is £2 5s per child per term.</P>
      <P>From what I know of the people in Wicklow who have been given permission to purchase these tickets, I believe most of them are not able to afford them, particularly where there are three and four children in a house. One can imagine the situation in the lower-income group where a man has three children.  If he has to buy tickets from CIE it will cost him £24. 15. 0. for the school year.  If a man has four children it will cost him £33.  What is happening is that the children are not able to avail of the bus tickets the Minister in his kindness is issuing. If he could induce CIE to reduce the charge I believe more children could avail of the facilities and that CIE, in the long run, would probably have a greater income from that source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to mention in passing that while free transport may be something new, subsidised transport is not new.  In 1953 the Wicklow Vocational Education Committee introduced a scheme of travel scholarships to post-primary schools.  The late Minister for Education, Deputy Moylan, when he was speaking in Wicklow in 1954 at the opening of the vocational school there, said that he hoped to provide post-primary education in rural areas on the basis of the scheme that was then in operation in Wicklow.  When this scheme was introduced by the Department we in Wicklow had subsidised transport to every post-primary school under the control of the vocational people.  The only thing that was necessary for the Department to do was to put flesh <Col N="1751" /> upon the bones of the scheme we had in operation there for close on 13 years.</P>
    <P>On the vexed question of teaching children through the medium of Irish, it is, in my opinion, bordering on the criminal to insist on children of tender years being taught other subjects through the medium of a language which they have never heard in their own homes.  I know that those who introduced these proposals were acting from the highest motives and that they believed that with such a method the Irish language would be revived.  Unfortunately, the various census statistics prove that, far from that being the case, there are fewer Irish speakers with every passing year.  Even the Gaeltacht, which should be the powerhouse of the language, is growing smaller. I think it is true to say that compulsion is a word to which the Irish people have never taken kindly.</P>
    <P>As far as post-primary education is concerned, I should like to refer to the introduction of new methods of teaching maths without proper preparation. They should first have been introduced in earlier classes in national schools. They are being launched in post-primary schools without a proper introduction and without the provision of a sufficient number of teachers adequately trained in this sphere.  Even the textbooks are inadequate, and students doing the intermediate certificate next year have not the benefit of either proper textbooks or teachers sufficiently well versed in the new treatment of mathematics.</P>
    <P>Oral examinations, which were to play an important part in the intermediate certificate language courses, have now been relegated to a lesser role as a result of the method whereby the actual teacher of the pupil for examination can give his own pupil from ten to 15 per cent of the marks. What steps have been taken to ensure that all teachers will use the same standard of marking?</P>
    <P>The whole question of the grouping of subjects for leaving certificate seems to have been rushed into.  Is a child of 15 mature enough to opt for a group of subjects which will dictate its future career?  Worse still is the fact that, at the age of 13, a child <Col N="1752" /> must make a selection of subjects for the group he will later opt for.  How many children, beginning their secondary course or even in their second year post-primary course, are in a position to say that they will pursue a particular group in the leaving certificate examination?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that until after the intermediate certificate.  They do not have to make the selection the Deputy talks about before the intermediate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The grouping of subjects on a specialised basis necessitates the creation of vast senior level centres where all the options and all the groups are available.  Is this advisable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to see huge, supermarket type schools where the pupil is only a number on the roll and not an individual and where the teacher must of necessity become a mere technician?  Surely the experience of other countries, where huge schools had to be broken down into smaller units, should be an example to us before we rush into something which may take years to put right?  No matter what options or facilities are available, there is no substitute for the close relationship of teacher, parent and pupil which can only be achieved in a school where each teacher can know each pupil and feel a personal responsibility for him or her.</P>
      <P>In some counties there seems to be a problem regarding the amalgamation of schools.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the position in Arklow, where there seems to be some delay because of what one might describe as lack of co-operation between the vocational education committee and the Brothers teaching there. I am sure everybody applauds the work the various teaching Orders have done through the years and I hope the Minister will be successful in bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Presentation Order in Baltinglass on the amalgamation with the Vocational Education <Col N="1753" /> Committee there.  I think that co-operation is something the Minister would like to see in many other places throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The prudent stewardship of the present Government and its contribution to the national progress is nowhere more evident than in the Department of Education.  The present Government can modestly claim that under its tutelage a veritable revolution has taken place in education. One might even say that a dynamic explosion has occurred in education in Ireland.  If there is this new awareness and involvement today in matters educational in Ireland it is because of the contribution of the present Government.  There are still those petty-minded individuals in the Opposition who attempt to denigrate the Government's achievements in this field but, as the old Irish proverb says: &ldquo;Molann an obair an fear&rdquo;.  The achievements in education can be witnessed on all sides.  Apart from the remarkable rise in post-primary education, the rise in school population at post-primary level and the rapid expansion of university education, the quality of building and the extension of curricula are also indications of progress.  Boys and girls are now entering an educational environment where merit has its own reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To speak in these terms, however, is not to be oblivious of or insensitive to the challenge still confronting the Minister in the further advance that should be aimed at.  I want to ask the Minister tonight and the officers of his Department to give the closest consideration and attention to an idea that I have had for some time.  I am sure it is not a new idea&mdash;they may have already thought of it in the Department <Col N="1754" /> or it may have been already put forward by other people.  Everybody knows that the new opportunities in post-primary education have taxed the accommodation resources of our universities.  Academicians and pupils alike are working under most frustrating conditions and, irrespective of the dynamic steps taken by the Government to offset the problem, for many years our university accommodation cannot and will not in the near future be able to cope with the additional needs and provide a proper environment for all students.</P>
    <P>The problem is a peculiarly frustrating one in Cork University.  The wonder is, in my opinion, that the whole administrative system has not broken down completely.  The President and members of the staff of the university are daily at their wits' end to find lecture-hall accommodation and other facilities for the hundreds of new students seeking admission each year. I am sure it will be accepted that to fit 160 students into a hall or lectureroom originally built for nearer to 40 is not conducive to a studious atmosphere or academic advancement.  I think it is because of situations such as I have described that we have student unrest and frustration.</P>
    <P>I make a reasonable proposal towards ameliorating and attenuating the problem.  The main accommodation problem is in the arts and commerce faculties.  It is there more than elsewhere that the problem seems almost insurmountable.  There is a marked tendency for students to enter these two faculties.  More alarming is the very high failure rate for students in those faculties which, I believe, runs at an average of 50 per cent per annum.  Having taken a note of these figures, there is very little need for me to underline or to emphasise the heartbreak and frustration that this promotes for students and parents alike. Indeed, the wonder of it all is that, in the face of such physical conditions, the failure rate is not higher.</P>
    <P>In the United States, in Great Britain and indeed in other countries, students are allowed to sign on as external students at a given university.  They study for the arts and commerce faculties and, indeed, in some cases, for <Col N="1755" /> the science faculties as well in educational institutions that are accepted and recognised by the university.  As here in Dublin, some students can become external members of their university while studying for their B.Sc. degree at Bolton Street and take the same examination as their counterparts in England. I see no good reason why first arts and first commerce students could not be afforded this facility here in Ireland, whereby they could commence their studies in the environment of their secondary school.</P>
    <P>The proposed advanced leaving certificate is generally accepted by education authorities as being nebulous and, I think, in its place could be put courses in keeping with the first arts and first commerce syllabus.  The entry standard could be maintained at the two honours level and thus, in succeeding examinations, the degree courses could be continued at university level.  Nobody can convince me that secondary school teachers are not more capable of adequately and competently equipping their students to reach the required standard for these examinations.  Indeed, I shall go so far as to say that, in many instances, their approach would be more thorough and more comprehensive.  Boys and girls would benefit socially and emotionally from the further year at school.  Furthermore, the frustration that failure must bring to students could be lessened and blunted considerably and, most important of all, the financial loss to the parents would be negligible in comparison to that which would accrue if such a year was spent at a university.  Either way, such a year would have a cultural and an educational advantage and I believe that it would recommend itself to teachers and parents alike.  There is nothing to prevent schools from pooling their resources and obtaining the services of the best teachers in the particular area to conduct such courses.</P>
    <P>Some people might argue that the cultural benefits of a university would be lost in this way.  I do not think that that would be so.  The schools in the country in most cases&mdash;indeed, in the majority of cases&mdash;offer a cultural environment which is as good as anything <Col N="1756" /> the university can offer and, indeed, as good as anything the schools throughout Europe have to offer.  There are opportunities for participation in drama, in debates, in physical education, in music and, above all, there is an opportunity to participate in games and athletic sport.  All these facilities and amenities are offered at secondary schools and the social advantages from these are well above those offered at university level.</P>
    <P>Since the advent of civics into the secondary school curriculum I would say that the standards and the depth of education are second to none.  The advantages to a student doing a first year arts or commerce course in a secondary school would be much greater than those he would get if he were doing the course at a university, bearing in mind the 50 per cent possibility of failure with the consequent psychological upset and, as I have said, the financial upset that failure can bring about.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister to give this proposal every consideration. I am aware that there will be many conservative and, sometimes, over-selfish people who will adopt the attitude that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained, and this could well be a stumbling block in this proposal.  It will not come easy to university dons to admit that their job can be successfully done by secondary school teachers.  At that level of education, I believe the arguments are overwhelming on the side of the secondary school teacher.  I know that the Minister is only too familiar with the type of academic arrogance one meets at university level, but this proposal should be given an arising and allowed to stand or fall on its academic merits.  More important still, the heartbreak and frustration of failure would be blunted and, certainly, lessened.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I should like to refer.  I know the Minister is aware of it but there is no harm in referring to it again.  It concerns the transport system.  We have a situation at the moment in a place called Ballinaspittle, near Kinsale, where we have the school bus going to Bandon.  It picks up two brothers and leaves their two sisters.  The two sisters have to be driven by car two miles <Col N="1757" /> down the road so that they can get on the bus to go to school.  In my opinion with the best will in the world, nobody can but say that this is bureaucracy gone mad.  This is a ridiculous situation. It is a situation that I hope the Minister will right because, to any right thinking person&mdash;I know we must have rules and regulations&mdash;this is taking it a bit too far.</P>
    <P>Flexibility in such situations as I have mentioned would go a long way towards alleviating a lot of the hardships in the transport system.  I know we have had problems.  If we had not a transport system we would not have problems.  I am glad we have problems. Any system that works efficiently must have teething troubles.  I can speak only for my own constituency, and there the transport system is working well.  People are appreciative of the fact that children have free transport available to them and that they are probably much safer travelling in these buses despite the Jeremiahs who, when the scheme was introduced, were saying the opposite.  There have been very few accidents in these buses.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  This refers to my own constituency. It is in relation to the Crab Lane controversy.  The only way I can describe the members of the LFM who are endeavouring to have the Irish curriculum upset at the moment is that they are people who have committed treason.  They have no interest whatsoever in the educational facilities being offered to the Irish people, either in Crab Lane or any other school for that matter.  Their only motive is to procure a public platform to bring their brand of Irish Paisleyism to the forefront.  Certain matters&mdash;matters that were inaccurate in the first place and dishonestly presented in the second place&mdash;have been highlighted over the past few weeks. To bring before the people this sort of dishonest presentation does no service, in my opinion, either to them or to the people they purport to represent.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister to be very wary in his treatment of those people.  My experience is that they <Col N="1758" /> would be ready to stoop to any level in order to put their point of view forward.  There are so few schools teaching through the medium of Irish that I ask: Are not those people who want to have their children taught through Irish in at least one or two schools in a city like Cork entitled to have such schools available to them?  They talk of democracy in the Government attitude to the Irish language. They should, first of all, practice democracy before they preach it. I promised the Minister not to speak too long.</P>

      <P>I can see we have a coalition coming up again.  In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he has carried out his onerous task.  The Minister had a difficult job to follow in the footsteps of a man like the late Deputy Donough O'Malley.  The fact that the present Minister has made such an impact on the Department, coming after a man of the calibre of the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, speaks well for the present Minister and, indeed, for the future of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom rud éigin a rá ar an Meastachán seo.  First of all, I should like to say that the Department of Education is probably the Department I know best.  I have had an association with it for many years and I should like to put on record that in all those years in my dealings with the Department of Education I met nothing but courtesy, and willingness to help, from all the officers of the Department andfrom the various Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want anything I have to say on this Estimate to be construed <Col N="1759" /> as destructive criticism.  I shall try to put a few points in which I believe before the Minister.  I should like, first of all, to say that I think education at all levels should be pursued with the utmost courage, energy and initiative.  Education should be kept apart from side issues such as economic pressure of little expediency; that is, if we are not to fall behind to any extent in standards.  The involvement of parents, teachers and representatives of students&mdash;student organisations&mdash;is desirable.  There should be dialogue among those in order to ensure the co-operation which is essential if we are to get adequate returns for our very heavy investment in education.</P>
    <P>It should not be the prerogative of people in high places to take solely on themselves the right to dictate to those most involved in the field of education.  There should be dialogue which would lead to co-operation between parents, teachers and the Department in order to ensure the progress which we all desire so much.  It is heartening to know that parents are becoming aware of their rights and responsibilities in the field of education, where enthusiasm should be tempered with moderation and discretion.  In this connection, frustration could set in through unqualified people becoming leaders of parents' organisations. It must be remembered that the chief influence in education is in the home. Consequently, a grave responsibility rests on parents.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see so many parents taking an active interest in adult education.  I have nothing but the highest praise for bodies who organise courses in this field.  They are to be highly commended.  We have such a body in Sligo town and the classes in adult education are highly satisfactory.  There is one thing that many people&mdash;and, mark you, people involved in education&mdash;appear to miss out on.  We are only at the beginning of an educational revolution in this country.  When I cast my mind back to the days when I was at secondary school&mdash; I think this applies to quite a lot of people here&mdash;only about 20,000 <Col N="1760" /> students in this country were getting post-primary education.  They were, if you like, a privileged class.  They were children whose parents, or some of their relatives, could afford education. Probably the national teacher said to the parents that their boy or girl was bright and advised them to send the child forward to secondary education.  Besides that, the course was very limited and the number of subjects was also limited.  Nowadays, in order to look at education properly&mdash;I am not sure of my figures but I think we have 180,000 or thereabouts receiving post-primary education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>The curriculum has been broadened in order to take in all ranges of ability from the highest to the lowest level.  If we look at education as it is today, in a proper perspective, we must take that into account.</P>
      <P>With that in mind, a gigantic task faces this country and it has to be tackled in a vigorous manner.  We should not go too fast.  When we are inclined to go too fast more snags are bound to arise than if we took things a little bit slower&mdash;that is, of course, in certain fields.  There are other fields in which we appear to be going too slowly.  Anyway, forward steps have been taken in education.  It has been taken out of the doldrums in which it had rested for many years.  For that, I should like to join with others in a tribute to the late Minister for Education, Deputy Donogh O'Malley. Even though he did take much of his policy from the Fine Gael policy in <i>Towards a Just Society,</i> nevertheless, he is to be admired for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a teacher, I must refer to substandard schools.  Very much has been done in this field and we must give credit for what has been done.  Perhaps the reason there is not greater acceleration is that there was an accumulated neglect down the years and, when the problem was first tackled, the job was a bit big.  However, much has been done and remedies have been put into effect.  I am sure that neither the Minister nor anybody else will be satisfied until the last substandard <Col N="1761" /> school in this country disappears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation has been tackled in a pretty realistic manner and I should like to compliment the Minister on it.  I am sure he will give every facility to eliminate substandard schools as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that national school children attend school at a very impressionable age.  It is not conducive to good education nor to making a good impression on their tender minds if they must spend their youthful years amid squalor and filth in circumstances as I knew them.  It is difficult to teach children the beauty of things around them if they are taught in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>To come back to the question of dialogue and co-operation with the teachers, I would suggest that in the erection of schools the teacher should be consulted.  The teacher has to work in the school.  He has to use the equipment in the school.  He has to use the accommodation provided.  From dayto-day experience, he knows what layout is best suited for maximum efficiency in teaching and in pupil control. I am sorry that this consultation does not take place.  The teacher is not consulted although he could give very useful advice.  About three years ago, I went into a very modern school but there were many improvements that I could have recommended, had I been asked.  In this modern school, we have not a place even to hang a map: that is absolutely true.  One has to try to swing it over a blackboard: the blackboard may be required for some other purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be at least an acre of land attached to each new school because games are an integral part of education.  Playing football, for instance, trains the eye and engenders self-discipline and a spirit of co-operation.  I do not want to labour the point, but I believe playing facilities would provide a deterrent to juvenile delinquency as against the system of having children herded together in a small yard, which is the position in many national schools today. I should like the Minister to consider that suggestion.  He may be able to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Visual aids are becoming daily more important in the field of education. They are an essential part of the equipment of any modern school.  I know something is being done in this direction and I am quite happy about the development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing good work.  I would, however, advise him to continue co-operation with parents especially in regard to the closing of schools.  I am against the closing of schools.  There is, of course, no future for the one-teacher school, but I should like to put it on the record that two-teacher schools have done tremendous work.  There is evidence of that in County Sligo where, year after year, more scholarship winners came out of two-teacher schools than out of multi-teacher schools.  That, in itself, proves the efficiency of the two-teacher schools.  The closing of schools should be approached slowly. The parents should be consulted.  I take it the idea is there in the Department already to send an inspector to have a chat with the parents in such <Col N="1763" /> cases.  That is the correct approach. I am sure the Minister is aware that it is very hard to override sentiment and tradition.  I know that there are cases in which parents object to the closing of a school because of sentiment and tradition, and perhaps for other reasons as well.  If matters are approached gradually the parents may eventually come around to the idea themselves.  I do not like the idea of compulsory closing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Steps should be taken, too, to ensure that there is sufficient accommodation and sufficient teachers for the pupils in the schools to which they are sent.  There is a case of which I am personally aware in which there should be a third teacher; there are, in fact, only two.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio should be 20 pupils per teacher.  That would be the ideal number to enable the teacher to give individual attention to each pupil in a class.  Big classes affect the teaching because standards vary; there is the bright child, the not so bright and the dull.  The old axiom was that the teacher went as fast as the slowest child.  If that is followed to its logical conclusion, then the bright child must be kept back and does not reap the full benefit that he should.</P>
      <P>The importance of the primary school in laying the real foundation of all future education cannot be overemphasised. From the point of view sub-standard schools are a menace because in such schools the best impression cannot be made on the youthful mind.  The child who does not get a good foundation in the national school will inevitably find himself falling behind in the post-primary school, whether it be secondary or vocational.</P>
      <P>Primary education is, of course, no longer sufficient to equip any child for life, particularly if our young people are going to play a significant role in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of an inspector should be <Col N="1764" /> that of an adviser.  I suggest again, as I suggested last year, that a note should be sent to all inspectors of primary schools telling them that any criticism they may have to make or level at a teacher should not be made or levelled in the presence of the children.  That has happened to my own knowledge.</P>
    <P>I am glad a new curriculum is being devised.  The old curriculum was outmoded and out-dated.  It served no useful purpose in modern conditions.  The abolition of the primary certificate was a step in the right direction.  Record cards are a much better system of assessment.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with transport to secondary and vocational schools.  Like Deputy Crowley, I too have come across cases which it is very hard to understand.  I know two brothers; one gets transport while the other brother has to cycle three miles and, at the end of that three miles, the bus that collected his brother then collects him.  On the way home that boy is dropped three miles away and has to cycle home while his brother goes all the way on the bus.  These matters are hard to understand.</P>
    <P>I also know a case which I think should be ironed out immediately. Children are not allowed free transport on the bus because they are not going to the nearest school.  The only other way for them to get to school is to go on the normal bus service which leaves them one hour late for school every day.  It is a serious matter for a child to miss one hour's education every day.</P>
    <P>I have always been a great admirer of the tremendous work the religious orders did in this country before we had post-primary education.  This interest of the religious orders probably goes back to the time when Ireland was known as the Island of Saints and Scholars.  We should remember that in the dark ages in Europe it was the monks and missionaries from Ireland who travelled the highways and byways of Central Europe.  They went as far down as the Apennines in Italy where they founded the famous monastery at Bobbio.  Their contribution towards education down through the years must be praised, and we <Col N="1765" /> hope that nothing will happen in modern times to affect those religious communities.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the common basic pay scale.  The acceptance by the INTO of the recent salary proposals was based on the principle of a common basic scale of salaries for all teachers and a common scheme of arbitration and conciliation.  I am aware that difficulties have arisen in the secondary teachers' profession.  All I will say is that every effort should be made to smooth out those difficulties as soon as possible.  I am in favour of a common basic scale.</P>
    <P>With this tidal wave of education I am wondering what will happen in the years ahead to the young people coming out from the secondary schools with leaving certificates.  What will be done for the boys and girls who do not get four honours?  I doubt very much if provision is being made for employment opportunities for the thousands of boys and girls who will be roaming the country looking for jobs. This may not be a direct function of the Minister for Education, but it must be referred to on this Estimate. This is an aspect which has not occurred to the parents yet but they are starting to wonder what this educational drive is about.  When these people are educated there must be employment opportunities for them.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by wishing the Minister the very best of luck in carrying out a very difficult job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long on this matter.  I finished my education rather abruptly at the age of 13 years and, from what I have seen in this House during a long period in regard to the education of some of the children I saw here, I have to thank God that I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the transport position.  Changing the hours has undoubtedly caused consternation, particularly in the rural areas where children of four, five and six years of age have to get out in the dark of the mornings and travel along roads on which motorists are travelling to work at anything from 60 to 80 miles an hour.  I suggest <Col N="1766" /> to the Minister that the school hours should be changed.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for what he has done in my area in regard to school transport, but I must say that CIE are either bluffing him or letting him down.  Some time ago I raised the question of the children travelling from the Carrigalow district to school in Cobh along a road on which 500 men travel to work every morning in the rush hour.  CIE's cure for that was to tell them to go to the Carrigalow railway station which is a mile or 1½ miles or more from there and they would be transported from the station to the school.  In both cases those children have to travel along a dangerous and treacherous road.  I suggest to the Minister that he should communicate again with CIE and get a bus for those children.  Anything else is no use.  I suppose nothing will be done until a few tragedies have occurred.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the extension he gave to the children who have to come in to the Midleton secondary and vocational schools.  The bus route has now been extended as far as Churchtown South but there are still 15 children who have to travel in every morning from the Ballycrennane district.  They have to come a further four miles walking or on bicycles to catch the bus in Churchtown South.  A further extension of the bus routes there is absolutely essential. There is no use in having young children travelling along the roads in the dark of the morning to catch buses. They have to travel that distance in the morning and that distance back again at night.  If there are to be transport facilities they should be equally available to all and not just available to one or two here or there.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to deal with is the Ballymacoda and Red Barn bus to Youghal.  The bus provided there is completely unable to take the number of pupils that have to travel by it.  I have already urged that a larger bus be provided for those pupils.</P>
    <P>I have also heard rumours about the proposals of the Minister and his Department to close Belvelly school. <Col N="1767" /> school is a comparatively new school with every facility and amenity that could be provided.  It is ridiculous to close that school and send those pupils into the town of Cobh.  We hear much talk about going back to the land, but the policy of the Department of Education is to drive people into towns and cities.  Anyone going into towns and cities will have different ideas on returning home.</P>
    <P>I wonder what course is education going to take?  We had an exhibition here outside the Dáil last week.  If this exhibition is a result of the training the pupils are getting in the universities, then the sooner those pupils are taken, body and bones, and put somewhere out on the land where they will be able to do an honest day's work the better it will be for the nation. Too much of that type of tripe is going on, not so much in this country, but in other countries at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House on any matter but I give the facts as I see them.  I want those points I raised here in connection with CIE transport system remedied so that we need not be asking questions about them afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long but I would like to say a few words on this important Estimate.  First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the late Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, for having first introduced the scheme and put it into operation.  Secondly, I must compliment the present Minister who has taken over a very heavy responsibility. Under the circumstances he is doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our business to come here for every constituency and give our views. We must mention whatever complaints are made to us.  This is the place to convey them to the Minister.  So far as I can see, these are the complaints the Minister is getting from Deputies all around the House.  He is getting the usual complaints from the parents, teachers and children.  He is hearing what the Deputy himself knows to be necessary from what he hears in his <Col N="1768" /> constituency.  That is part of our job. Those are the things we learn going around meeting people.  Somebody said we were complaining a good bit on this side of the House.  I do not think we came in to make political speeches but we would like to express our views honestly on behalf of the people.  The Minister knows very well from the pressure that people are putting on him that there is still a lot of work to be done.  Every day is too short for the Minister and the week is too short for him to deal with the amount of work that is being brought to his notice and to his Department.  That is quite natural.  This is a big new scheme which is being availed of to the full.  I must congratulate the people on making full use of it when it is offered to them by the Department of Education in this country.</P>
    <P>Many extension works to schools have been sanctioned but, owing to financial circumstances, they are being left over.  Problems can arise which may force the Minister to leave things over.  It is my opinion that when new schools are being erected they should be made, in most cases, too big for the number of pupils who are starting in them.  Schools often prove too small for the number of pupils attending. I have known cases where schools were erected, like the one in Drumshanbo where the Minister and I met recently, and shortly after erection the schools are bursting their seams with an overflow of pupils.  I would ask the Minister, as a young Minister for Education, to take particular notice of that, despite the figures and statistics provided for him from the teachers and everybody else.  It seems that the numbers still increase over the numbers planned for.  We could spare ourselves this problem of extension work which I have mentioned earlier.  We have the school at Carrick-on-Shannon which is in need of extension.  I believe it is going to be replaced by a new school. We have schools in Ballinamore to which extensions have been sanctioned. The school at Manorhamilton has &ldquo;prefabs&rdquo; around it.  Everywhere we go we find &ldquo;prefabs&rdquo; around the schools.</P>
    <P>It is good to see the parents making <Col N="1769" /> their children avail of this very useful education in secondary schools.  We have &ldquo;prefabs&rdquo; in the secondary schools and in the colleges.  &ldquo;Prefabs&rdquo; are everywhere.  They are certainly playing a very useful part in the provision of classrooms, but in any school that has been built recently this should not happen.  I am sure that the Minister himself, when going around the country to various meetings, will see this and will take notice of it.  In the future schools should be planned on a larger scale than proposed.  We will not go very wrong then.  In my constituency of Sligo/Leitrim we have the usual complaint of many schools in rural areas having deteriorated as a result of our damp climate.  The years have left their mark and those schools, in many cases, are not up to the standard required for the proper education of our children.  They compare most unfavourably with either new or newly-repaired schools in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister is tackling the problem of the older schools&mdash;I know it is a big job&mdash;but he should pay urgent special attention to the matter of sanitary accommodation in those schools.  Children suffer because of the present arrangements in some of the older schools, apart from which it sets a bad example for them.  During a recent by-election campaign&mdash;in Wicklow, I think&mdash;I was impressed by the quality of some of the modern new schools, with the facilities and the amenities provided in them.  Such schools provide early good example and training for our children and fit them more suitably for life afterwards. I hope the Minister will do everything possible to ensure that such facilities are available to all children in all schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, our school transport system is having its teething troubles even at this stage. I asked a question last week about children in Calry, only four miles from Sligo town.  They have to be out of bed at 7 a.m. to be ready for the school bus at 7.40.  Though, as I have said, the school is only four miles away, they have to leave home shortly after 7.30. They arrive at the school long before <Col N="1770" /> time and they do not arrive home in the evening until 5 p.m.  That day is much too long for children of tender years and the arrangement does not measure up to what we had expected from the school transport system.  In regard to the children from the area to which I have been referring&mdash;only four miles from Sligo&mdash;I suggest the only solution is the provision of a minibus instead of having the children depend on the big bus which has to do a long journey first and then the shorter trip. It is wrong to have children out of bed so early in the morning and out of their homes so late in the afternoons.  The solution, as I have said, is the provision of a minibus.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the matter of school books for children.  As a member of a vocational education committee, I appreciate that it is not fair to have teachers inquiring into the means of children.  It is embarrassing for both teacher and child.  The teacher has to ensure that the child is a member of a family which has a medical card. That was the case last year and I do not know if there has been any radical change in the situation.  The medical card was the yardstick which determined the child's qualification for free books.  There should be some other method.  I realise the Department have increased the allocation under this heading but I suggest that the system should be changed completely from that which enjoined on the teacher to find out who could and who could not afford to pay for school books.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, and throughout the west, there are parents with large families living on a county council wage of about £10 or £11 a week.  Having provided for their families and paid their rents, it is difficult for such parents to buy school books whose price is far from what it was in my day when one could get books for 6d or 1/-. I wrote to the Department recently about a case and I suggest now to the Minister that the Department would be well advised to make concessions in isolated cases.  It will not happen in many cases and it is embarrassing and hurtful to children to ask them to go to school without being able to pay for Belvelly is in a rural area.  That the necessary books.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> I welcome the recent discussions on the provision of school meals.  Even a cup of hot tea or a bowl of hot soup would be much better than the cold lunches children take with them, sometimes not very nourishing.  School meals have been adopted in a big way in other countries and let us hope that we are not far from the time when all our children will be provided with nourishing meals at school.  In passing I should like to compliment all on the change that has taken place in our education system.  It is a good thing to see bus loads of children being taken to school, the children high, dry, safe from the weather.  It is something of which we should all be proud.</P>
    <P>The problem of the closure of schools arises in my area as it does in others. It is dying off a bit and we do not hear of so many schools being closed.  Early on, it was a big job for the Department. I recall visiting a school at a time when the Department's inspector was speaking about closing down a 65-pupil school.  I am glad to be able to say that school was not closed.  It would be a sad thing to see a school of that size being closed in a rural area.  I hope the Department will continue to keep open as many rural schools as possible, disregarding the economics of it.  The teachers are in the area, the children are convenient.  I hope the Minister will work on that line because God knows we have enough places closed without closing schools.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the time has come when all children with ability can go to university level.  Only a select few whose parents were wealthy could hope to get as far as the university in days gone by.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we owe a lot to the religious orders&mdash;the brothers and the nuns who run schools there.  They kept the schools open when it was not easy, when money was scarce.  The people are, and always will be, very much indebted to the brothers and sisters who have kept up the good work and who have found others to take their places when they grew old.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently signed a contract <Col N="1772" /> for the erection of a school of technology in Sligo.  It will be a great boost to Sligo in many ways and I know it will be fully availed of and packed to capacity when the time comes.  I expect it will not be too long until work commences on that school. I will not repeat the question of one child going on a bus and one child not going on a bus.  I know too much about that.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to speak about is schools for mentally retarded children.  There is no greater need for education in any field than in that field.  We have numbers of those children all over the country. Many of them are scarcely heard of. Their parents are nursing them and attending to them with nothing in view except to continue that work. The most essential thing for any Department at the moment is to make provision for those children.  There is one of those schools in Mohill where a great voluntary effort is being made.  The Department is making its contribution, but without the voluntary effort the grant would be of no use.  Judging by the progress that has been made and the number of children being brought to that school this thing should be very carefully examined by the Department who should get down to facts immediately and get all those children located.  The people will give every co-operation as regards transport and everything else if they find that schools are being provided, even a school where these children could be kept and cared for as is done at Cregg House outside Sligo town.  This school is packed to capacity and I would be safe in saying there are hundreds on the waiting list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief but there are a few things I want to mention and I will take them as I have made notes of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing is the education of mentally handicapped children.  There is a school in Athlone, which the Minister probably knows, which caters for some of our children from the Ballinasloe area.  I was at a meeting of the parents and people generally associated with that school last Monday night <Col N="1773" /> and I promised that I would bring to the Minister's notice a few things about the school.  This school is a small one started by the Parents and Friends of Mentally Handicapped Children in Athlone.  It has one teacher recognised by the Department and it now has the required number of children to have two recognised teachers.  I appeal to the Minister to look into that further.</P>
    <P>This particular school is paying for its own transport.  The transport of something like 25 children costs £150 a month and anyone can see that voluntary effort will not be able to continue that indefinitely.  I appeal to the Minister and the officials of his Department to look into the whole question of transport for mentally handicapped children.  I know it is completely different from the transport of the normal child.  Transport for mentally handicapped children will have to be done in a small way because these children need adults to travel with them.  I suggest a minibus for the Galway area from Loughrea into Galway.  Certainly, we have the number of children in that area. I do not know what the position in Athlone is.  I think they are bringing them in cars because they come diverse ways.  The Department should be looking on that with a kind eye and give them some help with their transport.</P>
    <P>There is another thing we lack in the country with regard to the mentally handicapped.  We lack not only schools but also centres for assessing the ability of those children.  Years ago, if a child was even slightly retarded, it was written off.  Nowadays we find that with specialised training and teaching these children can be taught to lead a useful existence and in many cases even in a small way to support themselves when they are adults.  They are the weakest members of our community and the most deserving of care. We are inclined to spend millions on primary education, secondary education and university education, and rightly so, but the care of our mentally handicapped, while it is not neglected in this country, is certainly falling behind the care of our normal children. We have the highest rate of mentally <Col N="1774" /> handicapped in Europe.  I do not know what the reason is.  Strange to say, the further West you go the higher the rate of mentally handicapped.  Only for the religious orders in the West of Ireland certainly we would have nobody catering for the mentally handicapped and to those people who do it I say we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude.  I do not think there is any Deputy in this House who in the course of his travels around his constituency has not been approached at some time or another to have one of these children admitted to either a hospital or a school for mildly mentally handicapped.  In this sphere there should be closer liaison between the Department of Health and the Department of Education.  Once the children are assessed there should be some contact and some way of placing them (a) in a hospital or (b) in a school following on the report of the people qualified to assess these children's ability.</P>
    <P>Primary school education has to a great extent stayed with the same curriculum and at the same level in this country for the last 50 years, but now we are making some changes.  We are doing away with the small schools.  I recognise the fact that the one-teacher school had to go.  I regret the passing of the two-teacher school but I think it is the trend all over the world.  Perhaps, I am a little bit old-fashioned in this way, or not with it as they say, but while I regret the passing of the two-teacher school I think removing children from the local parish is a bad thing.  The teacher in a parish is a great asset.  He is more than just a teacher.  He is a counsellor, an adviser and quite a stern disciplinarian.  I am often amused on a Sunday morning when I watch children at Mass looking behind to see if the teacher is present.  It is incredible the good effect the presence of a teacher in the church has on the pupils.</P>
    <P>We have adopted a system in which we are moving into larger schools but I see a danger where the children are moved into larger classes.  This is a bad thing particularly for children who come from small classes.  You are faced with a situation in which you might have up to 40 or 50 children in classes. <Col N="1775" /> I know that is not the fault of the Department because they like to have small classes but obviously in this case slow children must go to the wall.  If the teacher tries to strike a happy medium the more advanced children are held back.</P>
    <P>This is particularly evident in Dublin, especially in the suburbs.  I know the situation which exists in Rathfarnham and other suburbs.  The schools are not able to absorb the huge increase in the population.  National schools and private schools all have gigantic classes which must be bad for the children. Here, again, I do not think we have enough teachers.  I spoke to a nun in charge of a school about this.  She agreed and sympathised with my views but asked: &ldquo;What are we to do?  We cannot get teachers&rdquo;.  This is something the Department will have to look into.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written in recent times about teaching through the medium of Irish.  I do not approve of teaching all subjects, particularly to young children, through the medium of Irish, but I approve of teaching a subject through Irish.  If children were encouraged to use Irish phrases in their rhymes when at play it would encourage the use of Irish.  I know one place in my own constituency where all subjects were taught through the medium of Irish.  The parents were against it and after much acrimony, and what have you, it was decided to change the system but it should not have gone that far.  The parents should be consulted and if a majority of parents are against the teaching of all subjects through Irish the school must give way.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have been accused of not using more Irish but this is not true.  I often regret I do not know more Irish particularly when my children are getting older and I have to help them with their lessons.  Irish was a must in my young days and a stick was held over you.  This is bad for children because resentment is generated if Irish is hammered into children.  If they are encouraged to use it in their play they begin to like it and surely that is what we want?</P>
    <P>Transport for the primary schools <Col N="1776" /> on the whole in my constituency has worked out well but there is one school from which a number of children are not quite two miles away.  I refer to a school in County Leitrim where no transport is provided.  I appeal for transport for these tiny tots.  They live near the Tynagh Mines and huge trucks travel the roads at high speed every morning.  Those tiny tots&mdash;I know several children in one family between the ages of four and seven&mdash;have to travel to the school and I do not believe the lorry drivers can see them on the road.  Driving around my constituency early in the morning, I can see the children on the side of the road and at the last minute when you get near them they decide to cross over and you are liable to hit them.  Transport should certainly be provided for those children. I know the Minister has made a statement about opening the schools later in the morning, but I should like to reiterate an appeal which was made, I think, by Deputy Tully that the children be given special armbands or luminous belts.</P>

      <P>The time has come when we must try to provide some sort of hot meal for the children particularly now that they are going somewhat further to school and are obviously later home in the evening. It is a long day for small children without a hot meal.  I do not know how it could be worked out but I am sure it could be done.  I, like many other Deputies, welcome the change from the primary certificate to the report cards but in regard to those report cards the teachers should consult the parents and advise them what the children should do, whether to go to secondary school or technical school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A teacher&mdash;a very good teacher, I may say&mdash;told me that two of his pupils, neither of whom could read, <Col N="1779" /> went to secondary school last year. It was not the teacher's fault; it was just that the children had not the ability to read.  I am sure that if more thought were given to the matter it would be found that the children had ability for something.  While it might not have been for academic subjects, they might have a flair for technical education.  This is one of the things that we will have to take care of in some way.  I know that the 11-plus system in England has not worked out very well.  Eleven years is too young an age at which to stream pupils but streaming will have to be done at some age.  There is no use in emptying from the primary to the secondary school children who are not able to avail of secondary education.  It is only a nuisance to themselves; they are wasting their lives; and they are a nuisance to the teacher who has to try to keep them up with the rest of the class.  It is opportunity lost.  In some cases such children are taking up places that could be better used by other children.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about transport to secondary schools.  In my constituency every weekend I hear nothing but grumbles.  I know that it is easy to come in here and complain. I do not know what the answer is. I do know that children from Kilrickle leave at 8 a.m. to go to Loughrea, a distance of six miles, and return at 6 p.m.  One person said, &ldquo;We have a flock of young hooligans&rdquo;; another said: &ldquo;We are rearing a crowd of juvenile delinquents; they are roaming the streets&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They leave at 8 a.m. and they are roaming the streets until school time.  The brothers cannot be expected to go down to the bus to collect them.  Otherwise, the children will not go to school.  The time-lag between their arrival in Loughrea and the school time is too great.  The bus goes out at 8 a.m. and does another run.  It is too early to have them in town at 8.15.  The pupils alternate.  One month some of them <Col N="1780" /> go too early and the other month they go too late.  The same applies in the evening.  In the summer it seems all right; they are going around the town &mdash;the young girls are.</P>

      <P>The teachers assure me that the schools are open, the rooms are provided for them to study but children, being children, will duck out as soon as they can.  We all did it and every generation of children will do the same.</P>
      <P>I am glad that there has been a change in the school curriculum, which is now much wider and much more suitable to the needs of today.  We seem to be progressing in many ways but I notice a lot of differences in education. The word means &ldquo;to draw out&rdquo;.  We seem to be losing some things.  When I went to school, one of the things we were taught was to write letters.  Now one gets letters from university students and they are practically illiterate.  They do not know how to set them out or to spell.  It is an art that has gone.  It is an essential art that should be kept.  It is part of the English course.  They should be required to be able to write letters.  One gets boys and girls writing to say that they have applied for a job and could they use one's name for a reference.  My own spelling is deplorable but I often send back letters with words underlined and tell them not to apply for a job in a letter with that kind of spelling.  If it came from my own nine-year old daughter, I would send it back more quickly.  These are things that we have lost.  Also, they do not pay as much attention as they used to English grammar and oral English.  I welcome the introduction of oral examinations. The same applies in the case of Irish and French.  Obviously, if they are required to be educated, they must be able to speak the language as it should be spoken, not any old way.</P>

      <P>I know.  I mentioned it last week.  You should have seen my fanmail after I spoke in <Col N="1781" /> the House.  It is terribly important.  It used to be considered very important that one spoke properly and wrote letters properly and behaved reasonably well.  I know that standards are changing nowadays and that it is considered &ldquo;with it&rdquo; to be using all these silly phrases that are current, but it strikes me as terribly bad to get letters from either secondary school or university students that are badly written and badly presented.  It annoys me.  I feel that a lot of time and money was spent on their education and that they have not availed of a great deal of it.</P>
      <P>Television could be used to a greater extent in schools, particularly for the smaller children.  The visual thing impresses the little ones a great deal more than we realise.  Indeed, Telefís Éireann could well have an hour, say, in the early evening, for the smaller ones.  The bigger children seem to be catered for all right.  There could be less of the &ldquo;Jeanie&rdquo; and the &ldquo;He and She&rdquo; and this sort of drivel and a little more educational programmes, such as nature study programmes.  The BBC are particularly good on wild life programmes and programmes about fruit and flowers.  Such programmes are very important for small children.</P>
      <P>Television has had its own influence on education in a retrograde way, if you like.  Children read less than they did because of television.  School libraries should be developed.  Schools should be encouraged to avail of every facility to build up libraries and should give a certain time to reading.</P>

    <P>One danger in the five-day week is that subjects like music, drama&mdash;that some schools do&mdash;and particularly games may be curtailed.  Saturday was always considered in the secondary school as the big day for games. Obviously, if schools are not open on Saturday, games will suffer.  This is a great mistake because both boys and <Col N="1782" /> girls need games to teach them the competitive spirit and to win graciously and lose graciously and to mix with other schools.  Every school should try to have a trained PT instructor and as much time as can be spared should be used for games, which develop children in many ways, teach them to be less selfish and so on.</P>
    <P>Here, again, in secondary schools, with the long day and the early commencing hour of the morning and the late finishing hour in the evening, some effort will have to be made to provide hot meals.  I know it will be gigantically expensive having regard to the price of food, but something will have to be done.  It is not good for a young child to go from 8 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m. without a reasonably good meal.  If they are allowed, they will do with icepops and crisps.  We all know from experience that that is about the only thing they will eat when they are out.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of school fees.  Most of the schools have gone into the free scheme but the Minister well knows that a number of schools are charging fees.  I know it is quite reasonable to expect that schools with large building debts must recoup in some way but there is a certain amount of abuse.  I know a few schools that have jumped their fees and they are also in the free scheme.  If parents are willing to pay, that is fine because, as the Minister knows, it is almost impossible to get children into schools in Dublin.  One has to go with hat in hand or be three years on a waiting list.  There is this problem of fees and the Department should keep an eye on it.  There is a certain amount of abuse.  At one stage I was of two minds about the schools that stayed out.  I felt that they were wrong in some ways.  Now I am beginning to admire them.  They are making all the effort, not looking for assistance while some others are a little sly in collecting in two ways.  At least, the schools that stayed out are making their own effort, not collecting on the double.</P>
    <P>In my view there is not sufficient career guidance.  That is required to a much greater extent now that there is grouping of subjects.  It should come <Col N="1783" /> at two stages.  Career guidance should come in a very simple form when they are about to leave primary school and again before the leaving certificate standard.  There is a great need there for career guidance.</P>

      <P>I know you will meet resistance.  There will be parents who will say: &ldquo;You cannot advise me about my children.&rdquo; Obviously the teacher who has been teaching children for five or six years must know what their abilities are and will be better able to advise than the parents who are inclined to think all their geese are swans.</P>
      <P>We must&mdash;I said this last year and it was not very popular in some areas&mdash; educate our people to the need for technical education.  Here both the primary school teacher and the secondary school teacher should be able to help.  It is silly to think that children who go to a technical school are not as able or will not get as good an education or acquire the same social status from education as children who go to what we used call a secondary school.  This is an outmoded idea, and here the schools can play a tremendous part by advising the parents that they believe a child would be better off at a technical school and by pointing out the advantages of technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something that worries me and probably worries many parents and also Deputies in this House, that with the advent of what we all call free education little or no interest is being stirred up in regard to farming education. The trend I find in my constituency is this: &ldquo;So-and-so is at secondary school and So-and-so is at technical school.&rdquo;  When I ask: &ldquo;Who is going to look after the farm?&rdquo;, the parents says: &ldquo;None of my boys is going to look after the farm&rdquo;.  We talk about <Col N="1784" /> saving the West.  I talked yesterday to a father of a family of seven boys and two girls.  They are nearly all through school now, and I asked who was going to stay on the farm, which is around 200 acres, and he said: &ldquo;None.  They have all got their education and farming is not for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are going to survive in the European market we must have educated farmers, farmers with an education in farming, so that they will be able to keep up with the know-how in every sphere.  The danger of free education is that farming is being neglected.  I do not know what the answer is.  If encouragement were given from the school and if the parents were advised by the teachers that a particular child would be better off in an agricultural college, this could be a great help.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Corry, I do not disapprove of students gathering anywhere and demonstrating.  It is a trend all over the world.  Students are noted for having various views.</P>

      <P>I know a girl who got seven honours in 1967; her father died, and she was the eldest of a large family.  The school approached the Minister's Department and nothing was done.  Here is a brilliant child who, just for one year, through financial circumstances, could not go to university.</P>
      <P>Last year&mdash;indeed I think every year I have spoken on the Estimate I have referred to this&mdash;I mentioned the training of teachers.  Years ago teachers were trained to a very high standard and they maintained this standard right through their professional life, and improved on it.  Nowadays, I might be wrong but it seems to me that the young teachers are not as well trained as the teachers who taught us.  Maybe it is that because of the pressure of life they do not do as much reading as the older teachers. I spoke to a young boy who was just finished his training.  We were discussing education and he said that he regarded the three-year course he had done as a crash course.  I know the commission recommended that teachers should have university degrees, but I recommend to the House that teachers should be paid the highest salary the Department can possibly afford.  It is a hard life; I would not be a teacher for the world; to have to teach my children for half an hour drives me around the bend. If we want to retain the best brains of the teaching profession we must pay them.  I do not think we are getting the best brains to stay in the teaching profession.  While I agree that teachers should be paid reasonably comparable salaries, it is a terrible thing to expect secondary teachers to suffer a reduction in salary.</P>

      <P>Whatever salary is paid, they deserve every bit of it and much more.  It is a profession that not too many are anxious to go into at the moment.  There is no point in building all these big schools if we arrive at a situation where there are not enough teachers to go into them.  As the Minister knows, if you want to lure people into any job you <Col N="1786" /> must increase the salary.  I have known even national schools where the managers have said to me: &ldquo;I did advertise but I got no reply except from untrained teachers.&rdquo;  If you cannot get sufficient teachers you are in real trouble.</P>
      <P>Much has been said over the years about the position of managers.  I always sympathise with managers, because in most cases they get all the knocks and none of the bouquets when anything is going on.  The manager is in an invidious position.  He has great powers, if you like, in some cases; he has great responsibilities and he gets nothing for doing all this. I think the time has come when the managerial system will have to be examined and brought into line with modern times.  It is not fair to expect the parish priest, particularly a man getting on in life, to be able to get on well on all occasions with the teachers.  That is not so easily done; it occurs in every walk of life.  The time has arrived when the system should be looked into again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of this Adjournment debate has received some consideration in the press in recent times and I have sought permission to raise it on the Adjournment so that at least the House may be given some opportunity of discussing this problem, the beginnings of which we have seen here in Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two schools of thought in relation to the matter.  There is one which says: &ldquo;Avoid any discussion of the problem.  It does not exist; therefore, let us not talk about it.&rdquo;  There is another school of thought which says that the problem undoubtedly exists and it will not disappear by pretending it is not there and that by discussing it we may come to some correct answers and may be able to deal with it.  I do not want to exaggerate or to minimise the extent of the problem.  The Minister for Justice belongs to the first school of thought, <Col N="1787" /> namely, the &ldquo;do not discuss it&rdquo; one. As the House knows, he has criticised certain newspapers which considered the matter serious enough to publicise it and bring before the notice of the public the fact that the problem does exist.</P>
    <P>The first school of thought says that we encourage the practice by talking about it.  I do not see how one can come to that conclusion.  In fact, I imagine that all the experience in other countries is that, before we can tackle the problem, we must discuss it so as to find out the extent of it.  I would suggest to the Minister for Health that we must have a register of addicts in order to discover the extent to which the problem does exist in this country. I do not pretend to be in possession of all the facts in this area.  I have discussed the matter with some unfortunate young people, who are, let us say patients, or involved in this tragic business, and to the best of my ability I have made my own investigation based on their experience, about the extent of the problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>So far as I know&mdash;and this is subject to all the limitations that individual investigation implies&mdash;there is not a large problem in the illegal traffic of drugs in Dublin, as far as my inquiries go.  So far as I know, most of these drugs come in from London through friendships created over there and reach Dublin in that way.  There is not a problem of drug peddlers making large fortunes out of illegal traffic in drugs but there are undoubtedly in Dublin people who are becoming&mdash;I think the expression is&mdash;hooked, or at least well on the way to becoming addicts.  If there are children of Irish parents who happen to be falling into this tragic situation it behoves us to take action for them.  Otherwise we may take the easy attitude, as we do with so many other social problems&mdash; let the British welfare state look after them.  That has been the attitude to some of the problems in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in his reply on 12th November&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can bring in another <Col N="1788" /> Minister.  The question are directed to the Minister for Health and to him alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To cut that short, although the preventive and remedial aspects of the matter are interlocked, the situation is that the Minister for Justice devolves all responsibility for dealing with the problem on the Minister for Health.  While I can understand that the more important remedial measures belong to the sphere of the Minister for Health there is also need for consideration of the preventive side of the problem.  I humbly suggest that a Minister who thinks the problem does not exist could not be expected to understand how grave the problem is, even if it is but beginning to be a social problem in Dublin. Someone has properly said that in other countries and societies people denied that the problem could attack them. They ignored the problem until it had reached large proportions when real emergency measures had to be taken at that stage.  We may avoid that situation by exercising commonsense and taking steps now to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Even the Minister for Justice admits that illegal traffic in drugs will increase. If that is his estimate of the position it behoves all of us to examine what measures we should take.  The Minister for Health has set up a committee and I want to give the impression that I get from his reply on the matter.  I asked the Minister whether his Department was giving any special consideration to the growing practice of drug-taking among young people and if he would outline any special steps he intends to take to make drugs less easily available.  The kernel of his reply to that was:</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous questions, I propose to make the unauthorised possession of certain drugs liable to abuse, a punishable offence and I hope to incorporate the necessary statutory provision in the legislation for the improvement of the Health Services which, as I have previously indicated, will be introduced in the present session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I get the impression that the Minister for Health is prone to take&mdash;even <Col N="1789" /> he&mdash;a purely punitive attitude towards this problem.  There are several schools of thought in that regard, as I have learned.  We can regard drug addicts as delinquents or we let them fall into the category of patients, which is a description which I am inclined to adopt myself.  I think a person who is falling into the practice of drug-taking is a person who must be regarded in much the same way as an alcoholic must be regarded, as suffering from a disease in that sense.  It is not so long ago since we refused to recognise that alcoholism was, in fact, a disease or that citizens in the grip of alcoholism were seriously ill.  It was said that this was part of our social pattern.  It is not so long ago since people condemned to mental homes were regarded as pariahs of society and outside the pale of ordinary human life.  It is not so long ago since tubercular patients were regarded as being the victims of some divine curse on them.</P>
    <P>I think the kernel of our sincerity in approaching the problem of drug-taking, if we wish to tackle it seriously, must be the establishment in Dublin of a specialised clinic to deal with the problem.  There are clinics in London and if we do nothing about it we can be sure that the young people who are caught up in this tragic business will gravitate to London and be dealt with there in some fashion.  Any of us who consider that we have an obligation to our own citizens must believe that we should do something at home for them.  The British authorities have done a great deal in at least looking into the situation and there have been several inter-departmental committees of the British House of Commons sitting on the problem.  There was the Brain Committee in 1965.  They brought in a report two years later and a great deal of their material could be considered to see what we could do here.  But I believe we must have this specialised clinic in Dublin with all necessary medical expertise it would call for.  So far as I am aware&mdash;and again I would say that my figures are subject to all the limitations of individual inquiries&mdash;I should imagine that in Dublin there is something in the region of 200 people who are victims <Col N="1790" /> of this particular habit.  I say we have an obligation to do something for these young people and their families who must be tortured by the problem of having sons or daughters caught up in this desperate business.</P>
    <P>One failing we have in this matter is that some of the people to whom I have talked took up this drug habit in London and the peculiar thing is that many of them had gone to London at a very early age.  Some of those to whom I spoke emigrated at the age of 16.  Therefore, this uncovers the real problem of young people leaving the country at a very early age and going into an alien environment. What we see happening in this area may be happening in other areas also. However, it would appear that these young people took up the habit on leaving this country for London at a very early age.  I do not know what solution could be suggested but certainly this is one aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>In this connection, one of the young men to whom I spoke said that he had heard it mentioned in London&mdash;I wish to say that this is subject to limitation and caution; it is not a scientific figure but at least it was mentioned in the course of my inquiries and I see no danger in referring to it&mdash;that 25 per cent of the young people who were called addicts were, in fact, of Irish background.  This figure may not be correct but, at any rate, it suggests that a large number of those people in London who are suffering from drug addiction are citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>These are some of the facts that have come to my notice in the short time that I have been looking at the problem. The Minister says that he is setting up a work party to advise on this matter.  This is a good thing but I should like to ask the Minister if the party will work within the existing system, which is one of neglect of this problem.  It is necessary to know exactly who will be on this committee. It is important that there should be representatives of young people so that it will not become a group who do not understand this problem from the point of view of youth.</P>
    <P>In Belfast, as we know, the authorities have contacted all youth organisations <Col N="1791" /> asking them for submissions and for any help that they can give to the official committee in that part of the country.  Indeed, in Belfast, there is a much more honest and open approach to the problem than there has as yet been here in Dublin.  We cannot say which city has the more serious problem but there is no doubt that the problem in Dublin is fast approaching a situation that is at least as serious as that obtaining in Belfast. This is not scaremongering.  There has been an increase in the number of court cases dealing with this matter during the past few months.</P>
    <P>One factor that will hamper any measures we take towards solving this problem will be the inadequacy of our probation service.  Recently, we asked the responsible Minister what the extent of our probation service is in the country&mdash;and remember a probation service is a skilled probation service with people trained in sociology&mdash;and we were informed that there are seven full-time officials for Dublin and none for the rest of the country.  Therefore, this work party that the Minister is asking to help him on this problem face a situation where the full-time probation service for the whole country amounts to seven men in Dublin; for the rest, we must depend on the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the first problem the Minister should look at is the dreadfully inadequate position of the probation service.  Most of the workers in the clinics in London that I have read about work in very close unity and day to day contact with the probation service and, in fact, the job of a probation officer when dealing with one of these people is to befriend him and to ensure that the person is able to keep in contact with him.</P>
    <P>We should get it out of our heads that punishment alone in the form of sentences will not solve the problem. We must have remedial measures.  We must put a stop to whatever illegal traffic is going on.  This traffic, to my knowledge, has not, as yet, reached commercial proportions.  The emphasis should be on the remedial clinic aspect. Whatever is done from the point of view of prevention must call for a <Col N="1792" /> wider probation service than we have at present.</P>
    <P>My only excuse for raising this matter here is that this habit is a destroyer of youth and many people in this House, regardless of political differences, will agree on the importance of our youth and anything that can ruin&mdash;&ldquo;ruin&rdquo; is not too strong a word&mdash;a young person's career and their whole grip on life must be effectively tackled.  It cannot be treated as being something of no consequence or, to use the words of the Minister for Justice, &ldquo;something that the newspapers got up&rdquo;.  Such an attitude in dealing with a problem of this kind is not responsible.  Those public representatives and members of the clergy who have highlighted this problem have, in my opinion, spoken from the most responsible motives.</P>
    <P>If there is irresponsibility in this matter it is on the side of those who keep their mouths closed.  I should hope that the Minister for Health means business and I hope that the setting up of this committee will lead to the establishment here in Dublin of a clinic of the type that I mentioned. This clinic would be the centrepiece of any meaningful campaign to eradicate this habit among our young people. The State has an obligation to help these people.  We cannot take the easy way out and export the problem to Britain even if the problem did begin in London to where so many of our young emigrants go.  The lives of these people will be ruined.  I am pressing the Minister to take action in dealing with this problem.</P>

The Deputy said he was guided by the highest motives.  I hope this is so.  Last week, when as a matter of courtesy I told Deputy O'Leary that I would not be here on Thursday evening to answer questions, he had them treated as written replies and then went to the <i>Evening Herald</i> with the substance of the replies, which <Col N="1793" /> would appear to suggest&mdash;whatever his interest in it&mdash;that he was determined to get the maximum publicity out of it.</P>

      <P>He said that the reply I gave last week in regard to a working party and other replies would appear to suggest to him that I am taking a purely punitive attitude in regard to this problem.  That, I assure the House, is absolutely not so. I think, first of all, it might be no harm if we were to try to get the situation into perspective.  Figures available to us from the mental hospitals of the number of drug-addicts who have come to the hospitals for treatment are: in 1966 there were 59 patients admitted for drug-addiction and in 1967 this number had increased to 63.  A breakdown of these figures shows that only 12 were in the age group of 22 years and under.  The vast majority of those concerned were in the higher age group, 25 years and upwards.  Some of those were people who by reason of their profession or occupation had ready access to drugs in any event.  Therefore, from the point of view the figures, at any rate, the problem would appear to be rather less discouraging than one would have thought from recent publicity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, psychiatrists who have reported to us on this matter say that it is very difficult indeed to make an absolute statement on the size of the problem of drug abuse rather than drug addiction which is really more the problem <Col N="1794" /> about which Deputy O'Leary was talking this evening.  One of the psychiatrists consulted said that opinions tended to be impressionistic. I am inclined to agree that that is so.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the question of drug-addiction as such, in regard to the 12 younger people of 22 years of age and under, of those 12 ten were males and two females and six of them were on &ldquo;hard&rdquo; drugs.  To me, the important distinction here is the one between drug-addiction and the social problem of a growing interest by young people in the use or abuse of drugs. It is because of the fear that this problem can become a serious one in this country that I propose to set up the working party, which I announced last week.  I want to assure the House in regard to that working party that the chairman and most of the members of the party are people who are actively identified with youth.  In reply to the specific question raised by Deputy O'Leary, they will have authority to report in regard to the matter of the establishment of a special centre or clinic in Dublin to deal with addicts.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should say, first of all, that it is necessary to bring in further legislation.  The fact that that is so is not to be taken as meaning that my attitude, or the attitude of my Department, in regard to this matter is one of punishment.  At present certified &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs, as they are called, are obtainable readily only by means of a doctor's prescription but the fact is that illegal possession when taken by others means is not an offence.  This hampers the Garda in their handling of drug-addiction in Dublin and the proposed legislation will help them to deal more effectively with these cases. The heads of this legislation have been prepared and will be sent to Government Departments very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I should like to mention is that we have the preparation of a document in hands now arising out of recent break-ins to dispensaries, and so on, and we will circularise all hospital bodies&mdash;chemists, wholesalers, retailers, hospitals and so on&mdash;asking them to safeguard the drugs in their <Col N="1795" /> possession in every way they can.  In that way we will try to seal up a possible source of the illicit supply of these drugs.  As the House knows, this is something which has actually happened in Dublin in recent months.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the working party.  The next thing I should like to mention is the special centre or clinic which Deputy O'Leary said it is essential to establish.  I am inclined to agree with him and, indeed, inclined to go ahead with the establishment of the clinic as soon as possible without waiting for the working party to report on it.</P>

      <P>In regard to the register, I am not convinced that a register of addicts would be of any advantage.  If the time comes when I am so convinced, I can reconsider the situation.  To me the problem is a social one.  That is why I think a working party comprised of people who are social workers, tutors, doctors or students&mdash;there will be students on the party as well&mdash;is the best means to advise me and my Department as to what steps should be taken in the education of young people, in particular, in regard to the use and abuse of certain drugs.</P>
      <P>Personally, I should like doctors to take note that some of these barbiturates may have an equally good therapeutic substitute which is not capable of being abused.  What we aim to arrive at here is a stage where we are satisfied, on all the evidence available to us, there is no serious problem even in Dublin, and virtually no problem outside Dublin.  The situation should not be allowed to reach the stage where there will be a serious social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the measures I have outlined, the legislative measures being only one of them&mdash;the working party, the establishment of a centre, and the other measures I have mentioned&mdash; will all make for a real attack on this problem without exaggerating its importance. This, I think, is something we should not allow happen.  I think <Col N="1796" /> that excess publicity in Britain in recent years has contributed to the problem rather than take away from it.  I want to try to avoid a situation where unnecessary publicity is given to the abuse rather than the use of these drugs, and I want to make sure that that does not arise.  We will tackle the problem sensibly.  In various youth organisations lectures will bring home to young people the evils that can flow from the abuse of certain drugs which in recent years from a therapeutic point of view have done great things in the field of psychiatry.</P>
    <P>One final matter I think I should mention is that, as a preliminary to setting up a special centre here in Dublin, my Department will send certain officers to Britain to learn from their experience in the past few years on this problem.  They have had vast experience of it, unfortunately, in recent years.  We will do that so that our Departmental officials will be fully up to date with British experience and will be able to use it to prevent our having a similar experience here.</P>
    <P>I imagine it may be asked why all the members of the working party will be from Dublin although they will be asked to report on the situation in the whole country.  At the moment, the problem&mdash;such as it is&mdash;exists in Dublin and not significantly outside Dublin.  Furthermore, any conclusions to which the working party may come will obviously be equally applicable in other cities and, indeed, in other areas generally.</P>

But, outside Dublin&mdash;in the rural areas, in particular&mdash;it is insignificant and, in the other cities, so far as all the evidence available to the police and to us is concerned, it suggests that, as yet&mdash;and as we hope it will remain&mdash;it is a minor problem.</P>
