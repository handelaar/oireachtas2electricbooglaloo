    <Title>Road Traffic Bill, 1966: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 36, to delete the amendment of section 36.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendment of section 36 which I wish to delete proposes to make compulsory disqualification obligatory in the case of the new offence of driving without due care and attention.  I pointed out that this is a comparatively minor offence.  Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, we had the offence of dangerous driving and the offence of careless driving.  The offence of dangerous driving carried a consequential disqualification on a second conviction and the offence of careless driving under section 52 did not carry a penalty of consequential disqualification. I was pointing out yesterday that in the Bill with which we are now dealing, section 48 creates the offence of driving without reasonable consideration and that does not carry any consequential disqualification.  Section 49 creates the offence of driving without due care and attention.  This offence does carry disqualification on a second conviction.  I think that is too severe.  A driver, whether he be a private motorist or a professional driver earning his living by driving vehicles, should not be subject to this consequential disqualification.  Without making it consequential, the courts have discretion under the Act to impose disqualification if they think it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to see what the difference is between the offence of <Col N="1672" /> driving a vehicle without reasonable consideration for other persons using the place or the offence of driving a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention.  It appears that the second mentioned offence is supposed to be more serious than the first.  From the wording of these sections, I find it very difficult to differentiate between the two.  It would be a question of luck or chance for a person who was involved in an accident as to whether he would be charged under one or the other.  If he is charged under the first, he most probably will not be disqualified; if he is charged under the second and convicted twice, he must be disqualified.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows there is a vast difference between dangerous driving, which means what it says, and driving without reasonable consideration or driving without due care and attention. We are now putting the offence of driving in a dangerous manner in the very same category as driving without due care and attention.  That does not make sense and it could operate to inflict an injustice on an accused person. There is inherent all through the Act the general discretion conferred on the court of imposing disqualification in any case in which is deems it necessary. I suggest to the Minister that he should accept my amendment and delete the amendment to section 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is in fact that we have already approved sections 48 and 49.  This merely enables the licence to be endorsed in respect of a first offence so that it will be known when the second offence is committed that disqualification will follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> They do not say anything about disqualification. Surely this is the one that provides the penalty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done in the Schedule. This amendment is merely to provide for endorsement of the licence. The position is that the Road Traffic Act, 1933, provided for two summary offences.  One consisted of driving&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;without exercising reasonable consideration for persons, vehicles and other traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> The other involved driving&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;at a speed or in a manner which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature, condition and use of the place and the amount of traffic which then actually is or might reasonably be expected then to be in the place) is dangerous to the public.</P>
    <P>The really serious cases involving death were dealt with by a charge of manslaughter, but in fact it became virtually impossible to get a court to convict of manslaughter in a driving case.  The Road Traffic Act, 1961, therefore provided for new offences.  Under section 52 of the 1961 Act, it is an offence to drive a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention, or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the place. Under section 53 of the 1961 Act, it is an offence to drive a vehicle in a public place at a speed or in a manner which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, is dangerous to the public.  Where death or serious bodily harm is caused to another person, a section 53 offence is an indictable one; in other cases, it is a summary offence.  The indictable offence, which carries very heavy penalties, was designed for use in the type of case in which a manslaughter charge would have been brought prior to 1961, although a charge of manslaughter is still taken in a very few bad cases.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the provisions of the 1961 Act have not produced good results.  Judges have tended to apply to all dangerous driving cases the criteria already applied by them to manslaughter charges.  Juries have tended to acquit in all but the really bad cases, despite the evidence.  The result is that, while summary charges of dangerous driving are on the whole dealt with reasonably well by the District Courts, the more serious cases are not so dealt with in the Circuit Court.  The position appears to be that &mdash;I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick knows this&mdash;the more serious the charge, the better the chance the accused has of being acquitted.  Sections 48 and 49 are designed to deal with this situation.  It <Col N="1674" /> can be seen from the figures of cases taken to court that the position will be that the really bad type of case, the case in which juries have tended to convict, will continue to be dealt with under section 53 of the 1961 Act as dangerous driving, either on indictment or summarily.  It will be a matter for the State to select which cases they propose to proceed with by a charge of dangerous driving, that is, under section 53.</P>
    <P>Up to now cases involving death or serious bodily harm were practically all dealt with by a charge of dangerous driving which was tried by a judge and jury.  The only alternative to that was to base the charge on section 52, driving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration. But the penalty for a section 52 offence is only the general penalty, the maximum for the first offence being a fine of only £20.  The result of this was that there was a considerable gap between the dangerous driving charge, for which the maximum penalty is penal servitude up to five years and a fine of up to £500 or both, and a careless driving charge in cases involving death or serious bodily harm.  The result of this big gap was that very little use was made of section 52 in such cases.  Practically all cases were dealt with by the dangerous driving charge and in a very large proportion of these cases, the charge was not successful.</P>
    <P>What is being done is that a new offence is being inserted by the Bill in an attempt to close this gap between dangerous driving and the lesser offence.  What is being done is that the existing offence under section 52 is being broken up into two separate offences&mdash;driving without reasonable consideration which is in section 48 and driving without due care and attention which is in section 49.  The position would be that the first offence, that of driving without reasonable consideration, which is in section 48 will be the equivalent of the present charge and the offence of driving without due care and attention in section 49 will be the more serious of the two, and we are providing for a heavier <Col N="1675" /> penalty in that case, a penalty which will be in the gap between the two existing penalties.  This means that cases which do not involve an element of recklessness will now not be brought before the courts as dangerous driving charges.  These were the type of cases in which the courts tended not to convict because of the fact that apparently the penalties were considered to be too heavy.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need for an intermediate offence which is being provided here.  The careless driving and the inconsiderate driving are two distinct offences and they can be clearly differentiated.  Careless driving is aimed at the person who is careless but not necessarily driving without due consideration for others, while the latter, the inconsiderate driving charge, covers the driver who may be quite careful in so far as his own safety is concerned but disregards the comfort and convenience of others.  A decision as to which type of offence any particular case comes under is a matter for determination by the court.  The first amendment that has been made here concerns the new offence of careless diving.  It will be a more serious one than the existing offence and the penalties applying to it are being increased above those which apply to the existing offence under section 52.  In line with this, it is considered that consequential disqualification should apply to this new offence also, that is, where a person is convicted twice in any three-year period.  That is what is provided for by the third amendment to the Second Schedule of the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>I feel it is quite clear that a number of quite serious cases has escaped because of the fact that there was this big gap between the penalties for the two types of offence that existed up to now and it is necessary to have this third intermediate classification of careless driving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in almost complete agreement with the Minister.  I think it has become a public scandal that somebody who is involved in a minor offence can be tried and convicted while somebody who is involved in a more serious accident, because of the fact that juries seem to <Col N="1676" /> think that the penalties are too heavy, invariably gets away with it.  What the Minister said is quite correct and the introduction of an intermediate charge may possibly be the solution to it.  The only thing I am not in agreement with is the question of the suspension of the licence for the second offence in three years.  The trouble about that is that it does not give the same punishment to everybody.  A man who takes out his car once in six months and has an accident and then only takes it out again for a run on a Sunday maybe and has another accident loses his licence and is fined.  That man has only the question of the fine to worry about, whereas a lorry-driver, a taxi-driver or even an ordinary person who uses his car to go to work will have the fine, plus the loss of his job, to worry about because he cannot carry on his job if he has not got a licence.  Maybe I misunderstood what the Minister said or did not read the amendment correctly but that is the way it appears to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Personally I feel that this is a desirable thing to provide for.  It is not, as Deputy Tully says, that the second accident or even the second serious accident would entail this disqualification but the second conviction of driving in this manner.  However, I will undertake to consider it between now and Report Stage.  That is as far as I can go but I am not promising to agree to not having this provision. I do not know if Deputies would think that maybe a third offence might call for this rather than a second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that it would be a lot nearer the point. The Minister appreciates that the fellow who is dependent for his livelihood on a driver's licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Somebody does something stupid which may involve more than one person and very often a fellow can get involved and appear to be in the wrong because of something which somebody else did, and I would be very careful about doing this.  If the Minister considers that even a third offence would be better it would be a help.  Somebody who is caught three times can hardly claim that the long arm of coincidence put him in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the amendments which took away the power of the Minister for Justice to remit, I will consider relating it to a third offence rather than to a second one.  Anyway I will consider it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not think it is correct to say that we have imposed the penalties in section 48 and section 49.  We have created an offence and we are now making provision for imposition of penalties. That is what I think and the explanatory memorandum would appear to bear me out because the section dealing with the Schedule, section 36, says:</P>
      <P>Section 36 of the 1961 Act deals with endorsement of driving licences.  The effect of the first amendment of this section (taken with the amendment of the Second Schedule to the 1961 Act) is to include in the offences to which mandatory endorsement applies, the new offence of careless driving.</P>
      <P>That is what I understood and the White Paper seems to agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Tully, with all due respect to him, clearly understands the position.  The Minister gives as his reason for creating this new offence that the courts were slow to convict on serious charges.  I presume that when he says that he is referring to juries.  The only offence that is triable on indictment by jury is that of dangerous driving causing serious harm and that will still be tried by jury.  We have the ordinary case of dangerous driving which was, and will <Col N="1678" /> continue to be, triable by the district justice.  We have the offence of careless driving under the Act and we are now to have the offence of driving without reasonable consideration, section 48, and driving without due care, section 49.</P>
    <P>The whole point of my amendment is to make it clear that I think that automatic disqualification for a second offence of driving without due care and attention is too severe.  I am glad the Minister has at least undertaken to consider the matter between now and Report Stage.  In making the case last evening, I referred to the fact that the Minister had amended the Bill, as originally introduced, by dropping section 22, which dealt with the power to remit certain disqualifications.  I hope the Minister will consider the matter as he has promised and perhaps he will be good enough to let us know in advance if he intends to ease the position.  If not, I will consider retabling this amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 37, after the third amendment of section 65, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The substitution for subsection (1) (g) of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" />&lsquo;(g) any person claiming in respect of an injury to himself or any other person in respect of which he would be entitled to claim occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act 1966, and which arose out of and in the course of the employment of the injured person by the insured in the relevant document.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under section 65 (1) (g) of the 1961 Act, &ldquo;excepted person&rdquo; that is, a person who need not be covered by an approved policy of insurance, is defined as, <i>inter alia,</i></P>
    <P>any person claiming in respect of an injury to himself or any other person in respect of which he would be entitled to claim against the insured or the principal debtor in the relevant document and be awarded compensation or other relief under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 to 1955.</P>
    <P>This subsection was based on the principle that it would be inappropriate (1) that persons already covered by the Workmen's Compensation Acts should be covered also by Road Traffic Act insurance and (2) that the law on compulsory insurance should differentiate between workmen's compensation claims on the basis of whether or not they were caused by a mechanically propelled vehicle.  The provisions of the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966 (No. 16 of 1966) replaced the system of Workmen's Compensation as laid down in the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 to 1955 as from 1st May, 1967. Under the 1966 Act, a system of State insurance enables a worker to claim against the State for benefits for death, injury or disease suffered in the course of employment.</P>
    <P>So as to ensure that the introduction of the new system of occupational injuries insurance will not alter the <i>status quo,</i> in so far as the scope of road traffic insurance is concerned, it is necessary to insert a new paragraph in section 65 (1) of the 1961 Act to include as &ldquo;excepted persons&rdquo;, persons claiming in respect of an injury in <Col N="1680" /> respect of which occupational injuries benefit is payable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At first sight, this appears a reasonable amendment.  It seems really to be replacing the workmen's compensation code by the Occupational Injuries Act.  Up to now compulsory road traffic insurance was not necessary in respect of an employee.  That was the position and it was stated in the old Act that compulsory insurance was not necessary in the case of an employee.  The idea behind this was that he was entitled to workmen's compensation.  Under this measure notice has been taken of the fact that he is entitled to occupational injuries compensation and that therefore compulsory road traffic insurance should not be required in his case.</P>
      <P>I find that in general practice this will place the workman in a less favourable position than he was under the old code.  I am saying that for the reason that most employers were insured against their workmen's compensation liability to their employees but invariably the policy under which they were insured also covered the employers' common law liability to his employee.  The result was that if the employee was injured in a road traffic accident while in his employer's vehicle, it was almost certain that if he was not the driver, the employer was guilty of negligence and he could then sue the employer at common law.  Apart from the workmen's compensation he could receive, he could be awarded substantial damages at common law. It is less likely at the present time that employers will continue to insure their common law liability.  It may be said that the employer will continue to insure against common law liability, but, as I say, it is less likely because they will be paying this 2/- a week and they will consider their workmen's compensation liability covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, the employer would not be insured against this common law liability to his employee and if he was not a mark, the workman who was seriously injured in a motor car the property of his employer would be confined to the comparatively small <Col N="1681" /> benefits under the Occupational Injuries Act.  Unless his employer was a mark, he could not recover the substantial damages he might be entitled to at common law.  That is a thought and I throw it out for consideration.</P>

      <P>Section 95 defines traffic signs, as I have already told the Deputy.  It indicates the existence of a road regulation in relation to a public <Col N="1683" /> road.  As defined early in the section. &lsquo;road regulation&rdquo; means an order, regulation, bye-law or rule, under an enactment (other than section 86, 93, 94 or 96 of this Act) relating to traffic on a road.  It is intended to insert &ldquo;91,&rdquo; after &ldquo;86,&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Signs&rdquo; which indicate the existence of (and/or implement) an order, regulation, bye-law or rule under section 86, 93, 94 or 96 of the 1961 Act do not come within the definition of &ldquo;traffic sign&rdquo; in section 95.  Signs under these sections are of an individual character (bridge notices under section 93 and &ldquo;road closed&rdquo; notices under section 94) or are provided by authorities other than road authorities (bus stop signs under section 86) or are different in some other respect from normal signs (as in the case of signs carried by traffic wardens).  It is not possible, therefore, to apply the general provisions of section 95 of the 1961 Act relating to the provision of traffic signs to these signs.  An amendment of section 91 of the 1961 Act (effected by the Schedule to the Bill) will enable the Garda to use portable signs on special occasions.  It is necessary to provide that these portable signs will not come within the definition of &ldquo;traffic sign&rdquo;.  The first amendment of section 95 provides for this, namely, that &ldquo;portable signs&rdquo; will not come within the definition of &ldquo;traffic signs&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The effect of this amendment&mdash;maybe it is the existing law but it is restating it&mdash;is to say that the running of a car park is not a business.  It says the operation of a car park including the operation of facilities therefor on or in property leased by a local authority shall not be deemed to be a business <Col N="1684" /> within the meaning of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  I think the meaning of that is that if a person leases a car park or leases property from a local authority and converts it into a car park and builds up considerable good-will and takes a lease, say, for ten years, then, at the end of ten years, he is not entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act entitling him to a new lease or compensation for distrubance.</P>
      <P>I think it cannot reasonably be stated, in the year 1968, that the occupation of running a car park is not a business.  Of course it is a business and it will become perhaps big business as the years go on.  I think such a lessee should have the rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, that he would have were is not for this exclusion.  There might be some sort of a case to be made for not renewing the lease but the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, takes care of that and makes provision for payment of compensation.  If we confirm the law here now as this, we shall have a case where a man could take a lease of a barren bit of land from a local authority, spend a good bit of money on it, build up good-will and then be thrown out at the expiration of his lease without any right to renewal and without any compensation for disturbance. This is out of line with all the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. These car parks are leased for a temporary period by a local authority such as Dublin Corporation and have been portions of sites earmarked for municipal housing which are put to this use for a temporary period while the corporation is waiting to acquire the remainder of the property which it is necessary to acquire in order to provide the housing.  This is a reasonable provision to make.  It is designed to ensure that where a local authority lets a car park to a private concern it will be in a position to repossess the car park or to convert it to alternative use should it be desired to follow this course.  Under the 1961 Act, section 101, subsection (10), the local authority <Col N="1685" /> may, with the consent of the Minister, lease a car park or any part of it subject to such conditions as it may think proper.  It is obviously desirable to ensure that where a local authority lets a car park to a private concern for operation for a period as a car park it will be in a position to resume the car park and convert it to alternative use.  The operation of the Landlord and Tenant Acts could defeat this by providing for rights to have leases renewed for certain periods which I think is what Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister, knowingly or otherwise, used a word in his explanation&mdash;&ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.  Of course, the Landlord and Tenant Act has already dealt with conditions like that and leases for temporary convenience are not within the terms of the Landlord and Tenant Act at all.  If it is really temporary lettings such as Deputy Tully has spoken about that the Minister is trying to safeguard, it is not necessary.  I would thoroughly agree that if an urban council, Dublin Corporation or any other corporation has a derelict site it does not know what it will do with at the moment and, taking the long term view, other property will be available in ten or 15 years, it would be unreasonable permanently to deprive the local authority of that property, but there is a way of dealing with that already, that is, to declare in the lease that this is a letting for temporary convenience and the Landlord and Tenant Act then specifically excludes such a temporary letting or leasing from its provisions.</P>
      <P>But there is no doubt about this: if the measure goes through as suggested, it will apply to all leases, whether they are genuine and <i>bona fide</i> temporary leases such as the Minister and Deputy Tully have spoken about or whether they are genuine leases taken for 21 years.  When granted, 21 years seems a very long time but we all know how quickly such leases become short leases and a young man taking a lease for 21 years may say that it will do for his lifetime but soon finds that ten years have expired and if he goes to sell it he is operating on a short lease with no power of renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is that it will discourage the genuine acquisition of land for this <Col N="1687" /> very desirable and even necessary car parking.  I am all with the Minister as far as temporary lettings are concerned of bits of land the local authority do not know what they want to do with. It may be a very good thing to let them out for car parking, but in that case the person who would take them would not spend money on them but would leave them, as some of them are left around the city, as unsightly dumps, half-levelled out and used as car parks.  That is not the type of business I have in mind.  I have raised the matter and I cannot do any more.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 38, to delete the second amendment of section 104.</P>
      <P>Section 104 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that in certain offences under the Act a prosecution does not lie unless the accused person is warned at the time of the incident giving rise to the prosecution or within 24 hours after it that the question of prosecuting him for the offence under the Act would be considered or unless within 14 days after the commission of the offence a notice of intention to prosecute has been served or a summons has been served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been the law in this country for a very long time.  It was the law under the old Road Traffic Act and it was again enacted in the Road Traffic Act of 1961.  Now we are proposing by this amendment to water that down a good bit and to say that a person can still be prosecuted, presumably six months after the occurrence, even if he <Col N="1688" /> was not warned at the time of the accident or within 24 hours of it that a prosecution would be brought, or even if notice of intention to prosecute or a summons has not been served within 14 days.  We are providing here that, notwithstanding that failure, the accused was at all material times aware of the occurrence in respect of which the prosecution for such offence is brought.</P>
    <P>If I understand that amendment correctly, it is to do away with the necessity of a warning or a notice of intention to prosecute.  A person could be aware of the occurrence giving rise to the prosecution, but he might not have regarded it as an offence under this Act, or he might not have thought anything about it.  The whole object of the warning or the notice of intention to prosecute was to put the accused person on notice within a reasonable time after the occurrence that he was going to be prosecuted and to give him an opportunity of thinking about it and, perhaps, talking to his witnessess about it.  That has been thought necessary since the 1930s, and it is difficult to see why it is necessary to bring in this amendment which is going to water down this protection which was afforded to the accused person to such an extent that it will be really useless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 104 contains a proviso the effect of which is that failure to comply with the requirements of the section in regard to notice in regard to an offence shall not be a bar to conviction in certain cases.  The second amendment of section 104 extends the cases in which a failure to give notice will not preclude a conviction by including cases in which, notwithstanding the failure, the accused was at all material times aware of the occurrence in respect of which the prosecution was brought.  In a recent court case, the judge ruled that to comply with section 104 a warning, whether verbal or in writing, should be given as a separate and distinct matter in a case in which a person is arrested and charged with an offence. This was obviously based on a literal interpretation of the provisions of section 104 and, I think, makes nonsense <Col N="1689" /> of the clear intention of the section. This amendment should make a warning unnecessary in such a case.  If a person is arrested and charged, he can hardly claim he was unaware of the occurrence.</P>
      <P>The amendment is also required for cases in which the defendant, though he admits to being perfectly well aware of the occurrence, relies on a minor technical error in the notice in order to escape conviction.  If it is quite clear that the person was well aware of the occurrence, this should not be necessary.  Of course, it will be a matter for the courts to decide whether or not the person was aware of the occurrence, and I think we can rely on the courts to see that lack of formal notice will not in any particular case prejudice the defendant in preparing his defence.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will tell you just in a second what you can do to cure that situation.  There is already a provision in section 104 which says that where a person is charged with an offence under section 47, 52 or 53 of this Act, he shall not be convicted of the offence unless either &ldquo;(a) he was warned at the time....&rdquo; or &ldquo;(b) within 14 days after the commission of the offence a summons for the offence was served on him&rdquo;.  In order to cure the case raised, all you had to do was to add to that: &ldquo;or a charge has been preferred against him&rdquo;, and that was that fixed up. However, here we are availing of a court decision virtually to wipe out protection afforded by the verbal warning or service of the notice of intention to prosecute.  I think it is going too far. I agree it will be a matter of defence <Col N="1690" /> for the accused to say that he was not aware of it at all, but he might not be able truthfully to say that; but he might be in a position truthfully to say that while he was aware of the occurrence, he did not regard it as a breach of any of the provisions of the Act and that by the time he got the summons, nearly six months afterwards, he was so hazy about the whole thing that he could not put forward his defence.

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to tighten up the law on accident reporting. At present, a person who is involved in an accident must, in addition to stopping and keeping his vehicle at the scene for a reasonable period, give on demand his name and address, particulars of his insurance, etc., to a garda if he is present or to a person entitled under subsection (5) of the section to demand that information. If a person entitled to demand the appropriate information is present but does not demand it, the person involved in the accident is under no obligation to report the accident to the Garda.  The amendment of section 106 will require a person who has been involved in an accident and who, for any reason, does not give the appropriate information at the scene, to report the occurrence to the Garda. It will also impose a duty to report all accidents involving personal injury to the Garda.  The majority of these accidents come to the notice of the Garda at present but it is considered that there should be a clear duty to report all such accidents.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This certainly makes a substantial change in the law.  The Minister has said that at present the only obligation on a motorist is to stop and remain at the scene of the accident for a reasonable time, and give a third party an opportunity of finding out such particulars as he is entitled to.  I <Col N="1693" /> have an open mind on this.  I cannot say I am against it so long as we are clear on it, and the public will become aware of what is involved.  It now means that after an accident, unless a person has given the necessary particulars on the spot, he must go to the Garda.  Apparently the Garda now do not want to hear about accidents that do not involve personal injury. They do not seem to think they are very concerned with them.  It is also the case that it imposes&mdash;if I understand the Minister correctly&mdash;a duty to report an accident involving personal injury to the Garda, whether or not the appropriate information has been given to a third party on the spot.  It will lead to more prosecutions anyway, I am sure.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule, as amended, be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to repeat some of the arguments I made before.  The Schedule provides for the inflicting of serious penalties on a person who <Col N="1695" /> refuses, in the circumstances outlined, to give a sample of his blood.  It imposes the same penalties for that offence as for the offence of driving while impaired within the meaning of the Act.  I think that is going much too far and I want to register the strongest protest against it.  I believe it is unconstitutional. I know the Minister has been advised that it is not unconstitutional, but Ministers have received advice of that sort before and the courts decided against it.  I suppose that if the Bill becomes law as it is, we will have to patiently await a decision of the High Court or the Supreme Court on this and other provisions.  I do not think we will have to wait too long.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of whether the provision is constitutional or unconstitutional, we believe it is highly undesirable that we should create here the criminal offence of failing to submit, in the circumstances outlined in the section, to a minor surgical operation to provide a couple of spoonsful of blood, as the Minister said, and to punish a person who, for one reason or another, refuses to submit to what might be for him or her an ordeal, by heavy fines, imprisonment and consequential disqualification.  Only if there were no other way to attain the objective behind this Bill could or should this House agree to those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave the Minister an alternative by agreeing to make such a refusal <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person was unfit to drive a car by shifting over to the accused the onus of proving that he was in fact fit to drive a car within the meaning of the Act.  I say that would have provided the Minister with much more than adequate machinery to clear the roads of the impaired driver.  I am convinced that only after that had failed should the Minister come to this House seeking the extreme measures which he has asked for, especially as he was advised by a commission of experts which his predecessor set up that what he is doing was unnecessary and undesirable. I put forward that argument at greater length on the sections creating the offences but I think it only right <Col N="1696" /> to repeat it on the Schedule which provides the penalty.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Schedule, as amended, that the Minister has deleted section 22 from the Bill as drafted.  It was a section which restored to the Minister power to restore licences taken away.  I think public opinion demanded that and I am glad the Minister has acceded to it.  Most of the other things I wanted to say have been said on amendments and in some cases the Minister has undertaken to look into them.  I think the proposal in the Schedule, as I have said, will place the employee in a less favourable position than he is in at present in that he may find himself, in respect of his common law rights, pursuing an uninsured employer.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to have a look at that.</P>
    <P>We also raised the question of the consequential disqualification for the second conviction on the comparatively trivial offence of driving without due care and attention.  I think the Minister now appreciates the serious consequences that might have and again I am glad that he has agreed to look into that.  We have dealt with most of the other matters in the Bill as we went through it and we shall deal with any outstanding ones on Report Stage which I hope will not be taken for a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Apart from the many matters we have dealt with in Committee, in regard to the matters of principle in the Bill and the proposals&mdash;which are also dealt with in the Schedule&mdash;to create the absolute offence of driving with a certain concentration of alcohol in the blood and to impose heavy penalties for that, I must go on record as saying that I disagree with them and that my Party disagree with them.  We believe the alternatives suggested by my Party through me were adequate and should have been accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Increases in retired pay, pensions and gratuities for or in respect of former members of the Permanent Defence Forces (including the Army Nursing Service) and the Chaplaincy Service are promulgated by Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes which are made under the authority contained in the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, as amended.  Section 4 of that Act provides that no pension scheme shall come into force until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by resolution of each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two types of pension increases which can be described as &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;.  The first is an increase related to an increase in remuneration &mdash;that is, where the pension bears a proportionate relation to remuneration, <Col N="1698" /> so that, when the remuneration is increased, the pension must also be increased.  The second is what has come to be known as a &ldquo;Budgetary&rdquo; increase&mdash;the type of increase, applicable to State pensioners generally, announced by the Minister for Finance in connection with the Budget.</P>
    <P>Statutory provision has to be made for such increases in the different pensions codes.  As far as the Defence pensions codes are concerned, the practice up to now has been to amend the Military Service Pensions Acts, the Army Pensions Acts, the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts and the MacSwiney (Pension) Acts and, as regards retired pay and pensions under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, to introduce new amending schemes to provide for the increases.</P>
    <P>These measures take up a certain amount of Parliamentary time, and in the course of the debate on one such amending measure a few years ago&mdash;it was the Army Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1954&mdash;reference was made in this House to the desirability of simplifying the procedure for promulgating increases of the specific types I have mentioned in the pensions administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, which enables the Minister for Finance to prescribe such increases by regulation rather than by legislation, is wide enough in its scope to cover a number of the pensions for which the Minister for Defence is responsible, and consequently Budgetary increases in military service pensions, Connaught Rangers pensions, and the pension under the MacSwiney (Pension) Acts are being brought within that particular procedure.</P>
    <P>It was hoped to make a similar arrangement for increases in benefits under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, but the machinery of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, was not fully adaptable for this purpose.  Neither was it possible to cover benefits under the Army Pensions Acts, but I hope in the near future to introduce an amendment of these Acts which will also provide for regulations rather than legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> Accordingly, the object of this Bill is to achieve the desired simplification in procedure by providing that a pension scheme which deals with increases in benefits, arising out of increases in service pay or Budgetary increases in public service pensions, will not require confirmation by formal resolution of each House to bring it into force but will come into force as provided in the scheme.  Such a scheme would be laid before the House and would not be debated unless a resolution is moved for its annulment.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that this new procedure applies only to the two &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; types of increases I have mentioned. Where any other type of change is being made in the schemes the old procedure will be followed&mdash;that is to say, the scheme will not come into force until it has been laid before each House and has been confirmed by resolution of each of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We very much welcome this Bill on this side of the House.  On the debate on the Army Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1964, we suggested it was desirable to simplify the procedure for promulgating increases of the type referred to.  I am very glad indeed the Minister has now accepted the suggestion made on that occasion and brought in this Bill.  I am a little disappointed that he has not gone further and tried to arrange for increases in benefit under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act so that they could automatically be increased by regulation rather than by legislation.  That would be a very commendable thing.  I am glad the Minister has said he is considering it.  I hope some time in the near future he will be able to implement what he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These pensions to which our Defence Forces are entitled are indeed minimum and minimal pensions.  I do not think we give to our Defence Forces the pensions they deserve.  We are inclined to keep them hidden under a bushel.  Only this morning I met an Englishman anxious to visit the House who wanted to know what was going on.  I informed him it was a Bill to provide simplification of the payment of pensions to our Defence Forces.  He said he had <Col N="1700" /> been in Ireland for the past six weeks and thought we had abolished our Army because he had not seen a soldier during all that period. We appear to hide our Army under a bushel.  I do not think that is for the benefit of the personnel of the Army or for the <i>esprit de corps</i> or morale of the Army generally.  I know this is not the place to discuss that.  It is amazing that we have a Defence Force of approximately 6,000 personnel which costs £10 million approximately, but £4 million of that is spent on the administrative side. There is something wrong there.  I sincerely hope the same proportion of the amount we vote for pensions will not be absorbed in the same manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we are in favour of the Bill and the Minister was wise in introducing it.  It will save himself and the House a lot of trouble.  However, I am rather disappointed with the Bill for other reasons.  Section 3 of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>This Act applies to the following benefits under the Principal Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  retired pay, pensions and gratuities for or in respect of officers of the Forces,</P>
      <P>(b)  pensions and gratuities for non-commissioned officers and men of the Forces,</P>
      <P>(c)  pensions and gratuities for members of the Army Nursing Service,</P>
      <P>(d)  pensions and gratuities for members of the Chaplaincy Service.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was under the impression that the Minister would avail of the opportunity to try to do something about gratuities for NCOs and men and also for unmarried officers.  An opportunity has been lost of doing something I am sure the House would have unanimously agreed with.  I also felt he might have availed of the opportunity to deal with a question which is a very sore one with the Army at present, that is, the question of the amount of pension after the 31 years service.  I know the Minister is aware of everything pertaining to Army service, but there are a few facts he may not know.  I would not <Col N="1701" /> have known of them myself, had they not been brought to my attention.  With your permission, Sir, I would like to give them briefly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Act gave authority for the payment of pensions to NCOs and men of the forces after 21 years continuous service. It did not provide for gratuities. The first personnel to whom this would apply would be those finishing in 1949. The Minister knows the reason.  In that year, authority was given for the further extension in service of NCOs and privates by two year periods up to a limit of five such periods, ten years, for which pensions would be increased by 1/- per week for each year completed. This brought the total pensionable service up to 31 years.  This then would apply to those finishing in 1959.  In 1959, a further extension of two years without pension was granted to personnel with certified pre-Truce IRA service.  All others, except technicians who could serve until the age of 60, who had completed 31 years had to retire.  The result was that trained men still at a relatively early age were made to retire for no other reason than that they had 31 years service.  Many of them were a lot better trained than those being recruited. They were good at their job and knew it inside out.  For some extraordinary reason, it was decided that not age but service should count and that if you had 31 years service you must go.</P>
    <P>This continued up to 1960 when the 31 years service period was shelved and instead the 60 years age limit was substituted.  This continues up to the present.  This solved a lot of the problem. It meant that age 60 was the retiral age in service.  The regulation allowed quite a number to carry on in the Forces but without any increase in pension.  In 1966, the Jubilee Year, a further extension in service was granted to personnel who had certified pre-Truce IRA service.  In 1967, there was the termination of service of nearly all the long-serving personnel by reason of their having reached the age limit.  Most of them, by this time, had completed 43 to 45 years but only <Col N="1702" /> with a pension for 31 years, irrespective of rank.</P>
    <P>The number affected by this, I understand, is comparatively small.  I am sure the Minister can see the merit of the argument I am making.  Would he say, even at this late stage, it is possible to introduce some section into the Bill or in legislation which will come at a later stage which will give credit to men who have served 45 years?  I do not know any other pensionable job in this country or anywhere else where men are allowed to serve but only given 31 years service out of 45.  The pension is not very big&mdash;1/- a year for the last ten years. Surely it is awfully small?  I want to make it clear, knowing the Minister as I do, that I am not blaming him for the situation that has arisen.  This is something that has been handed down, but it is something which has now been brought to his notice and he might take cognisance of it and attempt to rectify it.  I am referring to that and the other question of gratuities for NCOs and men.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister realises it or not, but an Army man finishing his service does not easily fit into industrial employment outside.  He finds very many people who just do not want to know him if he is looking for a job.  For some reason, they feel he cannot do work.  I have very personal reasons for asking that these matters be considered.  I believe, with Deputy O'Donnell, there is in this country an attempt to try to hide our Army away and say they do not count.  The fellows who go to Cyprus are on the radio occasionally and they get a certain amount of credit.  When they first returned from the Congo, everybody met them coming home.  I saw a group coming home from Cyprus recently. They were marched into a little shed at one side while the ordinary people were allowed into the airport.  They were treated as though they were second-class citizens, people who did not count very much.</P>
    <P>I spoke to some of them and they said: &ldquo;We do not want you to do anything about this because it might come back on us.&rdquo;  That was shortly after the first of them came home <Col N="1703" /> from Cyprus and since then I have not made any comment on it, but I would ask that they be given more consideration than they get at the present time and that an effort be made to try to realise that soldiers are important people even when there is no war on. The one way in which we can show our gratitude for what they are doing is by attending to the two items I have raised&mdash;a gratuity for privates and NCOs on termination of service and for the unmarried officers and pension credit for all their service, not just up to 31 years.</P>

      <P>This Bill of course explains itself.  It deals with certain specific increases only, and it is confined, as Deputy Tully has pointed out, to the increases arising from the circumstances as outlined in section 3 of this Bill.  It does not provide for anything else.  I have listened attentively to what Deputy Tully has said in relation to gratuities for NCOs and privates and unmarried officers and the other changes he would wish to see implemented.  However, all the matters he raised are proper for consideration for inclusion or otherwise in a pension scheme.  This Bill is not a pensions scheme and any of the matters he raised would not be proper to be provided for in a Bill of this nature.  However, I shall give due consideration and have been giving consideration to some of the matters Deputy Tully has raised in this connection.</P>
      <P>In relation to the criticism of the non-appearance of our armed forces on the streets or in the countryside, there is no attempt whatsoever being made to hide our Army.  I have great respect for the armed forces of this country.  So has Deputy Tully, Deputy P. O'Donnell who has spoken for Fine Gael, and, I would say, all Deputies.  I do not know if anybody in this country regards the members of our armed forces as secondary citizens.  I would not in any circumstances think of them as such.  I have the highest admiration for men who offer their services in the armed forces of their country, no matter what country they belong to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know nothing of the incident which Deputy Tully mentioned regarding the <Col N="1704" /> troops coming back from Cyprus.  If they were taken aside to some room, there might have been a reason for it, a reason which might not be apparent to the observer at the time.  As far as I am concerned, the NCOs and men of the armed force of this country are very well respected by their officers and the men of the force have great respect for the officers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further to say.  This Bill is self-explanatory and it will be an improvement in the legislative procedure which enables the payment of pensions under the pensions scheme.  There have always been pensions schemes and I am sure there will always be amendments to them. Under this new procedure, Deputies can raise any question they want to raise in connection with a new pensions scheme when it is laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October, 1961, an International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations was concluded at Rome.  The Convention was drafted under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, the International Labour Office and the Bureau of the International Union for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. It was open for signature until 30th June, 1962, by which date it was signed by 36 countries, including Ireland.  In accordance with the provisions of Article 25 the Convention entered into force on 18th May, 1964, following <Col N="1705" /> ratification by six countries, one of which was Britain.</P>
    <P>So far as the requirements of the Convention relate to Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, they are already met by the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963, which came into operation on 1st October, 1964.  The present Bill is designed to meet the requirements of the Convention in relation to the protection of performers and, if it is enacted, we shall be in position to ratify the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Performers' Protection Bill, 1964, was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 30th June, 1964, with the object of enabling us to ratify the Convention and it had its second reading on 25th November, 1964.  A number of official amendments aimed at bringing the Bill into complete conformity with the Convention had been drafted for proposal on the Committee Stage, but the Bill lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil in March, 1965, without reaching that stage.  Following representations from interested parties the amendments proposed at that time were further examined and revised and they are incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the essential features of the Convention is set out in Article 4, which requires that a Contracting State shall grant national treatment, i.e., broadly the same treatment as is given to nationals of the State, to performers whose performance takes place in another Contracting State or is incorporated in a phonogram or a broadcast made or published in or broadcast from that other Contracting State.  Section 11 of the Bill will enable the Government to satisfy this requirement.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the Convention sets out certain acts in relation to performances which would infringe the rights of the performers or which would be contrary to the interests of the performers and requires that the protection to be given to performers shall include the possibility of preventing those acts.  It is not proposed to create a property right in a performance, in the nature of a copyright, which a performer could enforce by civil action or which <Col N="1706" /> he might assign for enforcement to any group such as a performers' union.  It is proposed to meet the requirements of Article 7 in sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.  The proposals in those sections provide for protection of performers by making it a penal offence to do certain acts in relation to performances. It will, for instance, be an offence, punishable by fine on summary conviction or conviction on indictment, to make a record or a film of a performance without the consent of the performer, to sell or hire such a record or film, or to use it for the purpose of giving a public performance.</P>
    <P>Article 12 of the Convention provides that where commercial records are used for broadcasting purposes or for public performance, the user shall make a payment to the performers or the producers of the records or both. Under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963, payment is required to be made to the owners of copyright in sound recordings, that is to the makers of recordings, when their records are broadcast or used for public performance. It is understood that, under an agreement made between the recording companies and the various performers' union, a percentage of the money which these companies receive for this use of their records is paid over to the performers' unions for the benefit of their members.  The proposals in the Bill will not interfere with this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The initiation of proceedings under the Act will be the responsibility of the person aggrieved.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly becoming a very cosmopolitan sort of State when we consider that in the past two days two Bills were introduced here which were necessary because of international agreements and the bringing into line of the law in regard to performance and behaviour in various States.  Perhaps it is of the world in this case rather than of Europe as before.  This question of performance adds up to a huge business when you take phonograph records, television, radio and all the rest of it <Col N="1707" /> into account.  You find that this is an industry which is far greater than most people would think at a first cursory glance.  When the production is even more easily dispersed than money, it is quite clear that the tentacles of the law and the proper guidance of the industry, should anybody cross State boundaries, should be kept on it.</P>
      <P>The fact that this State has signed the documents arising from the Convention in 1961-62 means that we are committed to it.  We have no objection at all on this side of the House to the introduction of this measure.  We regard it as necessary.  It is difficult for an Opposition to examine this Bill critically because it is not just something related to ourselves alone.  It relates to an international Convention. There does not seem to be any objection from this side of the House to the Bill and accordingly we have no objection to its passing today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inquiry which I make at the instance indeed of a former Member of the House, a distinguished Member of the Minister's Party, on the occasion of this Bill.  It is said that publicans, many of them small publicans barely on the existence line, throughout the country who make use of gramophone records for the popularising of their premises, indeed for the creation of the convivial mood, are compelled to make a contribution to this Society in respect of the playing of records.  This would appear to be an imposition on them which could not be justified by the amount of business they do in the first instance.  They are made to pay money for this.  I would like the Minister to say if this is, in fact, the legal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is the legal position, would the Minister think of having a look at it to see what can be done to relieve such people?  As we well know, many of those publicans are very hardworking people who have to work extraordinarily long hours.  Indeed, all members of their families have, on occasion, to engage in the business in order to make it economically possible for it to be carried on at all.  It would seem, when they buy a gramophone record for use in a very limited area <Col N="1708" /> such as a small public house, a lounge or a bar, unreasonable that they should have to pay a sum in respect of every time the record is played.  I do not know if this is, in fact, the position. It is thought to be the position and I would like to hear the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a short comment?  I am not so much interested in those people.  Deputy Dunne has dealt with one fact but I am interested in the use of radios in a public place.  Most of us of necessity have to dine in hotels and cafes and we like a radio to be available, particularly for the news.  Sometimes there is some music before the news or maybe it will continue afterwards. Most of the places I know have taken the radio out because of the fact that they have been required by the Performing Rights Society to pay for the use of it on the ground that certain songs or pieces of music were, in fact, played in such places.  Perhaps the Minister might let me know what is the position there.</P>
      <P>I believe the labourer is worthy of his hire and that in the case of somebody who performs or sings, if royalties are being paid, that person is entitled to get his share.  I am a little hazy about the situation with regard to the number of records sold, the amount of money which goes to the performer or whether there is somebody else who syphons off some of it. The selling of records is becoming a big business at the present time.  More money, as the Minister is aware, is spent by the younger people on records than on anything else in this country, and that includes food.  This entertainment scoops off an awful lot of money.  Certain people spend a fair proportion of their weekly or monthly wages on this sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the State gets a cut out of this.  Does the State get anything out of gramophone records?  I would like to hear the Minister on that.  I would also like to know if any of the money being paid for the playing of those records goes into a society or not.  What way is it distributed?  I might say that if it goes to the people who sing on those records they are <Col N="1709" /> entitled to get their share because the artist is entitled to get some extra compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also another thing.  Background music is used in lounges, which unlike Deputy Dunne's point, is supplied by a company.  I do not want to say the name of the company but a weekly fee is paid and the records in the machines are changed regularly by people who call to the premises.  This background music is used so that the people next door cannot hear what you are saying. Do the Performing Rights Society levy anything on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The points which have been raised on this Bill, I am afraid, do not really relate to it but I might say a word or two on them, since the points have been raised.  As I said when introducing this Bill, under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963, payment is required to be made to the owners of copyright in sound recordings, that is, to the makers of recordings, when their records are broadcast or used for public performance. That aspect is covered under the Copyright Act and not under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, in regard to the point raised by Deputy Donegan, I do not know what the specific rights of the company providing those services are but I would assume that the paying of the fee would cover everything.  In other words, in the cases which have been referred to by Deputy Donegan and Deputy Tully, the principle is that there is under the Copyright Act a right vested in the makers of the records to collect a fee in respect of any performance of this record in public.  I cannot purport to define what a public performance is but I think there have been decisions on this by the courts, and as far as I know, substantially it means performance in or <Col N="1710" /> in connection with a business, and this would include lounge bars, hotels or anything like that.  As Deputy Tully says, the labourer is worthy of his hire. I do not think reasonable objection can be taken to the fact that payment must be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that where they are being broadcast it would be more equitable if the fee were collected from the Broadcasting Authority rather than have the case of the person who turns on the radio, when he wants the news and happens accidentally to get the Beatles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a record is broadcast by a radio station, a fee must be paid in respect of that broadcast.  I think the Deputy's point is that another fee is demanded as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for interpretation by the court as to whether or not it is justifiable.  The principle of payment for performance in public is a sound one.  The payments made to the record companies include payments which have to be made to the performers on foot of the contracts made by them with the companies.  The only point I can make which would be of assistance to Deputy Dunne is that, while the principle is sound, it may not generally be known that there is a procedure whereby an appeal can be made against the amount of the fee charged by the Society to which he referred.  There can be no objection to their levying the fee but in cases where it is thought too high&mdash;say, in relation to a small public house, and so on&mdash; there is a procedure for appeal, I think, to the Controller of Patents.</P>

      <P>No, Ireland.  Take, for example, a small public house in the country.  There is a procedure for appeal to our Controller of Patents against the amount of the fee.  The <Col N="1711" /> Performing Rights Society, to which reference is made, is, I understand, a non-profit-making society and is really a trade union for performers to ensure that they get their just reward for their performance.  There can be no objection to the principle on which they operate.  But, if the fee is thought excessive, there is a procedure against that fee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and second parts of the Deputy's question is that the Nigerian Chargé d'Affaires came to see me on 8th instant.  He expressed his grave concern at the distorted and misleading presentation of the tragic civil war in the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme referred to by the Deputy, and in certain articles published in our newspapers.</P>
      <P>I referred to the statement issued by my Government on the previous day in answer to inquiries from the press, which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Chargé d'Affaires informed me that he was sending a tape of the Telefís programme to Lagos and I urged him to request his Minister for External Affairs not to issue the tape to the press or to radio-television, lest it might endanger the good relations between Irish citizens and the people of Nigeria or of other African countries.</P>
      <P>The answer to the final part of the question is that I propose to continue doing everything I can to promote a cease-fire and negotiations aimed at establishing stable peace, reconciliation and cooperation between all sections of Nigerians in their mutual interest.</P>
      <P>I wish to add that I pointed out to the Chargé d'Affaires that a peaceful and lasting solution of the Nigerian problem and a firm guarantee of the human and political rights of all citizens would set a fine example to the other African peoples who inherited on achieving their independence potential difficulties of a similar nature and to whose social and economic development many Irishmen and women at great personal sacrifice have been and are making a significant contribution.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">PRESS ENQUIRY</P>
      <P>On the 7th February the following questions were put to the Department of External Affairs&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  What is the official Government policy towards Biafra? and</P>
      <P>2.  Is there any reason to be concerned about the position of Irish missionaries there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> The following reply was issued through the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    <P>1.  The Government recognise the Federal Republic of Nigeria and maintain diplomatic relations with the Federal Government. Recognition has not been extended to the Eastern Region of Nigeria as an independent State by Ireland or any other State.</P>
    <P>2.  The Department of External Affairs has been very anxious about the safety of our citizens in Nigeria since the outbreak of the civil war and the Irish Embassy has given all possible assistance to those of them who wished to leave temporarily or permanently.</P>

      <P>Our diplomatic representation abroad is reviewed from time to time in the light of the relevant considerations, including trade prospects. The volume of our exports to either of the countries referred to does not at present provide sufficient commercial justification for the expense involved in formal diplomatic representation. I should mention that in recent years bodies such as Córas Tráchtála and An Bord Bainne, as well as private business interests, have visited the USSR and other Eastern European countries with a view to increasing our exports.  So far, the prospects for sustained growth in exports to any of these countries are not promising.</P>

      <P>I have been considering certain proposals for the establishment of milk processing plants in the North West by the local co-operative societies and the Dairy Disposal Company.  In view of the size of the area, it would appear that at least two plants may be required.  In considering the proposals, and in particular the question of the location of any new plants, it is, of course, necessary to have regard to the general question of creamery re-organisation and, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, this question is at present being examined by two consultants from the United States.  I hope, however, that it will shortly be possible to have further discussions with the co-operative societies in the North West about the milk processing proposals for the area.</P>

      <P>The building in question is held on lease by the State for a term of 75 years from January, 1967.  It is not the practice to disclose the amount of the rent payable in respect of a State rented property as the figure concerned is a confidential one between landlord and tenant.  The rent is exclusive of rates.  Occupation of the building began on 7th October, 1967, and was completed on 16th December, 1967. Immediate occupation was not possible because of the necessity to provide partitions and lighting installations, to supply furniture and fittings and to instal telephones.</P>
      <P>The total cost of preparing the premises for occupation was approximately £80,000 of which about £20,000 was in respect of furniture, office fittings and floor coverings.</P>
      <P>Because of its age and condition some of the furniture and office fittings which had been in use by the staffs transferred to the new building, would not be suitable for re-use and will be disposed of.  The remainder has been or will be re-issued to meet the demands of Government staffs, as appropriate.</P>

Personal injury was inflicted on the gardaí concerned in 12 of these cases but the injuries, by and large, were not of a serious nature. Charges were preferred in all cases save one.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities recognise that the protection of the man on the beat is an important matter and give it constant attention.  Whenever violence is considered at all likely, patrols are intensified and the single-man patrol is replaced by a two-man one.</P>
      <P>The recent equipment of beat-men in Dublin with personal radio sets linked to the Radio Control Room and to the mobile units lessens the isolation of the man on the beat.</P>

      <P>A claim for disability benefit by the insured person concerned in respect of the period from 22nd May, 1967 to 18th October, 1967 was disallowed on the ground that he was not incapable of work. This decision was upheld, following an oral hearing, by an appeals officer, whose decision is final.  A claim for disability benefit for the period 19th October, 1967 to the 21st December, 1967, has also been disallowed on the grounds that he was not incapable of work and it is open to him to appeal against this decision if he is dissatisfied with it.  This person represented himself as fit for and seeking work when claiming unemployment benefit on 3rd January, 1968 and he was paid that benefit up to 15th February, 1968.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question exhausted an entitlement to 156 days unemployment benefit on 21st April, 1966, and needed 13 contributions in respect of insurable employment after that date to qualify for further benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He next claimed benefit on 19th April, 1967, and lodged with the claim his 1967 insurance card bearing six stamps stated to cover employment with two farmers for one day in each of four weeks and two weeks respectively. These stamps, when added to seven paid for 1966, gave precisely the total of 13 required for requalification for benefit.  In all the circumstances, it was considered necessary to investigate the insurability of the various employments <Col N="1736" /> and consequently the validity of the contributions for benefit purposes.</P>
    <P>Having considered the results of the investigations, a deciding officer decided that the employment in 1966 was insurable under the Social Welfare Acts but that the employments represented by the six stamps in 1967 were not so insurable on the ground that they were not under contract of service.  The claimant appealed against the negative portion of this decision, as did one of the two employers concerned.  Following an oral hearing at which sworn evidence was taken from the two employers and the claimant, an appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  The decision of the appeals officer is final.</P>
    <P>It follows from the invalidation of the six contributions in question that the claim of 19th April, 1967, for unemployment benefit failed and the claim was disallowed accordingly.  The claimant was paid unemployment assistance from that date pending determination of the claim for benefit and payment is continuing since the determination.</P>

As indicated in that reply, it is <Col N="1737" /> not envisaged that the setting up of industrial estates in locations other than at Waterford and Galway will be undertaken pending completion of surveys of various regions, one of which comprises Counties Sligo and Leitrim, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>

      <P>Limerick city:  A grant of up to one-half of the total amount of the costs of factory sites, site development, factory buildings and machinery, plant and equipment is available, but, where An Foras Tionscal are of the opinion that there are sound economic reasons why the undertaking cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas and other exceptional circumstances exist, a grant of up to two-thirds of the total amount of such costs can be made.  Grants are available for the training of workers comprising actual wages plus travelling and subsistence expenses if trained abroad.  Profits arising from exports are exempted from income tax and corporation profits tax for ten years, up to 1979-80.</P>
      <P>Shannon Industrial Estate: A grant of up to the full cost of buildings and up to half the cost machinery is available. Alternatively, factories, warehouses or office accommodation can be rented at economic or subsidised rents with the option to purchase or sites can be provided on which a company may construct its own building.  There is total exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax arising from exports up to 1983.</P>
      <P>Galway city: Grants are available of up to two-thirds of the total costs of factory sites, site development, factory buildings and machinery, plant and equipment.  The local authority is empowered to grant two-thirds remission of rates for ten years on premises provided by means of a grant by An Foras Tionscal.  Profits arising from exports are exempted from income tax and corporation profits tax for ten years, up to 1979/80.</P>
      <P>Galway Industrial Estate: On the industrial estate in addition to the facilities available in Galway city generally, factories built in advance of demand will be available for renting to industrialists.  The rents charged will reflect the capital grant which could have been provided if industrialists had built their own factories.  Estate factories may also be rented with the option to purchase.  Projects located on the estate will, in addition, be eligible for consideration for industrial grants towards the cost of plant and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Facilities available at all three centres: The training grants available for industries located in Limerick are also available at Shannon and Galway. <Col N="1741" /> Where a grant is made towards the cost of providing buildings, or machinery and equipment, An Foras Tionscal may make a grant towards the capital cost of the provision of electricity by the Electricity Supply Board.  Any such grant made may not exceed one half of the capital cost payable to the ESB. An Foras Tionscal may guarantee the payment of money payable to the ESB in respect of the capital cost of the provision of electricity supply.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy Kitt's supplementary, I cannot dispute the facts as indicated by him.  With regard to the other points raised, I would point out to the House that ideally we could devise a system that would ensure in the event of failure of an industry we would get back all the money or at least get full control of the premises or plant.  But if we did this we would get very few industries to come in.  This is the problem: to devise a system that will allow freedom of operation to people to come in without throwing away all the State's interest.  In fact, at the time this factory was built in Galway in 1956 there was a provision that the premises could not be disposed of for a period of five years without the consent of An Foras Tionscal.  The main purpose was to ensure that if the industry should fail their property would have to be at the disposal of a suitable industry which would take its place.  Usually in cases like that arrangements are made with An Foras Tionscal whereby the original grant is passed on to the new people taking over the factory.  The regulations now provide that the provision is for a <Col N="1743" /> ten-year period as against a five-year period</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of boiler installations for provision of heating for St. Kevin's Hospital is concerned, I am advised that it is not correct to say that St. Kevin's Hospital relies on one functioning boiler.  I understand that there is a number of different boilerhouse installations, each dealing with different groupings of buildings. It is possible that the Deputy has in mind the boilerhouse adjoining the laundry building in the north-eastern corner of the site.  This boilerhouse provides heating services for Hospitals Two, Three and Six, for the office block and board room building and for the Convent building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1967 the health authority <Col N="1751" /> made representations in regard to the need to install two new boilers in that boilerhouse and proposed to use oil as fuel.  They were informed last May that because of policy considerations it was not possible to agree for the present to the proposal to oil fire the boilers but that no objection would be raised to the installation of two new boilers in the existing boilerhouse for turf firing and to the carrying out of necessary incidental works and the replacement of defective pipelines.</P>
    <P>I am advised that it is the standard practice with hand-fired installations to accommodate the fuel in proximity to the boilers to facilitate firing, and that no significant fire hazard is involved because of this.  This has been the practice in the boilerhouse above mentioned throughout the years and also in the case of similar installations generally throughout the country where full-scale mechanical handling and firing is not provided for.  I understand that, if the new boilers are installed in appropriate locations in the boilerhouse referred to, it should be possible to provide for improved storage arrangements.  If the health authority proceeds on the basis of turf firing, it should be possible to complete any remaining planning work in a matter of weeks.  It has already been explained to the health authority that it is Government policy in the national interest to ensure that to the utmost practicable extent, native fuels are to be used in preference to any other fuel in local authority institutions and other institutions supported by State funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the hospitals which within the last five years were permitted to change from turf to other fuels for their boilers; and the reasons for, and savings resulting from, such changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval was given to proposals by hospital authorities to change from turf to other fuels in 14 instances after consultation with Bord na Móna.  The considerations on which decisions are taken as to the nature of the fuel to be used are usually related to site conditions, size of the institution and nature of the <Col N="1752" /> services being provided.  In a substantial number of the cases where a change was made the question arose during 1966 when the turf supply situation was less favourable than it is at present.  In the majority of these cases the decision not to insist on the use of turf related to new installations or to installations of a very greatly increased capacity, and the question of reducing turf consumption did not arise.</P>
      <P>The majority of the installations for which exemptions were granted in recent years are not yet in operation and it is not possible to give an estimate of any savings which may result from the use of oil.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that there are other considerations to be taken into account from the over-all national point of view, such as the question of imports and balance of payments and the employment afforded through the policy of utilising native resources to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that the object of the question was to suggest that oil should be used instead of turf in Dublin hospitals. This was repeated over the past couple of days.  I am quite sure the Minister would agree that because the facilities for burning turf are already there, because turf gives very much-needed employment and represents a saving to the State because many of the people who are employed in producing turf might in fact be unemployed if they were not employed on this work, that it is essential that native fuel be used as far as possible.  The Minister said that.</P>

      <P>I have notified the mental hospital authority that I have no objection to the proposals submitted by the manager for the acceptance of certain tenders for the building work and associated services installations subject to certain conditions, including the obtaining of guarantee bonds for the full amounts of the contracts.

I understand that the mental hospital authority and the consultants employed by them are at present finalising the details preparatory to the actual execution of the contract documents.</P>

      <P>I have inquired into the circumstances under which the wrong remains were removed from St. <Col N="1755" /> Vincent's Hospital, Tullamore, on 14th February last.

Offaly Health Authority has taken steps to ensure that there is no repetition of the occurrence in any of the hospitals under its control.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each health authority to ensure that the arrangements in force in its hospitals for the identification of the remains of deceased persons are adequate.  While I have no reason to believe that these arrangements are not adequate and that the present incident was other than an isolated exception, I am, however, taking steps to have the attention of health authorities generally directed to the matter and to advise them to check on their methods of preventing errors in identification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The increase in expenditure in each year arose from a number of factors: increase in cost levels generally, the progressive use of more expensive and effective drugs mainly in the general medical services and in the treatment of the mentally ill.  An increase in the user of health services generally has also occurred, involving additional expenditure on drugs.</P>
      <P>The rising cost of drugs has resulted in some increase in the expenditure falling on the rates but it is not the major element in rising health expenditure. Increasing expenditure on drugs seems unavoidable in a modern health service.  However, I do intend to investigate ways of ensuring that the increase is kept to what is needed for the proper treatment of patients.</P>
      <P>The financial information is contained in a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of extending the scope of our drug control arrangements is at present receiving my attention but it is necessary to ensure that any changes to be made will be appropriate both to the needs and to the resources of this country.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for monitoring each new drug introduced into this country as respects its safety in use are being operated by the National Drugs Advisory Board and, at my request, they are also considering proposals for a suitable scheme of quality control generally.  I expect that their recommendations in this matter will be submitted to me in the near future.</P>
      <P>With a view to effecting economies in the health services my Department some years ago drew up a schedule of proprietary preparations showing, in respect of each such preparation, an item included in the Department's Prescribed and Special Lists of Medicines which is either of identical composition or of reputed analogous therapeutic efficacy.  This schedule was circulated to all doctors in the health services for reference when prescribing. In addition, health authorities have been repeatedly urged to make available to their medical staffs copies of the &ldquo;Prescribers' Journal&rdquo; which is a useful aid to effective and economic prescribing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that many new drugs are coming on the market every year, that there is much overlap and that the medical profession depend to a very large extent on the information supplied by the manufacturers.  Would the Minister not think that a licensing board should be set up which could analyse and test different drugs and ensure that what manufacturers state as regards those drugs is correct?  I have been informed by a medical officer of health &mdash; I am mentioning no names &mdash; that very often there is an inclination to issue the same drugs in a different colour and under a different name and that the medical authorities cannot do anything about it.  Would the Minister not think that is a sufficient reason for setting up a licensing board which would prove to the medical profession and to the ordinary people that what the manufacturer was saying was true?</P>

      <P>The function of the Drugs Advisory Board is to advise generally on the safety and quality of drugs.  The only thing about all this is that if they are satisfied the drug itself is efficient it is then left to the doctor to prescribe and ultimately test the drug.</P>

Drugs are imported but their effects are not known until some people here have been used as guinea pigs.  Therefore, why not have this licensing board to test the drugs before they are put on the market here?</P>
