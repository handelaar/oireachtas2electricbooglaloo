      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the serious concern caused by his speech at the launching of national productivity year in which he said make no mistake about it, within two or three years tariff reductions will really begin to bite; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the remark quoted by the Deputy was to bring home again to those primarily concerned the rapid approach of the time when British goods will be competing more keenly on the Irish market. This is nothing new.  It has been said on numerous occasions by various Ministers of the Government and was mentioned as far back as February, 1966, by the National Industrial Economic Council in their comments on the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
      <P>I hope that my speech will have the effect of prompting people who have been slow in preparing for free trade to take the necessary steps now&mdash;including recourse to the various Government aids open to them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what is the relative scale of taxation on property, and incomes derived from it, expressed as a proportion of the gross national product in each of the years 1950, 1960, 1965 and 1967.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been assumed that the references to taxation on property and incomes derived from it may be interpreted as meaning, respectively, death duties on all forms of property and income tax charged under Schedule A on income derived from the ownership of lands and buildings.</P>
      <P>The net receipt of death duties expressed as a percentage of gross national product at market prices is 0.6 per cent for 1950 and 0.5 per cent for each of the three succeeding years mentioned in the question.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figures as respects the net produce of income tax charged under Schedule A are 0.3 per cent for 1950 and 0.2 per cent for 1960. Figures for the two later years mentioned are not available as, with the introduction of the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; for 1963-64 and subsequent years, a single assessment is made on the taxpayer in respect of the tax due on his total income and accordingly the tax referable to particular Schedules does not emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a letter from the chairman of the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation Ltd. which serves to confirm that misunderstanding between junior officials of his organisation and of the Board of Works led to an inadequate list of guests for the opening arranged by the tourism organisation.  If I had been asked to supply a list of persons to be invited I would certainly have followed my usual custom of including all public persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that either a junior or senior official of the Office of Public Works made a bad mistake or deliberately provided a list to the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation and asked them to send out that list and will he not agree that this was a particularly mean trick to play on a junior official?  Will he not agree that in this, the third round, I have won by a knockout?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with nothing of the kind but what has become clearly evident in this series of rather futile questions by Deputy Tully is that he himself is quite uncertain of his ground.  He has shifted his ground in this series of questions on numerous occasions.  The first time he raised this issue he asserted that the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation knew nothing at all about the formal opening that took place.  Then he discovered that ERTO themselves had requested the Office of Public <Col N="1057" /> Works to permit them to hold an official opening and so he had to shift his ground elsewhere.  Then an effort was made by him to impose the ineptitude of the ERTO on the matter of the preparation of the guest list by seeking to show that there was some sinister design on the part of the officials of the Board of Works.  I should like to point out to Deputy Tully that it was necessary for an official of the Board of Works to get in touch with ERTO two days before the opening to ask them if possible to ask the Commissioners themselves and the Parliamentary Secretary to the function which the Board of Works were said to be trying to monopolise. It is a very big storm in a very small teacup.  The ERTO made a glorious mess of this and the letter I had from the chairman of the organisation, as late as a couple of days ago, stated that he did not know there was such an opening being held by his organisation. If they do their business in that way you could expect something to go wrong.  Evidently they are not able to do their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall withdraw it and say that it is an untruth, that he is, in fact, accusing the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation of doing something which they did not do. Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that the organisation did not request permission to hold an official opening, that the only request made was from one of his own senior officials? Even now the Parliamentary Secretary does not appear to be aware of the vendetta between two sections of the Board of Works.  The reason I asked the question was to ensure that these people would be brought out into the open and would not try a trick like this again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain, in the first instance, that under section 8 of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE are free to fix such charges as the Board thinks fit for any service provided by the Board.</P>
      <P>CIE notified me of the need to increase fares and rates to help the Board to meet increased labour and other costs.  Details of the increases and the reasons therefor have been given in a comprehensive statement issued by the General Manager of CIE on Thursday, 21st November, 1968.  At the Government's request, there will be no increase in school children's fares.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied in view of CIE's present financial position that the Board has no alternative but to increase fares and rates and I have informed the Board that there is no objection to the proposed increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary that it should be clearly understood that, since the last increase in CIE fares and rates in January, 1968, labour costs in CIE have risen by over £3 million per annum.  Other costs, including material costs, fuel costs and financial charges have risen by £1.255 million in a full year, making a total increase of £4.3 million per annum.  The impact of rising costs have been offset by CIE to a substantial extent by increased business and greater productivity.  The <Col N="1064" /> balance must, however, be recovered as far as possible by the proposed increases in fares and rates.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE's annual subvention of £2 million cannot be varied before 1st April, 1969, after which the amount of the subvention will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister take into consideration the fact that this will impose a tremendous hardship on working-class families who must use buses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note that, just as the earnings of the staff of CIE have increased through negotiations between staff and management, so have the earnings of the rest of the community and that should enable the rest of the community to bear more easily these increased charges.  The increased charges in CIE arise, as the Deputy knows, because of the fact that in some industries and services the total labour costs are higher than they are in others.  In the case of CIE the labour cost is 61 per cent of the total cost.  The Government have been giving a subsidy of £2 million a year as a general contribution from the taxpayer to maintain the transport services.  That subvention will come in for fresh examination in connection with a Bill to be brought before the House and, I hope that, whatever the level of the subsidy will be, it will not constitute a greater burden on the total Budget than it did in 1964.  It is a question of balance. As the Deputy knows, money is required for educational purposes, social welfare and so on.  CIE is now being subsidised by the Department of Education in order to provide free transport for schoolchildren.  There is also a contribution towards the carriage of old age pensioners and others free. It is a question of balance.  It is a matter of striking the right balance.  If one examines the railway accounts of European railways one will find that the losses sustained by CIE, making allowance for the special conditions here, appear to be moderate compared with those in other countries, countries in which circumstances are more satisfactory <Col N="1065" /> from the point of view of the operation of railway services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the services offered by CIE are grossly inadequate and are, in fact, in a state of chaos?  By raising the rates at this point of time CIE is merely forcing people to acquire other means of transport, thereby worsening the position still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, like a few other Deputies, is always prejudiced against the CIE bus service.  I propose to deal with that on a later Question.  I want to make it clear that we have a great deal of knowledge of the operation of railways and bus services because of our link with the European Conference of Ministers of Transport.  It is possible to examine every phase of CIE operations, productivity, the utilisation of coaches and wagons, the use of diesel engines, the sales organisation, the efficiency with which buses and rail stock are maintained, the efficiency of the assembly service.  It is possible to make comparisons and these comparisons have been made.  I have no doubt that CIE is relatively efficiently organised in that way.</P>
      <P>CIE have managed to achieve a great deal of productivity in the past five years, both in the operation of bus and rail services.  It makes use of modern techniques and unitisation of traffic.  It makes other efforts it would take too long for me to enumerate.  We are not simply carrying on in a void. We have a great deal of information. We also have regular discussions with the chairman and general manager of CIE, and with the board, to make sure that they are aware of all the new techniques and that everything possible is being done to make the organisation efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister one feels rather guilty about asking this question.  He has given a comprehensive review of the situation, but is he aware of the fact that over £2 10s per week in bus fares must be borne by the father of a working class family or by a person earning £11 or £12 a week?  This is a considerable <Col N="1066" /> amount, and I think there should be a bigger subvention from the State to help the lower income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the fares had not been increased the loss in the present year would have been £3.256 million, £1,256,000 over the present rate of the subsidy.  Next year it would be very nearly £5 million.  One has to balance one element against the other.  I should like to tell the Deputy that I think bus fares in Dublin seem to be in line, so far as I can make comparisons, with the provincial bus fares in Great Britain.</P>

In relation to the general rise in wages this is part of an inflationary situation of which the Deputy must be aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The operating profits on the Dublin city bus services for the years ended 31st March, 1966, 1967, and 1968, were £295,000, £200,000 and £264,000 respectively, and the estimated operating profit for year ending 31st March, 1969, is £110,000.  These figures do not, however, include an allocation for financial charges and when an appropriate allocation for such charges is made, the results for each of the three years ended 31st March, 1966, 1967, and 1968, is a net profit of £128,000, £14,000 and £54,000 respectively.  After allowing for the additional revenue from the proposed increases in fares and rates, the estimated result for year ending 31st March, 1969, is a net loss of £120,000. The estimated result for the year ending 31st March, 1970, is a net loss of £130,000.  There is, therefore, no surplus revenue from the Dublin city bus services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have read some of the reports issued by CIE and gone into in great detail by me on the occasion of my last Estimate, of the efforts made by CIE to provide the best possible service.  There was the origin and destination survey in which some 250,000 people were interviewed in order to ascertain whether the bus services were scheduled in the best possible way.  An effort has been made to achieve greater productivity of the bus services from the standpoint of those who pay for tickets and from the standpoint of efficiency, and by providing larger buses by economies in maintenance and production and assembly of buses and by such matters as having a greater number of standby buses, mobile inspectors, radio control to centre, closed circuit television apparatus.  As the Deputy may know, at the moment there is a problem of bunching of buses at peak hours in the afternoons and in subpeak periods.  I understand that measures are to be taken by Dublin Corporation next year in addition to the provision of clearways and oneway streets which may relieve this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate the difficulties, in January, 1967, there were 600 lost journeys, that is 600 buses during the period of one month were unable to complete their journeys because it was not thought worthwhile as they had been so much delayed.  In September, 1968, 2,000 bus journeys were lost. This is a modern technical method of assessing the degree of bunching and it is serious.  All these things add to the cost of running the CIE bus service in Dublin, and certainly add to the inconvenience caused to the public.  I hope that next year when the new measures outlined by the Corporation are put into operation that position will be relieved.  I can assure the Deputy that there is the most scientific management of bus operation and that every conceivable device is used for the re-scheduling of bus services to meet the needs of the public for a bus service at a particular hour and a particular <Col N="1069" /> place relative to origin and destination services.  Queueing and bunching of buses are a familiar phenomenon in every capital city in Europe of which I am aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This was due, perhaps, to some relatively intemperate remarks made by some representatives of CIE in regard to the progress being made.  I can assure the Deputy that there is a co-ordination committee in <Col N="1070" /> which the Garda, the Department of Local Government, Dublin Corporation and CIE participate.  As the Deputy probably knows&mdash;this has been published in the newspapers&mdash;there is an intention to establish parking meters in the centre of Dublin.  Wardens have been appointed to try to enforce the parking laws and this should help in the mobility of transport and particularly in the movement of CIE buses.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, as the House knows we have a complaint service in our Department and we refer complaints to the State companies themselves.  Frequently we discuss with the manager of a particular State company a number of repetitive complaints.  These complaints for areas in relation to the services referred to by the Deputy are due to bunching in the city at peak times.  There was an inevitable obstruction on the main road due to repairs which by itself cut in half the road and caused an appalling disruption of traffic.  It lasted some days and was inevitably part of the problem.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>No grants have been made to any semi-State company for which I am responsible in respect of the engagement of the management consultants named by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is normal business practice for semi-State bodies, particularly those engaged in trading operations, to engage consultants from time to time to assist the management in the solution of particular problems; where this is done without special State assistance, the choice of consultants, the terms of engagement and the assessment of results are the responsibility of the company concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister no information as to the cost of engaging these consultants?  Has he no information as to what benefit accrued from the expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of engaging the consultants is, as the Deputy knows &mdash;there is general application of fees of various kinds to consultants and so many consultants have been employed &mdash;of no very great significance if good results come therefrom.  I receive constant <Col N="1073" /> reports about the consultancy works they have done on behalf of State companies.  Consultants have proved to be extremely useful.  In relation to the total expenditure by these State companies.  I would not regard the expenditure on any particular consultant as of any great importance or significance.  It could not affect the financial position of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems most reluctant to answer the question I have asked.  Is the Minister in a position to say, or does he know, what the exact cost of employing the named firm of consultants was and what benefit accrued from their employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In this particular case considerable benefit accrued from the employment.  As the Government gives no grant, and the Government does not make a decision about whether a particular consultant should be employed for a particular purpose, it should really be left to the commercial action of the company.  There are many consultants of various kinds and it would not be appropriate for me, when no Government money is involved, to make a declaration or statements about the employment of one consultant as compared with a great many others.  I can assure the Deputy that the employment of the particular consultant named by him does not bear any great importance in relation to the total employment of all consultants of other kinds by State companies.  It does not enter into the picture to such a degree that the Deputy might be worried about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is more worried than the Minister.  Is the Minister telling the House it is no concern of his whether or not a suitable Irish firm could be employed, whether or not benefit accrued from the employment of such a firm, or whether or not that firm was paid in sterling?  Is the Minister seriously telling the House these things or is it of no interest to us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say these things were of no interest.  I said they <Col N="1074" /> have no significance in relation to the total number of consultants employed by all State companies.  The answer to the question raised is that it has no significance in relation to the total consultancy expenditure of State companies.</P>

      <Col N="1081" /> It is not possible to forecast demand and price conditions for milk powder for some years ahead but the current situation as regards supplies of dairy products generally on world markets is not encouraging.</P>

      <P>The publicity campaigns of the National Dairy Publicity Council have been directed principally towards encouraging increased consumption of cheese.  Cheese consumption is in fact estimated to be about 40 per cent higher now than it was in 1963, the year before the council was established.</P>
      <P>The council's activities have also included promoting the consumption of liquid milk, cream and butter.  This year the council is specially promoting milk consumption in hotels and other catering establishments.</P>
      <P>A further expansion of the promotional programme is under consideration.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the last three questions, is it not so that skim milk powder is a very fruitful source of protein and is it not true that a great part of the problem of malnutrition <Col N="1082" /> in Africa, both the peaceful and the war-torn parts, is the question of supplying protein?  Is it not the intention either of the United Nations or various bodies concerned with the relief of the kind of problem to which I have referred to concentrate on the supply of milk powder and can we do anything to persuade them to do so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the proposed British import restrictions; and <Col N="1092" /> what action the Government intend to take to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by me yesterday, copies of which have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I propose to cover this matter in the course of my reply tonight to the debate on the Financial Motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, is it not a fact that this action by the British Government is a definite breach of the Free Trade Area Agreement?  In view of the fact that this breach of the agreement was made by the British Government without advance consultation, can the Taoiseach say what action it is proposed to take in relation to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether the action of the British Government is a breach of the agreement &mdash; their action in introducing a scheme of import deposits &mdash; is a matter on which there can be conflicting opinions.  Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that it is clearly a breach of the spirit of the agreement.  As to what action we propose to take, this is a matter we have at present under consideration, but the immediate and most effective action has been taken with the co-operation of the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the action taken to relieve the problems our exporters will have, surely it is a situation which calls for action on our part?  We have a situation in which the Government here are lending the British Government money to get them out of their balance of payments difficulties while the British Government clearly have taken action which is contrary to the letter and the spirit of Article 18 of the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has mentioned Article 18.  It is open to either party to the agreement to take certain action in the event of that country running into balance of payments problems.  Such action includes the imposition of quantitative restrictions. These are defined in Article 24 <Col N="1093" /> as prohibitions or restrictions on imports, whether made effective through quotas, licences or other measures with equivalent effect, including administrative measures and requirements.  As I have told the Deputy, whether the action of the British comes within that definition is open to argument.  The position is being examined closely by us at the present time.  As for lending the British Government certain moneys, I do not think that applies because the moneys which will be used for this purpose would not be available to us for capital purposes in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach contemplate taking any action to offset the British action?  Under Article 18 of the Agreement, we are entitled to take counter-balancing action if we wish to do so.  Has that aspect been considered and, if so, what action do the Government propose to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain action is under consideration but one does not rush into taking action of this nature unless one is sure the effects will not be to our disadvantage.  As I have said, these matters are under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that in view of this action by the British, taken unilaterally, the possibility of breaking this agreement should now be considered by the Government?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this last action by the British is serious enough to merit our consideration of breaking the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether it will cost approximately £50 million to provide this assistance to Irish industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to say. It has been estimated that the cost involving six months exports of the kind that will be affected would amount to maybe £20 million to £25 million by way of the required deposit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House very long because I understand there are other speakers who wish to get in before the debate concludes this evening.  A few moments ago we heard a discussion on the implications of the British Budget and we saw what has been talked about here for many weeks past, the Minister for Agriculture taking the case out of the hands of the Taoiseach.  I just wondered who is in control in the Government.  Since I spoke here last week events have been happening rapidly in Europe, events which made Britain introduce a hair shirt Budget which affected very much our economic position but it must be remembered that no monetary crisis hit this country from outside at the time that we introduced our maxi-Budget.  Our present economic and financial difficulties are due solely and entirely to incompetence, lack of foresight and political wrangling within the Fianna Fáil Party and within the Government. That, to my mind, is the cause of our economic crisis today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I reported progress last week I said I thought there was arising in this country two classes of society, the affluent and the social welfare benefitciaries. It is easy to see that the affluent society is coming on very quickly, led, of course, by the Taca organisation.  They are the people who are trying to garner all the big jobs in industry and in other spheres.  At the bottom of the list we have social welfare beneficiaries.  The middle-man is fast fading out of existence in this country.  The small farmer in the west of Ireland has lost hope.  The Government have said that they came to the aid of the small farmer in the West by granting him dole &mdash; unemployment assistance &mdash; but they forgot one thing, that the method of assessment for that was changed a year or so ago.  Now, £20 income is put against £1 valuation. They also forget that in the rural areas of the West many of the small farmers are unmarried and consequently do not qualify for this.  The reason they <Col N="1098" /> are unmarried is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a girl to come into a small farm in a backward place in rural Ireland.  Consequently a large number of the small farmers are not eligible for social welfare benefit.  Then we have the middle-man with a £20 to £30 valuation.  He has been squeezed out.  He does not qualify for any social welfare benefit and qualifies for very little other benefit. Quite a number of them are living on fragmented holdings and a great deal of time is absorbed in travelling from one holding to another.  As well as that, they cannot keep up with the pace of increased taxation.</P>
    <P>The small shopkeeper in the west of Ireland is practically out of business with the rates going up year after year and the income falling due to supermarkets and all the rest.  The gap between expenditure and income has now become a yawning chasm.  In the foreseeable future the small shopkeeper will go out of business.</P>
    <P>There is no incentive in this Budget or in previous Budgets towards hard work.  One of the things we will have to do in this country, if we are ever to balance our economy, is to work harder.  There is instead, I think, an incentive towards laziness.  If I may give an example, I know of a widow with one child who was drawing a widow's pension.  She had nothing else except about two acres of land which was unused.  She had not money to work the land and she let it run into common. She went out on domestic work at £3 a week and declared to the social welfare officer.  Because she went out to work and declared to the social welfare officer that she was earning £3 a week she lost her widow's pension. Her case was appealed and the appeal was lost also.  Where is the incentive to work there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling but I thought I was in order in dealing with incentives and encouragements or lack of incentives in this Budget.  However, I shall pass from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> We know that our basic ill is unemployment. There is a deplorable lack of employment opportunities today, especially in the west of Ireland.  Due to that lack of employment opportunities we have a very high incidence of emigration.  We have asked here time and time again for productive employment that would keep our people at home and swell the coffers of the Revenue Commissioners through income tax.  All those please have gone in vain.  The Government have turned a deaf ear to the position in the West and the economic ills which exist there.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a statement by the Taoiseach about clouds on the horizon.  Of course, those clouds had been on the horizon a long time and practically all the clouds in Ireland appear to follow the sun into the West. Today you have a rich east coast and a poor west coast.  Any economist will tell you that a rich east coast and a poor west coast will never make for a balanced economy.  You have a pampered east coast and a neglected west coast, which will never make for a balanced economy, through the wilful neglect &mdash; and wilful it was &mdash; of the Fianna Fáil administration in this country.  They are the Party who have been longest in power.  Economic decay has set in in the West and the only solution is to put more people into productive, taxable employment.  It must be remembered that the best source of wealth in any country is its human flesh and blood.</P>
    <P>If we examine the west of Ireland from this point of view we see from the records that 44,000 people, young boys and girls, left the Province of Connacht in the last ten years.  Not so long ago we saw Fianna Fáil posters plastered all over the place about 100,000 new jobs.  The 44,000 people who left the Province of Connacht in the last ten years could have got some of those 100,000 new jobs but when the posts were promised by Deputy Lemass he apparently misled the people into believing that they would be available in this country.  These jobs were found in the large industrial cities of England, in Manchester, Birmingham, London and Liverpool.  That is where the jobs were found, not in this <Col N="1100" /> country.</P>
    <P>I have been to Swinford, and, perhaps, this is symbolic because during the time of the Famine several uncoffined bodies were buried in the work house yard in unknown graves, and I saw on the wall of this building the words &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;. Somebody came along and added just two words &ldquo;to Holyhead&rdquo;.  That is exactly what Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Government did, and what the present Fianna Fáil Government are doing, to the west of Ireland. We are told that the transfer of the Department of Education to Athlone and the Department of Lands to Castlebar will help to revitalise the West.  The transfer of these Departments will not open up closed doors. The transfer of Departments will not bring back the 44,000 people who emigrated from the Province of Connacht in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>I have been pleading since I came into this House over seven years ago for heavy industrial development in the West, heavy industries which would give male employment.  I have fought here for 6 or 7 years for an industrial estate in Sligo.  I hope I will have a comeback yet and that favourable news will be circulated as soon as the result of the Buchanan report is circulated.  That is a must because we are situated close to one of the most depressed areas in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Fianna Fáil Government of being guilty of the rape of rural areas and the west of Ireland.  I accuse them of wilful neglect of almost an entire province.  I accuse them of being responsible for the economic chaos there.  I accuse them of being responsible for waterlogged land, land which, as it is, would not provide money and employment for the remnant of the population should they stay at home.</P>
    <P>The unjust taxation in this cruel Budget will, I think, react mostly on the rural sections of the community. The never-ending spiral of taxation which we have had in two Budgets in one year &mdash; nothing new to Fianna Fáil of course &mdash; will weigh most heavily on the poorer section.  Anybody who knows anything about the <Col N="1101" /> economy will know that the wholesale tax will slow it down.  We know it will slow down house building.  In the towns of Ballysodare, Tubbercurry, Ballymote and Collooney, in my constituency, the people are crying out for housing but this wholesale tax will slow down this house building.  There has been no word of an increase in reconstruction grants.  There has been no increase for years in spite of the fact that the cost of materials and labour has increased considerably.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the price of milk.  Much has been made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of the penny increase in the price of milk.  I am sorry he is not here to hear what the position is in my county.  I do not know whether the same applies all over Ireland.  The position in my county is that the price of milk with the penny added will be the same as it was in 1967.  There is proof of it in the returns for September, 1967 and September, 1968.  This is worth listening to.  In 1967 the test was 3.65; in September, 1968 it was 3.65; the same test.  In 1967 the price was 23.53 pence per gallon and in September, 1968 the price was 22.58 pence per gallon, that is, one penny down from 1967 to 1968. Therefore, the increase of one penny brings the farmers in my constituency back to the price they had in 1967 in spite of the fact that the cost of feedingstuffs and the cost of labour has increased.  The farmers in my county will be much worse off with the one penny per gallon added than they were in 1967.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries were present I would say more to prove to him that the farmer today with the one penny increase in milk price is worse off than he was with the 1967 price.  No allowance is made for the increased cost of feedingstuffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>This hits the poorer section of the community most of all. In my constituency I can see the change coming whereby the people will no longer be able to bear the burden of taxation, and the housewife will not <Col N="1102" /> be able to balance her budget.  People who would never dream of looking for social welfare benefits are coming to me in their thousands day after day and week after week for advice. That is a sign of the times.  The increase on cigarettes, tobacco and beer, of course, hits the poorer sections of the community.  The Government may call these commodities luxuries.  If they are luxuries they are very small luxuries for the poorer sections of the community.  These things are mere necessaries which make the struggle to stay on the land a little less onerous.  In the west of Ireland this taxation which is depriving people of those comforts will be an incentive for still further emigration.</P>
      <P>To old people eking out their final years a pipe of tobacco or a pint of stout can make life a little easier.  Now, these small luxuries are placed beyond their reach.  Is the Minister being cynical when he describes this attempt at curbing expenditure as one of the excuses for the savage imposts of the maxi-Budget particularly where elderly people and those on low incomes are concerned?  He has hit their only relaxation.</P>
      <P>There is no incentive to save because whatever little money people might save is taken in death duties.  Of course, there will be no money for the poorer sections of the community anyway. Savings should be encouraged but the incentive is lacking.</P>
      <P>There are other matters to which I should like to refer but many others wish to speak on this Budget.  In passing, I wish to refer to rates.  Small business people will no longer be able to clear the rates and in rural areas where land is not derated up to £40 valuation the holders will not be able to pay. They have no productive opportunities. Although we have had in Sligo the Owenmore and Arrow Drainage proposal mooted for the past 40 years and although 117,000 acres of land are affected, the Government would prefer to spend the money on a useless effort to change the Constitution rather than look after the interests of the people in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appear to be travelling along a very bumpy road into the future and <Col N="1103" /> into Europe.  The Government are doing nothing more than merely filling in the potholes and the cracks in order to deceive the people.  They should get out and allow Fine Gael to take over the country so that they may try to reduced the bumps and fill in the cracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker said we are on a bumpy road.  I presume he did not expect that this country's economy could escape the vicissitudes that have visited and afflicted other countries allowing us to travel on without much effort and making no sacrifices and, as the former Taoiseach said, slide our way down to prosperity.  This is not possible.  Nobody owes us a living and we shall not reach prosperity sitting here groaning.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate I wondered what this House has to offer the country at present &mdash; recriminations from the Opposition, fault-finding, placing the blame, challenging each other to have another election to see who will win. Could we not take a look at our problems in the hope of making a contribution towards their solution?  I say &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; because in the kind of democracy we have large freedoms are allowed and Parliament and the Government can offer only a contribution. The solution of our problems depends on the co-operation of almost all sections of the community.  If we are to achieve this we could set out in this House to find an understanding of our problems and a reasonable approach to their solution.  I realise the difficulties.  Reason has no chance in a battle against emotion and we have reached the era of dealing with each other through headlines and slogans.  I should like to impress on the House that slogans quickly thrown out or headlines easily read without study in depth of the real problems and the processes of solution will not get us out of our trouble and nobody will get us out of it but ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of opposition in every democratic country and at all times is to undermine the Government in the hope of replacing it.  This is done by accentuating existing grievances and <Col N="1104" /> producing artificial ones, if possible causing a general feeling of gloom and despondency and, if possible, self-pity. But our Opposition, as has been pointed out before by other speakers in the course of the long campaign on the referendum, have taken all the steps open to them to prevent them becoming a Government at any time.  If they cannot in this House offer the country an alternative Government they should at least make it possible for us to discuss alternative policies which might be implemented to solve our problems.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors which made the Government's financial proposals necessary was the round of salary and wage increases which has worked its way through various employments this year.  What is now called the 11th round was initiated in 1967 when a number of pay settlements were made which seemed at that time to be generous, although I suppose those who benefited then may regard them as being on the modest side now.  The general pattern which emerged in the 11th round in industrial employment was of pay increases on a phased basis of 30/- to 40/- or, in percentage terms, from about ten per cent to 20 per cent with increases spread over two years and in two or three instalments.</P>
    <P>As the 11th round progressed there was a tendency for the amount of the increases to go higher.  The increases became higher and the element of phasing and of time became shortened and compressed.  The upper limit of 20 per cent was breached in certain settlements and the average increase has now moved much nearer 20 per cent than ten per cent and, as I said, in some cases over 20 per cent has been given.  At the same time, other costs increased &mdash; items such as reduced hours, service pay, longer holidays and a wider range of employment.  More recently, pay adjustments in the public sector and in salaried employment have moved into the centre of the picture and there have been some trendsetting awards by arbitration tribunals which have considerably upset the pay situation.  All these happenings have brought a series of settlements giving <Col N="1105" /> pay increases far in excess of the expected growth in national product for this year.</P>
    <P>Everyone is now complaining bitterly of the price increases which have now been put on the community but I cannot see what else we can expect in view of what has happened in salaries and wages during the past 12 months.  It is yet somewhat early to say what the precise outcome of the 11th round will be in terms of overall increases in cash incomes.  The latest index of wages available is that average earnings in transportable goods industries for the June quarter show an increase of 8½ per cent over the corresponding quarter in 1967.  There is little doubt, too, that the last quarter of 1968 will show an increase of as much and probably a good deal higher.  This, coupled with the fact that the average number of hours of work tends to drop, indicates that we are paying ourselves a good deal more for less work.</P>
    <P>If national income goes up by four or five per cent a year and if salaries and wages go up by something in the region of ten per cent or more, prices simply must rise.  I know that other factors such as the devaluation of the pound contributed to the price rises, but there is no use in adopting an ostrichlike attitude in this association between pay increases and the inevitable harvest of rising prices.</P>
    <P>As I said before, nobody owes us a living.  The effects of the incomes increases on domestic prices are manifest. I wonder if anybody links these increases in domestic costs with what is happening at the same time in our export position.  If costs go up at home, they must also go up for our goods abroad and our export position, therefore, is being endangered.  The economic shocks which have been experienced by our neighbours in Europe during the past few days should have at least one lesson for us, namely, that we can continue to exist and develop in a modern world only if we can expand and diversify our export markets.</P>
    <P>We have Government organisations for seeking out markets, for developing markets and for advising exporters. We also have the private activity of our own manufacturers, but I repeat that a strong export position depends <Col N="1106" /> heavily on competitiveness.  One sure way to kill our competitiveness is to insist on getting salary and pay increases which are not justified by improved output and productivity.</P>
    <P>All that has been happening here has been happening in our system of free negotiations.  The Taoiseach spoke of clouds on the horizon but I would deny the statement of the last Deputy that we have a crisis.  All these clouds arise with the faults in the system of free collective bargaining and free negotiation for wages and salaries.  By and large, we are fixing our own salaries.  We did it by vote in this House.  In different sections of the economy, perhaps, people fix their own salaries.  Well-organised workers are fixing their own wages by industrial action and, except for the weak sections of the community, we are, in this context of free collective bargaining, fixing our own incomes.</P>
    <P>As I say, all these faults go with the freedoms of our system and those who would criticise the faults should be prepared, if not to put up an alternative method of dealing with them, at least to discuss the alternatives.  I do not believe anybody in this House will accept the extreme alternative but we may as well go over what we could do as an alternative way of managing our wage and salary situation.  The first alternative is what we are doing.  We are operating a system of free bargaining with the Government taking no stronger action than merely giving guidelines to those who are running the negotiations, those who are fixing the wage and salary levels.  We have set guidelines based on the expected national growth.  We have given guidelines in the form of ministerial statements and this has been the system in operation with all the faults which we see.</P>
    <P>Another system which is being tried in other places, but not here, would be a system of voluntary control &mdash; a freeze if you like &mdash; done voluntarily by responsible people.  This, as I say, is being tried in other places and we watch it with interest.  There is also the alternative of statutory control which I do not believe anybody in this <Col N="1107" /> House would want.  Again, there is another way of dealing with the problem but this would require a great deal of co-operation, that is, to have a prices and incomes board.</P>
    <P>If we study any of these, we will find that, associated with the theory and especially with the practice of them, there are much worse disadvantages than those associated with free collective bargaining.  The Government have decided on what we are doing nowfreedom of action for the negotiators with guidelines offered by the Government and by such bodies as the NIEC and, a couple of years ago, by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must realise that if we are leaving the system of negotiation to be operated in freedom, those operating it must understand that their actions and decisions have an influence on other people in the community.  Up to now, people have taken decisions and have made agreements without having any regard for other citizens in the country.  I would suggest that, rather than bemoan what has happened in 1968 to wages and salaries, we should resolve that from this point on we adopt a new approach &mdash;an approach based on productivity.</P>
    <P>The 11th round offered a wonderful opportunity for linking productivity measures with pay increases because on this occasion, as distinct from earlier ones, the agreements were negotiated on an industry by industry or on a firm by firm basis.  The opportunity which was offered to us was almost completely lost.  As a community we are committed to these phased pay increases I spoke of, which mean further increases in 1969, and this as a result of agreements already negotiated.  What we need above all now&mdash;we cannot go back&mdash;is to determine, as a people, to improve our productivity to pay for the increases which we have given to ourselves and to seek further productivity improvements as a basis for increases after 1969 so that pay increases after that time will not have the inflationary results that salary and wage increases are having now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> I mentioned the people who can fix the level of their own income.  Apart from the need for the Government's financial proposals now, apart from the threat to the economy, which, incidentally, is expanding well&mdash;we need not be gloomy about it&mdash;apart from the deficiencies in the use of our free negotiating system, there are other undesirable effects.  There are the effects on the lower paid workers; there are the effects on the unemployed who want to get employment in this country; there are the effects on the youngsters leaving school who have a right to expect to be employed at home; and there are the effects on the disabled, who can only hope for employment if we can increase the number of job opportunities.  While we continue to pay ourselves more than we can afford, these people will be left out of the picture and will be made to suffer.</P>
    <P>The problem of the lower paid worker has been the subject of many public statements from different spokesmen who, in spite of the system being a free system and in spite of all the evidence about the power of the Government in this field, think that the Government can solve it.  The Government have been frequently urged to help to improve the situation of lower paid workers.  I should like to assure Deputies that the Government want to do something in this field, but it is very difficult for the Government to do anything effective unless the trade union movement itself pushes the interests of the lower paid worker.  It must be clear to everybody that in a free society where power of position is the only criterion, the lower paid worker, the unorganised worker, will suffer.</P>
    <P>The trade unions and the Government acting in co-operation could help the lower paid worker, but it is no help to the lower paid worker if he is only used as a base for all the differentials which would start another round and leave him, perhaps, worse off than when the round started.  Those of us who are better off&mdash;and this includes better-off people in all sections&mdash; should be prepared to let the lot of the lower paid worker improve without <Col N="1109" /> making demands for maintaining differentials.  Anybody dealing with this question is aware of the difficulty of persuading people not to take what they think is their due.</P>
    <P>Anybody who examines the various settlements in the 11th round will agree that practically nothing was done by the negotiators to help the lower paid worker, and I lay the blame for this at the door of the trade unions.  They have made various pious statements in this matter, but that is as far as they have gone.  The interests of the powerful and the well-organised have predominated and the lower paid sections have made various pious statements in The Government would have preferred if the opposite had happened; they would have co-operated fully in any move to help the less well-off, and will co-operate in any effective move to help them.</P>

If we pay ourselves more than we earn, prices will go up.  The day we start looking at it that way we can start doing something to remedy the situation.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear this. I am saying that, if we continue to give this nation the freedom which everybody claims, I think there are things which a Government can do in relation to those sections of the public, the unemployed, the youngsters leaving school and the disabled.  We are spending public money on the educational training of those people.  The changes in the educational system over the last few years have been visible to everybody.  They have been discussed widely but, in addition, the Comhairle Oiliúna&mdash;which was set up under legislation by this House&mdash;training programme is now moving into top gear and the first training centre at the Shannon Industrial Estate is already in operation.  A second one will be opened in Waterford next week, and a further one will open in Galway in the New Year.  The year after I hope to have a major centre of training opened in Dublin suitable for the training of about 400 people at a time. In the same way the traditional apprenticeship is being up-dated and during next year a number of major industries will be brought within the scope of the Act, which we passed here, that is, the levy grants system will be applied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those schemes are intended to stimulate management to make a greater effort to undertake training within their own individual undertakings and to spread the cost of training more equitably throughout the firms in each industry.  As I say, this training programme is aimed at developing the skills of our people.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that economic progress depends on the contribution made by people in all walks of <Col N="1113" /> life.  The chief fruit of economic progress should be the welfare of the people of the nation&mdash;more jobs, education and training of the people to do their jobs well and to develop all their talents more fully.  Those are serious aims of our economic and social policies.  We have had, I must acknowledge, full co-operation from both sides of industry in this so far.</P>
    <P>I have been for years dealing with this area where the Government comes in between the two sides of industry. A few years ago I was hearing a lot of talk that the Government should do something.  Again, nobody mentioned what it was but what they meant was something which they themselves would be afraid to offer as a solution to this problem.  I have discussed this at length with both sides of industry, but more particularly with representatives of the Trade Union Congress and with trade unionists I know personally and I have made myself as fully aware as possible of the problems</P>
    <P>I have often said legislation is not the cure for the problem of industrial relations.  Particularly was this necessary to say two or three years ago when many people, even people well informed in other fields, felt that all you had to do was to pass a law and everything would be all right.  I must acknowledge over the last few years there has been a much deeper understanding of and fuller thought given to the problems in this field so that those facile solutions are no longer offered as we go about our day's work.  That is not to say that the field of industrial relations is any better.  It does not say there is anything to be proud of about the way it is proceeding and it does not mean we have nothing to worry about.  It means we have a wider understanding of this very sensitive area.</P>
    <P>I mention this because it is a very sensitive area requiring very delicate intrusion by those who want to speak on it.  In recent times we have had to meet difficulties within that field where people think that any legislation produced in this field would be repressive. Various Opposition spokesmen have used this word &ldquo;repressive&rdquo;.  I want to nail the allegation as firmly as I can and refute as strongly as I can that <Col N="1114" /> repressive legislation is contemplated. It certainly is not contemplated and I might add that, if it were contemplated, it would not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>You know that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals I hope to have in this House soon for legislation emerge from very long discussions, as I say, with representatives of employers and workers' organisations, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were given every opportunity to bring their strong influence to bear on the proposals.  The Congress have had a substantial influence in reshaping the proposals with which we started off three years ago.  Everybody knows that Congress some time ago, at very short notice and with a great deal of publicity, withdrew from the talks. I have never seen or heard any statement of their reason for so withdrawing. They certainly have not come out in the open and said that they withdrew because they regarded the proposals as repressive.  Has anybody, any spokesman for the trade unions or the Opposition, who is man enough, come out and said in what way they find them objectionable?  I announced publicly the main features of the proposals during the course of the referendum campaign in the hope that people would get down below the headlines and read what was proposed and not be influenced by this talk of repressive legislation.  No one has taken up the challenge which I issued at that time to show where indeed in the proposals there was any repressive measure.  I can only add, again, that they did not take up the challenge because there is no repressive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no truth whatever in the allegation that the legislation is repressive. It is a sensitive area.  Those who want to cause trouble seem to deal on the basis that people read only the headlines and deal only in slogans. After all the discussions I have had with the representatives of those concerned, I am convinced that we have to have changes.  The changes have to be gradual and have to be acceptable. However, if this campaign, which started in the political field, continues, <Col N="1115" /> nobody can bring about an improvement in an area where we all agree an improvement is badly wanted.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the way of compulsion or repression in what the Government have in mind.  We base the legislative proposals which are now being printed on the principle of continuing, indeed buttressing, the present system of free collective bargaining which is the corner-stone of industrial relations.  A number of proposals are designed to facilitate the better operation of the system.  There are also some proposals in the Trade Union Bill&mdash;the two Bills were introduced together&mdash;designed to strengthen the trade union movement, to put it in a better position to deal with moves to set up splinter groups or break-away unions and to discourage unofficial strikes.  I promise that these two Bills will be before the House in the very near future.  I can assure the House, in the meantime, that this is not antitrade union legislation.  In bringing it forward, I am certain I shall be criticised for what some people in the community will call being &ldquo;too soft&rdquo; with the unions.  I have spent three years studying this.  I do not want to do anything that will hinder the worker on his way towards improving his position.  Almost all the solutions which offer in this field have disadvantages in that line.  Therefore, we shall be concerned with putting up with the criticism of those who will say we are not doing enough or that we are being too soft.</P>
    <P>I suppose all the Parties have support from workers, but the basic support on which I depend is the workers'support.  I would not do anything that would not be favourable to the workers but, at times&mdash;Deputy Dunne mentioned something &mdash; it is necessary to protect the workers from the automatic activity of a free-wheeling mechanism and this we should not be afraid to do in this House.  Nobody need deny the need to improve ourselves in the field of industrial relations. It is a very sensitive area where suspicion is always present.  If any attempt to improve it is to be labelled <Col N="1116" /> and made the subject of emotive slogans, then the chances of improvement are small&mdash;and improvement in this area means improvement for the trade unions and, in the long run, protection for the workers.</P>
    <P>During this debate we have been looking on the gloomy side.  They have had a pretty gloomy time in most of the countries neighbouring us, if you regard the difficulties of controlling the economy as matters for gloom.  But we should also consider the advantages of this free system&mdash;the freedoms which we all cherish&mdash;freedom of association, freedom to negotiate and all the other freedoms which are not available everywhere in the world.  We should look to the improved educational system, which is still far from the ideal of giving everyone opportunity according to aptitude and skill; but we have improved our educational system and certainly we have improved our social system.  Opportunity is now much more widespread in education than even five or ten years ago and full opportunity, in so far as can be provided by a Government, is coming nearer and nearer.</P>
    <P>The Government's aim is to secure that there will be no boy or girl lacking opportunity through lack of funds or social position.  We should count our blessings in having a training authority, An Chomhairle Oifiúna, with the full co-operation of employers and trade unions forging ahead at such a speed, because we started far behind other industrialised countries.  We are now on the road to providing training and skills for our own people.  In spite of the fact that the number of new jobs being created is not as great as needed, we should not lose sight of the fact that we are creating a big number of new jobs.  According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, this year appears to be better than ever.  This is an area where, again, Government initiative has proved of great value.  The other areas where we find difficulty are those where the balance lies between freedom and Government action.  We already have had workers' legislation in this field&mdash;training legislation and redundancy legislation.  I do not think anyone will deny that, for the bulk of the population, the standard of living has improved at a rate far beyond what <Col N="1117" /> many of us expected.  The growth in the economy last year was four per cent: this year it looks like being five per cent.  It is a high rate of growth by any international standards.  I deny the idea&mdash;as one of the Fine Gael Deputies mentioned&mdash;of crisis.  We have a developing, expanding economy.  But the one central problem is how to handle our wages and salaries situation and to keep the freedom of bargaining, the freedom of negotiation.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to stay on this system of freedom and to offer guidelines, relating to the growth rate of the economy.  From that on, we are depending on those who are participating in the negotiations&mdash; those who are making the decisions through their industrial strength&mdash;so to negotiate and reach agreement that will not damage the lower paid worker, the unemployed or the people leaving school, or the disadvantaged.  I think it is well worth giving it a trial and I think this House could give a lead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour who has just spoken, strayed somewhat from the general discussion on the Budget Resolution.  I can understand why he did stray.  He is a Minister for whom I have a very high personal regard but I have been wondering what he has been doing over recent years: we hear nothing of him.  We know that he has a Department somewhere is the city and that, presumably sitting in an office in that Department, he is weaving plans, drawing blueprints for the great day when he will announce a policy of industrial relations, a policy on trade unions, a policy in relation to incomes, a policy in relation to the things which, unfortunately, up to this, have been causing difficulty and concern amongst ordinary people.  It is great to hear from him again.  It is great to learn from him that eventually the mountain, which has been in labour, is going to produce, whether it will be a mouse or something else we will have to wait to see.  Meanwhile I suggest to the Minister that he might use some of the sentiments which he expressed in this debate on his colleagues in the Government and ask them what is their <Col N="1118" /> concern in relation to the present situation.</P>
      <P>The ordinary people who have to carry on irrespective of what Government may be in office are becoming fed up to their back teeth with drastic changes in the value of money every month and every year.  Sometime ago the pound had a nominal value for a reasonable period, a period of three, four or perhaps five years, but now that is no longer so.  The pay packet of the ordinary worker is eaten into every six months by direct Government action.  The Minister for Labour was talking quite happily about the lowly paid workers but he might have referred also to those who have to live on and depend on social welfare assistance of one kind or another.  In effect he says they are no longer to be the concern of his Government; if somebody else does not look after them the Government certainly are not going to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this, and I will not be diverted from it, that we are discussing today a Budget, the second Budget in this year, which has imposed in a full year some £19½ millions in fresh taxation.  It may be of interest to the Minister, although he probably knows it, and it may be of interest to the Fianna Fáil Party and to Deputy Dowling who is in the House and who in certain circumstances talks a great deal about the trade union movement, to know that this Autumn supplementary Budget, once referred to as a mini-Budget, has imposed the highest amount of taxation ever imposed <Col N="1119" /> by any Budget in the history of the State.  This mini-Budget, this supplementary Budget, has imposed £19½ millions which is a record taxation increase.  The previous highest taxation was imposed by the Budget which introduced the famous turnover tax.  This £19½ million has been imposed by this Budget which apparently was introduced as an afterthought, in the after-wash of the referendum.  We know from Ministerial speakers at dinners and banquets and so on that money does not grow like apples on the trees.  We know because Ministers have told us so often that their dark locks are going grey worrying about where money is going to come from for different things.  We know, of course, that ultimately the money has to come from the ordinary people.  £19½ million as an afterthought, as a by-the-way just before the financial year ends, is being taken from the people and it is being from the people who will pay it as they buy the things which they are told are luxuries.  They will pay it on the pint, on tobacco and on the ordinary things people wish to buy, through the wholesale tax and so on.</P>
      <P>There is no regard in this enormous increase in taxation for the lowly paid worker.  Let him just suffer on.  There is nothing in it for the old age pensioners, they will pay just the same as the best, well-off member of Taca. This is the Government we now have, the Government that I am going to suggest do not know what social justice means.  This burden of new taxation, this £19½ million, is imposed on the backs of the ordinary people, on the backs of the largest number of people where the base is wider.  We are expected to accept this.  I do not know the basis for this Budget. This debate ends this evening as it began, with utter confusion amongst ordinary people as to why this Budget was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those on this side of the House who are sufficiently uncharitable&mdash;I do not know whether I am one of them or not-to suggest that this Budget became necessary because the spring Budget, the ordinary Budget, was a dressed-up facade of a <Col N="1120" /> Budget designed to make straight the way of the referendum.  That may be so and it may not be so.  If it is not so, then it seems to indicate that in the spring of this year the Government of which the Minister for Labour is a member presented a Budget orientated for a 12 months period, designed to shape the financial policy of this State for 12 months, and they did not know what was necessary.  It is not surprising that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;I am sorry he is not here now because he spent the whole of his turgid speech on the Budget talking at me&mdash;apparently did not know in the spring of this year that all the arable land of Ireland was being broken up to sow wheat.  He did not know that.  Of course, it is not surprising that he did not know it because he had not got a farmer friend in the country.  No farmer would talk to him.  If he had a farmer friend who knew anything about agriculture he would have told the Minister that we were in for a record year as far as wheat was concerned.</P>
    <P>But that was not known and so one puts that down to what might have been.  One &ldquo;might have been&rdquo; that might have been, had there been a Minister for Agriculture in the spring of this year <i>en rapport</i> with matters agricultural, would have been that the Government would have had sufficient advice to make proper arrangements in regard to wheat subsidy requirements and in regard to milk.  Apparently our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries did not know what every farmer in the country knew, what even the Minister for Finance knew because he referred to it in his Budget Statement; every farmer in the country and the Minister for Finance knew there would be a dramatic increase in milk this year.  But the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries did not know that and, accordingly, the Government did not know the score.  In regard to these two headings there was under-budgeting to the extent of close on £6 million.  That is, perhaps, understandable.  Any Government which has to suffer the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, because no one has the guts to boot him out, will go from crisis to crisis and from difficulty to difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> What about the £9 million for civil servants?  Did the Government not know about that?  It is hard to believe that in the spring of this year no one told the Government that wage and salary increases were, in fact, already taking place.  Apparently, no one did and we have in office now a Government so far removed from what is taking place in the country they are supposed to govern that they did not know that in this financial year the salaries and wages of public servants would increase to the extent of £9 million. Everybody else knew it, but the Government did not know it.  I find it very hard to imagine these 13 or 14 gentlemen, entrusted with the Government of this country, displaying such sheer incompetence that they proceed to budget in regard to our economy not knowing what is happening in agriculture and not knowing what is happening in the State service, the service they themselves are supposed to be running.</P>
    <P>I doubt if that is the truth of the situation.  While the choice may be between incompetence and dishonesty, one is driven towards the conclusion that the spring Budget this year was a deliberate makeshift Budget, a makebelieve Budget, designed to cod people into thinking that budgetary requirements did not necessitate any significant increase in taxation and that everything could carry on with the Minister for Finance in the role of Fairy Godmother.  Whatever the real motive was, we have had a result which is most unfortunate for the country. This Budget, coming at the time it does, is bound to have a deflationary effect.  It is bound to depress the economy.  It is bound to lead to another spiral in wage demands and no amount of Ministerial tut-tutting will prevent that happening.  This Budget is bound to increase the cost of living by at least 4½ per cent.  It is bound to increase the anxieties and the difficulties of those with slender means, pensioners, social welfare recipients, people at the very lowest point in the income grouping. All these will suffer.  This Budget is bound to arouse a sense of social justice on all sides of this House.  It is bound to increase the demands that will fall to be made on the Exchequer in the next few months.  These demands <Col N="1122" /> will depress the economy still further. This Budget will shove up costs of production.  It will make our export trade much more difficult and much less competitive.</P>
    <P>This comes at the end of the period in which we have put behind us two miserable years of deflation.  The year 1966 and the first part of 1967 were periods in which the workers and the less well-off sections of our community were forced to pay bills entered into by an incompetent Fianna Fáil Government in the inflationary years of 1964 and 1965.  The inflation of those years had to be paid for in 1966 and 1967.  It was paid for by the people. It is they who always have to pay. It was paid for by those who were thrown out of jobs.  It was paid for by increased unemployment and increased emigration.  It was paid for by increased taxation.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that this year and in the latter half of last year&mdash;the Minister referred to this&mdash;the economy was beginning to recover.  The Minister said the economy is fundamentally sound. It is, thanks be to God.  It has withstood the assaults of successive Fianna Fáil Governments and, after a little medication, it has come up smiling again.  I am sure it will come up smiling again even after this Budget but, in the latter part of 1967 and this year, the economy was beginning to advance. We were beginning to get the kind of significant growth so absolutely essential for a small country such as ours, if we are to survive.  It is in these circumstances that we have now a fresh dose of deflation introduced deliberately by this Government as part of their policy, some £19½ million of additional taxation imposed on the economy at a time when the economy was beginning to surge forward once more I do not know what the outcome will be.  Not only have the people to face these additional taxes but the taxes themselves are being followed up by an increase in bus fares, by an increase in the price of bread, and, apparently, by a complete collapse in the control of the Government over the stresses facing the country.  At the same time, the Government are out of control over what is happening in the country at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The Second Programme for Economic Expansion was buried some six months ago.  Nothing was put in its place.  The evidence of that lack of plan and policy is now clear to the people. It is bread one day and bus fares another.  It is a Budget one month and another Budget the next month.  One does not know now from week to week what crisis is likely to face the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour talks about collective bargaining.  Is it not clear that one of the difficulties that has faced the country over the past two or 2½ years has been the complete lack of any policy by the Government in relation to incomes and prices?  For the past 2½ years we have had a succession of wage rounds which seemed sometimes to come of their own momentum, and sometimes to be triggered off by direct Government action. We have had wage round after wage round.  Now we have a situation in which the 10th round is chasing the 11th round and in which we will have a merging of wage rounds.  At the same time, you have one causing the other, and one does not know which is the <i>causa causans</i>.  But at the end prices go up.</P>
    <P>May I remind the Minister that two years ago in this House we had a debate on a prices and incomes policy. The difficulties were recognised by every Deputy.  The aim behind such a policy was also recognised and appreciated by every Deputy.  The motion in relation to prices and incomes which was moved from the Fine Gael benches was passed unanimously by the House. It was accepted by the Government. That did not mean that to achieve an incomes policy would be easy.  No one expected that it would.  Now 2½ years have gone by with nothing whatsoever done in furtherance of what was the unanimous view of the House.  That is a significant dereliction of duty on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about difficulties. Of course there are difficulties, but I should like to know what the Minister for Labour and his colleagues have been doing about getting a policy of that kind off the ground.  I have no doubt that in a country as small as we <Col N="1124" /> are, a country that has the difficulties we have&mdash;we must export to survive&mdash; if we do not get some reality, some constancy, some normalcy in our earnings, we will have a recurrence of the type of difficulties we are now experiencing.</P>
    <P>Prices must be related to production, as incomes must be.  There has to be a general understanding between the business people, the entrepreneurs, those who hazard capital and management generally, and labour, and the Government have a responsibility. They cannot sit on the sidelines and say: &ldquo;It is up to the pair of you.  Tell us what the result is and we will see it is enforced.&rdquo;  That will not do.  As long as that continues, as the Minister himself has recognised, the lowly paid workers will continue to suffer and the social welfare recipients will continue to find that whatever measure of social welfare help they get is eroded and destroyed by rising prices.  The entire economy will continue to suffer from new incursions on the value of money spiralled off by increases in the cost of living and prices generally.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility and they cannot shrug it off by saying it is a difficult and a dangerous task.  Of course it is.  These are dangerous days, and if we have not got a Government willing to live dangerously and act, the country will not survive.  We in Fine Gael believe in an incomes and prices policy.  We stated that in the general election of 1965.  We announced it before they endeavoured to introduce it in England.  We still believe in it.  We think it is the only salvation for a country such as ours, and we expect some action by the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to say a word about the situation now confronting this country.  It is unfortunate that we have had this Budget.  The way in which it was introduced and the taxation it imposes were bad enough, but it is particularly unfortunate that this Budget should have preceded the developments in recent days in Europe and in Britain, particularly in so far as they effect us.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Free Trade Agreement between this <Col N="1125" /> country and Britain.  I do not want to debate the terms of that agreement but I should like to remind the House, through you, Sir, that when the Free Trade agreement was debated here a little over two years ago, we on these benches had considerable reservations about the benefits claimed for that agreement.  In the first place we deprecated the fact that the agreement which was concluded by our Government appeared to condone and accept the import levies which the British Labour Government had imposed on our exports some short while before.  What has happened in the past few days indicates the validity of the reservations which we expressed then.</P>
    <P>In my view the 50 per cent deposit now required by the British Government in relation to exports from us is in clear and open defiance of the provisions of the Free Trade Agreement. That agreement does permit either country, in the event of a balance of payments difficulty, to impose quantitative restrictions on imports from the other partner.  What the British are now doing in effect is taxing or imposing a form of levy on exports from this country.  It is not within the terms of the agreement.  It is in open defiance of the agreement. They are doing it unilaterally and doing it because they apparently feel they can get away with it.</P>
    <P>When one remembers that this agreement which was supposed to give such tremendous help to the agricultural industry&mdash;I will not go into the claims made for it two-and-a-half years ago&mdash; and the great expectations that were entertained in relation to that agreement when debated and when one looks at the score since, one begins to realise that there were some defects in the negotiations for the agreement itself.</P>
    <P>In an exchange of letters between the then Minister for Agriculture and the British Minister of Agriculture Deputies will recollect that the British, at the time of this agreement, said that they were going to take all our creamery produce and all our creamery exports in the sense that the target set out in the Second Programme would be absorbed by them.  What has happened since?  They have cut down on butter. <Col N="1126" /> Last year they grudgingly allowed imports of some minor amount in excess of 1,000 tons of butter.  They are now threatening our chief exports.  Indeed, three or four days after the announcement of their plan to make Britain selfsupporting in agriculture the British Minister of Agriculture&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash;when speaking to British farmers said that the Free Trade Area Agreement caused some difficulties in relation to the British Government's new plan but when it came up for revision the British Government would remove these difficulties.  He said &ldquo;when it came up for revision&rdquo;.  This agreement is supposed to be irrevocable and it is supposed to be a permanent statement of our trading relations with the British but a member of the British Government describes it as something temporary and says they will remove the difficulties in it when it comes up for revision.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might convey the view to his colleagues in the Government that we should tell them first it is coming up for revision here and now.  They have broken it in the last two or three days and their breach is merely a repetition of the way in which it has been disregarded when it suits British purposes in the last two years.  We made these reservations clear indeed. This agreement was debated and I certainly feel so far as this country is concerned that we have not got from this agreement the kind of benefit we were led to expect.  There will have to be new thinking on our trading relations with Britain.  In saying that I have no doubt that what will be done in that regard by the Government will be adequate and necessary.  In relation to any representations that will have to be made and any point of view that will have to be expressed, I have no doubt that the Taoiseach or whoever may meet the British Ministers will represent fully the point of view of most people in this country.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude there are one or two other things I want to say.  I am sorry Deputy Andrews is not here.  I saw him here earlier.  I was interested to watch him on television last night serving a certain notice on the Fianna Fáil Government.  One could call it a <Col N="1127" /> challenge.  I wonder will it be taken up?  We have had a surfeit in this country of Government by dictatorship. A very good example of what I have in mind is now coming to take his seat in the House, the Minister for Local Government.  People of this country have reacted violently against ministerial dictators who have paraded themselves around the country saying: &ldquo;You take it from me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the referendum the fact is that the people did not take it.  We heard last night that at least one Fianna Fáil Deputy is going to react in a very positive way against this handing down of decision by the Fianna Fáil Government. I wonder will there be others who will do it?  This Budget is a good example.  Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party has an opportunity now to react against the weight of this taxation and to react against the Government that suddenly decides that this kind of thing has got to be done. Deputy Andrews is going to vote against the Criminal Justice Bill.  I am not going to discuss the Bill.  I am merely discussing what is involved in a decision of that kind.  How many others of the Fianna Fáil Party are willing to take that kind of independent attitude?  I have little doubt that there is reaction inside Fianna Fáil against much of what has been going on, against the failure to consult people generally, against the situation in which ministerial decisions are handed down and against the way in which the Party is run by the few.  I am told that there is a marked line now in Fianna Fáil, a cleavage between the more nationalistic minded members of the Party and the newer type of Deputy.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Fine Gael introduced this Bill which proposes that Dáil constituencies shall be arranged by an independent Commission presided over by a High Court or Supreme Court judge subject to the control of the Oireachtas rather than directly by Dáil Éireann as at the present time because we believe that such a procedure would be desirable at any time and because we are convinced that it would be fundamentally undemocratic and against natural justice to entrust to the present Minister for Local Government and the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil the task of arranging constituencies at this time.  I say that because for the past nine months we have had in this House and, indeed, in the country a very controversial and acrimonious debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not going to labour it, I assure you, Sir&mdash;on this very question of electoral reform and constituency boundaries. The Minister for Local Government argued that the system of election which he sought to change was unworkable and threatened the wholesale butchering of constituencies and county boundaries if his proposals were not accepted.  The Minister's proposals were rejected by the people and we on this side of the House have good reason to believe that if he is allowed to do so the Minister will try to undo the decision of the people by trying to reduce to an absurdity the present fair system of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> That is the background against which we have introduced this Constituency Commission Bill, 1968. Briefly, the Bill proposes that a Constituency Commission shall be established from time to time but not less frequently than once every ten years. It further proposes that that Commission shall be composed of three Members of the Government side of the House nominated by the Taoiseach and three Members of the Opposition side of the House elected from among the Opposition as defined by law and that the Chairman of that Commission shall be a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court appointed by the Dáil on the nomination of the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to say that any member of the Commission may resign from office by placing his resignation in the hands of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann in which event he shall be replaced by the same method as that employed for his appointment; that the quorum of the Commission shall be four; that the Commission may act notwithstanding vacancies in their membership.</P>
    <P>The Bill then provides that as soon as may be after the establishment of the Commission, the Commission shall proceed to determine the constituencies.</P>
    <P>It is also provided that within three months of their establishment, the Commission shall present to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann a report setting out the constituencies as determined by the Commission either with the unanimous agreement of their members or by a majority with stated reasons for their decisions.  It provides that if, because of failure to secure unanimous agreement or agreement by a majority, no report is so presented, the Chairman of the Commission shall, not later than four months after the date of the establishment of the Commission, present to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann a report setting out the constituencies as determined by the Chairman of the Commission with stated reasons for his decisions, and that report shall be taken as the report of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Commission's report shall be signed by the Chairman or other member so directed <Col N="1130" /> by the Commission, and no minority report shall be presented.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that immediately after the Commission's report has been presented, the Commission shall stand dissolved.</P>
    <P>It is further provided in the Bill that, as soon as may be after the receipt by him of the Commission's report, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann shall cause the report to be laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is provided that if, within the next 14 days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the report is laid before it, a resolution amending the report is passed by a two-thirds majority of Dáil Éireann, the report shall be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is provided that, immediately after the last of the next 14 days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the Commission's report is laid before it, the constituencies set out in the report, or where the report has been amended by Dáil Éireann, in the report as so amended, shall become and be the constituencies, provided that any alteration in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann then sitting.</P>
    <P>It is then stated that, subject to the provisions of this Act, any matter whatsoever relating to Constituency Commissions or constituencies may be provided for by law.</P>
    <P>These, in effect, are the provisions of the Bill which I am bringing before the House and which I, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, am asking this House to have printed and brought before the House for a Second Reading. I put it to the House as a fair and reasonable Bill.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister for Local Government opposes it.  The Commission which I proposes in this Bill is substantially the same as the Commission contained in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which took up so much of the time of the House and of the country this year and, no doubt, when he is making his statement the Minister will refer to that fact and tell us that this Bill, in substantially the same form, has been rejected by the people.  For that reason, I crave <Col N="1131" /> your indulgence to say a word or two on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Commission in the Bill which I am introducing now differs to some extent from the Commission provided for in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  It differs slightly in one respect, in that it provides that the Chairman of the Commission must give the reasons for their report.  It differs rather vitally by providing that the report can only be altered by a two-thirds majority of this House.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I know the Minister for Local Government will say that I opposed such legislation when the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was going through the House and that I opposed the Commission proposal when the referndum campaign was being conducted in the country.  That is not so.  I tried to improve the type of commission provided for in the Constitution Bill by providing that the report could be altered only by a two-thirds majority of the House and by proposing that the Commission should also be written by the Minister into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, but the Minister resisted both efforts.</P>
    <P>However, if the Minister says, as I anticipate he will because he has done so since 16th October, that this Commission proposal has been rejected by the people, I want to go on record as saying that this is just not so.  This Commission provision, <i>per se</i>, if it were to put to the people was put to them only as part of a package deal, as part of a proposal to abolish proportional representation and the sugar on the pill was the offer of this very fair Commission.  The people have not had any opportunity of either accepting or rejecting the Commission provision <i>simpliciter</i>.  It was offered to them, as I have said, as part of a package deal, the other part of that deal being extremely dangerous and objectionable and quite rightly rejected by the people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to trespass unduly on the time of the House or on Standing Order No.89 which covers my remarks here.  The object of this Bill, and, indeed, the object of the Commission's <Col N="1132" /> provision contained in the Bill and in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is and was to prevent gerrymandering or an unfair arrangement of constituencies.  We say that the course proposed here will make it impossible, or virtually impossible, to gerrymander the constituencies in an unfair manner because they will be arranged by an independent commission presided over by a High Court or a Supreme Court judge.</P>
    <P>I am not the only one who has thought from time to time that there is a danger of gerrymander and that there is a necessity to prevent it.  Not only the Fine Gael Party have anticipated gerrymander or unfair arrangement of the constituencies and the necessity to guarantee against it.  The Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Taoiseach, in a document known as &ldquo;The Referendum, the Reasons Why&rdquo;, published a short time before the referendum on the 16th October, thought fit to draw the attention of the country, of the electorate, to the possibility and the danger of gerrymandering constituencies. He saw fit to recommend the measure which I introduced in this House tonight as a measure which he thought less calculated to prevent gerrymandering and to ensure a fair arrangement of the constituencies.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the records of the House in support of the measure I now introduce and as an argument in its favour, a brief statement under the photograph of the Taoiseach and beneath his signature.  In this document entitled &ldquo;The Referendum, the Reasons Why&rdquo;, the Taoiseach stated on the second page, which is not numbered:</P>
    <P>What is proposed is that new constituencies will be drawn up by an independent commission presided over by a judge so that gerrymandering will be impossible.</P>
    <P>They are not my words.  It is not my word or my advice, but the advice of the leader of the Minister for Local Government, as far as I can ascertain. It is the advice of the Taoiseach of this country, the advice of the Leader of this House.  I suggest to this House and to the country that if that warning were pertinent then, if that warning <Col N="1133" /> were necessary before 16th October, if the Taoiseach thought it necessary to tell the people that gerrymandering was then possible, to warn them against it and to provide machinery for preventing it, how much more necessary is it now?  If that Commission provision were necessary in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, how much more necessary is it now? How much more is it necessary having regard to the mood of the Minister for Local Government, the man who will put through the House the Bill which will arrange the constituencies?</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House very long but I propose to deal with this at greater length tommorrow.  I had occasion here to listen to the Minister for Local Government speaking on the vote of no confidence some days after the House re-assembled after the referendum.  He came into this House in a vicious, dangerous, vindictive mood and I propose to quote his references tomorrow.  I am merely quoting him roughly now, but he said words to the effect that &ldquo;I am sorry I could not attend this debate but I was upstairs dealing with such important matters as the number of persons in jail, the number of people who slept on ships on a certain date in 1966, the number of babies born in hospitals in Dublin city on a certain date in 1966.&rdquo;  He came into this House pouring out ridicule on the serious tasks on which he should then have been occupied, as a paid servant of the State &mdash; that of the fair and equitable arrangement of constituencies.</P>
    <P>I am not making any attack on the Minister for Local Government either in his personal or political capacity, but it would be asking too much of human nature to ask the Minister for Local Government after his performance in this House and his campaign in the House and in the country during the last nine months, to get down to this matter of the arrangement of constituencies in a calm, collected, fair and unprejudiced manner.  It would be presupposing that the Minister for Local Government was not Deputy Kevin Boland but the Archangel Michael.  We have no archangels <Col N="1134" /> flying about in 1968.  I am appealing to the Minister for Local Government to accept this measure and to authorise the printing of this Bill, to amend it in committee if he wants to amend it but to accept it here as a genuine attempt to save the country from the Minister, to save the Minister from himself and to save the Fianna Fáil Party from themselves and the Minister.</P>

I do not believe that any human being, who was so actively involved in an electoral reform campaign which was so energetically fought by the Opposition and which was so ignominiously rejected by the people, could come in here and in a fair, unbaised and unprejudiced manner do what he is supposed to do, give us a fair constituency commission.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I do not want to embarrass the Chair and I thank him for giving me the opportunity to speak.  The action of the Minister for Local Government is typical of a man who not alone wants to stamp on the whole country but to walk on this House as well as on the Chair.</P>
      <P>I believe the Bill introduced by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, which according to the Minister for Local Government would have been proposed if his previous proposal had been carried by the country, is the proper way to draw up the constituencies for the country.  We believe also that if we do not do that we will have what both he and the Taoiseach described as the danger of gerrymandering. We want the danger of gerrymandering eliminated and, unless we have the Bill which Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> now proposes carried by this House and accepted by the Government, as soon as the Fianna Fáil Government are put out of office the constituencies must be redrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the introduction of this Bill for two reasons.  First, the people have rejected the constitutional proposal which embodied a provision for a similar commission and it would be wrong in principle to provide now for the establishment of such a commission by law.  Secondly, Article 16, 2.1º of the Constitution provides that:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies determined by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that this means that constituencies must be determined in a Bill passed in the normal way by the <Col N="1137" /> Oireachtas and that the function of determining constituencies cannot under the present Constitution be handed over to a commission.  Accordingly, it is the Government's responsibility to introduce a Bill providing for a revision of constituencies and this has been done in a way which I believe gives reasonable satisfaction in view of the fact that four seats had to be taken away from the rural parts of the country and given to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I must also point out the inconsistency displayed by the Fine Gael Party in their attitude to a similar proposal in 1959 to provide a constituency commission whose report can be amended only by a two-thirds majority of the Dáil.  On that occassion they not only rejected the proposal but insisted that the Oireachtas should continue to revise constituencies, and earlier this year they rejected a proposal for a commission whose report could be amended by a simple majority.  Their attitude in this respect, on the one hand, and their present proposal, on the other, represents a complete reversal of their previous position.  Contrary to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has alleged no amendment was put down to the proposal for a commission this year in the debate on the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The Fine Gael Party did not propose any amendment on the proposal for the commission.  They rejected the proposal out of hand, just as they did in 1959 when an official amendment was put down by the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill, 1968&mdash;First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960&mdash;(Patrick J Lindsay.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple Bill.  It has no political implications of any kind.  It was sought to be brought in by me for the purposes of assisting some people who own what Bord Fáilte are pleased to call guesthouses instead of hotels.</P>
      <P>The situation is that there are, according to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power, 17 of these houses affected by section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, which says that any licences granted pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 2 of the Licensing Act, 1902, shall not be renewed unless the hotels are registered in the Registrar of Hotels kept by Bord Fáilte.  When these houses got their licences to sell intoxicating liquor they qualified under the section of the 1902 Act as hotels.  Their statutory definition is that of hotel. That definition is carried forward into sections 19 and 21 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  What Bord Fáilte purports to do and is, in fact, doing at the moment, is to set itself up as the licensing authority, which function, as every Deputy knows, is vested in the courts of this country, either in the district court, the circuit court or, on appeal to the High Court or by case stated to the Supreme Court&mdash;the courts are the only licensing authority &mdash;by refusing to register one of these houses which, in the country, are defined as houses with ten bedrooms seperately set aside for the reception of guests, or in Dublin city, as houses with 20 bedrooms.  They are defined as hotels.  Bord Fáilte refuses to register them as hotels because in their view they do not match up to what Bord Fáilte have decided a hotel is.</P>
      <P>I sought to bring in this Bill in order to protect these family-run institutions, small hotels, some with ten bedrooms minimum, some with more, all comfortable. Some of them are old country houses.  I know them and the Minister knows them in my constituency&mdash; houses like Aldridges, Glencairn, the old coastguard station, in between times the convent and now, one of these houses in Ballycastle in North Mayo, at least until such time as that constituency is axed.  This is the interest I have.  I do not believe that under section 25 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, there is any power vested in Bord Fáilte to define a hotel.</P>
      <P>However, they refused to accept these as hotels.  Many of them are far more comfortable and provide far more hospitality with excellent food and wine than do some Bord Fáilte Grade A hotels and they do so cheaply. My purpose in seeking to have this introduced was to enable and compel Bord Fáilte to register these as hotels. All these cases at the moment stand adjourned in the various district courts. In one county a case stated is being prepared for the Supreme Court but in the teeth of this arrangement opposition to this simple Bill, I shall not give this Fianna Fáil dominated Executive the opportunity of defeating it on a vote when, in a matter of a few days these people will be seeking justice in the only bastion of justice left&mdash;the courts of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House already knows, I am opposing this measure.  It may help to get matters in their proper perspective if I first say a few words about the general background to the problem.  I will quote for the House section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960:</P>
      <P>An application for a certificate for the renewal of a licence in respect of which effect was given to subsection (1) of section 42 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, or which was granted after the passing of this Act by virtue of paragraph (2) of section 2 of the Act of 1902 shall not be granted unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court hearing the application for the grant of the certificate that the hotel is registered in the register of hotels kept by Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
      <P>That is a section of an Act which was brought into this House as the result of a recommendation by an impartial licensing commission that the law should be so changed.  This House, in its wisdom or otherwise, changed the law by section 20 to provide that new licences for hotels would not be granted, or, rather, renewed, unless the hotels were registered by Bord Fáilte. Therefore, instead of questioning the actions of Bord Fáilte, we must get down to an examination of the measure enacted in this House by all Parties and, in particular, this particular section which was not opposed by Deputy Lindsay's Party, by the Labour Party or by any other Party, in this House.  As it was not opposed by any Party we must accept that this particular section, which was the result of the recommendation of an impartial commission on this subject, was acceptable to Dáil Éireann, and Dáil Éireann so provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, imposed a general prohibition on the issue of new liquor licences, but it made an exception for &ldquo;hotels&rdquo;, defined as premises with at least ten bedrooms for &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; and having <Col N="1144" /> no public bar.  The figure of ten bedrooms has since been altered to 20 in county boroughs.  The commission to which I have referred recommended that in future, the exception in favour of hotels should, for new applicants, be confined to premises on the register of hotels maintained by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>This recommendation was adopted and enshrined in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  In order to facilitate applicants whose premises might not be quite ready for registration as a hotel by Bord Fáilte before the &ldquo;Long Vacation&rdquo; in the courts, the Act allowed applicants to go to the court first and to Bord Fáilte afterwards, that is to say, to get the licence before becoming registered with the Board but not to have the licence renewed unless, by that time, they were on the register. It was assumed that only applicants who expected their premises to be accepted for registration as hotels would apply for the grant of a licence in the first instance.  This was the thinking at the time that section was passed.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself, I would prefer, and I think it would be better, to have the other way.  I do not think that these people, who had no licences previously, would have lost much by having to wait for the end of the &ldquo;Long Vacation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While more than 120 registered guesthouses have liquor licences at the present time, we are not concerned tonight with the great majority of these, most of which are fully entitled to be licensed and fully entitled to have the licences renewed.  Some of the licences that comprise this majority were obtained prior to the 1960 Act; others were publichouses that expanded; and others again got licences in the orthodox way through the purchase of one or two existing licences elsewhere, as the circumstances required.  We are concerned now with a small minority of guesthouses, some 20, or 17 I think Deputy Lindsay says.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>From my inquiries, and in so far as I can ascertain, I would say 20 at the outside.  I will accept 17 <Col N="1145" /> as quite possibly being the correct figure.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned with now is this small minority of guesthouses&mdash; perhaps 17 to 20 of the existing 500 registered premises.  These 20 or so premises have, since 1960, obtained hotel licences under the 1902 Act and they subsequently got these licences renewed even though the law did not allow them to be renewed.  The argument that is now being put forward is that there is hardship involved on those concerned if the licences are not renewed in future, as, in the ordinary course, they cannot be renewed, now that the matter has come to the Courts' notice.</P>
      <P>I certainly have sympathy with the 17 or 20 people who find themselves out on this legal limb.  I had a deputation from them and they all seemed, strange to say, to be adamant on one thing, and it was this: in relation to section 20, which is as clear as any legal section can be, and which provides that the premises have to be registered with Bord Fáilte before the licence can be renewed, they told me they were not informed of the position by their legal advisers and that they were unaware of the risk they were taking until they found themselves faced with these refusals.  I am just pointing out to the House what I was told and, if that was the position, I have double sympathy for them.</P>

    <P>Of course, there were many of the guesthouse owners who could likewise have applied for licences but were deterred by section 20 and even that is by no means the whole story.  There were guesthouses the owners of which have, since 1960, gone to the considerable expense of purchasing one or two existing public house licences&mdash;one licence in respect of an application in an urban area and two licences in a non-urban area&mdash;in order to qualify for a licence for the guesthouse, and they undertook this expense because they realised&mdash;I must assume they realised &mdash;that under the 1960 Act they could not get a hotel licence or, rather, that they would be prevented from obtaining a renewal under section 20 of that Act. We must also keep in mind the position of these owners who in recent years <Col N="1146" /> have incurred considerable expense to bring their premises up to the standard necessary to secure registration as hotels by Bord Fáilte.  There are many people who have done this, as Deputies know.  There are many people who have so improved their premises that they have progressed from guesthouses to hotels.  There are many examples of this type of people in my own part of the country and, indeed, generally throughout the rest of Ireland.  They could all say, or at least some of them could say, that they incurred the expense primarily to ensure that they would get renewal of hotel licences acquired by them since section 20 of the Act became law in 1960.</P>
    <P>All these people would now have a very real and a very legitimate grievance, and could, indeed, claim that they were being discriminated against, if any special provision were made for the 17 or 20 people who got their licences under the 1960 Act and who have had them renewed ever since although they were not entitled to renewals on the wording of section 20.</P>
    <P>Guesthouses owners are in a competitive business and the law must endeavour to ensure that there is no discrimination between them.  We cannot say that these 17 or 20 premises should be allowed to get their licences, while ignoring all the other guesthouses with similar accommodation.  We must also consider what the consequences would be if they were all to be licensed.  As matters stand, there are nearly 500 registered guesthouses and the number is increasing yearly. Granting that the majority of them have fewer than 10 bedrooms, the value of a liquor licence, with its right to sell drink to the public at large, is such that there can be no doubt at all, especially with the present position of grants being made available from Bord Fáilte, that many of these guesthouses with less than 10 bedrooms would immediately seek to come up to that standard so that in a couple of years we would be adding several hundred licensed premises to the existing stock.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I want to stress that all of them would be fully entitled to serve drink to non-residents and, in addition, by the process of buying a licence in <Col N="1147" /> any part of the State, would automatically acquire the rights to set up an ordinary public bar, as distinct from a dispense bar, to which they would otherwise be confined.</P>
    <P>The objection is not just that this would mean the addition of several hundred licensed premises but that this would happen without any adequate justification.  It is accepted that there are guesthouses that could advance a good case for a licence, but there are others that could not.  The point is that, where you have guesthouses that could make a case, the case they could make has nothing to do with the fact that they are registered guesthouses.  On the contrary, their case would be based on the services they provide over and above what is required of them as guesthouses.</P>
    <P>The provision of 10 bedrooms for guests is not of itself a good reason for giving a licence which the law withholds from others.  The great majority of guesthouses have no public dining room in which meals can be obtained by passers-by.  Less than 20 per cent of them provide a meals service to the public, as distinct from their own residents.  I am not decrying their value &mdash;far from it, for they are an essential part of our tourist structure&mdash;but, taking them individually, nobody could seriously attempt to justify a provision in which a licence to sell drinks to the public would be given, as a special privilege and by way of exception from the ordinary law, to an applicant who is not even providing a meals service to the public&mdash;and this is what it would entail to license these 17 or so guesthouses by virtue of the fact that they are guesthouses.</P>
    <P>There are a number of obligations on hotels, which I shall not weary the House with, in relation to the provision of certain services to the general public. A traveller is entitled to be provided with food and drink.  The provisions of the Innkeepers Act apply to them in regard to things lost, and so on.  The Hotel Proprietors Act, 1963, provided that these statutory duties should apply automatically to the proprietor of every establishment registered as a hotel by Bord Fáilte, but, before that, all <Col N="1148" /> registered hotels were in practice subject to the common law obligations of innkeepers.  It will, accordingly, be seen that registration as a hotel is a guarantee not only that the hotel provides certain minimum standards for members of the public but also that it has these legal obligations to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>These obligations provided law in relation to hotels would not apply to the guesthouse at all.  Indeed, it could well be argued that the ordinary restaurant that is providing a service for the public by way of meals, and so on, would be more entitled to consideration for a liquor licence than those guesthouses that are concerned solely with catering for their own individual guests and accept no obligation of any kind to the public.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become involved in arguments as to the logic of the particular details of the procedure laid down in the 1960 Act.  Suffice it to say that, as I have said already, possibly with hindsight, I feel that it was unwise to draft the section in this particular way.  I think that if the House in considering the matter had provided that they would have to go to Bord Fáilte first and the court afterwards, it would have avoided the main complaint that these people have made to me, that their advisers did not bring it to their notice that the section was there and that they were gambling on being registered by Bord Fáilte the year after getting a licence from the court under the 1902 Act.</P>
    <P>On the question of withholding registration, the position, of course, is that Bord Fáilte is not concerned whether the premises should be entitled to a liquor licence or not; that is an incidental consequence which follows, not because Bord Fáilte says so, but because the Dáil here said so in section 20 of the Act.</P>
    <P>I have seen in my Department that there were strong representations made, even before the time of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission, by the people in the licensing business.  They consistently objected to what they regarded as the excessive liberality with which licences were issued to premises purporting to be hotels.  Indeed, even <Col N="1149" /> since the licence restriction which we are talking about here was introduced in the 1960 Act, publicans have repeatedly suggested that the law is still too liberal in this respect.  While I do not want to be taken as meaning that I accept the objections of these people, I think I should mention them here in this House as they underline the fact that the immediate problem with which we are concerned here is a complex one in which all kinds of conflicting interests are involved and in which solutions that may seem neat and simple turn out, on examination, to be neither neat nor simple</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that the present situation, basically, is that, since 1902, there has been a general prohibition on the issue of new licences.  Any exception to the general rule must be based on some logical and coherent system, as otherwise we would have inequality and injustice.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude let me say, in relation to what Deputy Lindsay has said&mdash; he stated or implied the same thing the last time we had in this House&mdash; that is, that legally these people can get their licences anyhow.  He has referred to the fact that a case stated is pending.  I am not going to speculate whether it will be successful or not. Deputy Lindsay seems to think that, apart from the present case stated, a decision of the Supreme Court is already on the record under which those people can get their licences.  If this is so, all I can say is more luck to them.  If the law is to be interpreted in such a way that those people can get renewal of those licences&mdash;licences that they should never have got in the first instance under this section unless they contemplated they would have a hotel of the type acceptable to Bord Fáilte for entry on the Bord Fáilte register&mdash;I say more luck to them.</P>
    <P>Let the House be quite clear on this. It would be absolutely impractical&mdash;it simply could not be done&mdash;to change the law as we have it so as to enable every place which calls itself a guesthouse through the length and breadth of this land to obtain an intoxicating liquor licence.  If the whole matter is being re-examined, as no doubt it will have to be in this House at some time, <Col N="1150" /> because licensing laws come up for review from time to time, then there will be questions for the House to decide.  But, in the meantime, I reiterate that back in 1960 section 20 was put on the Statute Book by Dáil Éireann. It was accepted by the Opposition generally in this House.  It was a recommendation of the Licensing Commission. The House, at that time, must have satisfied themselves it was a desirable reform in the law.  Certainly, in the reading of it, it is quite clear; and nobody, certainly no lawyer, could be under any misapprehension that the 1902 Licensing Act was intended to be read subject to this section 20 of the later Act.  The clear intention was that applicants who had not licences before 1960 could not have their licences renewed unless their premises were registered as hotels with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>If those people were ill-advised I realise that it is unfortunate for them. I do not understand myself why they have found themselves in this position because nothing could be clearer than what this House did, in its wisdom or otherwise, in the year 1960.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I have given it would be utterly impracticable to accede to the motion by Deputy Lindsay, which I formally move to reject.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The Minister lasted 25 minutes.  This motion is put down in the name of Deputy Corish and other members of the Labour Party, including myself.  It is of interest that on 22nd February, 1966, Deputy Corish moved a motion on income tax.  The wording was:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to make provision in the forthcoming Budget for a substantial increase in personal and dependants income tax allowances as they bear no relation to the purposes for which they were originally intended.</P>
      <P>That motion was debated over the three-hour period and the man who put the Government point of view was Deputy Jack Lynch, the present Taoiseach and Acting Minister for Finance.  He He was then Minister for Finance.  He was not Taoiseach.  He made a number of points in the debate and one of them which recurred was: &ldquo;It is unfair to ask me now to do something about this.  We are near the Budget&rdquo;&mdash; in fact, the Budget came in April &mdash;&ldquo;We are unable to disclose what is likely to happen because it would be giving away Budget secrets.&rdquo;  I suppose at any time of the year, certainly at the present time, one could be accused of being too near the Budget because one can never know when a Budget is coming with Fianna Fáil.  We had two this year, and, according to some reports I hear, there is great danger of a third one looming on the horizon some time later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I have no doubt before this debate is finished that somebody will say: &ldquo;It is unfair to ask us now about this because we are too near the Budget&rdquo;.  Budget or no Budget, I suggest we have reached the stage in this country where, no matter what the workers do about improving their working conditions and wages, they cannot keep up because of the present <Col N="1152" /> arrangement in regard to income tax whereby the State unblushingly grabs back from them a very high proportion of the wages they are earning.  I have here the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation and at paragraph 27, page 14, it says:</P>
    <P>We recommended recognition of the principle that income tax should not be payable on the income needed for minimum subsistence; and that the effective exemption limits should be based on the personal allowances, including earned income allowance, without the complication of a formal exemption limit.</P>
    <P>Despite this, and despite the fact that the present Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, agreed he was accepting this and, in fact, had included it in the White Paper produced by the Government on the question of income taxation, despite that he argues and continues to argue that no efforts should be made to try to put this into operation.  In 1960-61 the single man or woman earning £6 5s paid no income tax because the tax-free allowance was £6 5s.  Many of the people at that time had under £6 per week and, in fact, could earn overtime without being taxed.</P>
    <P>Now, with the general rate of wages throughout the country&mdash;at least for male employees&mdash;at around £10 per week&mdash;I am referring to local authority employees particularly and to farm workers and to State employees &mdash;the limit of tax exemption has not been moved.  While the wages being paid by employers at the present time are, as far as I know&mdash;I am speaking as a trade union official who negotiates those wages&mdash;simply an amount which will keep body and soul together, with nothing to spare, despite that the State insist on taxing, at the rate of 7/- in the £, approximately £4 of the wage the single man is getting. In other words, the single man or woman who is getting £10 5s Od per week is required to pay £1 8s Od per week income tax.  The Minister may say that the standard rate is only 4/9d: the standard rate is 7/-.  It does not matter whether or not it is deducted from them at 4/9d: it amounts to the same thing.  The really important <Col N="1153" /> point is that these unfortunate people are being treated now in the same way as they were treated in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>The last time the Taoiseach was speaking in the debate he made some kind of peculiar argument that, because of the increase in wages, it was the right for the Government to increase income tax.  He tried to turn the story back on us.  Because we were claiming that, as a result of the drop in money values, the wages they were getting in 1966 were, in value, only the same as they were getting some years ago, the Taoiseach tried to turn it back on us and say it was the same with tax.  He knows that is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>In 1966, the minimum wage, the wage which was a bare subsistence, was not taxed.  I claim that, in 1968, the minimum wage&mdash;which is still a bare subsistence&mdash;is being taxed on the single man and woman to the tune of up to £4 per week, 28s tax.  No doubt there will be people who will say these people are single, that they have no dependants.  This is one of the fallacies to which I think the Government either are closing their eyes completely or are not aware of.</P>
    <P>It is the general thing in the country with somebody who is working for a living&mdash;if there are ageing parents, a son and a daughter&mdash;that the daughter remains on as a housekeeper and one son is keeping the household.  The father and the mother may die but the daughter will remain on.  In many cases, she is unable to work. Sometimes she is able just to do odd jobs around the house.  Sometimes she is a fully fit person but she has never been employed outside and whatever work she does is around the home.  Yet she is not a dependant, just as for social welfare benefit, as far as income tax is concerned.  The result is that that man is treated as if the only person depending on the income he is getting is himself, although everybody knows that he must look after the housekeeper or whoever is living in the home.</P>
    <P>We have the same situation with regard to married couples.  The married couple are in the position that they have approximately 10 guineas tax free but they had that in 1960/61 and the <Col N="1154" /> position has not changed.  It did not change up to 1966 and it has not changed up to 1968.  Would anybody seriously suggest that a married man with a wife only to support should be asked to pay income tax on a wage of £11, £12 or £13 per week if his tax free allowance is only 10 guineas?  Why should he not have a reasonable tax free allowance?  Why should the same effort not be made to ensure that a man who is getting a bare subsistence to keep himself and his dependants should have a higher tax free allowance?</P>
    <P>There is the other case which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey &mdash;I hope he will soon be back with us &mdash;referred to when making his speech on Budget No. 1 of this year.  He said I have a pet case which I always trot out: I hope to continue to trot it out until it is remedied.  It is the case of the man who gets up at 6 o'clock in the morning and travels a long journey to work.  In order to do that travelling, he must have the use of a car.  Either he himself has an old car or some of his neighbours will carry him in their car and there will be a certain payment for it.</P>

      <P>Let me deal with this point.  Here is the man who leaves home at 7 a.m. and who travels 30 or 40 miles to work.  He works very hard on an open site all day.  He may get an hour or two overtime or he may not.  He starts back home in the evening.  The income tax people say to that man, in effect: &ldquo;You have a lot of income and we must get tax.  You have excess income and we must get tax on it.  We cannot run the country <Col N="1155" /> without it.&rdquo;  The man who finds it hard to run his own house with what he is earning must hand over a proportion of his earnings so that the country can be kept running on an even keel.  The Minister talks like a person who does not know the problem.  He has let the House know he is not aware of the problem.</P>

      <P>It must have been a very long time ago.  I doubt if the Minister ever had to work hard all day on only two or three sandwiches and a mug of cold tea and then had to start for home without having had anything to eat all day.  I doubt also whether he had the problem in relation to clothes and footwear that the type of man I am speaking of has because of the type of work he does.  The man of whom I speak finds that his boots need replacement every couple of months and that there is very considerable wear and tear on his clothes by reason of the type of work he does. All such a man sees of his family is for a couple of hours in the late evening because he must go off again early the next morning.  I speak now for such people.  We are told that such people are not allowed any travelling allowance.  But the boss, who runs the job, who lives beside them, and who goes in at 10 a.m., is entitled to claim a rebate for his car.  He can bring out his pals to dinner and claim for them, too.  They are a different class. The Minister can appreciate their problems but he cannot appreciate the problem of the fellow who has to work so terribly hard to try to keep both body and soul together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, within the time at my disposal, to look at this Budget not alone in the light of the new impositions, the new taxes, but in the light of what I regard to be of greater importance.  Although these taxes have been severe I should like to examine this Budget in the light of our greatest needs: economic growth and the provision of jobs.  May I say our greatest failures have been to attain the necessary economic growth and provide sufficient jobs.  I do not want any Member of the House to take my word for this.  I am sure every Member got the same document as I did, through, I suppose, the Department of the Taoiseach, entitled &ldquo;Comments on Second Programme.  Review of Progress 1964/67&rdquo; by the National Industrial Economic Council.  This is an admirable council which has treated its job seriously and has on numerous occasions given valuable advice to the Government in regard to the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion but, unfortunately, did not have it implemented by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the very first page of this document we find that as far as growth is concerned the Government have failed miserably in every single sector with the exception of imports and exports. It seems tragic as well that we should <Col N="1157" /> in discussing this Budget be concerned with our balance of payments when our exports, particularly our industrial exports, improved so much in the years 1964 to 1967, whilst on the other hand our imports increased as well.  The NIEC report that as far as gross national product is concerned we failed to achieve our annual average target. It was similar in agriculture, forestry and fishing, in industry and in consumption, private and public, and in employment.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, as far as employment is concerned, we find that since 1961 not alone have we not been improving the position in regard to the provision of jobs but we have been losing an average of 1,600 jobs per year.  One is, therefore, inclined to ask what price programmes whether the first, second or third, as long as we have the Government adopting a policy which is demonstrated to the fullest in the proposals in this Budget and when none of these targets was achieved?  I am convinced that the Budget was framed merely to satisfy the economic theorists rather than have regard to our great need&mdash;the provision of jobs and the creation of economic growth.</P>
    <P>This Budget, mini or maxi, whatever you want to call it, spotlights the Government's concern to maintain or, indeed, increase our external reserves at the expense of losing employment opportunities.  I think it was the Institute for Economic and Social Research which said recently that there should not be anything done now and particularly nothing like what has been done in this Budget because Irish industry was finding itself at a stage at which it could make some move forward in regard to the provision of more jobs.  In the last three or four years the position in regard to the provision of industrial employment has not been improved to any great extent. Now we are told by those who should know that if we did not have deliberate deflation at the present time there would be a great possibility of increasing the number of industrial jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it will be said in this House or outside it&mdash; I do not think anyone on the Government Benches would have the neck to <Col N="1158" /> say it&mdash;that the justification for this Budget lies in the recent financial crisis we had in Europe and in the world.  It has got nothing at all to do with it. The proposals now before the House were decided upon four or five weeks ago or maybe they were decided on even a short time before that or possibly they were decided on before the referendum, but the announcement of the proposals was delayed.  The Taoiseach says, and I believe him on this occasion&mdash;although that is not to say that I disbelieve him on other occassions&mdash;that these proposals were introduced to protect our balance of payments and our external reserves. This is where I join issue with the Government, with the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to our balance of payments and with regard to our allied external reserves. As I said, this has nothing to do with Europe or with the world.  It is a Fianna Fáil Government economic exercise and the Budget would have been introduced in any case no matter what happened in the last week, as, indeed, a similar Budget was introduced in 1964 by the then Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach, when practically the very same proposals were brought in and, unfortunately, the same damage was caused.  One would have imagined that the Fianna Fáil Government should have learned the lesson from the repercussions which followed the introduction of a further Budget in the autumn of 1964.</P>
    <P>The European problem is caused by difficulties in the French economy and by the crazy and inflexible world exchange system.  This Budget has been necessary because of the mismanagement and ineptitude of the Government. There is no point in the Minister for Finance saying: &ldquo;We have to do these things because we have an unfavourable balance of payments&rdquo; because there will be a much more unfavourable balance of payments next year.  If the balance of payments is unfavourable this year the Government must take responsibility and if the balance of payments is unfavourable next year it will be the full responsibility of the Government.  The proposals in this Budget have been introduced because of the supreme <Col N="1159" /> importance which Fianna Fáil appear to attach to our external reserves even at the expense, as they have done and as they are doing, of relegating economic growth and the provision of employment to second place.</P>
    <P>The basic job of this or any Government is the creation of jobs.  The stated purpose of the First and Second Economic Programmes was the provision of more jobs.  We had a target of about 8,700 jobs per year but, of course, that target has gone by the board.  The stated intention of those who framed the First and Second Programmes, and I assume they will have the same intention in the Third Programme, was to provide for economic expansion and the provision of more jobs.  Our criticism has always been that these programmes were merely pious hopes that these things would be achieved without the necessary action, or the minimum action, being taken in order to achieve them.  While that has been the attitude of the Government and of the framers of the Programmes, there is a contradiction in that the Budgets which the various Fianna Fáil Ministers have introduced have been deliberately designed, or if not deliberately designed then unconsciously designed, to ensure that growth would remain static or drop back and that there would be similar regression as far as employment was concerned.  It seems to me, therefore, that our workers, men and women, must come second to the sacred cow of our external reserves.  Programming for employment is dead.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's speech and read it subsequently and I did not see in it any great emphasis on the provision of employment.  It did not appear from that document that there would be more employment or that employment would be sustained.  On the contrary, underlying all this was the suggestion that there would be hardship as far as the provision of employment was concerned.  The targets have been scrapped altogether. Employment opportunities are being sacrificed.  Conservative policy makers detect unfavourable trends which violate any or all of the commandments <Col N="1160" /> of the financial world.  I do not know who the advisers are.  I do not know who advises that, in present circumstances, we should inflate in order to defend or to protect our economy.  All I know is that the result will be catastrophic for the Irish people generally and for the Irish worker in particular.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Budgets introduced here have been used consistently not as instruments of economic growth or for the provision of jobs but to defend and maintain banking and other financial interests, interests more concerned in economic theories and the mythical value of high finance rather than in the provision of good jobs at good wages.  The sooner senior politicians, those in Fianna Fáil in particular, rebel against this persistent advice given by so-called economic advisers the better.</P>
    <P>I have seen the trend in various Budgets under various governments. The advice of theoretical economists is taken, economists who know very little about men and women, very little about prices and the effect of prices on people; the Government should reject this advice and act as humans, not as economists; they should act like people who know the needs of people and who, because they know the needs, introduce measures designed in their own sagacity to protect employment and to expand employment.</P>
    <P>The policy being pursued is a cautious and conservative approach to our problems.  The proposals in this Budget will have the effect of stopping the growth of industrial jobs.  The savage and unnecessary increased taxation will deflate the economy, with dire consequences.  We should have learned from the lesson we had two years ago when, as a result of the mini-Budget at that time, there was practically no growth in national income for two or three years.  That was the result of the panic measures taken by the Government then.  In the early autumn of this year the Government were warned by the Economic and Social Research Institute&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach read the report of that body&mdash;that they could do either of two things in their general financial approach <Col N="1161" /> to the problems the country was facing.  They could decide to encourage growth and production and employment by allowing expansion to continue, by not interfering with it or with the purchasing power of the people, or they could deflate the economy to cut down the balance of payments deficit.  The latter is what they have done in the Budget proposals before us.  They have done that at the expense of existing jobs, the creation of more jobs or the risk of losing some of the jobs that are there at the moment.  The Institute warned that the two things could not be done simultaneously.  One cannot deflate and expect the economy to expand.  One cannot deflate and expect to maintain the <i>status quo</i> or to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>We must give credit to the Fianna Fáil Government for their consistency because, once more, they have chosen the second course.  They have decided to deflate in order to reduce the balance of payments deficit.  They have done so at the expense of economic growth and at the expense of existing jobs.  The two greatest needs we have are growth and the creation of jobs. The dramatic impact on the public, as far as this Budget is concerned, is the increase in the price of cigarettes, tobacco, beer, spirits, etc.  These are what hit the headlines because newspapers know what is news&mdash;cigarettes up by 3d, the pint by 2d, spirits up by 4d a glass and the wholesale tax up by five per cent.  That was the first impact of the Budget.  Unfortunately, there is another impact.  Some will try to compensate themselves for these increased prices and some will be successful in doing so.</P>
    <P>Have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance considered the repercussions of these increases?  Apart from these increases, other increases in prices have been approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;tea, bread, bus fares and various other items.  What a reduction these will represent in the pay-packets of the workers!  Perhaps, the Taoiseach could throw a little light on one aspect.  When were these increases applied for?  When did those who engage in the distribution of tea ask for an increase in price? <Col N="1162" /> When did those who make bread ask for an increase in the price of the loaf? When did CIE ask for an increase in bus fares?  Would it be unfair to suggest that these applications were made some months ago and decisions were deferred pending the referendum?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I pose the question so that the Taoiseach may clear the matter up.  Up to 16th October, apart from one speech in which the Taoiseach gave a gentle warning, things were apparently rolling along fine; we had nothing to fear.  However, from 17th October onwards, everything came down on top of the people: tea, bread, bus fares, telephone charges, etc.  Is it a coincidence that all this happened a few short weeks after the decision given by the people in the referendum on 16th October?  I am not saying this is punishment, as has been alleged by other speakers here; I am saying, however, that a great many of these decisions must have been deferred so as to prop the falling credit of the Fianna Fáil Party during the referendum campaign.</P>
      <P>Most speakers here have referred to the social welfare classes.  Old age pensioners, widows, the blind and those on unemployment assistance got an increase of 7s 6d from the beginning of August last.  What effect will this Budget have on that 7s 6d?  How much of it will be absorbed in the increases on the various items I have mentioned? There are, too, social welfare classes who have not yet got any increase.  I am referring to those on sickness benefit, unemployment assistance and contributory pensions, both old age and widows.  They will get no increase until January next, but in the five or six weeks up to Christmas they will be required to pay these increased prices and these increases will certainly be a pretty heavy burden on these people. They will represent a big reduction in the weekly income, such as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, these are the items that got the headlines.  There were no headlines in regard to other items because I suppose unfortunate people do not understand all the repercussions of the Budget.  There was no headline about the loss of purchasing power as a result <Col N="1163" /> of these increases in taxation and their effect on the level of production and employment.  I cannot say with accuracy the number of people who will now be denied jobs as a result of this Budget, but I would reckon the number at something between 3,000 and 5,000.  These will not now get the jobs which leaders of industry said they might expect if the economy were not interfered with by the Government.  We have all seen the results of other Fianna Fáil Budgets. The evidence is there in their appalling employment record.  All their targets, particularly those with regard to employment, have been shamelessly abandoned.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I spoke here on the motion of no confidence in the Government, I posed a query to the Taoiseach about the level of our external reserves.  I do not pretend to be a financial expert nor have I many, if any, advisers on this subject, but as an ordinary citizen in present circumstances, and particularly having regard to what is happening in Europe and in other places in the world today I must feel very bewildered.  I asked the Taoiseach what was the safe level for our external reserves.  To give him his due he is the only Minister for Finance in my term in this House who gave me some sort of an answer.  I also asked him to what level could they be run down with safety.  I did not get a reply to that question.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that our external reserves would be safe at the same level as our imports bill for nine months of the year.  I think I am quoting the Taoiseach correctly because I have since checked up in the Official Report.  I do not know where we got this nine months.  When I queried the safe level for our external reserves the Taoiseach said they should stand at the same level as the cost of our imports for nine months of the year. Where do we get this nine months? Are we following the example set in other countries?  Is this the level in Great Britain, America, Denmark, Belgium, Holland or Italy?  Is this our yardstick?</P>
    <P>We have not very many international <Col N="1164" /> records political or financial or otherwise, but we have this record&mdash;perhaps, the Taoiseach will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;of having the highest level of external reserves in Western Europe.  I will go further and say that we have the world record so far as external reserves are concerned.  The Taoiseach said our external reserves should be the same as the cost of our imports of consumer goods and raw materials for nine months of the year. Denmark is a country with a record of having progressed in recent years. The yardstick for Denmark is that their external reserves should be the same as the cost of imports for two months. In Norway it is three months.  In Sweden it is 2½ months.  In Belgium it is 3½ months.  In nn Holland 3¼ months.  In Canada it is three months. In Japan it is 2½ months, and in Switzerland it is eight months.</P>
    <P>We beat them hollow so far as our external reserves related to imports are concerned.  We are better than Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Japan and Switzerland &mdash;even the mighty Switzerland.  Our Irish banking system has more money abroad, relatively speaking, than Switzerland or any other country.  I do not like to accuse the Taoiseach of sharp practice but what was done was that in relating our present external reserves to the cost of our imports for a full year he got nine months.  I have given the figures for other countries in Europe and in the world, and I think it is up to the Taoiseach to be a little more helpful and tell the Irish people and the Dáil why it is necessary to have so much Irish money abroad when it is so badly needed at home.  Denmark does not need so much abroad, Sweden, Belgium, Japan, Canada do not need so much abroad related to their imports, and I should like to know why our reserves are greater than theirs. Denmark is a country which is often compared with ours but, so far as our external reserves are concerned, we have 50 per cent more.  The peculiar thing is that their gross national product is far greater than ours even though we have more money abroad.  It reminds me of someone down the country living in penury with thousands of pound notes or plenty of gold under <Col N="1165" /> the mattress.  The money is not being used.</P>
    <P>I do not want all our reserves to be run down, but I do not think we should be the &ldquo;champs&rdquo; so far as external reserves are concerned for the sake of having investments in other countries. I must say, therefore, with all due respect that I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Taoiseach.  I say we should be prepared to run down our external reserves in order to invest in productive enterprise in Ireland where investment is needed badly.  I do not say our external reserves should be dissipated but if some countries consider two months or 2½ months imports a safe level, I do not see why we should be the top with nine months.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Taoiseach had taken the course of running down our reserves it would not have been necessary to introduce these savage taxation proposals and the other proposals contained in the Budget.  The Taoiseach gave me this information because I interrupted him but I think we should have a serious discussion on this matter. I do not pretend to be an expert in high finance but it seems peculiar to me that in this situation we have a balance of payments problem and we still have £275 million or £300 million invested in other countries.  The other aspect is that while we have this sum of money in our external reserves in order to correct a balance of payments situation we must tax the people and ask them to pay more for the pint for the second time in six or nine months, ask them to pay more for cigarettes, more in wholesale tax and more for whiskey.  That is a ridiculous situation and it should be studied more deeply than it appears to have been studied in the framing of this Budget.</P>
    <P>This is the difference between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil or any other Party.  We believe that in a situation in which there is a balance of payments problem our external reserves should be used to combat that problem, and not the old device of taxing beer, cigarettes and tobacco and all the other things generally taxed in the Budget.  We do not think the people should have to suffer when we have a <Col N="1166" /> balance of payments problem and also £275 million abroad.  As I said earlier, we believe in putting employment first and Fianna Fáil appear to put financial theories first.</P>
    <P>In addition to the effects of this Budget we have the Fianna Fáil mania for free trade.  We have had exhortations from Ministers over the past five or six years that we should prepare for free trade and that industry should adapt and modernise to meet the competition of free trade.  May I ask the Taoiseach a question?  Will this Budget help that?  How can Irish industrialists plan ahead when the Government themselves will not plan ahead?  How can they plan ahead and decide they are going to expand and develop in different directions if they are not certain what prices will be? Did they know after the April Budget that there would be another Budget which would increase the cost by way of wholesale tax?  How can you expect Irish industry to plan ahead when they do not get a lead from the Government which do not seem to be concerned about planning ahead?  Trade unions cannot be indifferent to the increases proposed in the Budget and the recent increases approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I know we will get the usual call for restraint from the witch-hunting Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs.  I know we will get the usual exhortation from Dr. Hillery, the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Will they put themselves in the shoes of those who have to bear the burden?  I know everybody has to pay increased taxes.  Will they put themselves in the shoes of these people who negotiated wage agreements on the assumption the Government were concerned about keeping prices at a reasonable level?  Surely, having regard to these increases they must review their whole position?  As a matter of fact, some of these increases were phased out to the extent that they are to be paid in two instalments.  These wage negotiations or agreements were drawn up on the assumption that there would not be increases in prices.  Would anybody blame them for calling for review?  The agricultural worker with £10 per week could not be blamed for <Col N="1167" /> asking why he should not get the money to bear these increases.  Do the Government understand the position of a man with an average weekly wage of £13 in Ireland today?  Will they understand his point of view when he asks how he is going to pay the increased prices for tea and bread and the increased prices proposed in the Budget?  These increases which they were guaranteed and which may come as a result of the fixed agreement are whittled away, some by the April Budget, some by the November Budget of this year, and by the price increases over the past six to 12 months</P>
    <P>I am not quite satisfied about the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to price control.  A Price Control Bill was introduced into this House with a great flourish of trumpets two years ago following the insistence of the Labour Party.  The Minister who introduced it was, I think, Dr. Hillery, and we gave it our wholehearted support.  Valuable amendments were proposed by the Labour Party and graciously accepted. Does anybody believe price control is being exercised?  I remember Deputies from these Labour benches asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce what staff of inspectors had he got.  I would say prices in certain commodities are going up without any approval at all.  This is because the Minister's Department is not equipped with adequate staff to ensure price control will be applied as was intended in the legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are three reasons which I will describe briefly why the Labour Party reject the proposals. First, we believe these deflationary measures will do nothing but damage to employment opportunities.  I guarantee that in three months time such will be the case.  The Taoiseach may deny it.  Secondly, I believe that the proposals will upset plans for industrial modernisation.  All the Taoiseach has to do in that respect is to consult the various industrial organisations and employers' groups to know that is so, and again, to refer to the advice given by the research institute in the autumn of this year that if there was no interference <Col N="1168" /> by the Government we could have more jobs in industry in this country in a short time.  Thirdly, we reject the proposals because they will seriously affect industrial relations and wage structures.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is another serious aspect of Government policy which must be considered in this debate on the mini-Budget.  It is, in fact, our utter dependence on Great Britain as a trading partner and the Government's determination to hitch themselves to a country which has the slowest growthrate in Europe.  We are the second slowest in growth rate.</P>
    <P>Again, when discussing devaluation about two years ago there was a lot of hollow talk from the Government Benches about diversification of trade. Will anybody tell me what has been done?  Will anybody tell me what any Government Department has done to diversify trade?  Everybody in the House knew then that dependence on Britain and on the British market could mean that if anything happened in Britain economically we would get the backlash of it.  The Taoiseach, or his predecessor, talked about diversification of trade.  It was said we would go to Europe and sell to various countries. I have seen no figures which show any evidence of diversification of trade at all.</P>
    <P>We have the current situation with regard to the new import regulations to Great Britain.  This, again, indicates how very vulnerable we are, so long as we keep all our eggs in one basket. What emanated from the question to the Taoiseach today by Deputy Cosgrave was that we are going to prop and guarantee Irish exporters in order to be able to meet all these regulations to the extent of £25 million. Again, it emanated from the question which I put that the Irish taxpayer will have to pay £2½ million for this. Not alone did we get a bad bargain in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement but the Irish taxpayer is now going to pay money for it.  Let it be known that if there was another Budget the man who has to pay extra for the pint will be paying for this agreement which the Fianna Fáil Government made with Britain.</P>
    <P>We all remember the claims for the <Col N="1169" /> Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. We were told we were traitors because we voted against it.  We were told we were rocking the boat because we spoke violently against the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  The Minister for Finance claimed that agriculture would benefit to the extent of £10 million in the first year and that the Irish farmers would never know a hungry day or a hungry month.  It was claimed that Irish industry would be stimulated.  It was claimed that there would be competition and Irish industry could face the challenge.  This is the second or third occasion on which the British have broken this agreement. We still will not have a review of it. The peculiar or tragic thing about this whole situation is that the Irish Government asked for the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  It would not be so bad if Britain asked for it but the Irish Government asked for it as an exercise to prepare us for admission to the European Economic Community.  We looked for it and we certainly got it.</P>
    <P>Under recent regulations proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, industrial exporters will be in the difficulty that those who buy our goods in Britain will be required to put down 50 per cent deposit over a period of six months. As well as that, as was mentioned here at Question Time, the British Government propose to implement what the Minister for Agriculture calls a plan. For years and years there was a policy whereby agricultural exports from this country were guaranteed.  What did we get out of the trade agreement?  Employment did not improve.  Agriculture did not improve, and now we find these people with whom we sought an agreement are seeking to try to block industrial exports to Britain.  We were told we could get as many cattle as we liked and that, as I have said, the Irish farmer would never know a hungry day again.</P>
    <P>Here we are, on the other hand, in the position that not alone are we being subjected to these restrictions by Britain in respect of industrial exports, not alone are we being subjected, or may be subjected, to curtailment <Col N="1170" /> of our agricultural exports, but we are even stripping ourselves of the protection that is so badly needed by many Irish industries.  I think we are daft.  This is an agreement whereby Britain can do anything she likes.  This is an agreement whereby Britain can protect her industrial products, whereby Britain can take away any advantage we had as far as agricultural exports are concerned and we are sitting back.  We are going over to see Mr. Wilson.  We are going to ask him about all this.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that we had a review of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement? If that is not conceded by Britain and by the British Prime Minister, surely this House should be given an early opportunity to review the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and then let us hear from Fine Gael and from Fianna Fáil and, particularly, from those who spoke in favour of the agreement that has proved a fraud, a fraud that is the responsibility of a former Taoiseach and the colleagues who went with him to negotiate this trade agreement with Britain?  They have done all this without consultation.  We were told that as far as even small things were concerned, say, the price of soup, nothing would be done without consultation; that with regard to the price of cattle&mdash; anything we mentioned &mdash; nothing would be done to damage the Irish economy without consultation.  Is it not time for us to wake up and to ask for a review of this trade agreement and, for God's sake, to try to negotiate a far better one than was negotiated during the Christmas period of 1965-66?</P>
    <P>As I said, we were the only Party to oppose the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  If anybody read in the last week the speeches that were made by practically every single member of this Party on, I think, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th January, he will be forced to concede how right we were; he will be forced to concede that we were concerned at that time, not with the waving of a paper in which was contained a trade agreement, but with Irish workers and Irish people.  Again, that is demonstrated, if you like, in the circumstances that we have now in which, <Col N="1171" /> as I have said, over the last six years not alone have we not improved the employment position but have lost 1,600 workers, on average, for every year between 1961 and 1967.  The Labour Party opposed that trade agreement because we believed the balance of advantage lay with Britain and the Labour Party have been proved right in the attitude it adopted in January, 1966.</P>
    <P>This has been, in my view, a Tory and most reactionary Budget.  It will bring all the consequences in employment and industrial relations that I have mentioned.  This is a Budget that will hit the pocket of the man-in-thestreet. This is a Budget that will take from the shopping basket of every housewife.  This is a Budget in which the people are now being asked to pay dearly, very dearly, for a Government that are inept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before discussing the terms of the Budget, I should like to join in the expressions of regret which have been made by my colleagues and from different sections in the House at the absence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, through illness.  We sincerely regret the circumstances causing his absence from the House and we hope and pray that he will shortly be fully restored to health.</P>
      <P>In considering the Budget at the present time we have to consider the whole effects of the Government's economic policy.  Since this debate started the NIEC review of what has happened has been published.  The examination which that review has made of the economy and the facts which are disclosed in it and, indeed, some of the conclusions and observations made in the report, constitute a most telling and effective indictment of Government policy and the failure of the Government to adhere to the directives laid down in its own programme and the complete inability of the Government and, indeed, of Government Departments, to do the very thing that they say it is necessary to get across to the people &mdash; to get the public and the different sections affected involved directly in implementing and working the policy and decisions that have been laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> This NIEC review shows that a number of the targets which were laid down for the period 1964-1967 have not been realised and that in the main the failure has been entirely on the side of the Government in respect of their share of the particular section for which they had special responsibility.  In respect of a number of the targets as published in Table I of this review, on page 5, it is obvious that the targets laid down in the Second Programme have not been achieved and that in a number of cases, particularly in output from agriculture, forestry and fishing, the actual outturn is substantially below target.  In industry there is a shortfall in respect of the private sector in regard to private consumption.</P>
    <P>When lectures are delivered by Government Ministers and sections are admonished to live within their means and to produce more, it is important to bear in mind that private consumption was estimated at 3.6 per cent annual growth rate for the period 1964-67 but that the actual outturn reached only 2.6 per cent; and that when we look at public consumption &mdash; this applies to expenditure by public authorities &mdash; the figure shows that in this respect and in respect of investment, there has been a very substantial shortfall.  On the other hand, exports were substantially above the estimated target and employment, as has been said, was very much below it.</P>
    <P>This particular review examined what happened and there are obvious conflicts in the conclusions and statements made in certain parts of it.  In dealing with the adverse trading conditions which were encountered, especially in the British market, in the early years of the Programme, reference is made to the fact that the British economy grew relatively slowly, that domestic inflationary pressures developed during 1964 as a result of a combination of excessive increases in money incomes, in Government expenditure and bank credit.  Then, in the next page, it states:</P>
    <P>The measures taken to deal with it were promptly and successfully taken as far as the British levies were concerned.</P>
    <P>However, the kernel of the whole report is reflected in a statement later <Col N="1173" /> in which it is made clear that in Ireland, Government, management, trade unions, farm organisations and other agencies concerned with major national economic decisions, must all be involved in the planning of programmes, in the provision of the initiative in formulating targets.  The Government are primarily responsible for creating conditions conducive to economic progress but, taking economic planning in the private sector, the Government must create a favourable environment through economic and social expenditure and through monetary and fiscal policies.  In another part of the report, reference is made to the failure of the Second Programme, to the nuturing of cynicism, and stress was laid on the importance of consultation between those who are charged with pursuing major objectives and public policies and the representatives of those who make the final economic decisions in the private sector.</P>
    <P>What has happened here in so far as one major aspect of the economy is concerned, and this has been commented on time and time again, is that the Government have done the very thing the NIEC Report states they should not do.  They have failed to consult with the bodies and organisations concerned.</P>

      <P>How can you expect trade unions to accept, farming organisations to believe and industry to participate and share in the responsibility for implementing economic policy, if in a number of cases the Government fail to discuss with them and fail to negotiate where necessary with the responsible organisations concerned? I know it takes two to negotiate&mdash;perhaps three if there are more organisations involved&mdash;but that is what the Government are elected to do&mdash;to work with and to serve the interests of the different sections in the community.  A number of people in the organisation responsible for this report represent particular sections in the community.  Others are nominated by the Government.  They have devoted a considerable period of time <Col N="1174" /> during the years studying and considering in a responsible way the problems and the difficulties and the measures that must be taken to deal with the situation.  But the reason people are cynical and disillusioned, the reason people have no confidence in the Government, is that the Government were found to be unreliable; their estimates were inaccurate and could not be believed.</P>

      <P>Many Fianna Fáil supporters have no confidence in them. One reason is that their estimates and statements cannot be believed.  I do not know whether they are made in good faith or in circumstances that will create the impression that whatever is said in the easiest possible fashion may be got over quickly and without as much difficulty as would arise otherwise.  Almost exactly a year ago when devaluation occurred, in introducing the Estimate for his Department, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>As to the overall effect of devaluation on the price level, it is reasonable to calculate that it should not be more than 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute in a report already quoted stated:</P>
      <P>It would appear that the full impact of devaluation has not yet been felt on consumer prices, while the effect of the current series of pay increases has likewise yet to become apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer price index in May, 1968, was 4.4 per cent above that for the previous May and 3.7 per cent above the figure for November, 1967. This six-monthly increase is the highest since 1964.  The report went on to state that it has been assumed for the purpose of these accounts that there will be a further rise at a later stage. It had already mentioned that the full <Col N="1175" /> impact of devaluation had not yet been felt&mdash;that the effects would become apparent at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Of course, the effect of devaluation was not the only contributory factor in the price rise but the situation has now been reached when we find that the Government, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance when introducing the Budget last May said his estimates were based on the best arithmetical information available, are completely out.  The Taoiseach, acting as Minister for Finance, had to introduce a Budget here on 5th November for additional taxes which impose a burden of £15 million more this year or, in a full year, almost £20 million.  Even that allows for the fact that the estimates were buoyant to the extent of £7½ million&mdash;£7½ million over that which was estimated.  Even with that buoyancy and this additional taxation, we face the end of this year with a deficit, shown in the table presented by the Acting Minister for Finance at the end of the Budget, of more than £7 million.</P>
    <P>Is not that a fantastic situation for a Government whose advice, it was said six months ago, was based on the best possible calculations?  Is it any wonder that the NIEC Report states they have not got across, that they have not got the participation and the cooperation of the outside interests concerned? During a long period we have been repeatedly expressing the view, but particularly during the past nine months and since the debate on the referendum began, that the failure of this Government can be blamed on their arrogance and intolerance.  I want to show how that has happened.</P>
    <P>They refused to negotiate with the farming organisations.  Again, I agree this may not be an easy matter: there is politics in this and we know who started politics in it.  Leaving that aside, if one turns to education one sees what happened in relation to the policy for the proposed merger of the two universities in Dublin.  In that sphere, which embraces the welfare of so many of our young people, we had the extraordinary situation in which, after an initial announcement and a promise that there would be a White Paper&mdash;this was not honoured&mdash;the <Col N="1176" /> Minister for Education made an announcement on 6th July last: &ldquo;Those are the terms and there are no other terms either offered or open to the body for consideration.&rdquo;  This was another illustration of the arrogance and the dictatorial attitude of the Government. A number of the members of the Higher Education Authority were eminent people in their respective spheres.  They were in effect told that, whatever else might be open for consideration by them, they were to understand clearly that the decision on the merger is not open to question.  They were told: &ldquo;You have only to discuss the means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely this is an intolerable attitude to a body appointed by a Minister, because in the last analysis Ministers and Government Departments are there to serve the public interest.  I should like to emphasise what happened here over a week ago.  We had a good, constructive and responsible debate considering, as a result of a motion brought forward by Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i>, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee &mdash; this debate was contributed to by Deputies from all Parties on that Committee &mdash; a matter about which two officials had a disagreement. We asserted the supremacy of Dáil Éireann.  That was asserted and vindicated and we recognised the constructive manner in which the Government faced it.  It arose because two public servants about their respective duties had nearly brought the machinery of the Public Accounts Committee to a full stop.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation arising in respect of the proposed merger and in other spheres of education.  I do not want to speak at length on educational problems but this is a discussion on the whole question of Government policy.  We have seen a series of articles written in a recent publication of <i>Studies</i>; these articles were not written by politicians or people concerned in any sense in politics.  Again, the same situation was exemplified, as has been exemplified in what happened here in relation to the discussion over the Public Accounts Committee, as a result of an arrogant approach either spearheaded by a Minister or spearheaded because a Minister has <Col N="1177" /> allowed his officials to take authority.</P>
    <P>Here we have an extraordinary situation in which the Secretary of the Department of Education went to a meeting dealing with post-primary or secondary education.  There had been a good deal of discussion about the revised Leaving Certificate.  The Secretary spoke in laudatory terms of the grouping of subjects and was in fact flatly downed by every educational group except one.  Yet, the afternoon session of the meeting was peremptorily informed that it was the intention of the Department to introduce grouping and it was only after some discussion that it was agreed to have it on a voluntary basis for a few years.</P>
    <P>This handing down of diktats by Government Departments is undemocratic and is resented by Irish people in different sectors.  It is no use saying that this is a political point of view. This is a view expressed&mdash;and I have only read a brief reference from one particular article.  There are a whole series of articles all commenting on it. This is in many ways an extraordinary article because it is the accepted practice to preserve the anonymity of the Civil Service and this has been asserted here by all Governments and all Ministers since the State was established.  If you want to criticise policy or decisions, you do not criticise officials.  The Minister concerned and the Government must bear the responsibility. Here, for the first time, the Civil Service have departed from this practice, and I suppose departed from it with the approval or the knowledge of the Minister, and one assumes that Ministers are reasonable in their approach to what happens in their Departments.</P>
    <P>The Government approve and confirm what happened in relation to education.  We believe there is a case for the rationalisation of university education in this city.  There should be some form of co-ordinating authority. Initially there was possibly a case for some form of single university but, whatever decision is reached or whatever action is taken in this matter, whatever conclusions are eventually reached, they can only be made effective by consultation and agreement. <Col N="1178" /> There is no use in the NIEC Report saying that sections of the community must be involved in this if the particular groups concerned are not consulted or are handed a diktat and told that this is the Minister's decision, or that this is the Government's decision and you must make the best of it.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside this aspect of the Government we see an extraordinary failure in relation to the policy of the Government over a wide area of the economy.  The report in the quarterly commentary by the Economic and Social Research Institute indicated under every major heading with one exception that Government policy had no effect and that there had been a failure to expand employment.  More people have left agricultural employment since the target which was laid down in the Second Programme.  There are fewer people at work than before either Programmes started, the First or the Second.  There are fewer people at work in Ireland.  Is it any wonder that this NIEC Report says that the fact that the targets of the Second Programme were not achieved in that period has nourished cynicism where it already existed?</P>
    <P>I sometimes smile when I hear spokesmen from the Fianna Fáil benches say that Fine Gael are not producing a policy.  There are books produced not by Fianna Fáil but by departments of the civil service, departments that are now spreading all over this city to such an extent that when a question is put down to the Board of Works they do not know where their offices are or who are working in them.  It would take up to next February to calculate the number of these departments.  It is no wonder that people say that the economic situation is deteriorating because the Government have failed to deal effectively and in a competent manner with the problems that affect the country.</P>
    <P>We believe that the people are prepared to make sacrifices and are prepared to pull their weight in a national crisis.  They are prepared to discuss, as many have done.  Many have spent long hours in discussion in a voluntary capacity in industrial organisations, in <Col N="1179" /> trade union circles, in farming organisations and in academic educational services.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable, again possibly not merely through a display of arrogance but ignorance, for many spokesmen to criticise the contribution of religious and teaching orders to education, when much of whatever standard we have achieved would not have been achieved but for these orders.  Some of those who are criticising them would not be where they are today but for these religious orders.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Taoiseach making up for some of the omissions and some of the comments made by Ministers and by people offering comments out of turn, with, I hope, no authority to speak on behalf of Governments or Government Departments.</P>

      <P>In this sort of situation in which an authoritative publication asserts and suggests that there is a failure to participate, we must start at the top.  Government Departments, Ministers, permanent officials, Deputies, we are all there to serve the public, not to dictate to them, and work on behalf of their interests.  This Government have failed to meet the burdens which they should have foreseen and forecast in the Budget and, as a result, we now find additional burdens being put not merely on beer, tobacco, post office charges but heavy <Col N="1180" /> additional burdens on transport users as well and on bread and tea.  Some of these were deferred during the Referendum.  Some of them were in the pipeline.  It is an extraordinary thing that none of them emerged until after the 17th October.</P>

What has happened is that the Minister and the Government have become befogged with big words and all kinds of tautological phrases and they have lost track of the ordinary person.  The plain truth is that this policy has been put into operation and decisions taken without effective and proper consultation with the people affected.  The decision in respect of Cork had to be postponed because of mounting public pressure.  There has now been a loud outcry against the increased bus fares. This situation has developed because the Government failed to plan ahead and failed to examine carefully the whole economy to see where it was going.  There is not any use in Government Ministers saying that other sections of the community should exercise some degree of restraint in formulating demands when the one authority in the country that should set an example, when the one body that has available to it professional, technical and every sort of advice, cannot even present an accurate Budget, not for 12 months but for six months.</P>

      <P>Before six months the figures that have been presented are found to be inaccurate and have been nullified by events, nullified not by external factors, not by a sudden upsurge on the import levies, althoungh undoubtedly there was some variation in these but, in fact, we have had a remarkable growth in exports, a growth in exports secured by our own enterprising industrialists, by farmers <Col N="1181" /> working under difficult circumstances and by the fortuitous advantage of British and other continental travel restrictions, in having here an unprecedented tourist season, a season that according to one estimate will mean a rise in income for the current year of over £10 million.  That is the situation that has fortuitously affected this country and even with that the Government have allowed the economy to get out of order.  We have criticised not merely the lack of consultation and arrogant attitude of the Government to farming organisations, but also their attitude to university and post-primary education and more recently their attitude to the Criminal Justice Bill.  I welcome the conversion of my colleague in Dún Laoghaire-Rath-down, Deputy Andrews, who says he is going to vote against it.</P>

      <P>It is a late conversion. We have an amendment down for weeks, a reasoned amendment rejecting the Second Reading of the Bill and I am quite satisfied that the Bill will not be proceeded with during the lifetime of this Dáil or, if it is, the only thing it will contain will be what we appealed for, new provisions in regard to flick knives.  What is the necessity in this country after almost 50 years of self-government to have more power to control meetings?  In other words, you are only going to have a licence to speak if you are given it by a Fianna Fáil Minister or a Fianna Fáil Government. Mark you, I believe there is a remarkable change in Fianna Fáil.  I think my old friend, Dan Breen, is right, that when The Chief was there no one was allowed to open his mouth and now no one can stop some of them from talking.  There is only this about it, that some of them talk a lot but there is not a great deal in it when you re-read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that our economic situation has been allowed to deteriorate and the impact of the recent British decision is a most serious question.  We expressed, at the time that this agreement was negotiated, a number of reservations. I do not share the view that we should not have trade agreements. <Col N="1182" /> In our time in Government we initiated in 1948 the very advantageous trade agreement of that year with Britain.  We subsequently negotiated agreements with other countries. Our proximity to Britain, our traditional business and economic and trading relations with that country have always made it obvious that we must trade and any other view is completely unrealistic &mdash; the view, for instance, that we can trade with the Laplanders or somebody else on more advantageous terms than we can trade with Britain.  However, the decision to tie ourselves completely by an irrevocable agreement on our initiative was dangerous and had defects and deficiencies which we pointed out when this matter was debated here on the 4th January, 1966.  Since then two matters have occurred that have caused considerable concern.  One was the fact that, despite the negotiation of this agreement during the term of the special import levy that had been imposed, the British Government failed to withdraw that levy until a much later date.</P>
    <P>The serious situation has now arisen that without advance consultation and with the very minimum of notice the British Government have imposed a special import deposit system.  In that trade agreement as in a number of similar agreements it is generally accepted that provision is made in a special clause to allow for action in respect of balance of payments difficulties. It is well accepted; in fact, it is expressly included in this that:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, either party may, consistently with its other international obligations, introduce quantitative restrictions on imports for the purpose of safeguarding its balance of payments.</P>
    <P>That is in Article 18 of the Trade Agreement.  Article 24 defines quantitative restrictions as a collective prohibition or restriction of imports or, as the case may be, of exports where made effective through quotas, licences or other measures with equivalent effect, including administrative measures and requirements.  That is very wide.  It might be regarded as almost of limitless interpretation but there is <Col N="1183" /> also in Article 18 a provision in subparagraph (2) which states that the party who has not taken the measures may propose, at any time, other measures designed to moderate any damaging effect of the restrictions or to assist the other party to overcome its difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach admitted today in reply to a Private Notice Question that the Government regarded this as a breach of the agreement in the spirit, if not in the letter.  We should not be mealy-mouthed about this.  This is a definite breach of the agreement and we are entitled to take countervailing action.  I certainly agree with the view expressed that it is not a matter that we should rush into but we are entitled certainly to consider countervailing action.  Whether announcing in advance what action the Government were going to take here to assist Irish exporters and whether, in fact, by that announcement we did not give way straightaway the bargaining position and the fact that we accepted the British decision on it is another question.</P>
    <P>We must, I think, consider this not merely in the context of what was done on this occasion but of a recent statement by the British Minister of Agriculture.  In this connection again we must take action.  A reply which was given to me by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the House on the 19th instant referred to the British Minister's statement and said it represented a continuance of the established policy of selective expansion which had been followed since 1965. Whether it had been followed or not, is there a breach or is there a conflict with the spirit, if not with the terms of the agreement?  When the Minister spoke yesterday &mdash; I think this is important&mdash;we must consider it in the light of two facts, first, the decision last Friday to operate this special import deposit levy.  We must also consider the decision of the British Minister of Agriculture when he spoke at the Farmers' Club in London on 13th instant.  He said that these agreements were there and that they must honour their obligation but that did not mean that where some regulation was made <Col N="1184" /> to provide greater stability or better phasing of supplies into their market they were precluded from securing this if they went about it in a reasonable and equitable way.  It cannot be suggested that the decision taken the other night with minimum notice and without consultation and, as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in replying to a supplementary question by me, there was no notification or only minimum notification and there was no consultation before this decision was taken, was going about the matter in a reasonable and equitable way.</P>
    <P>This is important under two headings. It is important because of the increased taxes in this Budget in which one of the items to be assisted is the production of beef to the extent of £2 million.  It this selective expansion is operated it could affect the purpose for which we are taxing our people, in order to assist our own farmers to produce in a particular line.  On the other hand, action has already been taken and is foreshadowed in respect of cheese and possibly butter.  There is even a warning on bacon.  If we take that special statement of the Minister of Agriculture in Britain into consideration and the decision of the British Government to impose this import deposit requirement, I believe there is a definite indication that the British Government are unilaterally breaching the agreement which was made.  The country will expect the Taoiseach to indicate in general terms what action it is proposed to take and what decisions the Government have reached on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case &mdash; and in this connection I want to re-emphasise what has been said during the debate &mdash;that we should seek&mdash;and it is the responsibility of the Minister for External Affairs and the Government &mdash;to review and revise our trade agreements with other countries.  In the main, our trade agreements have remained static in a number of cases. It is obvious that the initial case made here that the Free Trade Area Agreement was being negotiated as a prelude to EEC membership is now at best in cold storage if not a very unlikely eventuality.  When the then <Col N="1185" /> Taoiseach recommended this in 1966 he said that the idea of making the Free Trade Agreement with Britain came in the context of certain developments in connection with the European Economic Community.  That situation no longer exists.  At best it is in cold storage and at the worst it is unlikely to occur for a very long time. It is time that we sought a review of the operation of this agreement and had it re-examined in every detail.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unthinkable that an agreement of this sort should be unilaterally repudiated in respect of a very important section and that the Irish people &mdash; in the last analysis it is the Irish taxpayer who will have to pay the interest resulting from this arrangement with the banks &mdash; should be asked to pay a sum of £2.5 million or so depending on the duration of the agreement and the extent to which it will affect our exports.</P>
      <P>Before concluding there is another matter to which I should refer in a debate of this sort because it covers not merely economics but also other questions.  Some criticism has been expressed in a number of quarters of the types of debates conducted in this House and the cross-talk that goes on from different sides, or from all sides at times, and the fact that the behaviour is not always constant with what one would expect from responsible, elected public representatives.  I believe we get respect and attention for the views expressed if Deputies behave in a responsible and dignified way.  I want to say now that I deprecate and repudiate some remarks or behaviour of my colleagues as well as my opponents.  They do not represent my views whether in the Front or other Benches.  If this House is to function in a responsible way and serve the interests of the people we have an obligation to concern ourselves with the nation's problems and the people's interests in that we were sent here to do the nation's business and to serve the people and not to indulge in endless and futile talk about the past or some present matters of headline hunting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> There was an example last week to which I referred earlier, of a constructive, useful debate to which Deputies of all Parties contributed.  Possibly it should never have arisen but the fact that it did arise demonstrated, asserted and vindicated the supremacy of Dáil Éireann.  I believe the people of the country will respect that kind of leadership and responsible direction and that it is because they are not getting it and have not got it that they have not responded.  I am convinced that if they do get it they will give as good a response as any people gave in previous generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal quickly with the main points of criticism that have been made of this Budget and to deal with the circumstances in which it was drawn up.</P>
      <P>I will deal later with the situation which has been caused by the British action in imposing the obligation to deposit certain moneys on the value of imports.  The measures in the Supplementary Budget have been criticised on the grounds that they are more stringent than the balance of payments situation would demand, but the critics have been very careful to avoid giving any indication of the degree of restriction that they themselves would advocate.</P>
      <P>It is likely that, in the current year, there will be a deficit of some £15 million in our balance of payments and, comparing that with a surplus that we enjoyed last year, our position in this respect will have worsened by some £30 million.  The factors which gave rise to the reverse during 1968 are likely to persist during the coming year of 1969.  One of these factors is the large increase in the purchasing power of the people caused by pay rises given in excess of output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the present year there was a substantial increase in consumer spending and a widening of the gap between imports and exports. There are prospects of further pay improvements in 1969 and in many cases these are likely to be out of line with the expected improvement in output. There are various views as to <Col N="1187" /> what our balance of payments deficit is likely to be in 1969 itself.  Our estimate is that, without corrective measures being taken now, this imbalance would probably exceed £50 million and, apart altogether from the fall in our external reserves which would be caused by such a deficit, there would obviously be a lack of confidence, not only by our own people, but by foreign investors, in our resourcefulness.</P>
    <P>We have had several occasions since the Second World War when the balance of payments went so awry that the consequences we had to face were so dangerous and so inimical to our progress that we certainly would want to avoid a recurrence in the future. Everybody will remember the deficit of £61.6 million in 1951.  That was at the end of the first inter-Party period of office.  Everybody will remember, too, the drastic action that had to be taken in 1952, in the first Budget that Fianna Fáil had to face after resuming office, and everybody will remember the £35.5 million deficit in 1955 which led to one of the most serious economic situations that this country has experienced. Again, in 1964, there was a deficit of £31.4 million and in 1965, £41.8 million.</P>
    <P>All these experiences are much too recent to permit anybody in this country to be complacent about their effects.  I might say that we were not on our own because the NIEC in its report on the economy in 1967 and the prospects for 1968 said:</P>
    <P>The progress of the economy should, however, be kept under close and continuous review in the latter half of this year to ensure that any tendency towards the development of an excessive pressure of domestic demand (which could occur if money incomes or public expenditure or credit rose excessively) should be quickly identified and corrected.  If this is not done, the adverse effect could be felt in the first half of 1969 and stronger corrective measures would then become necessary.  The main lesson of 1965/66 is that the occasion for sharp correction should if possible be avoided, because <Col N="1188" /> apart from the economic disruption and hardship created, the loss of growth which it entails is greater than can be recouped in subsequent expansion.  In all of this, of course, we cannot hope to insulate ourselves from events affecting Britain, our principal market.  The fact that determined measures are being undertaken in Britain to hold down costs during 1968 underlines the importance of maintaining a safe relationship between growth in incomes and increases in productivity.</P>
    <P>This was a report signed by every member of the National Industrial Economic Council and these members included names like John Conroy, James Dunne, William J. Fitzpatrick, Fintan Kennedy, Charles McCarthy, Donal Nevin and Dominic F. Murphy. I am singling these out to indicate that whatever arguments one might make for increased wages to offset the increased cost of living, these men recognised that increased wages must be met by commensurate increases in output.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggested that no intimation whatever was given of the Government's prognostications of the situation, certainly not until after the referendum.  However, I would remind Deputy Corish of a speech that I made at the ninth conference of Cumann na nInnealtóiri on 26th September, 1968, in which I highlighted most of these things.  This was, in fact, three weeks before the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I said and I quote:</P>
      <P>In any event, there have been developments in recent months on the salaries and wages front to which I shall refer later which make any complacency quite out of place. These are pushing up our costs to dangerous levels and have very disquieting implications for our balance of payments position unless they can be matched by increased productivity.</P>
      <P>Further on, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments just now on the <Col N="1189" /> wages and salaries front have to be seen in this context.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is the context of productivity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The current round of increases has resulted, in very many cases, in increases that are beyond the projected and potential growth in national output.  What is worse, a dangerous bidding up of claims has now shown itself.  In his Budget statement the Minister for Finance stressed that, if excessive spending were generated during the year, corrective action, which is never palatable or popular would have to be taken.</P>
    <P>This speech was headed in the newspapers by headings like &ldquo;Mini-Budget on the Way&rdquo;, &ldquo;Autumn Budget&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supplementary Budget&rdquo;.  These were the kind of headings that I intended to generate as a result of that speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I got some credit from people who realised that I had the courage to say it three weeks in advance of the referendum.  Each of the last two speakers, Deputies Corish and Cosgrave, seemed to suggest that we did nothing unpopular before the referendum and that we let all the troubles pile up and then loaded them on to the people; but I might say in respect of recent increases, CIE increases for example, the request came in the last couple of weeks.  Certainly, this was after the decision on the referendum was taken by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what I want to say is that no economic commentator would have suggested that the Government could have stood by and let events drift without making some attempt to meet and mitigate their effects.  The Government were faced with a large excess of current expenditure over revenue in 1968-69.  The principal item responsible was the £9 million estimated increase in public service pay.  At the time the Budget was introduced, the 11th round had barely got under way. There was no indication as to the extent of the increases that might be given and I think it would be irresponsible for the Government to earmark <Col N="1190" /> a sum that would indicate to all and sundry what kind of an increase there might be.  This £9 million is the equivalent, for public servants, of the 11th round pay increase which people in private industry and private employment have got, and it means a rise for all branches of the public service: the Army, the Garda, civil servants including postmen, forestry workers and so on.  None of the Government's critics suggested that these people should be denied the 11th round that has been granted by and large.</P>
    <P>The other large item comprising the excess was one of £6 million which was made available for the improvement, directly or indirectly, of farmers' incomes.  Again, none of those who criticised the imposition of taxes to meet these sums indicated that they should not be made available.  In reference to a remark by Deputy John A.  Costello last week, that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries disclosed a Budget secret by announcing here the increases that were being made available for farmers in the price of milk and the announcement of the beef incentive scheme, let me say, that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made that speech here with my encouragement, with my knowledge and my full permission.  There was no suggestion whatever of disclosure of what was contained in the Budget statement.  As everybody knows, the Minister had invited both farmers' organisations to come and discuss these two very matters with him, but they refused to do so.  The Minister then brought the proposals to the Government, and the Government gave him permission not only to introduce the scheme and to increase the price of milk but to announce them as well.  There was no question whatever of prior disclosure of the budgetary provisions.</P>
    <P>I may say, too, that this time last year our much-criticised Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was fighting a hard battle very successfully for which he got very little credit.  I refer to the maintenance of the health of the cattle of this country and keeping out foot and mouth disease.  Thanks <Col N="1191" /> be to God, he was so thorough and so knowledgeable about every aspect of that problem that he was entirely successful.</P>
    <P>Instead of imposing taxes, we could, perhaps, have raised the extra money which was required, by borrowing, but this would obviously have only added fuel to the inflationary fire that was already raging and would have put our balance of payments in even greater jeopardy.  Instead of doing this we took what I believe was the course of sound reasoning by increasing the taxation on the less essential consumption goods, by restricting hire-purchase credit, by earmarking bank credit for productive purposes and by introducing new incentives to encourage people to save rather than to spend.</P>
    <P>There have been some press comments&mdash;I must say, rather few&mdash;to the effect that the Government should have accelerated out of the difficult situation before 1969 and that, by pressing on the pedal and pushing expenditure above the danger limit, we could have reached 1969 and 1970 in a burst of speed and prosperity.  That would be a rather tempting prospect for a Government which is in the last 18 months of office.  We could have faced the people in just such a burst of speed and prosperity without indicating to the people that the day of reckoning was around the corner.  We would, as the Government, have had to face a day of reckoning ourselves, or, if we failed to secure office, blame the incoming Government for failure to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Instead of so pressing forward, however, we decided to introduce these moderate restrictions.  Instead of accelerating to the point of getting into danger, we decided that we should, as a prudent and responsible Government, effect the necessary remedies now rather than face 1970 in the certainty of the kind of recession we suffered in 1957.  It has been suggested that one can spend one's way out of economic difficulties and out of an economic recession.  That, perhaps, is quite acceptable in certain circumstances, the theory being that by deliberate injection of purchasing power we generaate <Col N="1192" /> demand and therefore give an impetus to increased activity.  However, where inflation is not only already present but is very much in prospect in the future, what is needed is a curbing of demand, and I think no economist worthy of the name would seriously advocate spending one's way out of an inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>None of the critics of the Government's financial measures tried to contest the basic facts of the present situation or deny that there were economic difficulties.  If the facts are correct and if inflationary tendencies exist in the economy and if they continue uncorrected, then they could cause a sharp disimprovement in our balance of payments next year.  Therefore, the responsible course of action for any Government to take is to introduce certain moderate restraints now so as to avoid a worse position in a few months' time.</P>
    <P>The Government, undoubtedly risked political unpopularity because of our conviction that a moderate check now to inflationary forces was the best way of ensuring continuous and steady growth in the years to come.  We took the decision after very carefully weighing up all the economic factors and, as well, after considering the best advice we could obtain from inside and outside the public service.  I do not think we are doing too much.  We do not anticipate that the measures that have been announced will cause any economic setback or depression.  We expect, on the contrary, that the growth rate will be at least four per cent in 1969, almost as good as it was in 1968 and, indeed, in 1967.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said we are slaves to book economics and are forgetting altogether about raising the level of employment.  I should like to refer to the very recently published figures which were circulated to Deputies in the last week or so, the <i>Quarterly Industrial Inquiry</i> for the June quarter of 1968.  These figures indicate that the level of employment in transportable goods industries now stands at 189,900, and that is the highest ever; and that the volume of production in the period since the June quarter, 1967, increased by some 10 per cent.  The <Col N="1193" /> figure of almost 190,000 in employment in the transportable goods industries is an increase of some 3,700 over last year.  I am not suggesting that that is a sufficient increase, but I should not like Deputies to go away with the impression that employment is static; it is increasing in these industries over the past few years.</P>
    <P>However, with the measures that we have taken if we find that a satisfactory rate of growth is not continuing and, if we find that we have to ease off, then that can be done readily because we can very quickly relax the restraints we have imposed.  In recent years we have been advised by international organisations like the OECD and the International Monetary Fund that there was need for more flexible use of the Budget as an instrument of demand management policy.  I think the introduction of the supplementary Budget now rather than postponing fiscal action until the end of the financial year is in full accordance with this kind of advice and it avoids the Government's having to rely unduly on monetary measures to ease those pressures of demand.</P>
    <P>Somebody suggested that the tax increases and other restrictions we have introduced are excessive because they will in the current year yield £4 million and in a full year £15.4 million plus of course the £3.7 million to £4 million from post office increases.  I think it is well to remember that out of every £10 million of new purchasing power about £4 million is spent on imports and, therefore, the converse also is true.  Clearly if we withdraw £10 million purchasing power the effect as far as the balance of payments is concerned will only be £4 million or so.</P>
    <P>Somebody put forward a suggestion that more stringent hire-purchase controls would have been adequate.  This suggestion completely ignores the fact that hire-purchase in any one year accounts for only £7 million or £8 of new credit.  Even if hire-purchase were stopped altogether this would obviously do very little to redress our balance of payments.  The hire-purchase restraints we have imposed are part, even though a small part, of a <Col N="1194" /> package of restraints whose total effect can be expected to take some millions off next year's otherwise excessive balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>Critics of the Budget from the economic standpoint assert, without any attempt to establish their assertion, that it is too deflationary and that tax increases should have been milder but accompanied by greater credit restraint. Nobody who has put forward this point of view has addressed himself to the question of what exactly can be done now with regard to the balance of payments in 1969.  The critics appear to concede that without some corrective measures or correcting action the deficit would be excessive but they do not say by how many millions.  Nevertheless, if they concede that the balance of payments has to be reduced by £10 million and accept the example I have given a few moments ago that for every £10 million generated £4 million is spent on imports, then it must be accepted that a purchasing power reduction of £2 million would save roughly £1 million on imports.  Therefore, measured in this rough way, the supplementary Budget might be taken as really the reduction of balance of payments deficit in 1969 by about £8 million and nobody can regard this as excessive.</P>
    <P>To advocate credit restrictions as the only form of corrective action that should be taken is, I suggest, only a form of escapism.  It is scarcely credible that there should be a general credit restriction.  It is generally accepted all over the world, at the present time, that credit restriction is a crude form of restraint and often most unpredictable in its effects.  Sometimes it tends to go too far and even to strike at the very root of growth.  I do not think it could be applied with the delicacy that is needed to differentiate between productive and less productive forms of investment.  In any case, at least as much cutting back would be needed in this area as through taxation to produce the desired effect on the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The choice facing the economy was between, on the one hand, maintaining steady growth and, on the other, achieving for a year or so an unsustainably <Col N="1195" /> higher rate of growth in production which would be followed inevitably by a serious recession.  We have chosen steady growth and we have decided not in any way to allow our economy slide again into recession.  Monetary restraint now will help to ensure a sustained and steady rate of growth.  It will help to ensure that we will not have to encounter again the problems in unemployment that we had to surmount in 1957.</P>
    <P>Some people say nothing should be done&mdash;that we should have drawn on reserves.  I think it was Deputy Corish who said this.  I gave the Government's attitude to drawing upon reserves during the course of my reply to the no confidence debate.  I would like to say in respect of what Deputy Corish said about the reserves in the countries he referred to such as Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Holland and some other fairly powerful countries&mdash;such as Germany&mdash;that they confine their reserves to about 30 per cent or so of their yearly imports.  I think the Deputy had in mind what are described as official reserves plus commercial reserves. If we use the second basis, then we would be very much in line with other countries.  Our official reserves would be about three or four months purchase of our requirements from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish can come back at me again if I am wrong. In any event a small country like ours which is open to extreme trading vicissitudes, as we are every day, would need much bigger reserves than the very big trading countries with very high gross national products and these we are now very happy to have. <Col N="1196" /> France is an example of what happens when reserves are permitted to run down.  They ran down there whether they liked it or not.  They fell from about 6,000 million dollars to about half that amount and thereby caused not only a crisis in France but a world crisis.  In any event, the psychological effect of that development affects the world generally and we must keep our balance of payments in a healthy state to avoid a serious setback here. We maintain reserves at a healthy level because it is prudent to do so.</P>
      <P>The rightness of the Government decision to act in this way was borne out by developments in the past few weeks and by additional evidence of inflation coming to hand since the supplementary Budget was introduced. The trade returns for October, which were published a couple of weeks ago show a further big rise in imports and in our trade deficit generally.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that we should take no one month's figures in isolation in this respect and draw conclusions from them.  Nevertheless, when these figures recur month by month over a period, then I think a deficit could arise that no responsible Government should ignore.  It would be tempting for a Government to ignore the certainty and to save itself the unpopularity which this kind of corrective action inevitably brings with it.  The Government know that the job of governing the economy is delicate and crucial and that it must be tackled in good time with courage and care. The Government know that the price of delay, negligence or indifference is a balance of payments crisis which would set back confidence, promote a calamitous downturn in economic development and cause a reduction in employment.  This is a price which this Government are certainly not willing to pay.  We are certainly not willing to permit a situation to develop such as existed in this country in 1957, a situation causing the gravest financial economic crisis that this State has known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say that the Government have drawn considerable encouragement from the success of the recent <Col N="1197" /> national loan.  I think that success was a reward for prudent management&mdash; reward to a Government prepared to take their responsibilities in a serious way.  I think that success was a reward to a Government who were prepared to take, whatever the consequential unpopularity, the measures we introduced. I think that success indicated that the people were prepared to invest in a Government which they saw was acting in such a responsible manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and some other Deputies alleged that the Government are adopting a dishonest budgetary policy.  They suggested we are imposing more additional taxation now than is really needed in order, as they suggest, to build up a strong financial position so that, in the Budget of next year, we can hand out benefits to all and sundry without imposing additional taxation.  I do not think any one of those who made such assertions can have taken the trouble to do the most elementary budgetary arithmetic.  First of all, the amount we require in order to have a balance in the current Budget, that is for 1968-69, is something in the region of £11 million.  The taxation that we imposed will, in this year, <Col N="1198" /> bring in something slightly over £4 million.  That will leave a deficit of the order of £7 million.  I think this can hardly be described as building up a strong financial position for the end of the fiscal year and for the Budget of the spring of next year.  I gave some indications of the prospect for next year as far as expenditure is concerned when I introduced these Financial Resolutions a few weeks ago.  I said that the extra taxation would produce an estimated £15.4 million extra revenue next year.  I also gave the following increases in expenditure next year over this year as an illustration of the growth of outlay.  I said that we would require an extra £9 million for Central Fund services; an extra £8 million for Agriculture; an extra £5½ million for Education; an extra £2½ million for Social Welfare and an extra £2 million for Health.  These are merely the principal items, and not the total sums of all the items that will increase although they amount, in all, to about £27 million.  Total Government expenditure on other services is likely to go up as well.  That has been the experience since the State was founded. I do not think there is any likelihood that this trend will not continue into 1969 and 1970.</P>
      <P>Another major item that we now have to reckon with, of course, is the cost of reimbursing the banks the interest they would otherwise lose in the support they are giving to our exporters: I shall refer to that later.  However, much of the Government expenditure involved is paid out in the form of salaries and wages to civil servants, to gardaí, to the defence forces, and the growth in the salary bill has been a very important factor in the increase in the expenditure.  Many of the grants that have to be made to local authorities contain also a very large element of salaries.</P>
      <P>Another important contribution, of course, is the rising expenditure on the service of public debt.  Our capital programme has expended spectacularly. That programme&mdash;in conditions of rising costs&mdash;contributes to the general increase that is taking place. The devaluation of sterling has added further to that burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> There is very little that we can do to control these expenditures.  No Government will cut back and reduce the salaries of public servants to a point lower than that which is available in outside employment.  Very few Governments would cut back on productive capital investment.  No Government will welsh on its obligations to pay the interest due on the money required for capital purposes.  The other increases in expenditure can, perhaps, be attributable to policies more amenable to Government control.  I refer to the substantial outlays on Education, Health, Social Welfare, Agriculture, Transport and Industry.  I certainly, as Head of the Government, make no apology to anybody for the level of our expenditure in those fields.  In fact, I challenge any Opposition Deputy to indicate where, and by how much, expenditure under any of these headings can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate, many Opposition speakers have mentioned the increases in the price of electricity, transport, bread, beer, spirits, tea and so on.  These increases are attributable to a number of causes, the primary cause, in the cases of transport and electricity, being the cost of increased wages.  That must be obvious to everybody. In the case of an undertaking such as CIE or the ESB, if wages go up then the cost of the product they produce or the services they give must also increase.  That is as plain as the nose on a person's face.  There is no point in decrying, on the one hand, the low level of wages and, on the other hand, in advocating increased wages and then, again, decrying the increased costs which are directly consequential on the increased wages.</P>
    <P>In some cases, there were external factors, such as currency devaluation, over which we had no control.  That applies to tea and to other commodities. Then there was an increase in the price of bread.  Everybody was clamouring for better conditions.  The farmers got better prices by reason of greater production.  That had to be paid for either by increasing the price of <Col N="1200" /> bread or taxation, or both, as, in fact, the case was.</P>
    <P>Some price increases represent extra taxation.  The need to give public servants the kind of pay increases that others have got and the need to give farmers the guaranteed price supports for this year's record production of milk and wheat, all necessitated extra taxation.  There have been suggestions that the additional taxation might be regarded as justifying another round of pay increases.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to those who put forward this idea that they are doing the trade unions, the workers themselves and the country no good in advocating such action.  A further round of pay increases now would bring about a two-way worsening of the position&mdash;increasing imports because of the greater spending power generated and reducing exports because of making our products less competitive especially in conditions where Britain, our main customer, and other countries are taking steps to reduce their imports, to hold down wages and costs generally.</P>
    <P>We all know that, if unit costs are increased and if our wage costs rise faster than those in other countries, then our whole economy is in jeopardy because the advance of our economy is, and must be, based largely on our exports. This is particularly relevant at the present time when the British are imposing severe restraints on domestic consumption and imports and are limiting wage increases to levels justified by rises in productivity.  These measures obviously will create great difficulty for our exports to Britain&mdash; exports that are very important not only to our economic growth but to our industrial expansion generally.  Inflationary pay rises now would really add to these difficulties and would lead, almost inevitably, to a significant reduction in our total exports and in our level of employment as well.  I suggest therefore that irresponsible comment about wage increases should be discouraged by everybody, by the Press the Opposition Parties and the trade unions themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a suggestion&mdash; perhaps he made it in good faith but I <Col N="1201" /> rather expect he made it with his tongue in his cheek&mdash;that an import levy on luxury consumer goods would be a more appropriate way of reducing our imports bill.  The weakness in this suggestion is, of course, that the kind of luxury consumer goods on which you can put a levy form a very small part of our total imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It worked in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1956?  Yes, it covered a fairly wide range of imports but, as Deputy Dillon will remember, it was accompanied by a very marked downward trend in employment and production.  The Deputy will remember that there were almost 100,000 people signing on at the employment exchanges throughout the country at the end of that year.  That action dealt a severe blow to our economy generally and I do not think the Deputy can suggest that this is the kind of remedy we should apply now.  The range of goods on which we imposed a levy in 1965 represented only about ten per cent of our total imports.  Because of the improved standard of living, goods that might have been regarded as luxuries in 1956-57 were regarded as essential in 1965.  Hence the reduction in the range of goods covered by the 1965 levy.  In 1968, I think that range would have to be considerably further reduced.  Therefore the imposition of an import levy on a small range of goods would not have any significant effects on our balance of payments and, in addition, it would bring with it the difficulty of restricting people's choice, importers' choice and manufacturers' choice of raw materials and services.  The Government have, therefore, decided to employ fiscal methods rather than import restrictions in order to abate the unduly fast rate at which purchasing power has been increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that he would like our national loans to be linked with the cost-of-living index so as to protect the savings of investors against the effects of inflation.  He mentioned that this was done in Finland but the Finns have desisted from this practice because of its inflationary effects and the experience there would scarcely encourage us to introduce such an experiment <Col N="1202" /> here.  I should like to say this about Deputy Dillon's comments generally in regard to the rate of interest payable on national loans: the Opposition Parties made their usual comment when the national loan was announced but this was the first occasion on which I ever heard a Deputy undermining a national loan while the lists were still open.  I deprecate Deputy Dillon's action in this respect very, very much. I do not know whether he made it deliberately or otherwise but, thanks be to God, whatever he tried to do had no effect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman made a number of references to the harmful effects which he believed the increase in the rate of wholesale tax would have on the exports of our manufactured goods.  He seems to have overlooked the fact that exports are not affected by wholesale tax.  Deputy Governey and Deputy Donegan made some comments in this regard as well. Deputy Governey said, in respect of building generally, that sand and lime were the only building materials outside the scope of the tax.  In fact, most basic building materials are exempt. Deputy Dunne stated that the increase in the rate of the wholesale tax would cause the cost of the gallon of petrol to rise by threepence.  I should like to emphasise that this tax does not apply to petrol at all.  I suppose that Deputy Dunne knew that but thought it was a good point to make.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also implied that tools and equipment for manufacturing industry would be hit. The Deputy with his wide knowledge <Col N="1203" /> of industry&mdash;I understand that he is the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;must know that industrialists who are registered are completely exempt from tax on tools and equipment. The Deputy will come to realise this when he reads more of the speeches that he should read.</P>
      <P>Another point that was made by the Opposition was that the Budget introduced last April was inadequate, that not enough taxation was imposed, but apart from the usual complaints about it not having imagination or that it was not progressive enough, that Budget was generally regarded as being adequate for the situation as it appeared at that time.  Most commentators accepted the point made by the Minister that, if large uncovered liabilities should arise, he would have to impose additional taxation.  I suggest that most Opposition Deputies knew and understood this as well.</P>
      <P>While I am talking about the Opposition's comments I might refer at this stage to something that Senator Garret FitzGerald said with regard to the kind of action that should be taken.  He was speaking in the Seanad on Friday, 12th of July last and at column 1417 of the Official Report of the Seanad he said:</P>
      <P>The mistake made by every Government in this country so far has been to wait too long and then to act too severely.  I think that is a fair description of what happened in this country in 1947, in 1951, in 1955 and indeed in 1965.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it was highly successful in that we emerged from the economic difficulties that enveloped the whole world much quicker than any other country.  Let me proceed with Senator FitzGerald's quotations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On each occasion, action was postponed too long and then the action required was correspondingly more <Col N="1204" /> severe and, in each case, the action was more severe than was needed. We know that now with hindsight. At the time it seemed right.  However, each Government in this country has tended to make the same mistake.  If there is even a sign of inflationary pressures, if there is anything that begins to be worrying, I hope the Minister for Finance will not be afraid to cut back.  If our growth rate is five per cent in the current year it may help to have that slightly moderated.  It is better to be wise in time, and take action in time, than to let things go too far too long.</P>

      <P>There are certain things I want to put on the record. During the past few weeks we have heard many suggestions of a general nature in this House, in the public press and elsewhere, as to what the Government should have done or should not have done in face of the present and the prospective state of the economy.  None of the critics has ever denied that there is a problem. All, however, pretend that the particular treatment they favour would be painless.  To say the least of it, this is naive.  If an inflationary situation is to be kept under control, kept from getting out of hand and from causing serious damage in the long run, then there has to be a lessening of excess purchasing power.  That, of course, does not take place without the shoe pinching somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special import levies, monetary or fiscal measures, may be adopted.  Their object is control, that kind of control <Col N="1205" /> which will contain the tendency to expand too quickly.  Such control is bound of its very nature to affect trends and expectations in certain sectors of the economy and it just makes no sense to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the events of the last couple of days, deal with the implications for the Irish economy and outline the course of action we propose to take.  First of all, despite what Deputy Corish said, we are, I think, entitled to take some credit for our timely action in this respect.  We are entitled to take credit for introducing remedial measures in time, measures of a nature designed to protect our own economy in the face of the present western world economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>We are a small country and I do not think we could expect our vulnerable economy to survive undamaged unless we took the right action.  We cannot immunise ourselves against adverse world trends.  Had we not taken the action we did a couple of weeks ago we would now be driven to taking more serious action, perhaps, and we would probably be accused, and quite rightly, of &ldquo;doing too little, and too late&rdquo;.  In fact, we would probably be described as being &ldquo;just too late&rdquo;. We acted in good time.  We read the signs correctly.  The Government have advice open to them.  The Government are bound to look around for information. That we did and we are, I think, entitled to take some credit for it.</P>

      <P>These recent developments obviously call for comment because of their implications for us and for our plans of continued economic expansion.  I have in mind particularly the international monetary crisis <Col N="1206" /> and, more particularly, the measures taken by Britain to reduce imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>We took advice from inside and outside the Civil Service, as we are entitled to do.  That is what we are bound to do in the interests of our economy, instead of turning our backs on it as, apparently, Labour would have done.</P>
      <P>If one can assume that the arrangements made last week with regard to the deutschemark and the franc will last, then what has occurred will not greatly affect Ireland's position in relation to those currencies, at any rate. The old parities will remain.  Nothing is changed so far as the franc is concerned except that the internal restrictive measures will probably affect, to some extent, our export potential to that country and the growing tourist business we have been getting from France.</P>
      <P>The German export tax of four per cent will make our imports from Germany correspondingly dearer, but our exports to Germany will have the advantage of a corresponding reduction in the rate of import duty.  It is certain, therefore, that our exports to Germany will have a better chance of competing successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British measures have by far the greater implication for us.  As the House is aware, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced these new measures on Friday last, measures designed to reduce demand and imports in Britain.  These measures include increased taxation designed to have the maximum effect on consumption&mdash; taxation much more severe than we <Col N="1207" /> saw fit to impose and this in a country with a huge economy, an economy which might reasonably be expected to withstand the impact of world conditions better than we could.  Secondly, there is a general and severe curtailment of credit and, thirdly, and much more important, there is the imposition of import deposits.  The measures designed to reduce demand by the imposition of higher taxes and the curtailment of credit will, of course, tend to reduce the flow of imports to Britain.  These are virtually impossible for us to counter so far as our exports to the British market are concerned. The import deposit scheme means that, before British importers can obtain clearance of goods through customs, they must make an interestfree deposit with the British Customs equivalent to 50 per cent of the value of the imported goods.  The period for which this deposit must be lodged is six months from the time of clearance.  The deposit must be paid on imports of manufactured goods. There are certain exemptions&mdash;for example, food, feedingstuffs, oil and oil products and raw materials.  However, because of the severe curtailment of credit in Britain, the deposit requirements must be expected to create great difficulties for British importers in obtaining the necessary finances to maintain their purchases from other countries.  The deposit requirement could, therefore, have a very serious effect on Irish exports.  It could affect, in c.i.f. terms, about £100 million worth of Irish manufactured goods, or nearly one-third of Ireland's total exports to all destinations.  This would, I think, constitute the highest proportion of any country's exports to Britain; in other words, the proportion is much higher in our case than it is in that of any other country.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the direct purpose of this import deposit scheme is to reduce imports.  It runs counter, therefore, to the declared object of the Free Trade Area Agreement, which is:</P>
    <P>To expand mutual trade and, to that end, to eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce <Col N="1208" /> on substantially all that trade:</P>
    <P>In our view, therefore, this scheme conflicts with the spirit, if not the letter, of the Free Trade Area Agreement and should have been the subject, not of prior notification, but of prior consultation. This, as I said earlier today, did not happen.  The case for consultation appears to be all the stronger when account is taken of the very high proportion of our total export trade which is affected.  As the Dáil is aware, I have sought an early meeting with the British Prime Minister and I intend, without prejudice, to tell him of the steps we have taken to help our exporters, and to try to persuade the British Government to remove these restrictions so far as we are concerned, and to make them fully aware of how we regard their action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the imports deposit scheme is due to come into operation tomorrow and we could not afford to await the outcome of this meeting with the British Prime Minister, I decided to take the action which we regard as necessary to sustain and expand the present level of the export of the products affected.  I issued a statement yesterday outlining the action we propose to take to assist our exporters to maintain the flow of trade. As I said in the statement, discussions have taken place between the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Banks Standing Committee and following those, the Irish banks have prepared a scheme to assist exporters by providing funds to obviate the difficulties which British importers may have in making the necessary deposits with the British customs.  This difficulty of course, is increased by the reduction of the availability of credit which accompanied the other measures taken by the British Chancellor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said also in that statement, the Government will compensate the banks directly from public funds for the loss of interest which the scheme will entail.  No liability will therefore fall on the Irish exporters for either the principal or interest.  Details of the operation of the scheme are being worked out at present with all possible <Col N="1209" /> speed and full particulars will be announced at the earliest possible moment.  At this point I should like to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Banks Standing Committee, Mr. Don Carroll, and to all his banking colleagues for being not only helpful but most resourceful in devising and developing, at extremely short notice, simple and efficient financial arrangements to assist Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>I hope the prompt action taken by the Government and the banks will encourage exporters to make every effort to overcome these latest obstacles to the maintenance and expansion of our export trade, particularly by increasing their sales to markets other than Britain.  The Government are urgently examining ways of helping exporters through Córas Tráchtála and other Government agencies to strengthen their selling arrangements in those markets.  Given the necessary energy and resourcefulness on the part of everyone concerned&mdash;and the Government have given and will continue to give a vigorous lead in this respect&mdash;I am confident that it is within our capacity to make good any losses we may suffer as a result of the latest British measures</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the arrangements we have made for dealing with the British import deposit will not interfere in any way with the normal credit facilities for exports and for domestic activity of a productive nature.  Indeed, the Government are determined to do everything possible to maintain a high level of domestic production and employment in the year ahead.  We will be concerned&mdash; and I think it is important to say this &mdash;to ensure that the general effect of the British restrictions will not be too severe on our own producers and will not push our balance of payments too far into the red.  If that happened we would certainly have to consider countervailing action and we would not hesitate to do what would be necessary.</P>
    <P>In preparing the recent budgetary measures the Government had foreseen the possibility that developments in the United Kingdom would create difficulties <Col N="1210" /> for our balance of payments.  Here I should like to refer Deputies to the speech I made to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 24th October, a month ago.  Again I am not claiming any prophetic powers except to say we had been keeping our eyes on the situation.  By ensuring that we ourselves did not incur a large budgetary deficit and allow personal consumption to grow at too fast a rate, we have taken the necessary steps to avoid difficulties emerging in the balance of payments in the months ahead as a result of excessive domestic pressures.  The course of events over the past few days strongly confirms the wisdom of our action and must surely persuade even our most persistent critics that what has been done is in the best national interest.</P>
    <P>While the external developments of the past few days are worrying there is, nevertheless, no reason why we should give way to despondency.  Thanks to the Government's careful management of external reserves in recent years these should be large enough to cope with a temporary widening of the gap on external account.  It is fortunate that we did not listen to those who suggested that our external reserves should be run down.  Had we done so we would now have no option but to cut back home demand with consequent repercussions on growth and employment.</P>
    <P>Besides the satisfactory level of our reserves, the policy of diversification which the Government have pursued over the past 12 months has added to their value.  We now hold much more gold and non-sterling reserves, including credits with the International Monetary Fund and Deutschemarks. Besides, under the recent agreement with the British Government, most of our official sterling holdings are guaranteed in value against any change in the exchange rate between the £ and the US dollar.  There is no question but that the Government's diversification policy has been fully justified by the continued unsettled state of the foreign exchanges.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there are a couple of matters to which I would like to <Col N="1211" /> refer.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke again about the arrogance of the Government. For some reason he brought in the recent debate&mdash;to prove his point &mdash;on the motion put forward by the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to the conflict between two officials, the Secretary of the Department of Justice and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not want to see any official isolated as the Secretary of the Department of Justice seems to have been in the past few weeks.  Every official acts under the authority of his Minister and no doubt Mr. Berry acted under this authority on this occasion.  He believed in the rightness of what he was doing and had the Minister's direct approval for it.</P>
    <P>The practice in these cases has been to show the files, if necessary in confidence, to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General put forward the claim that he was entitled to examine the administrative efficiency of Government Departments. Mr. Berry disputed that with him.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has since stated that he is entitled to examine any wastefulness that emerges because of the lack of administrative efficiency.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in commenting on this is to make it clear that this Government will not let down a civil servant and isolate him in the course of doing his duty as he sees fit.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the increase in our tourist business was fortuitous.  All the bad things happen because of the Government's <Col N="1212" /> arrogance and we are not entitled to claim credit for something good.  Certainly so far as our export trade has expanded this has been achieved mainly by Government encouragement and by assistance from Government schemes.  I think that Deputy Cosgrave or any member of his Party cannot comment with any great effect on this expansion because everybody knows they opposed it in years gone by.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave deprecated the kind of comment his colleagues made in the course of this debate and in recent debates.  He cannot escape responsibility for this.  He started it in the debate of &ldquo;no confidence.&rdquo; He encouraged it to continue right through this debate.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to two specific aspects of the debate.  One is the comment made by Deputy Lindsay in relation to the failure of Deputy L'Estrange to make in public or to an authorised officer of the Garda Síochána a statement he made in this House.  Deputy Lindsay said he made information available to me ten years ago which led to a criminal prosecution. I quote what he said at column 75 of the Report of the proceedings of the 12th November:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave him information over ten years ago on what related to a criminal charge; I gave him accurate information; I gave him information of full evidential value and how did he use it?  He was the relevant Minister and he used it, with the collective authority of the Government to which he belonged, to instruct their then Attorney General to ask the district justice to refuse informations at a time when the district justice <Col N="1213" /> was going to return the accused for trial.</P>
    <P>This case involved the selling of wool to Gaeltarra Éireann.  As a result of whatever information Deputy Lindsay made available at that time I caused an investigation to be made during the course of which statements were taken from many witnesses and these statements formed the basis of a prosecution against an individual of the firm in Dublin.  The case was based mainly on the statement of one witness.  It was based legally on intent to defraud. That one witness, having made a certain statement, after several days of the hearing in the district court withdrew that statement and made a completely different statement to the police officer in charge of the investigation who duly reported it to the senior counsel for the prosecution.  I will make his name available and Deputy Lindsay can consult him if he likes&mdash;Mr. Justice Brian Walsh of the Supreme Court.  He, having considered the new statement made by that witness, informed the Attorney General that on that evidence there was no prospect whatever of the prosecution succeeding. He asked the Attorney General's permission to withdraw the case and enter an <i>nolle prosequi</i> before the district justice.  There was no question of any interference with the course of justice. I have no knowledge whatever what the counsel for the prosecution advised the Attorney General.  I had no knowledge whatever, at the time, of the Attorney General's decision. Deputy Lindsay ought to have known that as a practising barrister.  He ought to have known that no district justice would permit a case to be withdrawn where the evidence was sufficiently strong.  It was only after full advice from the district justice involved and without interference with the Attorney General that the case was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The other matter is the charge made by Deputy Dillon in the House.  This is the kind of contribution that Deputy Cosgrave deprecated a few minutes ago.  These charges are of a general nature and are demeaning not only to the House but to anybody who makes them.  Anybody can make a charge of a general nature.  I admire the stand <Col N="1214" /> Deputy M.P. Murphy took after that accusation on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what Deputy Dillon said at column 338:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to ask him now so that he will have an opportunity of answering it categorically to the House and to the country: is it true, what is popularly believed throughout the country, that Members of his Government have been speculating in lands and making large personal fortunes as a result of their speculation? This question needs to be answered because I can assure him that I have been approached by bankers, architects, prominent members of the solicitors' profession and prominent members of the auctioneers' and valuers' profession and challenged as to why that fact is not ventilated in Dáil Éireann and clarified for the people at large.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon ventilated but he did not clarify.  He made a general charge trying to denigrate the reputation of Ministers individually or collectively. I want to say categorically that no member of this Government has been in any way involved in land speculation. One Minister recently sold a house in which he lived for several years and bought another to which there was also attached some land. That land is in no way earmarked for housing development.  Deputy Dillon came in with his acknowledged eloquence and all his experience and said in one breath that he was a champion of democracy while, at the same time, he denigrated the attitude and conduct of subversive elements which abused decent people.  That is the kind of charge which is being bandied around &mdash;denigrating the Government and shouting &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; at them without any proof.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the solicitors, bankers, prominent members of the auctioneering profession or architects are.  I do not know where Deputy Dillon heard these slanders or heard these people who are mud-slingers and slanderers.  They live in some protection and can try to bring down the reputations of members of Government and try to be as subversive as the people that Deputy Dillon deprecates <Col N="1215" /> himself.  Deputy Dillon by his own acknowledgment is a defender of democracy.  He is being equally subversive and equally damaging to the democracy of this House by making these general charges here.  It is time they were contradicted.  There are very few members of this or any other Government who, having left office, were the richer for it.  On the contrary, many people who left this House were in dire straits.  We have ample proof of that, at the present time, unfortunately.  I do not think I need say more about the matter.  This kind of charge has been coming from Fine Gael for a long time, especially on the eve of elections.  It came during all the by-elections in which I was engaged since I became Taoiseach.  I challenged them to withdraw or prove their charges.  They come and repeat them time and time again.  It is the lowest form of political activity and is beneath contempt.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer.  We have come through a difficult period.  We have read the signs well.  We must recognise that we, in this country, cannot avoid the repercussions of international situations, especially the repercussions of inflationary tendencies and recessions.  By foresight and courageous measures we have taken in time the kind of action that <Col N="1216" /> will ensure that our economy can continue to expand at a steady rate.  We must recognise that we are a small country and that we live mainly on what we can earn abroad.  If we look for too much by way of pay increases, Irish industry will be made less competitive. I believe that everybody recognises the position in which we find ourselves at the present time.  Everybody who will be honest with himself will recognise that this is not a time for complacency.  This is a time, more than ever, for ensuring that everybody will work to the fullest extent of his ability. Everybody will have to examine his or her own conscience to this extent to ensure that he or she is putting at least as much into his or her work and into the economy as he or she is taking out of it.</P>
    <P>With an honest approach to these problems, with the kind of guidance the Government are giving, with the kind of management the Government are giving in relation to our national affairs, there is no reason for despondency; we can look to the future with confidence and, as a result of the measures we have taken now, that we have debated at length, we can look to 1969 to be as good a year as 1967 and 1968.</P>
