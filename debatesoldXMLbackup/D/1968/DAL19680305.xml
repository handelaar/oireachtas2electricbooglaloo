      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the disquiet expressed at a recent meeting of Kerry County Committee of Agriculture which was attended by the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the premature removal of the embargo on foreign onions, and the consequent loss to the extent of thousands of pounds to the onion growers of the county; and if he will <Col N="4" /> make a statement on arrangements regarding the matter in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the discussion at the meeting but I do not accept the suggestion about losses. Resumption of imports this year was in fact three weeks later than last year and onion traders and merchants undertook to co-operate in the disposal of any remaining stocks.  My information is that this undertaking is being honoured and that only a relatively small quantity now remains.  It would not be feasible to wait until all stocks are cleared before allowing imports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his attention has been drawn to reports indicating that, because Dublin Corporation did not send out at 13 week intervals notices requesting an earnings review from Dublin Corporation tenants, hundreds of Dublin tenants are now being asked to produce certificates of earnings dating back to July, 1966 and to pay arrears where applicable from that date; if the proposal had his approval; if he can take any steps to ensure that this retrospective correction is not pursued at the expense of the tenants as it will undoubtedly cause hardship and worry to hundreds of them in Dublin; and, if so, what steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the form of agreement which a tenant signs on taking up occupation, he agrees to furnish to the corporation full and detailed particulars of his income and of the income of each member of his family, and to notify the corporation immediately of any change in income.  This requirement is also explained orally to tenants at the time of letting and in a leaflet sent to every prospective tenant.  This leaflet states that failure to give notice that family income has increased will be of no advantage since, when the corporation learns of the increase, as a result of visits by their officers or otherwise, the tenant will be required to pay not only the increased rent but the arrears as well.  There is no obligation on the corporation to carry out quarterly reviews of income but if a tenant wishes that they should do so he will be facilitated.  Rents are reviewed at any time when income falls as a result of change of employment, illness, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approval is not necessary to the detailed administration by local authorities of approved differential rent schemes.  I would, however, see no reason why the arrangements for review of rents to which I have referred should be changed.  These arrangements have operated since differential rents were introduced in Dublin in 1950 and should cause no hardship to <Col N="7" /> any tenant who abides by the terms of his tenancy agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree it is imposing a hardship on those tenants to have this thing done in retrospect, bearing in mind all the procedures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if they adhere to their tenancy agreements and report changes in their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees on the purpose of the differential rents scheme&mdash;that there is no misunderstanding about it&mdash;and surely then he will also agree that to ask people suddenly to produce sums of money due to inadvertent action by an official&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not due to any inadvertent action on the part of the officials concerned.  It is a reasonable requirement to require the tenants to notify changes in their income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the difficulties experienced by taxpayers calling to the PAYE office in O'Connell Street, Dublin, to discuss their difficulties, because of the absence of suitable inquiry and interview officers and the lack of facilities to allow taxpayers' problems to be discussed in private; and if he will have immediate action taken in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision for members of the public to discuss their PAYE problems at the offices in O'Connell Street, Dublin, is normally adequate. There are nevertheless occasional periods of pressure when congestion occurs and when it is necessary to have some of the less experienced officers deal with callers.  During these periods, however, senior members of the staff are always available to deal with any point of difficulty which may arise.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course the arrangements provided enable the public to discuss their problems with a reasonable amount of privacy.  Where, however, a taxpayer specifically requests a private interview he is, of course, given this facility.  Rush periods naturally place a heavy strain on both staff and accommodation and it will be appreciated that at such times some delay and congestion are unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to investigate the complaint I received from a taxpayer who went to discuss his particular problem? He informed me that he was more than two hours being passed from Billy to Jack before being referred to the correct quarter to deal with his problem. Perhaps the Minister will bear in mind that I am concerned that an adequate inquiry system or a form of conduit system should be established which will cause the people concerned the least possible delay in having their problems dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the annual amount of customs duty collected (a) on parts and accessories of motor vehicles and (b) on taxi meters; and if, having regard to the cost of collection of revenue on taxi meters, he will reconsider his decision <Col N="13" /> not to permit their importation free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual amount of customs duty collected on parts and accessories of motor vehicles, other than aggregates of parts imported for assembly, is roughly £1.4 million.  Of this total approximately £2,000 is derived from taxi meters.</P>
      <P>It is no more costly to collect the customs duty on taxi meters than on any other parts or accessories.  In the case of any particular item the cost would be negligible.</P>
      <P>As I explained previously the duty involved is a revenue duty and I would not feel justified in introducing a special exemption for taxi meters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of the Garda Síochána to enforce the Road Transport Acts and this duty necessarily involves the stopping and questioning of drivers of vehicles of various kinds.</P>
      <P>It has come to the notice of the Garda, through complaints and otherwise, that private buses have been used, apparently to an increasing extent, to carry farepaying passengers in contravention of the Road Transport Acts. Arising from the Garda investigations, some persons have already been convicted or have been given the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act the charges having been found proved. Other cases are <i>sub judice</i>.  Other cases again are still under investigation.</P>
      <P>It is unavoidable that, when the Garda Síochána are carrying out checks of this nature, some persons will find themselves stopped for questioning who are not, in fact, breaking the law. In such cases, the Garda can only express their regret and endeavour, as they do, to keep the inconvenience to a minimum.  I understand, however, that such complaints as have been made have come mainly from people against whom the Garda found evidence that justified a prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that it would be proper for me to supply information as to charges preferred in court in a particular case and, of course, this applies with even greater force where, as in this case, it is over two years since the matter arose and where the decision of the Attorney General was that the evidence did not justify proceeding further.  Rule 85 of the District Court Rules, however, provides a means by which such information may be obtained privately by a person with a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the matter.  A fee of 7/6d is payable.</P>
      <P>Communications between the Garda Síochána and the law officers are confidential and it would be contrary to established practice to give information about them on the lines sought in the question.</P>
      <P>The case referred to came before the District Court on 14th December, 1965 and the Garda records show that the solicitors for the complainant were informed verbally on 21st December, 1965 and in writing on 7th January, 1966, of the decision to withdraw charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the difficulties created for manufacturers who are obliged to pay duty on specialised viscose rayon yarn; and that payment of this duty gives British manufacturers an advantage compared with manufacturers here; and if he will state the circumstances in which this duty is imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the fact that, under the Trade Agreements of 1938 and 1948 with Great Britain, duty free licences could not be granted for certain goods, imported from third countries, if goods of a like class or kind were available from British sources.  In such cases, a <Col N="23" /> minimum duty of 10 per cent had to be charged.  When the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was being negotiated, the abolition of this arrangement, in the case of goods required for manufacturing purposes, was secured with effect from the 1st of July, 1969, the rate of duty in the meantime being tapered off to 8 per cent from the 1st of July, 1966, and to 5 per cent from the 1st of July, 1967.</P>
      <P>I am not clear what advantage a British manufacturer secures as compared with a manufacturer here because the British manufactured goods would, of course, be liable to duty on importation here up to 1975.  We are at no disadvantage so far as exports are concerned because this duty is not applied to material imported for processing and re-export; and as a result of the arrangements negotiated for the Free Trade Area our manufacturers are at liberty to use EFTA yarn without attracting duty on importation into Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under the terms of the EFTA arrangement, Swiss yarn could be imported into Britain as from 1st January of this year without payment of duty and that the revised rates of duty applicable to this country in respect of yarn imported from Britain mean there is a differential of 8 per cent?  I understand the British manufacturers can get Swiss yarn 8 per cent cheaper than Irish manufacturers can get yarn from Britain.  Perhaps the Minister would investigate that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is referring to is, I think, the fact that the duty to which I referred, which is being tapered off, is to disappear next year.  There was no similar kind of material available in Britain but, since February of this year, it has been available and therefore the duty has been applied again.  That duty is to disappear from 1st July next year and, as far as Irish manufacturers are concerned, if they are selling on the home market, they are liable to duty.  If they are competing with other markets abroad, <Col N="24" /> our people do not have to pay duty, if they import, process and re-export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that manufacturers here could, if they were allowed import, get Swiss yarn at a price which would enable them to compete on equal terms with British manufacturers.  Because of the application of the duty, they are, apparently, obliged to purchase yarn from British manufacturers and that yarn is 8 per cent dearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If our manufacturers were to purchase Swiss yarn for processing and re-export to anywhere other than Britain, they would not pay the duty and they would, therefore, be on the same terms as the British.  In so far as they are competing here with the British in the home market, there is a duty on British goods coming in. I presume the difficulty arises in the British market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as I have stated.  The duty must be applied until 1st July next year because there is a reasonable substitute available from British sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasonable substitute is available at a price of 81d per lb plus 2d per lb duty, which differentiates in favour of the British manufacturer as compared with the Irish manufacturer, both of whom are selling their manufactured commodity in the British market.  Perhaps the Minister will have the matter further considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking last Wednesday, I had given the House the reasons why I thought the proportional representation system of election should be preserved.  I set out the merits of that system as established and I dealt with a number of objections which had been made to the system in the course of the last effort by the Fianna Fáil Party to abolish proportional representation and I was going on to deal with some specific matters that had been raised in relation to the present proposals.  I do not want to repeat anything I said before but I was dealing with an article written in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 4th February, 1968.  I said that this seemed to me to be a brave effort by the political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Press</i> to present arguments in favour of the change being proposed.  It is right that when these arguments are put up they should be examined.  Certainly, the arguments put up in this article are at least as weighty as the arguments which have been made by the speakers on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first argument I extracted from this article was the idea that under the single-seat constituency, it will not be possible for people to get in on preference votes.  It was suggested that each candidate would be elected entirely on his own merits and the comment on that was that it was a more honest system.  As I said, I think it is entirely a matter of opinion whether or not it is a more honest <Col N="30" /> system to have a Deputy elected after fully sifting the views and preferences of the voters in a particular constituency or to have a candidate elected &mdash;as may happen, and probably will happen, under the so-called straight vote system&mdash;with a minority of the votes of a constituency.</P>
    <P>The second argument I have extracted from this article is the argument that under the straight vote, the election results will be a more accurate reflection of the public mind.  I would like to ask the Minister and the House just to consider what happens under the so-called straight vote and what happens in relation to our present system of proportional representation. The suggestion here is that under the straight vote, election results will be a more accurate reflection of the public mind.  Surely it is common knowledge that under the proposed straight vote system a candidate who is in a substantial minority as regards support in the constituency, who may have a substantial majority of the voters voting against him in the constituency, may be elected as the sole representative of that constituency?  In those circumstances, where we know if we accept the Government's advice on this that we are embarking on a system where minority representation is more likely to be the rule than the exception, how then can it be suggested that under such a system the results will more accurately reflect the public mind?</P>
    <P>The next argument put forward in this article, as I see it, is contained in this quotation:</P>
    <P>If the electorate decide on the abolition of PR general election results under the &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; system will be known within a few hours instead of as much as three or four days in some rural areas as at present.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt to some extent with this argument because it seems to me it was one of the arguments predominant in the minds of the Taoiseach and of the Fianna Fáil Party when they decided to recommend these proposals to the House.  If my recollection is correct, when the Taoiseach was interviewed on television after the Fianna <Col N="31" /> Fáil Party had come to their decision to try once more to get rid of proportional representation, he referred to the long and arduous counts in the last general election.  Here we have it again in the article of the political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Press,</i> that under the knock-out system, as he calls it&mdash; not the straight vote system, but the knock-out system&mdash;results will be known within a few hours instead of as much as three or four days.</P>
    <P>I would again ask Deputies opposite to consider seriously if the country should be asked twice in the one decade to go to the expense, trouble and turmoil of a referendum on our electoral system merely for the sake of obtaining the results a few hours earlier of some seats that might be in doubt.  Is that being put forward as a serious and substantial argument in favour of this change?  If it is, it is not, to my mind, an argument likely to recommend itself to the people of this country.  We are told that patience is a virtue.  Fianna Fáil Deputies who may be contesting a shaky seat or the last seat under proportional representation could well possess themselves in patience a few hours longer rather than ask that the entire electoral system be changed so they could get the results a bit earlier.</P>
    <P>The next argument put forward is a very true one, but I do not think it is a justification for the change.  I think it is a true description of what is likely to happen if this change comes about.</P>
    <P>The political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Press</i> continues in this article:</P>
    <P>This will be aided by the fact that there will be fewer candidates in each constituency.  In fact, there will be a substantial number of candidates &ldquo;returned unopposed&rdquo;.  Constituencies will, of course, be much smaller and candidates with strong influence in a particular area will not be challenged.</P>
    <P>I believe he is probably right in his forecast of the likely turn of events if these proposals are accepted by the House and subsequently accepted by the people, because what he is referring to there is what is known already in <Col N="32" /> Northern Ireland, and what is known already in Great Britain, that is, the situation brought about by the safe seat, the situation brought about where in some constituencies no election takes place at all, and the same candidate, or the candidate for the same Party, is returned time after time unopposed, and without a contest, without the electors in the constituencies getting an opportunity, election after election, of expressing their views either of approval or disaprpoval of the Government's administration and policies.</P>
    <P>When we see the political correspondent in a Fianna Fáil newspaper such as the <i>Sunday Press</i> calmly advancing the fact that this situation is likely to be brought about as one of the arguments in relation to these proposed changes, it should alert us to one of the inherent dangers in the proposals being made.  I do not regard the safe seat system as anything which deserves to be lauded or applauded in this country.  It is right and proper that when a general election comes, there should be a contest in each constituency, and that no voter should be disfranchised because an election or a contest does not take place.  Can we view complacently the prospect of such a situation arising here in which large tracts of the country are likely to be without contests, and large bodies of voters disfranchised?</P>
    <P>The next argument, as I see it, in this article is one which I have dealt with to some extent already.  The correspondent says:</P>
    <P>One of the weaknesses of PR is that it tends towards the creation of small, splinter groups who could have balance of power strength in the Dáil entirely out of proportion to their numerical strength.</P>
    <P>In relation to this argument which has been advanced and which I think runs through the Taoiseach's speech introducing these proposals, I want to say once more that so far as this country is concerned, and so far as our election system is concerned, all the records are against it.  There has been no undue fragmentation.  We still have in this House three Parties which have been here since the foundation of the State. <Col N="33" /> To my mind, no one can convincingly rest his case against PR on this argument about splinter Parties.  That simply has not happened here.  At the moment, as I said, there are three Parties in this House which have been here since the beginning of the State. If anyone wants to look up the records as regards this question, all he has to do is look at one of the annexes to the report of the Constitution Committee published recently, and he will see that down through the years there has not been the kind of splintering and fragmentation that is complained of in connection with the PR system.</P>
    <P>The next argument, as I see it, in this article comes where the writer says:</P>
    <P>With the smaller, more intimate constituencies, the TD will get to know his constituents better and the people will have a better opportunity of knowing the worth of their Deputy.</P>
    <P>Again, I think this is probably true as a description of what might be expected if this change comes about but that, in turn, produces other consequences. Apparently it is envisaged by the Government, if I understand the Taoiseach's speech correctly, that if the single seat constituencies are introduced here, the electorate will be as small as 12,000 in number&mdash;the Taoiseach said it may be 12,500&mdash;in or around that figure.  Consequently, there is a vast difference between the situation likely to arise here and the situation as it exists in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have not worked out the statistics but I think I am correct in saying that the average single seat constituency in England equates roughly to our five-member constituencies here in terms of the number of electors.  Consequently there is no question there of a person who is fortunate enough to get in at one election being able, regardless of his policies or the policies of the Party he supports, to dig himself in on a purely personal basis as could happen obviously where you had a constituency as small as 12,000 or 12,500 electors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about population but about electors.  It is the electorate who are important when one comes to consider the question of the election of a Deputy.  So while I think the picture painted there in the extract I have read is probably correct, again I do not think that that is any virtue.  I do not think that is any reason which should induce the people to accept these changes proposed.</P>
      <P>The next argument, as I see it, in this article is contained in this quotation:</P>
      <P>With one Deputy in each constituency the work for civil servants, Ministers and Deputies will be simplified.</P>
      <P>Under PR as many as five TDs could be making representations to a Minister on behalf of a constituent. That adds work to the Civil Service. under the &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; method&mdash;</P>
      <P>previously in the article it was referred to as the &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; system</P>
      <P>&mdash;there will be only one TD making representation on behalf of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it to be seriously argued that we should change our election system so that the work of civil servants, Ministers and Deputies will be simplified? Remember, in this matter of an election system, we are dealing with the fundamental rights of the people and we should not be concerning ourselves with the convenience of Ministers, civil servants or Deputies.  We are talking about a right which should, and I believe, is regarded as a fundamental <Col N="35" /> right of the people to be properly represented in a free Parliament, to have their views properly expressed in this House on their behalf by a freely and fairly elected representative.  If we are to change what I believe is a very fair, very just and very democratic election system in order to serve the convenience of civil servants, Ministers or Deputies, we will be taking a very retrograde step.  It would be all wrong to do it.  I hope that argument will not carry weight either with the Government or with the electorate.</P>
    <P>The next argument put up in this article follows on the previous one.  It says:</P>
    <P>Ministers will not have to listen to the views of five TDs in a particular case.</P>
    <P>I know that Ministers are required to give a great deal of their time to public work: I know that, by and large, Ministers do not have very much free time.  They have little time of their own. That is the way it is and the way it has been from the beginning, but it is not right to look on these proposals from the point of view of the Ministers.  It does not make all that difference whether a Minister listens to the views of five Deputies or of one Deputy from the Minister's point of view, but it may make a very considerable difference from the point of view of the constituent on whose behalf the Deputies are making representations.</P>
    <P>Deputies are of different calibre of one sort or another, whether it be mental make-up or knowledge or learning, and will be able to present things in different ways.  Some people may be built with a more sympathetic and humane approach than others and they may understand and appreciate the point of view of the constituents on whose behalf the representations are being made rather better than another Deputy in the same constituency.  Certainly, if a situation arises where in a five-member constituency all five Deputies are of common mind in regard to the justice of a particular case and the need to make representations to the Minister, that adds far more weight on <Col N="36" /> behalf of the unfortunate constituent than would be the case where a constituent is depending on the assistance or co-operation, if you like, of one Deputy.  Remember that when we are dealing with the question of single-seat constituencies, we are all members of political Parties and we look on this from the point of view of a political Party.</P>
    <P>We know that, by and large, throughout the country if single-seat constituencies are introduced, the Deputies for those constituencies will be elected as representing various political Parties and consequently the Deputy when elected possibly&mdash;and, I think, probably &mdash;with a minority vote, will be in a position either to give or to withhold his co-operation to constituents.  He will be in a position to decide this on a political basis.  I am not saying that every Deputy or, in fact, any Deputy would be likely to act in that way but at least it is possible.  It is open to him to decide that he will make representations only on behalf of those of his own political persuasion.</P>
    <P>Even if he does not adopt that attitude, let us take it again from the point of view of the constituent.  We have been brought up for 50 years or thereabouts under a system of PR, a system where in each constituency the various political Parties get representation according to the volume of support given to them in the constituency by the voters.  The Fine Gael supporter, as a matter of course, goes to the Fine Gael Deputy in a constituency and the Fianna Fáil supporter, also as a matter of course, goes to the Fianna Fáil Deputy.  That has been the position here for the past 50 years or so.  Do we think that overnight if these proposals are accepted, the person with strong political views in a constituency who is represented by a Deputy of a different political persuasion is likely to approach that Deputy with the same freedom and ease as he would approach a Deputy of his own political persuasion? So far from that being an advantage, as apparently the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Press</i> sees it, I think again it is one of the disadvantages likely to ensue if this change is made.</P>
    <P>I want to look for a while at the <Col N="37" /> arguments presented by the Taoiseach when he introduced these proposals.  I am referring to the typescript which was circulated rather than the Dáil Debates because I have made some notes on the typescript.  At the end of the first page and going on to the second page, the Taoiseach draws a distinction between elements which he sees as being basic to the democratic process and those which admit of variation and he said:</P>
    <P>I should like at the outset to draw a distinction between those elements in our electoral system which are basic to the democratic process and those elements which admit of variation according to circumstances.</P>
    <P>Then he sets out his categories and says:</P>
    <P>To the former category&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, those which are basic to the democratic process</P>
    <P>&mdash;belong such principles as universal franchise, the secret ballot, the right of individuals and groups to contest elections, the limit on the life of any Parliament, the prevention of electoral abuses and the provision of impartial machinery for the conduct of elections.</P>
    <P>Then in the second category, those which the Taoiseach sees as being open to variation, he puts the precise method of voting; he puts the question of whether constituencies should return one or a larger number of members, and the machinery for determining constituencies.</P>
    <P>I want to say, first of all, as a general comment on what the Taoiseach says there, that this distinction which he draws between elements which are basic to the democratic process and those which admit of variation is, to my mind only valid, provided the elements which are placed in the second category, that is, the variable elements, are themselves essentially democratic.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach specifically mentioned the precise method of voting.  The precise method of voting, I agree, is an element which is variable but if it is varied from a system which is <Col N="38" /> essentially democratic to one which can allow undemocratic practices to spring up and to surround it, then, obviously, that variation is not one which should be made and if, coupled with a proposal to alter the method of election, there is a question where a tolerance issue might so unbalance things as to make the whole set-up at least doubtful from the democratic point of view, then I think this division made by the Taoiseach is one which certainly may not in all circumstances be valid.</P>
    <P>When he talks as being in the second category, that is the variable category, about the machinery for determining constituencies, again I would say to him, that may be all right provided the element is in itself essentially democratic.  It would be quite undemocratic if constituencies are rigged in favour of either a particular candidate or a particular political party.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned as one of the matters that were, so to speak, sacrosanct in this regard the right of individuals and groups to contest elections. I agree with him there but, remember, that right must not be only an apparent right; it must be a real right and it is only a real right provided the election machinery is such as to give individuals and groups an opportunity of using it in order to get representation in this Parliament and if we allow a set-up to develop here where it is going to be virtually impossible for a seat to be secured by groups or individuals other than the ruling political Party then, surely, even on the Taoiseach's own definition, we are entering into a field that cannot be regarded as conforming with essential democratic principles.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, again, on the second page of his typescript, refers to old established stable democracies such as Great Britain and the US and Canada, which have the straight vote.  I want to say that I think that argument is entirely fallacious if it is intended to imply that in this country we have not had and do not have a stable democracy. I have referred already in the context of the arguments put up about splinter groups to the records which are before us, to the records we are <Col N="39" /> entitled to take into consideration.  I want to ask the Minister in charge of the debate, is it being suggested now that over the years from 1922 or 1923 onwards we have not had stable government in this country?  I do not think it can be suggested seriously.  I think all the weight of the evidence and all the weight of the record is there against that argument.  In any event, I think we should remember that we are dealing here with Irish conditions, with an Irish electorate and with an Irish political system.  Many of the factors which apply to larger countries have no relevancy whatever to our particular situation and to our conditions. We do not have in this country the same prospect of the growth of purely zonal or local parties or groups as you can have in a larger country. In this country most politicians of note are as well known in Cork, Limerick or Galway as they are in Dublin and, consequently, you do not have here the situation which encourages the growth of purely local groups seeking representation in parliament.  So that I, at any rate, am not impressed by arguments which quote Britain or the United States of America or Canada as examples which we should necessarily follow in dealing with our election system here.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, there is the vital difference between the population in England and the population here.  There is the situation that the single-seat constituency in England is roughly the equivalent of our five-seat constituency and it is envisaged that if this change goes through, you will have here a constituency as small as that which will contain an electorate of about 12,000.  There is also in England the tradition of the Labour and the Conservative constituencies which, possibly, you may not have here.</P>
    <P>On page 3 of his typescript, the Taoiseach makes the case that what marks out PR as so typically a product of the last century is the assumption it makes concerning the purpose of elections and then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>which it sees as basically a means of producing a deliberative assembly to pass laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Then, if we look at page 8 of the Taoiseach's typescript, we will see that, in extolling the virtues of the single-seat constituency&mdash;he is talking about the position of Deputies, and so on&mdash; he says:</P>
    <P>So much time has now to be spent by Deputies in dealing ostensibly on behalf of their constituents with day-to-day matters of administration which it is not necessary for them to deal with and in travelling around extensive and unwieldy constituencies, that they have not enough time left for their primary duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>So that, if the Taoiseach believes&mdash;and I do not disagree with him on this&mdash; that the primary duty of Deputies should be as legislators, why on earth does he then say that PR was so typically a product of the last century because it sees the election system as basically a means of producing a deliberative assembly to pass laws? Surely there is nothing out of date about that?  If the Taoiseach agrees that the primary duty of Deputies is as legislators, then there is nothing out of date in an election system which has the object of producing a deliberative assembly to pass laws.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also mentions, at the end of page 2 and at the beginning of page 3 of the typescript, that proportional representation was invented before the growth of modern party organisations.  I want to ask the Taoiseach what is the relevancy of that argument.  Does it mean that if one gets rid of PR, the Party machine will then rule supreme?  To my mind, if our present system of proportional representation does at times reduce the effect of the Party machine, then I think that is all to the good and not necessarily to be dismissed as something that should not happen.  In many cases it might be all to the good that that should be so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's talk of a deliberative assembly to pass laws and his reference later on to the primary duty of legislators, it seems to me that the correct view of the functions of this House is that it is a representative as well as a legislative <Col N="41" /> assembly, and so long as it is a representative assembly we should strive to see that it is representative in the sense that it fairly reflects the views of the people and that it is formed after the conduct of free and fair elections under a fair and democratic system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then goes on to argue, on page 3 again, that the inventors of PR did not foresee the modern extension of the State's role or the growing involvement of the Government in the economy.  He refers to long-term planning and the need for stable government with an effective parliamentary majority.  Then in the middle of the page he says that the electors will wish to choose their government directly.  I do not suppose the Taoiseach meant that to be taken literally.  It does not matter what system of election we have as long as we preserve the system of the Dáil electing the Government, the people are not directly electing the Government under either system.  In any event, it can be demonstrated&mdash; and to some extent I think I have demonstrated&mdash;that our present system of PR does not militate against the situation that has arisen by reason of the extension of the State's role in the economy or long-term planning or even against an effective parliamentary majority.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach is making the case that these things are only beginning to happen now and that, therefore, it is necessary on this account to bring about a change.  I do not imagine he will make that argument, because for many years past we have all known of the extension of the State into various fields of the economy.  On page 4 the Taoiseach does seem to be arguing that, because he says:</P>
    <P>The logic of developments within the past decade in this country requires us to consider our own position.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to grant&mdash;and I disagree with the Taoiseach if that is his argument&mdash;that the expansion of the Government and of government machinery, administration and so on into further fields of the life of the country only came within the past ten years, it <Col N="42" /> can be shown that nothing in our election system has militated against that. The present Government, while they did not obtain an overall majority at the last general election, obtained 72 seats out of the 144, and as one of the Deputies here&mdash;I think it was Deputy MacEntee&mdash;pointed out, that was an overall majority of the elected Deputies, because the Ceann Comhairle was automatically returned.  Therefore, even on the basis of that argument, is it not quite clear that our present system has not in any way militated against the Government in carrying out their plans of extending as they wish to extend into the economic sphere?</P>
    <P>Again on page 4 the Taoiseach refers to the virtual disappearance of small Parties and Independents from the Dáil and the increased interest shown by the voters in national Parties with comprehensive policies.  This seems to me to be an extraordinary twist in the argument that has been used in connection with small Parties. The argument was, and I think the argument is made still, that we should abolish PR because it led to small Parties, small groups or splinter Parties. Now we find the Taoiseach arguing apparently that we should abolish PR because it does not lead to small Parties or splinter groups.  He says :</P>
    <P>The virtual disappearance of small Parties and Independents from the Dáil and the increased interest shown by the voters in national Parties with comprehensive policies has been paralleled by an evolution of thinking within the Parties to the point where each Party in the Dáil is committed to seeking a majority for the implementation of its own policy.</P>
    <P>The conclusion he draws from that is:</P>
    <P>Thus, the Irish people and the Parties in the Dáil have implicitly repudiated any desire for coalition government.</P>
    <P>So we are told apparently that, now that the question of small Parties and Independents has been solved by their disappearance from the Dáil, we should get rid of PR.  At the beginning of the next page, the Taoiseach poses a question:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> The first question is whether we want a multiplicity of Parties and a series of coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>This follows the Taoiseach's reference to the virtual disappearance of small Parties and coalitions.  I have already dealt at some length with the argument about coalitions and I do not want to repeat myself further than to say that in so far as the Government base their arguments against proportional representation on their dislike of coalitions, in so far as the question of coalitions or of any groupings of Parties is concerned, then, to my mind, that is entirely a matter for the people of this country.  If the people show by their votes, irrespective of the system, that they want representation of various Parties, big or small, in this House, then so far as I am concerned the people are entitled to demand that. It is a legitimate aspiration and it is one which they are entitled to seek by their votes.  I do not think it is right that any Party which has secured an overall majority in the Dáil should endeavour by weight of their numbers in this House to force through legislation, the admitted design of which is to take away the right of the people to have either coalition Governments or inter-Party Governments if the people so choose.  To my mind, that is what that particular argument of the Taoiseach amounts to.</P>
    <P>What I say is emphasised by what the Taoiseach says at the beginning of page 6.  He says:</P>
    <P>The second question we should ask ourselves is which system of election is more likely to keep the number of Parties to a reasonable figure and facilitate the election of majority Governments.</P>
    <P>I want to put again the case I put before in relation to this.  Is it right that any Party in this House that has become a majority Government Party should endeavour to legislate in such a way as to make impossible of formation a type of Government they dislike? The way I view it is this: I dislike Fianna Fáil Governments.  I will do whatever I can to persuade voters at the next general election to agree with <Col N="44" /> me and to vote against the formation of another Fianna Fáil Government, but if I or my Party were to be in the position after the next general election that we had an overall majority in this House, are we by virtue of that fact then entitled to try to secure legislation and try to wring from the people consent to the proposition that changes should be made which would render the formation of future Fianna Fáil Governments impossible?  I do not think that any Fianna Fáil Deputy who examines this argument will feel quite complacent about it, looking at it from a purely democratic point of view.</P>
    <P>At the end of page 6 and beginning of page 7 of this typescript of his speech, the Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>The logic of a position adopted by all Parties in the House and by the people requires that we change our system of voting to the straight vote.</P>
    <P>Then he says:</P>
    <P>Probably because of this most of the opposition to the present proposal is based not on principles or long term considerations but on the supposed immediate effects of the changeover.</P>
    <P>In relation to that I want merely to say that so far as I am concerned, I support the Irish system of proportional representation as against the British system of the straight vote which Fianna Fáil are proposing, not out of Party considerations.  I have tried to look at this and I think reasonably successfully, from the general point of view and not from a purely Party point of view.  I do not know whether the bringing about of this change would, either in the short term or in the long term suit my particular political Party.  I do not know what effect it would have ultimately so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned if this change were brought about, but I disagree with their proposals because I believe that the system we have at the moment, even if it cannot be called a perfect system&mdash; and I think one would want to be either a very brave or a very rash man to claim that any human institution is perfect&mdash;is the fairest system I know of and because I believe it is a fair <Col N="45" /> system and a just one, because it gives fair and just representation in this House to all sections of the people, I support it and not merely from the point of view of whether it does or does not suit my political Party.</P>
    <P>I do not think there would be anyone in the ranks of the Fine Gael Party who would shirk contesting for the Government of this country with Fianna Fáil, regardless of what system is in operation, but I believe the system we have is a fair one and gives fair results, and it is because I believe the people are entitled to a system which is fair and gives fair results that I support it.</P>
    <P>At the end of page 7, the Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>The members elected in a constituency are primarily the representatives of particular groups, rather than of the whole community.</P>
    <P>This refers to the PR system.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>This has many undesirable results. Instead of considering the interests of their constituency as a whole, Deputies tend to adopt partisan attitudes towards local problems.</P>
    <P>He refers then to the competition between Deputies and so on.  Surely this much is clear.  At present the Deputies by and large, excluding for the moment the occasional Independent representation in the House, represent their political Parties.  That situation will not be altered whether you keep the PR system or depart from it.  If by the phrase &ldquo;particular groups&rdquo; the Taoiseach means the political Parties, then he is right.  They do represent particular groups in that sense and they will continue to represent particular groups in that sense, even if this change were to be brought about.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach goes on to say at the end of page 8:</P>
    <P>Under the single-seat system, the political Parties would have every incentive to put forward candidates of a high calibre.</P>
    <P>It would be easy, and it is indeed tempting, to deal with this particular <Col N="46" /> topic facetiously.  I wonder would the Minister for Health let us know, for example, the reaction in the Fianna Fáil meeting when the Taoiseach stuck his head around the door and said: &ldquo;Listen, boys; we want to get rid of PR because we want Deputies of a high calibre.&rdquo;  I think that once the argument is advanced, it is an argument we have to consider and to deal with seriously.  In an argument such as this when we are told that the changeover would produce Deputies of a high calibre, I suppose it is true to say that we are entering into a rather delicate area of self-examination but it is one that we should deal with.</P>
    <P>I take the view, rightly or wrongly &mdash;I do not say it is shared by everybody&mdash;that the calibre of Deputies, both at present and throughout the years since the foundation of this State, has been high.  I know various quotations may be fired at me and I may be told about what so-and-so said about so-and-so, but I think it is understandable, and that it is in fact understood, that from time to time in the course of debates and discussions in this House, one may feel oneself provoked into, let us say, saying more than one's prayers.  One may feel provoked into saying things about a Deputy or about institutions or about Parties that one regrets afterwards. Things may be said which the person who says them regrets quite sincerely and which the person about whom they were said probably forgets.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in my time in this House and for some time in the Seanad I probably have very frequently said things that were over-harsh, unfair or unjust, but I think by and large none of us intends those as personal reflections.  Certainly, as far as I am concerned, if there are any still on record, I have no hesitation in withdrawing them because I have a high regard for this House, for the Seanad and for the Members of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  The longer one is a member of the Irish Parliament, the more one's respect grows, not only for the character and calibre of the Members who have been elected and are being elected under the Irish system of proportional representation <Col N="47" /> but also for the work they have done in this House.</P>
    <P>It may be far easier to remember the cleavages and the controversies, and what a newspaper described some time ago as the reportable incidents, than to remember the sound work done not by front benchers and Ministers but by back bencher Deputies, the contributions they make to the legislation going through the House, to the general discussions that take place in the House on various matters.  It is easy to forget the number of occasions on which legislation going through this House has been amended and improved by reason of discussions that have taken place here and by amendments proposed, whether from the Opposition benches or by Government back benchers.  Those things may be forgotten but I do not think they should be forgotten.  Whatever one's personal views may be, it is undoubtedly true that the election system which we have gives us in this House a fair cross-section of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Surely that is what we want?  Do we want a House of experts?  I do not think we do.  I personally have the greatest respect for the views of experts in their own field but when we are talking about representatives of the ordinary people of the country, then I believe this House should be a true reflection of the people, that it should not consist entirely of experts.  I consider the average Deputy is fairly representative of the average elector and that that is in fact what we require in this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach goes on to say on page 10, but perhaps before we come to that, we should deal with some of his criticisms of the present system which appeared on page 9.  He says:</P>
    <P>The defects of the present system have often been pointed out.  Two defects inherent in the system are that all preferences have the same value &mdash;a casually cast 10th or even a 25th preference can have the same value as a No. 1 vote.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>This latter defect, combined with <Col N="48" /> the complicated and arbitrary method of counting and transferring votes, introduces a random element into the process and the ultimate result may be far from what the electorate really intended.</P>
    <P>Later on, he goes on to refer to cases where candidates who have headed the poll have not been elected.  I want to challenge the Taoiseach with regard to his views as to the operation of the system and with regard to the vote.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach believes that all preference votes have the same value when he says it but I think it is possibly worth noting that even in that sentence, the Taoiseach seems to have had second thoughts about it.  If we just look at it, we will see that the first phrase: &ldquo;that all preferences have the same value&rdquo; seems to be a categoric statement, a definite assertive statement of the position that all preference votes have the same value.  In the second part of his statement, that part in brackets in the Taoiseach's script, we find that is modified a bit and instead of saying that all preference votes have the same value, the phrase is modified by saying: &ldquo;a casually cast 10th or even a 25th preference can have the same value as a No. 1 vote&rdquo;, not that it is but that it can have.  All that might seem a bit startling without an explanation and so far as I am concerned I want to see what the explanation is.</P>
    <P>First of all, I do not think the Taoiseach's argument is correct.  I think he is quite mistaken in the statement that all preferences have the same value.  If you take, first of all, the position of, say, second or subsequent preferences on the paper of a candidate who has been elected on the first count with a surplus, I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that there are no circumstances whatever in which a second or subsequent preference vote appearing on the paper of such a candidate can have the same value as a No. 1 vote.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach agrees with me, I think he will agree also that he was mistaken in making so comprehensive a statement, that all preferences have the same value.  Secondly, I do not agree that there are any circumstances in which under our present system of <Col N="49" /> PR the second or subsequent vote has precisely the same value as a No. 1 vote when we look at it from the point of view of the voter.  It is the voter who counts, not the Deputy, not the Minister, not civil servants.  It is correct, and indeed it is well known and well recognised by voters and candidates, that if on a voter's first preference choice, the candidate is eliminated, then the second or subsequent preference counts.  The vote is transferred on to the second choice and to that extent it is nearly as valuable as a No. 1 vote to the candidate who gets it.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;nearly as valuable&rdquo; deliberately because it may not be entirely as valuable as a No. 1 vote.  This happened in the local elections recently in the Arklow area in the case where there was a tie for the elimination of candidates and it was necessary to refer back to see which candidates got the most first preference votes.  Even on the votes following an elimination, it is not entirely correct to say that the second preference vote has the exact equivalent value of the first preference, but I might be regarded as over-particular in that.  Generally speaking, on an elimination, a second preference vote is as valuable to the candidate who receives it as a first preference vote.  What has happened here is that the voter's first preference has not been achieved.  The person he voted for has been eliminated and, consequently, because our system is fair, because it is designed at sieving the views of the constituency as a whole with the object of finding out their preferences, when the first choice is gone, the second choice is taken into account.</P>
    <P>Surely instead of being a defect in a voting system, that is one of the features which makes our system so essentially fair and democratic, that we are trying to get the views, after sieving the volume of opinion, of the constituency?  We are trying to get the preference views of the electorate, and that, I think, is what was referred to by the <i>Irish Press</i> 35 years ago as in the extract which I quoted here last week. The <i>Irish Press</i> of 24th January, 1933, said:</P>
    <P>The English press correspondents sympathise with us on having to <Col N="50" /> work so complicated a system as proportional representation.  It is wasted sympathy, for the system is simple to understand and easy to carry out.  It is based on the excellent idea that we have a greater preference for some candidates than others.  Under proportional representation the voter not only has the pleasure of voting first for the candidates he likes most of all, but he also can vote for all the others in the order in which he likes them.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> said it was based on the excellent idea that we have a greater preference for some candidates than others.  That is the explanation, that in certain circumstances when the first choice is gone out, the voter's second choice carries on and his paper is transferred to his second choice.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on in referring to the defect as he saw it, as in the quotation I have already read out, to say that the preferences of only some candidates are counted.  I do not know but I presume that this refers to the fact that the preferences of elected candidates are not counted except in the case of a candidate obtaining a surplus. Surely the reason for that is quite obvious and it is the whole basis of the system and shows the essential fairness and democracy of the system, which is, of course, to ascertain and satisfy as far as possible the real preferences of the voters?  If a voter's first choice and preference is satisfied, then obviously you do not need to have regard to his next preference.</P>
    <P>It can be put quite simply this way. The voter is in effect saying that he wants to be represented by candidate &ldquo;A&rdquo; but that if he cannot be represented by candidate &ldquo;A&rdquo;, then he would like to be represented by candidate &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  If, in fact, he is represented by candidate &ldquo;A&rdquo;, why then should his subsequent preferences be taken into account when his first preference has, in fact, already been taken into account?</P>
    <P>There are particular cases, as I am sure the Minister knows, even when the second preference for a candidate who has been elected is taken into account but they are not taken into <Col N="51" /> account at their full value for the reasons I have given.  If a person is elected on the first count with a surplus, then, because he has exceeded the quota, should his votes be spare, so to speak, a calculation is made to see what those votes are worth to the people who have got No. 2s from him.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the complicated and arbitrary methods of counting and transferring votes and then he says:</P>
    <P>This random element is all the more serious when as happened in the last general election only a few votes decided the last seat in some constituencies and as happens in many elections, only a handful of votes decides eliminations.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>If the returning officer decided to include at an earlier stage a different bundle of an elected candidate's surplus votes, a different result could be achieved.  But this is not the returning officer's fault.  The system obliges him to take random selections from the votes of candidates who receive surpluses for subsequent distribution.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Taoiseach or some member of the Government would explain that reference more fully because I confess I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>I agree that in respect of any system of election, of any rules at all that are required to be carried out and implemented, it is probably correct to criticise them as being arbitrary because all rules are in some sense arbitrary.  It may be fair to suggest that the system of counting is complicated, just as anything is complicated for a person who does not understand it.  I should probably find many things complicated which would be very simple to others. If I were to start messing around with the electric wires in this House, I have no doubt I would be electrocuted very quickly&mdash;I do not understand them; they would be complicated to me&mdash;but a qualified electrician would have little difficulty in understanding them.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the system of <Col N="52" /> counting for our Irish system of PR should not be too severely criticised on the basis of being complicated.  Most of us who have experienced the system merely by experience have got a fair grasp of it.  We know the first thing the returning officer is required to do is to find out how many votes are spoiled or invalid and to take them out, to exclude them.  We know that he then goes on to sort out the voting papers and to arrange them in order, under the rules provided in the 1923 Act, into parcels according to their first preferences; in other words, he puts them into bundles for each candidate in accordance with the first preference votes the candidate has got.</P>
    <P>The returning officer then counts the No. 1 votes for each candidate and he arrives at the quota by dividing the total valid poll by the number of seats plus one, and adding one to the result. The next step is that if a candidate reaches or exceeds the quota, he is declared elected.  Following that, if a candidate reaches the quota with a surplus, the surplus is distributed according to the next ballot preference. I do not think there is anything complicated about that.  I think it is very reasonable, that it is known to anyone who has any interest either as an election worker or as a candidate.  It may be that some difficulty may be experienced in understanding exactly what happens when a candidate has been elected with a surplus in the first count.</P>
    <P>I do not wish by any means to set myself up as an authority on the subject, but the rules are there in black and white; all of us can read them and to my mind, they are not in any way ambiguous.  They can be followed by anyone who takes the trouble to look up the Electoral Act of 1923.  There the rules are set out in the Third Schedule. Let us take a case in round figures in which the quota is 80 and a candidate gets 100.  That candidate clearly has a surplus of 20, and if that surplus were not carried on in some shape or form, the votes would be wasted and criticism might be levelled against the system on the ground that they were wasted.</P>
    <P>If I recall correctly, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davern, interjecting <Col N="53" /> while I was speaking on the last occasion, referred to votes not getting their full value.  If the surplus votes I have been talking about were not carried on, that would be probably ground for criticism of the system.  What happens in the example I have given is that all of the votes are again distributed, this time in accordance with their next choice&mdash;the second or subsequent ballot preference.  If we take the case of five candidates in a constituency, the quota being 80 and one candidate getting 100, leaving a surplus of 20, all of the 100 votes are distributed between the remaining candidates; and supposing, for the sake of keeping the example in its simplest terms, that the four remaining candidates get 25 votes each all marked No. 2 on 25 of the ballot papers, the next job is to find out what the 25 votes are worth.  That is done under the rules by finding out what proportion the surplus bears to the total transfer of votes.  In this case it is clearly one-fifth.  Consequently, if a person gets 25 votes, each vote worth one-fifth, the poll carried on to him is a total of five, not the whole 25.  That is quite simple.  Whether it is simple or not, it seems to me to be quite fair; whether it is arbitrary, as the Taoiseach claims, at least it is clear and clearcut.</P>
    <P>What would be the position in regard to wastage of votes under the system proposed?  Surely every vote under the so-called straight vote system cast for anybody but the successful candidate is in fact a wasted vote?  I do not know whether there is very much more in the Taoiseach's speech with which I wish to deal.  Some of the other points I have noted are matters of criticism with which I have dealt already.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the merits and the value of our system of PR and having dealt with the arguments that have been put forward against it, we should now have a look at the system that is proposed as an alternative and see what are its virtues and its defects.  The most glaring weakness of the so-called straight vote system is that to which I have just referred&mdash;that it can produce a result through which a Party with a substantial minority of the votes cast can get a majority of the seats in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> The Taoiseach referred to constituencies with electorates of approximately 12,000.  If you take a constituency of 12,000 voters with three candidates, you could have this kind of result: you could have candidate A getting 4,001 votes, candidate B getting 4,000 votes and candidate C getting 3,999 votes and under the straight vote system which we are to be asked to adopt, candidate A with 4,001 votes would become the sole representative of that constituency, although there would be 7,999 votes cast against him. Surely that is not likely to produce a fair result?  Surely candidate A taking his seat in this House in that situation cannot claim that he really and fairly represents the mass of opinion in his constituency?</P>
    <P>The greater the number of candidates put forward, the worse and the more unbalanced and the more undemocratic the result may be.  If you take another example of a constituency with an electorate of 12,000 where there are four candidates in the field, it would be possible to get this result, that candidate A gets 3,002 votes, candidate B gets 3,001 votes, candidate C gets 2,999 and candidate D gets 2,998 votes.  There you have a result from an electorate of 12,000 and candidate A gets 3,002 votes and gets the seat, although there are 8,997 votes cast against him.  I admit that these are extreme examples. I am giving them deliberately in order to point out what I regard as the glaring weakness of the system which the Deputies opposite are sponsoring and trying to get the country to adopt. That is the first and most glaring weakness of the system, that it can produce a Dáil, can produce a Parliament, which in no way reflects the desires and wishes of the majority of the people.  I think it is true to say&mdash;I have seen this somewhere but I have not got the actual figures&mdash;that in one of the general elections in England sometime in the 1950s, the Government Party, the Party which obtained the most seats in the election, obtained less votes than the second largest Party.  In other words, a Party which had the greatest number of seats in the English Parliament had fewer votes than another Party represented in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The second defect which I see in the system is one which is very possible and was also referred to in the article I quoted from the <i>Sunday Press,</i> that is, in regard to this question of safe seats, where there is no election, no contest, no opportunity given to the electorate to bring about a change or express their views at all.  That is a possibility. Indeed, it is more than that; it is a probability.  It would indeed be a pity if it ever came into vogue in this country.  My third criticism of the so-called straight vote system is that it means in effect that the votes of a great body of the electorate are completely wasted.  Under the British system, it would be possible for a person to go right through his adult life voting in election after election, as they came about, without his vote counting one iota in Parliament, or having any influence whatever on the election of the Government, because it is only the votes that are cast for the successful Party that have any relevance whatever in Parliament under the so-called straight vote system.  Those who vote for a candidate who is unsuccessful in an election are as effectively disfranchised as if they were locked away behind iron bars.</P>
    <P>Whatever my personal views or criticisms of the so-called straight vote system may be, whatever weight people may attach to them, I think that in different degrees they are shared by many people in the country. On the last occasion this proposal was put before the people, Deputies may recall that the six University Senators considered the proposal and having considered it, published their views. Their views are just as relevant now as they were 8½ years ago.  I do not think that anything has changed. Exactly the same proposal is being put before the people and to a large extent the same arguments are being used.  It seems to me that the verdict of six eminent University Senators, who have no axe to grind politically, who approached the problem of examining the proposal thoroughly and declaring their views, is just as relevant to the proposals now being put forward.  I quote from the Official Report of 29th <Col N="56" /> April, 1959, at column 1366, where the views of the Senators were quoted, and they said:</P>
    <P>We are convinced from our many investigations that the proposed change to the miscalled straight vote system would be disastrous on the following grounds:</P>
    <P>(1)  It would lead to an excessive Government majority with an Opposition almost as powerless as the present Opposition in the Six County Parliament.</P>
    <P>(2)  This would result in intolerant and dictatorial Government and might ultimately evoke as a reaction an organised extra-parliamentary Opposition.</P>
    <P>(3)  It would cause division and Party strife rather than a co-operative approach to our economic and national problems in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>(4)  The single seat constituency would inevitably narrow the voter's choice at elections and would greatly increase the power of political Parties as such.  This would undoubtedly lower the quality of Dáil representatives since unquestioning obedience to the Party leaders would then be the first demand made on any candidate.</P>
    <P>(5)  The proposed system sets the stage for class warfare between town and country and makes it possible for a majority to command 40 per cent in the urban constituencies and, getting little or no support in the rural areas, due to its deliberate anti-rural policy, to get a majority in Dáil Éireann.  Such a Party might have the support of as little as 25 per cent of the total electorate, and yet the miscalled straight vote system would enable it to impose its doctrines on the remaining 75 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>Those are five solid arguments produced after an examination by six individuals who, in my belief, had no political axe to grind, who viewed the matter thoroughly, made their examination <Col N="57" /> and published their findings.  Those views and criticisms are just as valid today in relation to the present proposals.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which the Fianna Fáil Party endeavoured to change our election system, we, on this side of the House, suggested to them that before that exercise was undertaken, there should be a thorough examination of election systems and the choice should not necessarily be limited, as it was then being limited.  It is fair to say that there is a difference between the present position and the position that obtained eight and a half years ago.  On the last occasion there was no examination by any committee, although we urged that such an examination should be undertaken.  This time, the move by Fianna Fáil comes after an examination of electoral systems by the Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Taoiseach, it should be stated that he did not claim the report of the Committee on the Constitution as justifying the proposals he made to the House and it is, I think, important that we should recognise that.  It is important that we should recognise that, although this question of the system of election was examined by the Committee, they did not recommend the proposals now before the House and they did not recommend that these alterations or amendments should be made in or to the Constitution. I have no special knowledge of what went on or of the discussions that took place at the meeting of that Committee but I claim it is absolutely and abundantly clear from the report published by the Committee that the proposals now before this House were never suggested at any meeting of the Committee and were never brought before the Committee for consideration.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at the arguments produced in favour of a change to realise that those arguments are not arguments devoted to urging a change from proportional representation to the so-called straight vote.  At page 22 of the report, paragraph 61, there is set out:</P>
    <P>The question of adopting a different electoral system for Dáil elections <Col N="58" /> was considered by the Committee. The substitution of the present system of proportional representation by the Alternative Vote was proposed and the arguments adduced for and against are set out here-under.</P>
    <P>I am right in saying then that there was never a proposal brought before the Committee that proportional representation should be replaced by the so-called straight vote.  Apparently there was a recommendation that proportional representation should be replaced by the alternative vote, but there was not unanimity with regard to that and no recommendation was made by the Committee, but the arguments pro and con were set out.  I would not recommend that proportional representation should be replaced by the alternative vote and my only purpose in referring to this is to make it clear and put it on the records of the House that there was no proposal from the Committee that we should change from proportional representation to the so-called straight vote.  It is not necessary to go into the arguments set out because they are available in the report for anyone who wants to read them.</P>
    <P>Various arguments have been made against proportional representation but very few arguments have been advanced in favour of the straight vote. I have examined the speech made by the Taoiseach and dealt with it to the best of my ability.  So far as I am concerned, I do not want any departure from the present system.  I believe there is an obligation on those who want a departure from the present system, those who are not satisfied with it, to examine fully and independently, apart from committees composed of members of political Parties drawn from the Dáil and Seanad, what alternatives or other courses are open. That has not been done except to a limited extent.  If Deputies argue against our present system of proportional representation on the basis that it contains defects, it is open to them, and this should be done, to examine to what extent the defects of which they complain are capable of being adjusted and, if there are complaints with regard to the rules of voting being <Col N="59" /> either complicated or arbitrary, is it not open to us to examine the rules and see whether or not any modifications or adjustments can be made in them?  Why is the only course open to us that of scrapping the system entirely? Why, if the Government insist that the system should be scrapped, is the only alternative the one rejected by the people eight and a half years ago?  I do not think very much of the arguments that have been adduced against the system of proportional representation.  They are not substantial. In so far as they relate to the machinery of the election system, or the count, I think an examination could be and should be made to see to what extent adjustments or modifications are necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Fourth Amendment Bill to which I have been addressing my remarks so far, we have before us also the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I do not intend to say very much about this.  I listened to Deputy O'Connor last week and I did not find a great deal on which I could disagree with him when he described the work of a rural Deputy, but he will, I think, agree with me that he was viewing the matter solely from the point of view of a Deputy and I have already said on more than one occasion that we should not view these Bills from the point of view of Deputies, or Ministers, or civil servants.  We should view them from the point of view of the voters.  Most of us in this House know what to expect when we present ourselves for election.  There is no obligation on us to remain in the House if we feel the work is too onerous, that we are not able to get around our constituency or that we have not sufficient time for our own personal business. There is no obligation on us to remain in this House; we can get out of it.  It is not necessary, to my mind, to look on these proposals or the present position from the point of view of a Deputy's or Deputies' convenience.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed in the Third Amendment Bill is this tolerance issue. A short while ago, we engaged in the exercise of devaluing the pound.  This Bill is a Bill to devalue the vote, not <Col N="60" /> by a mere 14 or 15 per cent, but in some areas by up to 40 per cent.  That is the issue involved in the Third Amendment Bill, in this tolerance Bill. The issue is that we are asked to bring about a situation where the votes cast in some areas are going to be worth 40 per cent less than the votes cast in other areas.  I do not think that is the kind of system we should encourage the free Irish democratic people to accept and support.</P>

      <P>Only a Party obviously lusting after unbridled power&mdash;a power which they feel will soon be taken from them&mdash;would have the temerity or the brazen audacity to ask this House and the country to reject the fundamental principle of one man, one vote.  Only such a Party would have the brass neck to stuff down the throats of the Irish people that proportional representation should be abolished. Proportional representation was an issue in this House and in this country in 1958-59.  It was decisively rejected on that occasion by a majority of the people.  It was the most opportune time for the Fianna Fáil Party.  Running for office in Aras an Uachtaráin was their leader, Eamon de Valera.  He did command a lot of respect and loyalty.</P>
      <P>They availed of this unique opportunity before he went into retirement in Aras an Uachtaráin to get the people to abolish proportional representation and elect &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; as President. They thought this was their last chance of copperfastening their power in this country.  If the magic of &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; was stripped from them, it was felt that, instead of the omnipotent Party they were under this great magician, they would become a Party of mediocrity and quickly fade away.  The Irish people elected Eamon de Valera as President on that occasion and rejected the attempt of Eamon de Valera and his Party to abolish proportional representation. Therefore, it is a matter of astonishment that this Party should have the audacity to make this an issue once again in the light of the fact that less than ten years have elapsed since this was made a fundamental issue by that Government and by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assert that, as far as the <Col N="61" /> Labour Party are concerned, we stand for the retention of proportional representation, not as a matter of expediency but as a matter of principle and not because we are a minority Party in this House at present.  We will evolve as a Government, whether Fianna Fáil like it or not.  Whether proportional representation is abolished or not, this great Labour movement will go on to govern in this country as sure as light follows darkness and darkness follows light.  No power in this land can stop the onward march of labour to its rightful destiny to govern.  We shall and will survive all the obstacles which may be placed in our path.</P>
    <P>This attempt by Fianna Fáil would be difficult to understand if one did not understand the history of that Party.  I have said it is an unbridled attempt to rule indefinitely.  All the old pretences were trotted out in the Taoiseach's remarks&mdash;stable government, the lack of minority Parties&mdash;but in essence this is the lusting after power, a power obviously waning.  This is the action of a Party which has lost its political nerve, the action of a Party which realises it has lost the confidence of the people and is afraid to face them under the present rules of proportional representation because they know they are in for a terrible beating.</P>
    <P>I believe this despicable attempt to abolish proportional representation is doomed to failure.  It has about the same chance of succeeding as a snowball in hell.  The foreboding of doom and gloom was evident in this House last week when the Taoiseach sat down after proposing these crucial amendments to our Constitution.  One could detect more life in a graveyard at mid-night than was evident on the Fianna Fáil benches when the Taoiseach concluded his remarks.  They were as silent as the grave: no plaudits, no huzzahs, no hear-hears, no stamping of feet or beating on desks.  This was not an occasion for jubilation or throwing hats in the air.  They indicated their fear and their foreboding about this decision.  Jointly they demonstrated to the Taoiseach and the Party that these measures were already as dead as the dodo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> One can well understand the indignation, the sense of outrage and anger of the Irish people when they read of this intention, this design, of the Fianna Fáil Party to abolish PR and create a situation where it would take a much lesser number of votes to elect a Deputy in the West than it would to elect a Deputy in the East or South. This is the undermining of the fundamental principle of one man, one vote. I assert that the people of the West are not concerned with votes or with the number of Deputies.  They are concerned now, as they always have been with a good life, with a right to work, marry and found a family with some semblance of security which Fianna Fáil deny them.  That there has been a depopulation of the West is directly attributable to the Government Party who have been in office for over 30 years.</P>

We have said before, and we repeat, that the single constituency and the straight vote system which the Government are seeking to bring about, clearly deny representation to minority groups, that it is contrary to our democratic traditions, and that it is certainly likely to lead to unrepresentative and arrogant government. Our people do not want these measures at present.  Indeed, it is a matter of astonishment that the Government should put us to the task of debating these costly measures when we should be concerned with the more essential matter of securing improvements in the shocking incidence of unemployment which has been spiralling in recent months and is moving upwards to 70,000 at present.</P>

People are more concerned about seeing the end of the slums and squalor, the end of the large queues at the employment exchanges and the end of the line-up at Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare and at the airports where they are moving out in their hundreds, denied a livelihood here by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification for these measures at the present time and it is an insult to the intelligence of our people to talk about the requirements of suitable government.  The Government have been in power continuously for the past ten years; they have been in power for 30 years under PR.  They have had more than a fair innings at controlling the destiny of the Irish people but they have wasted these years of government and wasted the <Col N="64" /> precious years of independence.

Far from being a British method of election, it is the method of election which the people of Sligo decided to have and the British Parliament legislated for it.  On the other hand the straight vote and the single seat constituency are things the efficiency of which the Taoiseach may have had confirmed to him on his recent visits to Captain O'Neill, the Northern Ireland Premier.  That is the method of election which Fianna Fáil are asking the Irish people to adopt, the Orange method of election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not finished dealing with the cases that were raised by Opposition Deputies on this Bill. Another Opposition Deputy who raised a case and sought to utilise it in furtherance of this campaign was Deputy Ryan.  In order to deal with the case which Deputy Ryan raised, it is first of all necessary to define some of the terms which have apparently confused the Deputy.  Otherwise he would hardly have made some of the statements he did make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I want to do is to explain what the term &ldquo;outline permission&rdquo; means.  This term was introduced for the first time in the 1963 Act.  Section 25 of the Planning Act, 1963, gave the Minister power to make permission regulations which, <i>inter alia,</i> could make provision for &ldquo;applications expressed to be outline applications for permissions for development subject to <Col N="67" /> the subsequent approval of the planning authority&rdquo; and provision was made accordingly in the Permission Regulations, 1964, which defined an &ldquo;outline permission&rdquo; as meaning a permission for development subject to the subsequent approval of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>The grant of an outline permission determines the principle of the land use to which it relates.  An application which is for an outline permission need only be accompanied by plans and particulars which are necessary to identify the land to which the application relates and to enable the planning authority to determine the siting lay-out or other proposals for development in respect of which a decision is sought, for example, a block plan for a single house or a lay-out plan for housing development showing road lay-out, proposed sewer connections, and so on, but containing no structural details or details of house design, floor plans, elevations or sections.</P>
    <P>When a planning authority receive an application which is not specifically expressed to be an application for an outline permission and they consider that the plans and particulars submitted are sufficient only for the purpose of an outline permission, they are empowered, if they see fit, to grant an outline permission for the development even if the applicant did not specifically state that it was outline permission only that he was seeking.</P>
    <P>Another term is the term &ldquo;approval&rdquo;.  Approval follows on the grant of an outline permission.  As I have said, once an outline permission has been granted, the land use is determined but detailed plans have then to be submitted to the planning authority for an approval and an approval has to be granted either by them or by the Minister on appeal before actual work can start.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;permission&rdquo; can better be described as &ldquo;full permission&rdquo;. This applies in a case where full details of the proposed development are submitted and permission is sought, that is, without going through the preliminary process of looking for outline permission, the proposer decides that <Col N="68" /> he does not consider it necessary to seek an outline permission first and goes ahead and has detailed plans prepared from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;permission in principle&rdquo; or &ldquo;approval in principle&rdquo; have no legal standing.  When the 1934 and 1939 Town and Regional Planning Acts were in operation, some planning authorities had a habit of informing intending developers who made preliminary inquiries as to whether they were likely to receive permission for the development proposed by them that there would be no objection or that there would be objection, as the case might be, to the development.  This was, in fact, an irregular practice which had no legal standing.  No formal decision was made under the 1934 and 1939 Acts.  Third parties were afforded no right of appeal and in the event of the planning authority indicating that they would have objection to the development the prospective developer himself would still have had to go through the machinery of looking for the permission and being formally refused before he could appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This practice had given rise to considerable difficulty in cases where planning policy had changed between the time the planning authority indicated that there was no objection to a development and the lodgment of plans with the formal application for planning permission and the case that Deputy Ryan raised is a good example of this.  I may say that this practice has now ceased under the new Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan tried to suggest that this appeal case in which consideration of the appeal was delayed was held up either because of incompetence in my Department or, as he described it, downright corruption, throwing in an allegation that the appeal was probably deliberately delayed in the interests of one of the parties to it who was described as being a friend of mine, though, I may say quite definitely, I do not know anybody connected with this case except Deputy Ryan.  His allegations are, as he knows, completely without foundation and he definitely knows this since his firm are, in fact, acting for one of the applicants.</P>
    <P>The appeal in question relates to a <Col N="69" /> site at Old Long Hill, Kilmacanogue.  I understand that in August, 1963, Wicklow County Council, in response to an inquiry from the owner, stated that they had no objection in principle to the use of the site for the purpose of building a single-storey house.  They informed the owner of the site that it would be necessary for him to submit detailed plans for approval.  No formal decision was made under the 1934 and 1939 Acts which were in operation at that time and, therefore, no planning permission whatever attaches to this site.  The indication that was given to the owner at that time was a purely informal thing which has no binding power, no legal standing whatever, as I have already explained, but the owner apparently assumed from this that he had, in fact, got outline permission for the development of the site and, apparently, he later contracted to sell the site to another party who agreed to purchase on the understanding that there was a valid outline permission attached to the site.</P>
    <P>The purchaser submitted an application then for permission&mdash;a term I have already explained&mdash;for the erection of a bungalow on the site.  On 3rd February, 1967, permission was refused by the planning authority on the grounds that the site is situated at a high contour level in a scenic area and the erection of a suburban type residence on it would be out of character and would seriously injure the amenities of the area.  The owner of the site, not the purchaser, lodged an appeal against this refusal, and he stated that he was really interested in the outline permission which he understood had been granted in 1963 and which the later decision appeared to revoke.  The purchaser also lodged an appeal against the refusal of permission on the grounds that the site was screened from the road and that a house in that location would not interfere with the amenities of the area.</P>
    <P>The owner of the site subsequently wrote to my Department on a number of occasions saying that what he really was interested in was to establish that an outline permission attached to the site and that he was not particularly concerned that the prospective purchaser's application had been turned <Col N="70" /> down.  He was advised that it was open to him to apply to the planning authority for outline permission and that the appeal before me related to the permission sought by the prospective purchaser and that it was not possible to change the application to which the appeal related into an application for outline permission as was suggested by him.  He was advised that the proper course for him to take would be to apply to the planning authority for outline permission if that was what he wanted.  That was in April, 1967, two months after these two appeals in respect of the site had been lodged.</P>
    <P>In June, 1967, the owner was asked whether he had taken any action on the basis of the advice given to him, but he did not reply.  On the 5th April, 1967, both he and the other appellant, that is, the prospective purchaser of the site, who had made no inquiry whatever about the case and had taken no action about it since he had lodged his appeal in February, 1967, were informed that consideration of the appeal was being deferred pending a further communication from either of them.  The purchaser was asked to confirm that he had no longer any interest in the case as had been assumed by the owner of the site when he did not reply.  I think that in view of the fact that he did not reply, it was reasonable to assume that the claim made by the owner of the site did represent the actual state of affairs.</P>
    <P>It was not until 27th November, 1967, that Deputy Ryan's firm, Messrs Ryan and Wallace, Solicitors, wrote on the purchaser's behalf stating that they were most anxious that the appeal should proceed.  That was almost five months after the letter had gone out to him from the Department.  The solicitors' attention was drawn by letter of 29th November, 1967, to the letter that had issued to their client on 5th July, 1967, and the purchaser was also told by letter of 4th December, 1967, that he had been informed the previous July that consideration of the case was being deferred.  Deputy Ryan's firm then wrote saying that their client had no recollection of receiving the letter to which my Department had referred. <Col N="71" /> They asked how the Department had come to the conclusion that he was no longer interested in the case when he had given no such indication himself. They were informed on 8th December, 1967, that the owner of the site had made it clear that he was not greatly concerned with the purchaser's application but wanted to get outline permission for the site.  The solicitors replied on 14th December, 1967, to the effect that their client was very definitely still interested in the appeal; they wanted to buy the site but that the owner refused to take the deposit until the appeal was determined.</P>
    <P>On receipt of this letter which clarified the position, steps were taken to have the appeal processed and it is now ready for decision.  I think it is quite obvious that any difficulties or delays that arose in this connection as far as the purchaser of the site is concerned are attributable to his own neglect in not pursuing the appeal.  He was quite clearly informed in July, 1967, that it was intended to defer consideration of the appeal unless either he or the owner indicated that he required that it should be determined.  It is not an unusual thing for appellants to decide not to go ahead with their appeals, but in this case the prospective purchaser of the site took no action until late in November, 1967, when my Department first heard from Deputy Ryan's firm about the case.  It is manifestly ridiculous for Deputy Ryan to suggest that the delay in this case was due to incompetence in my Department, and there is certainly no basis whatever for the suggestion that the case was deliberately delayed to suit the interest of the owner of the site, who is somebody that I have no knowledge whatever of.  It can be clearly shown that this is the position and that this is another case that has been deliberately distorted by the Opposition Deputies in pursuance of a definite campaign.</P>
    <P>There was a number of other cases raised by different Deputies, but in order to present the balanced picture everybody would desire to have presented, perhaps I might just deal with another case in which the decision of <Col N="72" /> the planning authority was reversed by one of my predecessors, Deputy P. O'Donnell.  This, as I mentioned briefly before, is a case with which a number of Deputies will have become familiar if they have taken any part in the by-election campaign in the Wicklow area. It is the case of an appeal which was submitted on the 22nd April, 1955, against the refusal of permission for the erection of a garage and filling station at Hollybrook, Bray, County Wicklow. The reasons that were given for the refusal by the planning authority in this case were, first of all, that the site proposed to be used for the erection of the garage and filling station was in a rural and residential district, the amenities of which would be injuriously affected by the erection of the proposed building; and, secondly, the proposed structure would obstruct the clear view necessary to road users at the main road junction adjoining it,</P>
    <P>This again is a case that had quite a considerable history.  The first appeal submitted to the Department was decided when the Minister, by order dated 15th June, 1953, confirmed the refusal by the planning authority of permission to carry out this development at this particular place.  I think Deputy Smith was Minister at this particular time.  Amended plans were submitted in January, 1954, and the proposal was again refused on the same grounds as previously, and on 30th March, 1954, the council's refusal of permission was upheld by the Minister on appeal.  I think the Minister at that particular date was Deputy P. O'Donnell.  Further revised plans were submitted in September, 1954, and permission was again refused by the council and the refusal was upheld by the Minister, who again at this time was Deputy P. O'Donnell.  The refusal of permission was upheld by an order dated 22nd December, 1954.  Once again revised plans were submitted and these were appealed on 22nd April, 1955, and although there was no fundamental change in them&mdash;the situation in which the development was proposed was still the same and the Minister was the same Minister who had rejected two previous appeals in respect of the same development for <Col N="73" /> the same site&mdash;he suddenly came to the decision that this should be allowed and the appeal was allowed on 1st July, 1955, some two months after it had been submitted.</P>
    <P>I have been attacked because I allowed an appeal that had been refused by my predecessor but here is a case in which an appeal had been refused three times already and twice by Deputy P. O'Donnell himself, and on this occasion although there was no substantial change&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No substantial change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;no substantial change, no change that could conceivably affect the objections that were raised to it, Deputy P. O'Donnell suddenly, for some reason, decided to allow it.  Deputies opposite can speculate as to what prompted the applicant to appeal again in view of the fact that Deputy P. O'Donnell had already rejected the appeal on two occasions and what prompted Deputy P. O'Donnell to agree on this particular occasion, what was the new factor that came into consideration at this particular time.</P>
      <P>As I said, the site is one which Deputies will have an opportunity of seeing during the next two weeks or so. It lies about two miles south of Bray at an acute junction of two main roads, the junction of the road leading from Bray towards Wicklow and the junction of the road leading from the Kilcroney area towards Wicklow&mdash;a very acute junction.  The area includes the Kilcroney Demesne which is well wooded and one of great charm.  The site, apart altogether from the fact that it is an area of high amenity, was described as being far from perfect for building, having an undulating crossfall, and one side of it, prior to Deputy P. O'Donnell's decision, was lined with fine trees which would have to be removed if the building were to take place.  These trees have now been removed.  The site was described as being located in a spot of great attraction on one of the main tourist routes in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think most people would agree that <Col N="74" /> it is an area of considerable attraction and that it is on one of the main tourist routes of the country.  I think most people would also agree that in such a location a petrol station, even if it were a particularly well-designed one, would be a grave disfigurement of the area and would detract from it. Apart from that, it is the accepted view that petrol filling stations at road junctions are generally undesirable but in this particular case, the junction, on account of its acute nature and the fact that there was a considerable gradient and curve of the main road already there, was even more difficult than the average one.  It was further established that there were adequate facilities for petrol in the particular location but, as I said, although Deputy P. O'Donnell had decided on two previous occasions himself that these arguments, from the point of view of the amenity of the area, and from the point of view of the road hazard were compelling ones, on this occasion decided to change his decision.</P>
    <P>This was in an area which was described as being one of high amenity, in an area which has been described as the gateway to the Garden of Ireland and here, in a sylvan setting, Deputy P. O'Donnell decided that a petrol station would add to the amenities of the area.  I suppose these things are a matter of opinion and while some people think that petrol stations are ugly and objectionable in any situation, others may think that they can be made attractive.  Apparently Deputy P. O'Donnell decided that this quiet wooded area would be improved and that the monotony of the scene would be relieved by the provision of this petrol station.  I mention this case to show that all the allegations the Opposition Deputies are making could be made in respect of decisions made by other Ministers as well if it was desired to do so but I have no doubt that Deputy P. O'Donnell's reason for allowing this was that he felt that this intrusion in a quiet wooded area would relieve the monotony of the particular situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully raised a case which I propose to deal with.  It is a <Col N="75" /> case of a model development at Kells Road, An Uaimh.  In this particular case the developer proposed to build a small motel, staff residence and filling station just outside the urban boundary of An Uaimh.  Permission was given by the county council, subject to ten conditions, for the motel and residential accommodation, but permission was refused for the filling station.  Local residents appealed to me against the grant of permission and after the case had been processed I affirmed the decision of the planning authority.  I am attacked for overriding the decision of the planning authority.  I am told that the planning authority should be the last word but here is a case where I affirmed the decision of the planning authority and I was wrong there too, according to Deputy Tully.  After this decision had been taken, Deputy Tully wrote raising a number of points and these points were replied to on 13th February, 1968.  Although they were explained to him, he raised them again in the course of the debate on this Bill. Deputy Tully stated that permission was given to Thomas Clarke, although the advertisement was inserted by Joseph Clarke.  It was considered that the use of a wrong initial letter for Mr. Clarke's name on the notice did not invalidate the application and that was a reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also stated that the county council refused permission for a filling station and therefore there was an appeal and it was adjudicated on, but section 26, subsection (5) of the 1963 Act makes is clear that the Minister must determine each application for permission as if it had been made to him and dealt with in the first instance and his decision operates to annul the decision of the planning authority; in other words, it is a completely new decision on the original application.  That was explained to Deputy Tully but he made the same charge here when speaking on this Bill. He further stated that the decision on the appeal refers to a flat but there was no reference to a flat in the original application.  The reference to a flat was included to give a more accurate description of the proposal, the plans <Col N="76" /> for which did in fact provide for a small residential flat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the points raised by Deputy Tully in regard to this particular development of Kells Road, An Uaimh.  He went on to say that the proposal is to build over a stream which would impede drainage and cause a hazard to the road and to a neighbouring house.  If this is so, apparently the people who made the appeal did not know it because the point was not raised by them.  Possibly it is only Deputy Tully who knows of the existence of this stream.  Deputy Tully stated that the appellant requested to have evidence taken on oath but the inspector refused the request.  The inspector acted in accordance with general instructions which are designed to ensure that hearings are conducted without undue formality.  This was explained to the appellant at the time by the inspector.  It is a good idea that those things should be as informal as possible.  That is the whole idea behind it, to enable anybody to make an appeal and not to have to go to the expense of employing legal assistance.</P>
      <P>He also stated that Meath County Council propose to widen the road here and if the motel is built, the widening will necessitate the demolition of houses on the opposite side of the road and the taking away of their land.  At the oral hearing, an officer of the county council explained that one of the conditions attached to the permission, which had been endorsed by me, required the developer to set back his front boundary wall and entrance 30 feet from the road centre to allow road widening to be carried out on his side. I think all points in respect of this which were raised by Deputy Tully had already been adequately covered in the reply which he obtained from the Department and I do not think there was very much in this.</P>

    <P>Deputy Tully referred to other cases where permission for new houses had been refused by the planning authority on the grounds that the further proliferation <Col N="79" /> of septic tanks in the area would give rise to a public health nuisance and that appeals against the refusals would give rise to trouble if they succeeded.  I presume Deputy Tully refers to Mornington, County Meath.</P>

      <P>Where some 15 houses with individual septic tanks were constructed, presumably with permission of the county council, but where subsequent applications were refused.  Two of the applicants appealed against the refusal and having considered all the facts, I decided that the grant of permission for the two houses would not lead to the creation of a public health nuisance.  In arriving at this decision, I was influenced by the fact that the use of septic tanks was only a temporary measure as a public sewerage system at an early date had been decided on by the county council.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with planning but Deputy L'Estrange will not let me.  I come now to a case referred to by Deputy Esmonde.  A man wanted to erect a pump, according to Deputy Esmonde, on an absolutely straight road.  North or south, one could see for more than 200 yards and this man was prepared to go back 30 feet, and if necessary 50 feet from the road.  It was turned down because the road was too straight and the traffic moving too fast.  As far as I can see, this relates to an appeal, which was turned down, on 24th November, 1967, against the refusal of permission by Wexford County Council for a filling station at Dublin Road, Inch.  The council felt that the proposal would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard&mdash;the sight distance along the arterial road would be limited to approximately 375 feet.  The applicant said, as Deputy Esmonde stated, that he was prepared to relocate the pumps in such a way as to improve visibility and the traffic hazard would be lessened.  It was mentioned that there were already three other filling stations within two miles of the site and the proposed station would largely negate the improvements and realignments which had been carried out on the adjoining part of the road.</P>

      <P>It was held that the proper location of filling and service stations on arterial roads should be sited in or at towns and villages, preferably just within the speed limit zone and it was contended that towns and villages were sufficiently frequent in County Wexford to provide ample stations for the use of travellers.  My order stated that permission was being refused because the site adjoins an arterial road carrying fast and heavy traffic and the construction of a petrol filling station would give rise to traffic movements which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on this road and thereby endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard.  I think it is the experience that increasing the points of access to these arterial roads involves increasing the danger of accidents on these roads.  I do not know, but I have got the impression during the last few minutes&mdash; I do not know why&mdash;that this is getting a little monotonous.</P>

      <P>I agree to a certain extent with criticism of some planning authorities who make little effort to help applicants to reach any acceptable compromise, who are too rigid in regard to matters of minor planning significance or who try to pass on difficult decisions to the Minister.  I brought my views on this matter to the attention of the planning authorities in a circular letter last October and I am hopeful it is having beneficial effects even if it has not been reflected in the total number of appeals, to any great extent.  Deputy Clinton acknowledged that the steps being taken to reduce the number of appeals in his area were effective.</P>
      <P>At the time I sent out the circular, about one-third of all applications were being refused in County Dublin.  There are special difficulties in the area and I am gratified to see that the planning authority have now found it possible to make a substantial reduction in the number of refusals.  If the county council adopt realistic policies in their development plan and apply planning control in a reasonable way, it is reasonable to anticipate their decisions will be less often reversed on appeal.  I wish to emphasise that I will support any planning authority where there is adequate planning justification and where they are pursuing a proper planning or development objective; but there must always be room for differences of opinion if the right of appeal is to mean anything.  Technical advisers may and do disagree in all these cases</P>

      <P>Deputy Cluskey said that the Minister gives no reason or justification for his decisions.  He said that while a planning authority must give clearly its reasons for its decision on a planning application, the Minister is under no corresponding obligation to justify his ruling on planning appeals. This is quite wrong.  A planning authority giving permission is not required to give reasons and the Minister is in the same position.  Where a planning authority gives permission with conditions, or refuses permission, it must state its reasons and the Minister has exactly the same obligation.  The Minister's Orders, on appeals, where he refuses permission or attaches conditions invariably indicate the planning considerations which influence his decisions.</P>

      <P>The oral hearing was reported in the papers and with a certain amount of publicity.  That applied to a proposed development in St. Stephen's Green and another in Kildare Street and Molesworth Street.  The public and the press can attend these hearings and, as I say, in any case in which it is felt that publicity is appropriate, there is quite a considerable amount of publicity.  I have not got the deciding of what cases should be public and what cases should not be public. It is open to any party to the appeal, either the applicant for the development or another party to the appeal, to request an oral hearing and if so, an oral hearing is always allowed.  The Minister may himself direct an oral hearing and in some cases that is exactly what happens.  I directed that there should be an oral hearing.  In regard to Mountjoy Square, I did direct that there should be an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>The only reservation I have about these oral hearings is that there is a tendency to lose sight of the basic informality that was aimed at in the 1963 Act for these proceedings.  In a number of these cases, we have had an array of legal and professional advocates and the resultant cost for some parties was out of relation to the effect of the contributions made by these counsellors.  I would prefer if the appeals were decided in a more informal way.  I suppose it was no accident that the Fine Gael case for this Bill was led by three senior counsels and three solicitors.</P>

      <P>I told you twice.  I have before me at present 83 current appeals by third parties against the granting of permissions by planning authorities.  If we accepted the case that has been made, it would not be possible for these appeals to be made. If the planning authorities were to be the final arbiters, as Deputies have been saying, then these appeals could not have been made.  No fewer than 14 of these appeals are by Bord Fáilte, for instance, in relation to proposals in Kerry alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, there are seven current appeals from residents' associations and of course residents' associations can do no wrong, but if Deputies opposite had their way, residents' associations would not be able to appeal against these decisions which they, as members of planning authorities, <Col N="91" /> made.  That would deprive them of this facility.  There is one by An Oige, one by the Irish Ramblers Club, one by University College, Galway, one by Clonmel Chamber of Commerce, one by Lahinch Development Association, one by Fermoy Development Association, one by the Office of Public Works, one by the Gap of Dunloe Ponymen's Association, one by the Irish Society for the Protection of Birds, one by the Irish Sisters of Charity, one by the Irish Georgian Society.  Would it not be a dreadful thing if the Irish Georgian Society were prevented from appealing against decisions made by planning authorities?</P>

The fact that there are 14 current appeals by the body charged with responsibility for promoting tourism in respect of the Kerry area alone would imply that there is a substantial difference of opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with types of cases in which it would not be possible to reverse decisions if the situation that Deputies opposite wish apparently to bring about did, in fact, exist.  I did not intend to deal with these individually but, since Deputy L'Estrange insists, I will describe one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies may remember the case of the bungalow at Letterass, Leenane, Aashley Falls, in respect of which permission was given by the planning authority and an appeal was submitted by the Irish Mountaineering Club.  There is no doubt that the Irish Mountaineering Club had the Planning Act on their side in this.  There was only one decision I could make unfortunately; though my decision was undoubtedly the right one, it was a decision <Col N="92" /> I found it very difficult to make.  I did not know the person proposing to build the bungalow.  Permission was granted by the planning authority subject to two conditions&mdash;the house to be not less than 240 feet from the front boundary of the site as shown on the plan and detailed plans for the house and applicant's scheme for tree planting and landscaping to be submitted to the planning authority for approval. The planning authority believed apparently that the proposed structure would not adversely affect the amenities of the area.  The Irish Mountaineering Club believed otherwise.</P>
    <P>The area was visited by a planning inspector and he became quite lyrical about the beauties of the area.  I did not know the area myself but it was quite clear to me that this was a classical case; if this development were permitted, it could be pointed out as the type of development the Planning Act was specifically designed to prevent.  I found it very difficult, however, to refuse because I knew exactly what refusal meant to the owner of the site. He was a small farmer with a practically useless farm, a man who had tenaciously stuck to his own particular area and was trying to make the best living he could out of it.</P>
    <P>He suddenly found a patch of almost useless ground was worth a considerable sum of money.  It was beyond all doubt that this was a case in which the amenities of the area would be very seriously affected if the bungalow were erected.  That is the way the planning inspector, who recommended the decision to me, also felt about it.  But he, too, knew that it was a very great hardship on the individual who had suddenly got this opportunity of making some money out of this useless bit of land.  But the Planning Act required that the decision be taken and I had to reverse the decision of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that in so doing, I preserved a national asset and saved a beauty spot from being ruined.  In so doing, I had to inflict grave hardship on a man who could be described as an impoverished small farmer.  These are the only types of cases in which I have had any qualms of conscience or felt in any way worried about the <Col N="93" /> decisions I have made.  No doubt the people who appealed in this case had no such qualms.  Deputies may remember some of the agitation there was about this and some of the descriptions that were applied to the planning authority that could grant such permission. It would not be possible to deal with cases like that if the ultimate court of appeal was to be the planning authority itself, as had been suggested.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate that in view of the fact in particular that only a comparatively small number of Opposition Deputies have so far made their contribution it was necessary for me to refute the allegations that have been made, both in respect to the individual cases mentioned and the implied allegation that the Minister is responsible for all planning decisions when in fact it is well known that only a comparatively small percentage ever come before the Minister by way of appeal.  The remainder of these are dealt with at local level.  Either the permission is granted or the refusal of the planning authority is accepted.  I pointed out that in practically all these cases there is some element of profit for the proposer and therefore there is scope for allegations such as those Deputies have been making here either against the Minister or the planning authority.  These allegations have been made in both types of case, although the effort is usually to try to imply that the Minister is responsible for all. In order to illustrate this it was necessary for me to show by a random selection of cases dealt with by a Coalition Minister for Local Government that, if this Party had been of the same evil disposition as the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, similar allegations could be made.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, in so far as appeals against planning decisions are dealt with, they are dealt with in just the same way as any other cases in dispute. Somebody has to decide which aspect should prevail.  There is always a dispute, and usually between technically qualified people, as to the merits of the case.  There is a difference of opinion. Just as in legal cases, both sides have to take technical advice.  I am satisfied that the technical advice available to me is of the highest quality obtainable. <Col N="94" /> While I do not hold myself out as being infallible I am convinced that the suggestion in this Bill would not be an improvement.</P>
    <P>I think I have refuted the allegations made in individual cases so far.  In order to refute those that are to come I would have to go through the whole range of appeals decided by me. That would take some considerable time and I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily.  I have shown some of the difficulties that arise in some of these cases.  I have shown the type of thing that could happen if it were not possible to appeal to the Minister and if the final decision was to be made by the planning authority.  My only worry in these cases is where the refusal of permission has involved an element of hardship, usually not for the actual proposer but for the person selling the site.  In these cases I have agreed to refuse permission only when satisfied there was no way out.</P>
    <P>The preservation of areas of high amenity and scenic importance does not necessarily mean that no building of any kind whatever can be allowed. Even in such an area some building, if it is suitably located and suitably designed, may be allowed.  It is in the proliferation of building and unsuitable location and design that there is danger to these areas.  It is a difficult thing to decide just what can be allowed and what cannot be allowed in these areas. I can only go on the advice available to me.</P>
    <P>I think I should make some reference to the procedure laid down for dealing with planning appeals.  There is a definite procedure laid down.  I think it is as fair and equitable as any reasonable person could wish it to be.  It is contained in the Appeals and References Regulations, 1964&mdash;Statutory Instrument No. 216, 1964.  These were made before the 1963 Act was brought into operation.  An appeal must be made in writing.  It must state the subject matter and the grounds of the appeal.  On receipt of an appeal the Minister must give a copy to each other party to the appeal and must allow them a reasonable time in which to make any observations they think fit.  A copy of such observations must be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I was seeking to alert the people to the importance of the referendum issues: the abolition of PR, and the attempt to confer votes on the stones in the west of Ireland.  Eternal <Col N="97" /> vigilance is the price of liberty.  All sections of the Irish people should beware at present.  This is the second attempt within nine years by Fianna Fáil to secure a <i>modus operandi,</i> by reason of a referendum, which would rivet them in power for an indefinite period of time.  It is not sufficient that they have enjoyed being the Government for the past 30 years.  They want power eternal in this land.  They still think they have a Divine right to govern here, and no one else dare gainsay them.  Whenever they see the writing on the wall, or any danger to their position, any weakening of the flag, they immediately have the audacity to change the rules so that their position may be safeguarded.  There is a saying that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</P>

      <P>Their tendency towards outward corruption is amply manifest in their condonance of the previous speaker, the Minister for Local Government, and his approval of the businessman's organisation, Taca, which is there for the purpose of financially supporting the Government Party.  This is a new get-rich-quick element in our society.  They have banded themselves together to provide financial aid and comfort for the Government Party, on the understanding and stipulation that they will be well paid for their efforts by way of helps, grants, aids, stimulants.  In all that is going, they expect to get first preference&mdash;preferential treatment for this small core of rich people in our society who can contribute £100 per plate to the coffers of Fianna Fáil.  I assert that this is an outward naked exhibition of corruption, and Tammany Hall politics at its worst.</P>

      <P>This is an exhibition of corrupt tendencies, because it is clear that anyone who contributes a large sum of money like £100 to the coffers of a political Party expects something in return, and gets quite a lot in return.  It is tantamount to the acceptance of a bribe, on the understanding that political advantage will be conferred on the person concerned. It is also fair to assert that the people who pay the piper are entitled to call the tune.  The more this element of Taca get a grip on the Government Party, the more they will be able to influence the Government in respect of their designs, in respect of jobs and positions in industry, grants, helps, aids and stimulants of all kinds.</P>

      <P>It is right, therefore, that our people should be alerted to this tendency and made to realise what is likely to happen in the event, God forbid, of PR being abolished and this régime being copperfastened in power for an indefinite period of years.  I hate to think the kind of things which this Government would impose upon our people if they got this unbridled liberty which they are now seeking, and if there were not the kind of restraint which an effective Opposition have provided and maintained.

      <P>I assert that that régime would ride roughshod over the minority Parties and over every respectable element in our society, and corruption would be the order of the day.  That is not going to happen.  We have had a foretaste of their arrogance, their hostility and their disdain for the rights of ordinary people in recent months.  I am not very long a Member of this House.  I came in as a young Deputy in 1961 but in that short period of time, I have seen legislation being sought to be enacted here which undermined the fundamental rights of our people.</P>
      <P>I say to the Irish working-classes, the people for whom I speak: beware of Fianna Fáil if they get the majority they are now seeking.  I say this to the Fianna Fáil worker in particular who looks on us Labour men&mdash;even though he does not vote for us&mdash;as the watchdogs at local authority and national parliament level and who is the first to accuse us if we go slightly wrong in respect of labour matters.  These people would never dream of voting for me but they would have the audacity to take me to task in respect of what I say here.  Yet they exonerate their own members who bring in anti-working-class legislation of a thousand kinds, destroying their opportunities in life, dragging down their standards, and impeding them from having the full life for which we in the Labour movement stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to these workers, and the Fianna Fáil working-class in particular, who have been fooled and deluded into giving support to this régime, that Taca is now in charge of the Fianna Fáil Party; big business is the order of the day and big business will certainly be influencing legislation in the future.  We had a foretaste of that in recent legislation and there is other legislation on the stocks of which we are aware.  We have seen signs of this type of legislation in the ESB Act which proscribed strike action, denied the right to withdraw labour to these particular categories of workers and asserted the right of the Legislature to impose heavy fines and imprisonment on these workers if they dared to defy the Government by withdrawing <Col N="100" /> labour, irrespective of rotten conditions of employment or the kind of wages they were paid in the ESB.</P>
    <P>We also know that there is legislation on the stocks designed to make the Labour Court a court of law, a court of arbitration instead of conciliation, whose findings will be binding on the parties concerned, workers and employers, thereby destroying the conciliatory nature of the court.  Again, we would have penal clauses and repressive legislation indicating the fines and the imprisonment involved for workers if they dared challenge this new Labour Court, this new creation of Fianna Fáil-ism designed to subordinate the workers.  We know there is also industrial legislation on the stocks waiting until they get the kind of majority or backing they are hoping for, to implement it against the workers in respect of trade union law.  We know they are seeking to take unto themselves the right to decide what unions will come into being or go out of existence.</P>

      <P>We also have the arrogance, the hostility, disrespect and disdain shown to other sections of the community, apart from the working classes.  We had an example of the treatment given to the NFA in recent months, the refusal of the Minister for Agriculture to treat with them in respect of their agricultural problems. We had the spectacle of farmers sitting on the Minister's doorstep in abominable weather for several weeks, receiving no recognition.  We had all the unrest, the marches, the blockages and dislocation of traffic and all these things indicating grave unrest in a most important facet of our society.  If our Ministers show that disdain with a very slender majority in Government, what would they do if they got the overwhelming majority they are seeking now?</P>

I have referred briefly to the incontrovertible fact that there is anti-working class legislation lined up which seeks to take from the working class people the fundamental right to strike, to withdraw their labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bill took from these people the right to withdraw their labour irrespective of the conditions obtaining on the job.  I assert that the fundamental right to strike is something which Fianna Fáil or any other régime will never take from the Irish working classes.  It is too precious.  It was dearly won for our people and it will never be filched from them.  We will fight them in this House and in the streets, if need be, to defend that fundamental right, because, the difference between the free man and the slave is that the free man has the fundamental right to withdraw his labour.  Take that right from him and you relegate the free man to the realm of the slave.</P>
      <P>I have also indicated, speaking in terms of previous legislation, that we have had repressive legislation of other kinds when wages were frozen, and the like.  Workers must cease to be complacent and alert themselves to the prospect of what is likely to happen in the event, which God forbid, of PR being abolished.  I have said that our farmers have suffered severely at the hands of Fianna Fáil in recent times.</P>

It is sheer effrontery to suggest that this council represents in any shape or form the views, hopes or <Col N="106" /> aspirations of the farmers of this country.  It is simply a council established by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Neil Blaney, that he not merely sits on but sits on top of and dominates in every sense of the word.  It is indicative of the kind of things which are in store for the Irish farming community in the event of these people getting the kind of majorities they are now seeking in this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is likewise in respect of our business community.  We have now the invidious position of preferential treatment being given to a small section of our business men and women enshrined in a political group to aid and give comfort to the Government Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>To acknowledge the existence of Taca as an organisation providing an immense amount of money for the maintenance of the Government Party is to condone something tantamount to Tammany Hall politics, which is the acceptance of bribes on the understanding that favours will be granted.  Let there be no ambiguity about that.  This the Irish people understand quite well.  The <Col N="107" /> amazing feature about the whole thing is that the Government have had the audacity to condone this situation.  It is an indication of things to come.  I deplore this emergence of Tammany Hall politics, of political kudos and the condonance of the policy of jobs for the boys, unbridled nepotism and political patronage naked and unashamed in this country in 1968.  We have to face this whole question of the abolition of PR and the possibility of a junta getting into power in the southern portion of the country which would be as ruthless as that which has dominated the North since 1922; may I say here that the junta in the North is so entrenched, backed by armed force, that opposition cannot and does not prevail against it.  The gerrymandering that goes on with the single-seat constituency there is such that very many of these constituencies are not contested at all.  It is futile even to put up candidates in opposition to Unionists entrenched in quite a substantial number of the constituencies in North-East Ulster.</P>
      <P>This is the system Fianna Fáil want us to apply here in Southern Ireland, and I want to assert that the system which they want us to apply here is even more ruthless than the Northern system, because be it said in fairness to the system in the North that there you have a postal vote.  If you are registered there at a given time you are entitled to a postal vote in England.  I challenge the Government to include in this measure a postal vote for the Southern Irish in England.  Let us have here what is enshrined in the North-East Ulster system, the postal vote and let us see the outcome.  Why is it not here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

Were they to be given the postal vote they would be rid of you in the morning.  If we are to have the British system, the North-East Ulster system, I challenge you to include in it a postal vote as well.</P>
      <P>I say these things in the knowledge that this issue will not pass, that it is defeated from the very start, if one is to judge by the lack of appreciation and enthusiasm with which the Taoiseach's speech was received by his own Party members last week.  If one is to have regard to the poll taken by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> you are in for a terrible beating.  It is indicative of things to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I read them all.  I am not a bigot, and I do not believe that the <i>Irish Press</i> or the <i>Sunday Press</i> have in them the truth in the news either. One must look elsewhere for truth in this country&mdash;the <i>Irish Times</i> which has been slandered by the Minister for Local Government for the past few weeks, the voice of liberality and truth. I have indicated as best I can the kind of legislation which is likely to come under strong government of the kind which could emerge if PR were abolished.  I have said there is no likelihood of that.  At the same time, one must question the ulterior motive which prompted the Government to bring it back as an issue in public life at this juncture.  One must question the reason for the establishment of the Constitution Committee.  I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in the House because he was the Chairman of the Constitution Committee, an all-Party body set up to review the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain organs attached to the Government are now seeking to purport that the Constitution Committee recommended the abolition of PR. This is utterly untrue.  There is no foundation in fact for that; on the contrary, all the indications are that this whole matter of the abolition of <Col N="109" /> PR was completely glossed over.  I think it true to say&mdash;the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, who was a respected member of that body, is on record as saying that the fact that PR was an issue in 1959, the Government could not again make it an issue after such a short duration of time, it having been rejected by the people, and that the proposition to abolish PR and establish single-seat constituencies and the single non-transferable vote could not, he said, again be put to the people at the present time.  Far from condoning or indicating that this should be an issue now, the main Government spokesmen on this Committee disavowed any notion that PR could be made an issue once again and indicated that alternatives would have to be proposed&mdash;the single-seat constituency with the transferable vote might be put forward but to put the same issue as was put in 1959, Deputy Seán Lemass indicated, was something which the Government could not justify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been seeking to demonstrate that this attempt to abolish PR was defeated in 1959 in the most favourable circumstances for the Government Party, in that they were running at that time for President Mr. Eamon de Valera, the acknowledged leader of their Party.  Their <Col N="110" /> chances were never so good at abolishing PR and copperfastening themselves in power as they were then under the leadership, the mantle, the mystique of Eamon de Valera.  They have no chance whatsoever of abolishing it under the leadership of Jack Lynch.  They know that now and I am sure they regret deeply ever having made this an issue.</P>
      <P>I believe&mdash;it is a personal opinion&mdash; that the Government were prompted to attempt to abolish PR, in the mistaken belief that on this occasion, they would be getting the support of Fine Gael or an important section of that Party, and that by so doing, they would annihilate the Labour Party.  Let it be said it is the Labour Party you seek to destroy in this proposition and we are in no doubt and under no illusion about that proposition.  I want to alert the workers of this country to the fact that this is what they seek to destroy. The emergence of Liberty Hall in this city has struck terror into the hearts of Fianna Fáil.  The emergence of a strong and virile labour movement here, the swing of votes towards labour in the city, has panicked the Fianna Fáil Government.  They have seen the resurgence of labour and they are seeking now to nip this upsurge of labourism before it disbands them and throws them out of office, and they were prepared to row in with anyone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They made a mistake which they regret and it would be far more honourable for them to admit that it was a mistake and withdraw these despicable measures because the Irish people may be fools some of the time but they are not so foolish as to give a mandate to Fianna Fáil to rule indefinitely.  They have not taken leave of their senses and you will have to do a lot better before you convince the Irish people that they should give you this unbridled right to govern, and govern ruthlessly, for an indefinite period of time to come.  I am not worried about these measures in the sense that they are defeated already but we are concerned about the audacity and the ulterior motive and the totalitarian ideas behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people are too wise in their generation and we do have a half million young voters coming on the register since 1959, young people who are asserting themselves, challenging, demanding, liberal in their outlook, conscious of their rights.  They are no fools.  They know Fianna Fáil too well to trust them with this power.  They see the tendencies towards oppression and this younger generation would not dream of supporting this idea of the abolition of PR and allowing into existence here a régime which could <Col N="112" /> and would be as oppressive as the régime has been in North-East Ulster and would probably last as long.  There would be stirrings in our society; there would be the emergence of the dissident elements in our society; there would be the assertion of rights; and my fear is and the fear of my colleagues in this great democratic Party of ours&mdash;and let it be said here and now that in the trade union movement, in the labour movement, industrial and political, is enshrined the bulwark of democracy in this country, the only Party in the State who are truly sincere in respect of the assertions of fundamental rights under PR, and this cannot be gainsaid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Armed men, demanding their rights and asserting their rights and you may well be responsible for tearing down the pillars of our democratic society by this proposal, if, God forbid, it passed this House and passed the country, because I assert that our people, with their long tradition of freedom for which we fought for seven hundred years, would not accept from an Irish régime that which we did not accept from the British.  Any diminution of our rights, our duties and our responsibilities would be opposed and if we were muzzled in parliament, these rights would be asserted in the streets of this city.  The Labour movement would be in the forefront of any such <Col N="113" /> campaign as it was in the early part of this century.  We are conscious of the fact that it was our martyred founder and leader, James Connolly, who marched out from Liberty Hall, which is the object of sarcasm from Fianna Fáil at the present time, under the flag of the Citizen Army to the GPO to assert our rights to freedom.  He did not have on his forehead the badge of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  He was Labour and the acknowledged founder of our Party.  The same courage and determination is in our people today, as was there then, to uphold the fundamental rights of our people.  No régime, native or foreign, can filch those rights from us.</P>
      <P>I want to say in respect of this challenge to fundamental rights that one of the most unsavoury things which has happened in recent times is the attempt by Fianna Fáil to suppress freedom of speech and fair reporting of the facts of life in this country.  We have reason to believe that attempts are being made to suppress the dissemination of the facts from Radio Telefís Éireann.  It has been adverted to in this House in recent days and it surely is a portrait of the kind of jackboot police state we would live in if PR is abolished.  In the past few weeks, an ultimatum was issued by a chief in Radio Telefís Éireann to certain responsible men in respect of the dissemination of news. The head of news indicated: &ldquo;We are not to give the pro or contra views of PR, no matter who puts them forward.&rdquo; The most vital issue that has come into this House for a long number of years, an amendment to our Constitution, the abolition of PR, the lifeline of the people and of Deputies who enter this House, is not to be reported on.  PR is about to be abolished and a junta in Fianna Fáil issues instructions on this vital issue.</P>

We know as politicians in the country at large the kind of intimidation that is adopted by Fianna Fáil against all sections of the community. Insidious threats and pressures are exerted on our people.  We know of the attempt being made by Fianna Fáil agents to dominate the lives of our people by threats and intimidations. The threats and intimidations are in certain cases of a most scurrilous kind in many parts of the country.  I have evidence of that in my own constituency.  There is a threat to the old age pensioners that if they do not vote for Fianna Fáil, they will lose their pensions.  There is also a threat to the unfortunate widow, the unemployed, the poor old warrior with an IRA pension that if he does not do what the Party expect him to do, his pension will be in jeopardy.</P>

Our people will not be bribed, bullied or intimidated.  We have a right in this parliament to protect our people.  They need not have any fear of those threats.  They are wholly unjustified and our Government, no matter what Government it is, have the right, the duty and the responsibility to give our people those things in respect of work, in respect of welfare, in respect of health and all those other services.  They owe these not to the Fianna Fáil Party or anyone else.

      <P>Please allow me to say what Eamon de Valera said in respect of PR.  He went on:</P>
      <P>The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country; we have to be very grateful that we have had a system of PR here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have a fair representation of Parties....</P>
      <P>The then Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we get, probably, in this country more than any other country, better balanced results from the system we have.  If you <Col N="118" /> take the countries where PR exists you get better balanced results than you get in other countries.</P>
    <P>Again, the Taoiseach added:</P>
    <P>I think we get the benefits of PR in reasonably balanced legislation here better than in any other country I have read about or know anything about.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the system you are asserting as being British in design imposed on us by the British is something else which has got the blessing of your acknowledged uncrowned king, Eamon de Valera.  He gave it his blessing on many occasions as you can see from these reports, and for the second time in nine or ten years, you now seek to throw overboard all these high sentiments on PR by Fianna Fáil spokesmen of the most important kind; you have turned a somersault and so you are now opting again for the straight vote.</P>

      <P>I wish to place on the records of the House the point of view of Eamon de Valera when condoning and approving PR.  He said it was the system we knew best, the system best suited to our people's needs.  Now we have Deputy Lynch, his successor as Taoiseach, saying the very opposite. He is trying to find all kinds of serious difficulties in PR.  He said the number of candidates was too great and the people were having difficulties as to whom to vote for.  Did you ever hear such nonsense, as if the Irish people have not their minds made up before they see the ballot paper, no matter how great the number of personalities that are on a ballot paper? Our intelligent people always had their minds made up as to whom they will vote for and to suggest that they find difficulty in finding names on a ballot paper is an insult to our people's intelligence.</P>

      <P>I cannot reiterate these sentiments often enough so that the people will be alerted to the attack which is being made upon their fundamental liberties by this power-crazy régime.  It may have been well illustrated by other people but there is very little democracy about the system which they now propose.  We know that a Party who secured as little as 35 per cent of the votes cast could secure the seat, even though 65 per cent of the people voted against the candidate.  We would have government by the minority.  We would have a Deputy representing a single seat constituency for whom 65 per cent of the people did not vote, who most probably hated his guts and would not touch him with a 40 foot pole in respect of making representations in regard to their needs or making requests of any kind such as Deputies are used to nowadays.  This individual would purport to represent all the people in his constituency.  Even in the areas where Fine Gael or Labour have strong prospects of winning under the single seat system, you would gerrymander the constituency in the way it is done in the North and see to it by a manipulation that your man got in by a fraction.  Fianna Fáil would get there every time, and once you get there, you will copperfasten him and see to it that it would be futile ever again for anybody to dare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not casting any aspersions on the Bench, but we know full well that it would be the designs of Fianna Fáil, and of Fianna Fáil alone, which would emanate from this Commission. What Fianna Fáil want in any constituency would be what would prevail and it is the Fianna Fáil <Col N="123" /> Deputies, or those fortunate enough to get themselves nominated, who would have the say and very largely carve up this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have had evidence of that in Radio Telefís Éireann.  We know the results we can get from this system and how we can have minority representation for our people.  We know that this proposal would very largely disfranchise our people.  The Taoiseach has sought to establish merit for the single-seat constituency and the single representative in the area by referring to the better service the representative would give, the greater attention he would be able to devote to his work here in the national Parliament, the fact that he would be &ldquo;the&rdquo; man&mdash;and the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; is underlined in his speech&mdash;in his constituency. He would be all things to all men and all men would be obliged to go to him for their needs and for their wants.  He would be the father of them all.  Imagine that.  At present we have a choice, and if we do not like the Fianna Fáil man, we can go to the Fine Gael man, or to the Labour man, or possibly to an Independent. This is only right.  People have a choice and no one individual is foisted on them.  You may well have a situation in the single-seat constituency where the individual concerned is so disliked by the mass of the people that they would not go to him with their representations, and they would be obliged to cross into the neighbouring constituency to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We could have the situation in which the Fianna Fáil Deputy was elected with 35 per cent of the votes, even though 65 per cent voted against him and did not want him.  This is not democracy as we know it.  We could also have a situation in which the Fianna Fáil candidate got 30 per cent of the votes, the Fine Gael candidate got 25 per cent of the votes, the Labour candidate got 23 per cent and, say, an Independent, or a Sinn Féin candidate or a Liberal, got 22 per cent, and the Fianna Fáil candidate would get the seat, although 70 per cent of the people had voted against him.  This is minority representation. If in the country 51 per cent of the votes are conferred on the Government candidates, the Government get all the seats, even though 49 per cent voted against them who get no representation whatsoever in the national Parliament.  We have seen the vagaries of the system too often in other parts.  It is a system alien to our way of life.  As I said, it is not because we are a small Party and it is not for any ulterior motive of political expediency that we are fighting for the retention of proportional representation.  We are fighting for its retention on the principle that it is both fair and just.  It gives the right of representation to minorities.  If we deviate from that, we shall move gradually towards domination of a tyrannical dictatorial kind, again something alien to our way of life.  We will undermine the pillars of our democratic society and way of life by tampering with the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Commission which it is proposed to establish, we in the Labour Party can have no confidence whatsoever in any such Commission.  We do not believe it would give us the fair play we would hope for in regard to the revision of constituencies.  We are concerned about the principle of one man, one vote.  It would be possible under this proposed measure to elect a representative in the western counties with <Col N="125" /> fewer votes than it would take to elect a representative in the eastern or southern counties.  That is wrong. If the population in the West has fallen, that is the fault of Fianna Fáil. The people do not want favours of this kind conferred on them.  They want work.  They want dignity.  Thirty years of Fianna Fáil Government have been responsible for the denudation of the West and the haemorrhage of emigration from that area.  Remember the pretence of anxiety to revive the language.  The Gaeltacht was allowed to die.  It is not votes the people want; it is not Fianna Fáil Deputies. They have had enough of them and little good they did them.  They want a square deal.  They want work.</P>

I am all for the postal vote, the vote for the emigrants.  If they had the vote, we would have good government very quickly in this country. Not one of the Deputies on the Government benches at the moment would hold his seat for 24 hours and damn well they know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conferring votes on a geographic basis means votes for the stones in the <Col N="126" /> West as distinct from the people.  That is wrong.  It is undemocratic that it should take three votes to elect a Deputy in our constituencies when it will require only two votes to elect a Deputy in the west of Ireland.  We do not think that conducive to an improvement in the low standard of living of the people of the West.  It will be of no benefit to the people. It will mean no improvement in their way of life, no better prospect of a job.  This is proposed for the sole purpose of maintaining Fianna Fáil representation in the West by fair means or foul, and these are essentially foul means.  In equity and justice, when a population declines, the number of representatives should fall proportionately. It is not the fault of our Party that the people have run out of the west of Ireland.

On the contrary: it is the straight vote and the single seat which creates the dominating, overbearing tyranny; that is illustrated very clearly by the Stormont régime.

    <P>It is a mockery when we hear the Taoiseach talking about respecting county boundaries in the new carving up that will take place in the months ahead, if PR is abolished.  We have evidence of that prior to the 1961 general election.  I was a victim of it myself.  I stood in the then constituency of South Tipperary, which comprised then the southern part of Tipperary, and Tipperary only.  In the gerrymander and carving up Fianna Fáil did at that time&mdash;perhaps it was done by a commission presided over by an honourable judge or maybe the Minister for Local Government himself&mdash;I do not know&mdash;they made a damn good job of it.  Talk about having respect for county boundaries and the traditions of the people, they brutally carved up this area and tacked on to my constituency a big slice of West Waterford stretching from Ballymacarbery to the bridge of Youghal. At present mine is a very difficult constituency to operate.  It commences near Thurles and goes down to the very bridge of Youghal.  This is the manner in which Fianna Fáil carved up the historic counties of Waterford and Tipperary in the last piece of <Col N="128" /> gerrymandering we witnessed in 1961. They showed a complete disregard for the wishes of the people of the Déise, a proud people&mdash;the people of Waterford&mdash;in respect of their traditional boundaries.</P>

The man responsible, in the main, for carving up the counties of Waterford and Tipperary was the then Deputy Loughman.  It is a fact that it was he who held the knife and carved the boundaries in the belief that he was going to annihilate Deputy Kyne in Waterford and destroy my chance of being elected in South Tipperary. The result was that Deputy Kyne, the man they wanted to put out by this gerrymander and brutal carving up of these natural boundaries, was elected at the head of the poll and I was elected at the head of the poll in my constituency of South Tipperary. The Irish people can smell a despicable trick a mile away.  This backfired badly on the then Deputy Loughman and was responsible for sweeping him into the political oblivion from which he has never emerged and never will.</P>

      <P>They have a small majority in this House now and we have witnessed here tonight their arrogant attempt to silence the voice of an ordinary Deputy on a vitally important issue.  What would it be like if they got the majority some professors of political science say they could get with the abolition of PR?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I want to advert to what the Taoiseach said.  He commented on the county boundaries and he also adverted to the accountability of Deputies and implied that Deputies were guilty of unfair practices in relation to one another.  This does not affect Labour Party Deputies because, unfortunately, as yet, we are not in the happy position of having more than one Deputy in any given constituency. Therefore, we are not worried about unfair practices such as poaching.  We know this goes on, and we know the Taoiseach is worried about it, and many other Deputies as well.  There is this pretence that they are doing things for people to which the people are entitled by right.  The Taoiseach is correct in saying that, but he is indicting, in the main, Fianna Fáil Deputies. It is a well-known fact that they are running around the constituencies pretending that they and they alone can do things of this kind, that Fianna <Col N="132" /> Fáil were sent from Heaven to govern the Irish people, and that anything we have was conferred on us by Fianna Fáil: our jobs, our health services, our houses, our pensions.  These things are ours by right and not by reason of the generosity of Fianna Fáil or anyone else.  I know there are many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who are what my friend Deputy Dunne would refer to as the parish priests in the constituencies and who want to get rid of the curates.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the accountability of Deputies and I appreciate the reason for the Taoiseach's remark.  He also mentioned the desirability of having a better quality TD.  Again I feel that was a serious inindictment of the calibre and ability of the people in his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wonder that they did not rise to the occasion and applaud vociferously after his puerile speech the other day when he commented upon his desire for a better quality TD.  That is indicative of the fact that a lot of the dead wood of the Fianna Fáil is being collected and would be quickly removed.  The straight vote system and the safe seat system would entitle the Chief to impose his Deputy on the people.  These Deputies see the writing on the wall and when the test comes, they will not be all that active in the campaign. Indeed we know that the last time they were whispering to their friends: &ldquo;Make sure you do not vote for that.&rdquo; We know the lack of enthusiasm there is for this venture.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach maintains that under his proposal the people will have a more effective choice not only in the selection of candidates but also in the selection of the Government.  Again, this is a lot of drivel.  There is no logic, no sense, in that sentiment.  Indeed, the opposite is true.  Under PR, the electorate have a choice, and they can exercise that choice and vote 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on, in the order of their choice. Likewise, they have a choice in relation to the Government.  They know the Government Party and they know the alternatives.  It is wrong for the Taoiseach to suggest that under PR, the voters have no means of voting for a Government.  The fact that they have been in power for so long is proof of that.  They got back into office time and time again.  They have been able to govern successively for the past ten years.</P>

      <P>Abuse of power was the order of the day.  I believe that the real feeling behind this move is an ingrained appreciation that power is slipping from them, that in the next general election they will be thrown out of power.  That is the full reason and the only reason why this attempt is being made, for the second time within the past nine years, to abolish PR.  It is a great effrontery to our people that the Constitution should be trifled with in this way.  I have said that the Constitution Committee was nothing less than a gigantic fraud.  I believe that Deputy Colley, Deputy Lemass and other Fianna Fáil Deputies wanted to create the impression that it was a committee to amend the Constitution. It was designed primarily to give an aura of respectability but the ulterior motive was to use it as a basis to abolish PR.  They were never serious about amending the Constitution in the many ways in which it needs to be amended.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy Tully of the Labour Party and members of the Fine Gael Party time after time gave assiduously of their energy and efforts and talents to amend our Constitution in a rational way, but I believe these honourable gentlemen, these colleagues of mine, were used by Fianna Fáil as dupes and tools. Their brains were picked and from the word go Fianna Fáil had predetermined that this was the means to abolish PR, and bringing in questions like divorce and other things was only by the way.  The real motive was to attack our civil liberties again and pretend that this was a recommendation from the Constitution Committee.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the form in which it was put in 1959.  Despite that firm conviction of this old warrior and wily politician, the Taoiseach has had the foolishness to put it in that form which is doomed to an ignominious failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asserting that the formation of that Committee and the utilisation of the time, talents and energies of Members of the House over a period for the alleged purpose of amending the Constitution was a gigantic fraud perpetrated on the House and the country <Col N="137" /> and the ulterior motive was to fasten on to this idea of abolishing PR and find some ways and means of copperfastening themselves in power by this unfair method.</P>
    <P>I sought to prove also that far from being the British system of election, PR is an Irish system approved and ratified by the father of Sinn Féin, Arthur Griffith, approved and ratified also by Eamon de Valera and Deputy Seán Lemass and others, adopted by the people of Sligo in the early part of this century, facilitated admittedly, by a British Act of Parliament.  It was the wish of the people of Sligo that this be their system of election, the then method of election, the straight vote, having brought bad results so far as that small community was concerned, and it clearly did not give fair representation on that corporation to the various minority interests in their society.</P>
    <P>I now want to quote the views which Fianna Fáil expressed when the present system of the straight vote and single-seat constituency was introduced in Northern Ireland.  Fianna Fáil were most irate and denunciatory in their pronouncements at the time of the Orange Order and the unfairness of the imposition this would be on the minority, the Nationalists and Catholics of Ulster.  Again, I quote from volume 171, column 1071, the views expressed by Fianna Fáil when the Stormont Government abolished PR. The Government here protested, and I quote the statement issued at that time. They said:</P>
    <P>This is to smash minorities and this is to deprive people of their electoral rights; this is to weaken and to retard the anti-partition groups in the Six Counties; this is typical of the Orange dictatorship complex which operates in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil said it was unfair and unjust to have done that then.  Now they are seeking to do it themselves, seeking to place themselves in the same position with the same dominant influence enjoyed by the Orange Order North of the Border.</P>
    <P>I have expressed most of the sentiments <Col N="138" /> I wanted to voice on these measures.  I deem this an important historic occasion.  I might not have wasted breath on the subject; I might be regarded as wasting my sweetness on the desert air because, thank God, these measures will not pass into law. Despite that, I would be failing in my duty to the sentiments prompting me to react in this way at the attempt to dominate by clique in this country if I did not express these views.  It would be a sad day if, due to complacency on the part of the electorate, in the mistaken belief that this measure is going to be defeated by a sweeping majority such as the <i>Sunday Independent</i> indicated, people refrained from voting.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in speaking and speaking at such length is to alert our people to the risk there is that Fianna Fáil might get away with this.  I am well aware of the tremendous political force they are and that there are no depths to which they will not sink in an effort to achieve their designs. I am concerned that our people might be complacent, and that by any freak of fortune the Government might get away with these designs.  It would be a retrograte step.  It would mean the end of democracy in this country, possibly for all time.  Only a revolution of a bloody kind would arrest the situation.  This is why I have in particular addressed my voice to my fellow workers in the country at large.  I am not unmindful or ungrateful of the magnificent, herculean part played by the trade unions in 1958-59 to save PR. To them in very large measure lies the credit for saving our way of life, our rights, our liberty.  Our democratic way of life was saved by Congress, by the unions, by the magnificent fight made in 1958-59.  They are with us again, bigger and better and more united than ever before.  In Congress, in labour, industrial and political, there lies the bastion, the last defence of democracy in this country, not as a matter of political expediency but on principle alone.</P>
    <P>I believe our workers are wiser now. I especially address my remarks to the Fianna Fáil supporter workers, misguided as they have been.  Having <Col N="139" /> regard to the things which Fianna Fáil has in store for them if they get the power they now seek, they will regret it all the days of their lives.  They will be relegated to slaves in their own land. Legislation in regard to essential rights, such as the right to strike, the right of negotiation between employer and employee, fundamental rights attached to the Labour Court, decisions as to what unions will come into being and what unions will go out of existence&mdash;all these fundamental pieces of legislation in respect of industry, the Labour Court, and so on&mdash;are likely to come in very soon and backed now by the sinister influences of the new unscrupulous executives in Taca.  The people ought to be more wary than ever before of giving to this Government that kind of power which they seek because we know full well that that power would be abused.  We know full well that Fianna Fáil as at present administered at the top cannot be trusted with power of that kind and that our people will quickly find themselves living in a police state under the jackboot.  That is why we in the Labour Party challenged this issue from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, challenged its First Reading, challenge it at every stage, challenge it in this House, challenge it in the country, at the hustings and if, which God forbid, this were to be passed, we would challenge it in the streets as well in more determined fashion.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal that we hold precious in our Constitution, which was given to us by Fianna Fáil and they should be the last to seek its amendment by trifling with the method of election.  It was they who gave us this Constitution in 1937.  A majority of our people voted for it on the advice of Eamon de Valera and Eamon de Valera included in that Constitution at that time and it was ratified by the Irish people that the method of election shall be that known as proportional representation.  I have quoted the high sentiments expressed by that man in respect of PR : it was a system we were used to; it had worked well; it was peculiarly suited to our way of life; gave adequate representation to <Col N="140" /> minorities.  It has been very good to Fianna Fáil.  Outside of the Iron Curtain, outside of Russia and its satellites I do not know of any party which has ruled for so long in a democracy as Fianna Fáil.  Ours is a young State, established in 1922, and under PR the people gave to you the responsibility to govern, the destinies of our country, for over 30 years.  You have been out of office for approximately only ten years.  Was that not stable government?  Was that not a fair opportunity to govern, to rule?  Is that not sufficient for you?  Do you now seek to arrogate to yourselves the right to govern always?</P>
    <P>I believe that if PR were abolished, you would take about yourselves quickly all the unsightly things that one associates with dictatorship.  No one would be free to express a point of view contrary to Fianna Fáil.  We have seen your arrogance in the past years in respect of our workers, our farmers and businessmen.  We have seen the arrogance and disdain which you show for certain newspapers, for certain viewpoints expressed in certain newspapers, the arrogance and disdain of the Minister for Local Government who has reflected in a very lamentable way on one of our best media of objective news reporting.  I refer to the <i>Irish Times</i>.  He has utilised the time of this House to make a constant attack upon this paper.  I have already adverted to the attempt to deny mention of this debate on this great national issue, the pros and cons of PR, whether or not PR should be abolished, to the audacity of Fianna Fáil agents to instruct those responsible for the dissemination of news on Radio Telefís Éireann that the <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i> in regard to proportional representation were not to be referred to, adverted to in any way, from either side.  This was clearly to the advantage of the Government Party. They set out deliberately here to silence the voice of all opposition.  This, again, has fearful portent for the Irish people, if they will examine it in minute detail.</P>
    <P>I believe that if Fianna Fáil got the kind of majorities of 40 or 50 seats they would snap their fingers at the Opposition.  We would be of no avail <Col N="141" /> here and they would with disdain do these things: they would control Radio Telefís Éireann; they would suppress the <i>Irish Times</i> and all other newspapers that had a <i>contra</i> point of view. We would have jackboot government in every sense of the word.  The signs are all there.  The people can read them.  Worst of all, there are now the signs of outright, naked corruption, condoned by the establishment of Taca, granting approval and licence to nothing but a bribe for political patronage.</P>

I know the Minister would like to suppress the points of view we have to express here, and even after we express them here, he would like to ensure that they never appear in any public organ, that the public never heard the defence we made of human rights and dignity in this House.

      <P>If repetition is required to alert our people to what you are trying to put across on them, I make no apology for it.  The choice is a simple one for our people.  Perhaps they have already made up their minds. To deny the principle of one man, one vote and to abolish PR&mdash;that is something I believe the Irish people will never do.  The Government will get their answer in June or July when they put this issue to the test.  It may well transpire that, when they realise what little chance they have of stuffing this issue down the necks of our people, <Col N="142" /> they will withdraw these proposals. However, whether they withdraw them or not, I want to assert again that this is in the main the action of a cowardly Government who have lost their political nerve and realise that they are going to take a terrible beating from the people at the polls in this referendum and at the next general election.  Thank goodness, there is an alternative for the Irish people when they are put out of office.</P>
      <P>I hope I have said sufficient to convery how strongly we in the Labour Party feel in regard to these matters. The time for battle has already arrived as far as we are concerned, and we intend to fight this issue every inch of the way.  We hope to alert our people against apathy or complacency so that this terrible Bill is not passed into law, because eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and the Irish people must recognise that now as never before.</P>

      <P>I should like to commence by congratulating Deputy Treacy on a reasonably effective fili-buster. I would, however, point out to him that with the strain of having to keep going and of repeating the same points over and over, he may not have paid too much attention to some of the things he said, but in particular, I hope he did not really mean what he said for about the fifth time when he threatened that if this referendum should be carried by a majority vote of the people, he and his colleagues were going to oppose it on the streets in civil war.  I feel sure he did not mean that and that when he thinks it over, he will realise that that is a sentiment that, given thought, he would not like to put forward, and that, furthermore, it negatives his whole posture and that of his Party as being the defenders of democracy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said it many times.  There is no doubt about what he meant.  The point I want to make is that we are dealing with two very important measures at the moment. The Taoiseach in introducing the Second Stage, approached these Bills in a calm, non-dramatic way.  Because he did so, he is being accused of not having enthusiasm for the legislation and of not having enthusiasm behind him in the measures.  I think that if the Deputies want really to do a service to the people, they will discuss these very important measures as objectively as any of us can, realising that none of us can be truly objective; each of us has a certain axe to grind. I do not think it helps the debate in this House, nor does it help the understanding by the public at large of the issues here, to suggest that, on the one hand, you have the defenders of democracy and, on the other hand, people who want to set up a dictatorship in this country, to silence the newspapers, to silence all communications media. This does not help.  Everybody knows that this just is not true.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is another matter.  The point I want to put to the House is this.  We are talking about the electoral system: the two points at issue are the tolerance and the single seat with the straight vote. It seems to me that there is plenty of time for argument, particularly on the question of the straight vote, plenty of time for legitimate argument by people as to the respective merits of our present system versus the proposed system.  I think people can argue in good faith on various points that can be put forward.  Anybody on this side of the House will admit that there are merits in the present system which would not exist in the system we propose. Furthermore, they would claim, and I think with reason, that there are merits in the system we propose which do not exist in the system that we have. The issue as we see it is to weigh up the merits and the demerits of the various systems and to decide and to ask the people to decide, having weighed up these merits and demerits, what is in the best interests of the country, having regard to the future as we see it shaping up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that quotations from past speeches, whether made on this side of the House or on the other side &mdash;because each side can make quotations from the leaders of the other side on this question which will suit the situation&mdash;are missing the whole point. People may be scoring debating points here but what we are concerned with is the future of this country and what the people of this country want; how they see our community developing; in particular, what the young people of this country want and are the young people of this country who are going to carry on satisfied that the present system is the one most suited to give us <Col N="145" /> an effective political system or can we improve that system and are the proposals being put forward by the Government now designed to improve that system.  I suggest that they are, and I suggest also that it is on this basis that the debate should be conducted and that the posing of people as defenders of democracy and presenting their opponents as jack-booted Nazis just is not helping the debate at all and is not helping the people.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that we have not been inclined, I think, to talk in public realistically about the situation in politics in this country under our system of PR.  Any realistic assessment of the present situation will reveal that we in Fianna Fáil have been in power for a very long time under PR; that if we ever go out of office under the PR system, almost inevitably we are going to come back at the next election, and furthermore anybody who is honest and realistic about the situation will admit that under PR neither Fine Gael nor Labour have any hope of forming a Government on their own.</P>

The <Col N="149" /> truth and the fact is that if Fine Gael were realistic, they would be looking for this system and we in Fianna Fáil, if we were thinking only of our Party, would be totally opposed to it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are not supermen, some other reason must exist for our being in office so long.  I suggest that if the Opposition accept, as apparently they do, that we are not supermen, they must agree that the reason we have been in office so long and are now stronger than ever is that the system of PR is designed to ensure that there can be no great swing one way or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, if we want to see in this country a situation in which the voter has a real choice, a choice between Fianna Fáil in Government at the moment and a viable alternative Government, if that is what the voter is to have, I believe that is what he can never have under the PR system.  The only choice he has is Fianna Fáil or some unknown combination of Fine Gael and Labour, the details of which he will never know until the results of the election are known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  There are only three votes between the Government and the Opposition.  Why are you talking like that?  You know there are only three votes.  If Deputy <Col N="150" /> Finucane were not sick and if Deputy Sheridan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the situation, therefore, is that any realistic assessment of the situation will show that there can be no alteration in the political system in this country under PR except Fianna Fáil going out to some kind of combination of Fine Gael and Labour and we know that in the next election Fianna Fáil will come back again.  I am human enough not to want to see Fianna Fáil going out of office but I am also sufficiently concerned with the welfare of my country to know that for any Party, Fianna Fáil or any other, to be in office forever would be a disaster for this country.  That being so, it seems to me that the obligation we have when we are considering the question of our electoral system is to try to devise a system that will give the kind of choice I am talking about, an effective Opposition in office as a viable alternative Government.</P>
      <P>This is something this country has not had except when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, we had an effective Opposition and we had a viable alternative but apart from those periods since 1932, we have not had an effective Opposition.  I suggest that the young people of this country are not satisfied with the political set-up in this country.  They are not satisfied with the fact that there is no effective Opposition in Dáil Éireann and that there is no viable alternative Government. They are entitled to get that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way they can get it is to change to single member constituencies.  If we want to discuss this issue on the basis of what is good for our country, we have also to admit and declare that this could be against our own interests as a Party.  I have endeavoured to suggest that although it has been argued that the Fianna Fáil interest is to have straight vote single member constituencies, it is in the Party's interests to retain PR.  Whatever number of seats we might get under the straight vote single member <Col N="151" /> constituencies&mdash;whatever number of seats we might get&mdash;and of course the things that are being quoted in this House about that are completely untrue, but if they were true, the point is that under that system you could with a relatively small swing in support put the Government out and put another Government in, which is something which can never happen under PR.</P>

I think it might be interesting to examine why it is that the Fine Gael Party, for instance, are not looking for the single member straight vote system.  It would be very interesting <Col N="152" /> and revealing if one could only find out.  It is clear that some members of the Fine Gael Party, and particularly front bench members, want this system.  That is not denied.  If you look at the people concerned, you will find they are people in the main&mdash;not entirely&mdash;who have been carrying the burden of the Fine Gael Party in Opposition in this House, such as it is, over the years.  They are the people who really oppose and who try to oppose effectively.  Then look at the people who take the other view, which is clearly contrary to the interests of their Party.  They are concerned with their own personal position and they do not apparently feel sufficient confidence in their Party and policies to feel that in a fair fight under the system if they do not win this time, they will win the next time.</P>

I proposed to the Committee that a section of the Committee's report dealing alone <Col N="156" /> with the electoral system might be made available to the Government, because I did not think that the report as a whole would be available, but I made it clear that these proposals were going to be considered by the Government, whether they got the report or not.</P>

We are getting close to that system here because of PR and the way it has worked out.  I say that the people of this country deserve better, particularly the young people, and I want to do as much as I can to ensure that the young people will get an opportunity to have an effective political system in which they can participate and in which they can contribute to the future welfare of this country.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Adjournment Debate: Aughaclay (Donegal) School.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I must apologise to the Minister for not having adopted the usual procedure of <Col N="158" /> putting a Parliamentary Question.  As a matter of the greatest urgency, I was requested by the parents of the pupils to have this matter ventilated with the least possible delay.  It is for that reason, and that reason only, that I raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The position is that Aughaclay is a national school approximately two miles from Malin in County Donegal. It is not by any means a new school. It was a three-teacher school up to 14 years ago when a new school was provided in Malin.  Recently, the Department of Education and officials from the Board of Works attended to discuss demands put forward by the parents of pupils and by the management of the school to have repairs carried out, notably the installation of flush toilets.  With this in mind, the parents believed the Department intended to renovate the school and that despite the fact that the three-teacher school had been reduced to a two-teacher school, there was no suggestion of amalgamation.</P>
      <P>Tradition dies hard in Ireland, and the parents feel they have a just claim to keep this school open.  However, their claims to the Department have been treated with what I can describe only as contempt.  If the Department are sincere in trying to win the goodwill of these people, the Minister should direct one of his officials to go to Aughaclay, meet the parents, discuss the differences and outline what the Department have in mind for the school.</P>
      <P>There are about 40 pupils involved and this is a reasonably large attendance at a rural national school.  I understand the population of that part of the country is now on the increase. It certainly cannot be regarded as a declining population.  At any rate, it has reached a level where it is impossible for it to decline further.  It is therefore reasonable to expect that the level of 40 pupils will be maintained during the coming number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to labour this matter beyond making the point that some time ago the Department of Education, by inference or promise, made the parents and all concerned aware that <Col N="159" /> a new school would be built there. Now the position is that it is proposed to amalgamate this school with the national school in Malin.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the whole situation and accede to the request of the parents.  In the meantime, I suggest that he provide toilet facilities and reasonable recreational facilities, thus winning the goodwill of all concerned. The Minister is a reasonable man, a man whom I have regarded since I came to the House as having little regard for red tape, a man with what could be described as an elastic conscience on the question of the normal procedure adopted by civil servants. If the Minister instructs a man from his Department to go there, he will discover that a much better solution can be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley) Donogh O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a perfectly straightforward case.  Aughaclay is a small two-teacher school, over 80 years old. It is in a poor state of repair and has been recommended for replacement by the Office of Public Works.  The out-offices are in particularly poor condition. There are about 40 pupils on rolls.  As the Deputy is aware, it is my policy not to replace such schools where accommodation can otherwise be made available for the pupils and teachers, thus creating a larger school unit where the pupils are afforded a more effective primary education and where the teachers have a smaller number of standards to deal with.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to amalgamate Aughaclay with Malin national school which is a little over two miles away in the same parish.  Malin is a modern two-roomed school, erected in 1952.  It will be extended and any necessary improvements carried out to accommodate the Aughaclay pupils and their one permanent teacher, thus creating a three-teacher school with an enrolment of over 80 pupils.  The ecclesiastical authorities are agreeable to the amalgamation and the Department's inspector attended a meeting of the parents in September, 1967 at which the advantages of amalgamation were discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> I understand that the parents have withdrawn their children from the school since 19th February.  One of their objections to the amalgamation appears to be that Aughaclay had a school of its own before Malin.  While I appreciate the very proper loyalty of the Aughaclay parents to their own locality, I could not consider this an adequate reason for resisting amalgamation. I would appeal to the parents not to proceed with their strike: in the long run only the children suffer by such action.  I could not hold out any hope that a new school would be built in Aughaclay.  There are no special circumstances which would warrant any departure from the policy of amalgamation.  This policy, I may say, is in full swing throughout the country and I have heard nothing but satisfaction expressed about its results even from places where local opposition was strongly voiced.</P>
    <P>Such agitation and strikes have taken place in other parts of the country and, like strikes everywhere, they must come to an end sometime.  The unfortunate position here is that in such instances as the retention of children from school, the sufferers are the children.  Deputies on all sides of the House have subscribed to the Government's policy with regard to the amalgamation of these smaller schools and it is wrong and irresponsible for any public representative, not necessarily Deputy Harte alone but any Member of this House or any public representative, irrespective of Party, to invite or encourage such agitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I have not incited anyone and in fact I have asked the parents to reconsider their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very good advice.  My primary concern as Minister is the educational needs of the children.  May I say that there is written evidence in the Department's files, when strikes took place on these questions of amalgamations of schools in the past, and when they ended and when the children were transported free of charge to the amalgamated school, as time went on, parents saw the upsurge in educational attainments <Col N="161" /> by the children.  We have written acknowledgments in the Department from many of these parents&mdash;I will say this for them&mdash;saying that they were wrong in their outlook and that they were more than satisfied that their children had shown unhoped for improvement in the amalgamated school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that my inspector went down and had a very long and comprehensive discussion with them on 26th September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At that meeting the Reverend Manager spoke in favour of my proposal and urged the parents to accept it in the educational interests of the children.  There is little point in my inspector going back again.  My decision is irrevocable.  I would not change my decision in any circumstances.  I have looked into the whole history of this case, as indeed I tried to do in all amalgamations, and to be as reasonable as possible.  Of all the cases I have ever come across, there is no shadow of doubt in my mind that amalgamation is the correct decision in this case.  The children are going to benefit very considerably from it through their educational advancement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that something would be achieved by having an inspector attend to iron out the differences?  It is a modest request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My inspector has been down there and has had a full and comprehensive discussion.  He is a reasonable man and answered all questions put to him.  He pointed out that the transport would go not only from Malin to Aughaclay but beyond it and would pick up children in the <Col N="162" /> surrounding areas, many of them living 1½ miles from Aughaclay, and transport them to Malin.  Another point to which the Deputy did not refer was that some parents referred to the infants who came out earlier than the older children. If this is a problem, my Department is quite willing to arrange a special service for the infants, as we have done elsewhere, so that they will not be waiting around for the bus for the older children.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances this is a good decision and a wise one.  I have no doubt that this will be reported in the appropriate Donegal papers and I would appeal to the parents&mdash;and I say this sincerely; it means nothing to me, except in regard to the educational welfare of the children&mdash;that they will only damage their children's education. If they agree with this proposal, they will be very pleased with the increased educational attainments of their children. I will say this to Deputy Harte: let them send their children to Malin, and after 12 months, I will send down an inspector to hear what they have to say.  That is a promise.  The Deputy can raise it again on the Adjournment, 12 months after the children have been going to that school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very fair in his reply but if he promises to send down an inspector in 12 months time, why can he not send one down now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be entirely irresponsible.  My inspector spent hours explaining the position to the parents, some of whom were most unreasonable, and of course sometimes it is the mob orators who carry the day and the quieter ones tag along with the ringleaders, and in this case there were some ringleaders.  If I were to say that my inspector would go back, it would build up false hopes.  I have not the slightest intention of changing my mind because what I have done is the right thing.</P>
