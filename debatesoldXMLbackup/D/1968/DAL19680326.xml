      <P>The effects of the British Budget on this country's exports to Britain will be followed with the closest attention.  As the Deputy is aware, there is provision in Article XXIII of the Agreement for meetings between representatives of the two countries once a year, or at any time at the request of either, to supervise the application of the Agreement, to keep its operation under review and to consider whether further action should be taken in order to promote its objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As previously announced in this House by way of reply to a question from Deputy Boylan on 15th February, I intend to introduce legislation into Dáil Éireann during the present session to make provision for the award of students' grants to enable the holders of such grants to attend courses of higher education.  In view of the impending legislation, it would not be appropriate for me to enlarge upon the proposals at this stage.</P>
      <P>Because of the introduction of the scheme of free post-primary education, it is not intended to hold any further competitions for scholarships to post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>All scholarships held under existing enactments will run their normal course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that the regional technical colleges will cater specially for local industries in the matter of technical education.  The provision of technical education for the textile industry in Donegal will accordingly arise in relation to the regional technical college in Letter-kenny. I cannot, therefore, envisage the establishment of a textile school in Glenties.</P>

    <P>NOTE: In addition to the four cases listed at (<i>b</i>) in which works for the provision of water and sewerage are included in major proposed improvements schemes (i.e., those costing £2,000 and over), there are other schools in the constituency where water-flushed sanitation systems are being provided by managers under the terms of a recent general circular authorising them to undertake, without prior consultation with the Department, such improvements in the heating and sanitation of schools as are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>In the cases generally, the arrangements are at different stages of progress.  While everything possible will be done by my Department to eliminate delay, it is not possible at this stage to give a precise indication as to when work may commence on the different projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1964 it was the policy in Northern Ireland as well as in the State to maximise the use of the railways. Since then the Northern authorities have reduced their railway system, discontinued railway freight service and fully liberalised road freight services for reward.</P>
      <P>In view of the situation brought about by the change in policy in the North and in the interests of expanding trade between the two areas, the Government decided in 1966 on a substantial measure of liberalisation for road haulage of goods for reward cross-Border.  Despite these measures, the railway freight service between Dublin and the North, now solely operated by CIE, has retained its volume of heavy freight traffic.</P>
      <P>In view of current policy in the North and particularly the discontinuance of rail freight services there, I am satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by such consultations as are mentioned in the question.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>At present the Government contributes, by way of subsidy, 75 per cent of the cost of connecting each rural consumer, subject to a maximum of £75 in each case.  Despite this subsidy and the heavy losses which the ESB suffer on rural electrification I realise that special service charges, in certain cases, are extremely high.</P>
      <P>As I have already told the House, the whole question of these charges is under review at present to see whether any relief is possible.  The review is nearing completion and, while I cannot say what the outcome of the review will be, I hope to make a statement on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a family in Durrow, Ballinahown, County Galway were recently quoted a two-monthly special service charge of £17 15s 11d by the ESB; and, if so, if he will explain how such a charge is calculated in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Special service charges are based on the cost of making supply available and are calculated in accordance with fixed rules, the explanation of which is rather lengthy.  It is set out in Vol. 215 No. 10, Cols. 1355-1358 of Dáil Debates of 13th May, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the ESB that the house in Durrow referred to by the Deputy is in an isolated location and heavy expenditure would be involved in making supply available.  In addition to providing a transformer, meter and service it would be necessary to construct, across very difficult country, about a mile of high tension line <Col N="1019" /> which alone is estimated to cost over £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he has further considered the establishment of a Giro here; and if he will state the advantages of such a system over the postal order, money order and banking system on the one hand and the disadvantages of such a system for Ireland compared with other States where such a system is in operation or about to come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of establishing a Giro system in this country has received intermittent consideration in my Department in recent years but due to other more pressing commitments it has not been possible to carry out the full detailed examination that would be essential before a firm decision could be made on whether a service of this kind should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, the Giro system involves the provision by the Post Office of a current account banking service with cheque facilities.  Its principal advantage over the postal order and money order system is that it provides a convenient method of enabling large numbers of small settlements to be made by the clearing house method, without the transfer of cash.  Commercial banks provide a similar service, but the Giro <Col N="1020" /> system has the advantage that post offices are more widely spread throughout the country than branches of commercial banks.</P>
    <P>The present Post Office money order and postal order remittance services and the commercial bank system in this country are more highly developed and widely used than in most of the European countries that operate Giro banks.  Consequently it is by no means certain that a Giro would provide a worthwhile addition to the existing media for transmitting money here or that the demand for such a service would enable it to be provided on an economic basis.  An important requirement of the system is the prompt debiting and crediting of accounts and the speedy issue of statements involving the use of high speed data processing equipment.  In this connection my Department is at present actively investigating the feasibility of introducing computer working for some of its operations.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not recall that in very recent times Mayo County Committee of Agriculture passed a resolution drawing his attention to the fact that the pig population of the west of Ireland was seriously declining, with consequent risk of bacon factories having to be closed down? Further, does the Minister not appreciate that Mayo County Committee of Agriculture is mainly made up of members from his own Party, presided over by a member of his own Party and, in view of these facts, does he not take serious cognisance of the fact that the pig population of the west of Ireland is declining and is he not going to do something about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree that the pig population is now declining. I do agree that there has been a decline.  That decline would appear to have been arrested to some degree by various measures that were taken. According to my earlier replies and supplementary replies, other measures are under consideration and this is the case at the moment in regard to what may be done in future to try to improve the situation in regard to supplies.  I would also like to have it on record that the price in March 1968 for grade A Special was 285/- as against the March, 1967, price of 270/- and, while admitting and agreeing that there has been an increase in the price of feeding stuffs, I do assert that the increase in price obtaining today as against this time last year more than <Col N="1023" /> makes up for the difference represented by the increase in the cost of pig-feeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is still the case&mdash; this is still my intention&mdash;that the minimum price will be increased, but, as I have already said, it is not likely and, indeed, it is not necessary that it should follow, that whatever increase there is in the minimum price should reflect itself wholly or in part to the benefit of the producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>But the price being paid at the moment is greater than the price this time last year by 15/- per cwt which, on calculations related to the increased cost of feeding, is a greater return to the producer than was the price he was getting then at a lower cost of feeding.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that paragraph 10 (3) of the Instructions to Presiding Officers issued in 1963 does not make it sufficiently clear to presiding officers that a ballot paper should not be stamped until a duly qualified elector presents himself to the presiding officer and demands his voting paper; and if he will take steps to have these instructions amended so as to make it quite clear that ballot papers shall not be stamped until the instructions contained in paragraph 10 (1) and (2) have been complied with.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, paragraph 10 of the Instructions to Presiding Officers makes it reasonably clear that a ballot paper should be marked with the official mark immediately before it is handed to an elector.  I will, however, consider amending the instructions, so as to remove any doubts about the position.</P>

      <P>May I inform the Minister, as he does not seem to know, that the returning officer in question directed, and properly directed, that the two presiding officers in question will never again act as presiding officers?  In my view, the papers should be sent to the Attorney General because the presiding officer not merely stamped more ballot papers than had been applied for at the time, but in addition stamped more ballot papers than there were voters on the register and in fact this was so found by the county registrar.  Proceedings should be taken by the Government against the presiding officers.</P>

      <P>No, it is a very minor irregularity.  There is no suggestion that any excess ballot papers were used.  It is a fact that in the particular place one of the machines was out of operation.  There were no complaints about irregularity.</P>

      <P>The national average electorate per Deputy in accordance with the current register of electors is 11,899.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the High Court judgment in question that a maximum divergence above or below the national average population per Deputy of about 1,000 in any constituency would be permissible. Expressed as a percentage of the present national average, this would result in a maximum divergence of about five per cent above and five per cent below the average.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the ratio of electors to population in constituencies varies substantially, strict adherence to population would inevitably mean that the value of each vote would vary substantially and would in general have a lower value in rural areas.

      <P>It will be clear from these figures that, if Dáil seats are distributed on the basis of equality of population per Deputy as provided by the Constitution at present, it will require 33 per cent more voters to elect a Deputy in South-West Donegal than in North-West Dublin, that there will be serious disparities in the effect of votes in many other areas, and that in some cases, where the population per Deputy is substantially below the national average, the number of voters per Deputy is above the national average.</P>

      <P>The provision of a serviced camping site for itinerant citizens in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area is a matter for Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council; no proposals have been submitted to me by either of these bodies, but I understand that Dublin County Council is endeavouring to find suitable sites in the area for development for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Government policy aims at the integration of itinerants into the community and, as a first step in this direction, local authorities have been requested to provide serviced camping sites.  I have been pressing the local authorities to establish such sites, which qualify for a generous subsidy from my Department. These sites are intended not alone to be a settled abode for itinerant families but also to provide the essential base from which voluntary helpers and official agencies can co-operate to set in motion a comprehensive programme of <Col N="1036" /> rehabilitation, with special emphasis on education and employment.  I would again take this opportunity of impressing on local authorities the importance of giving a reasonable chance to the itinerants to become fully integrated into the settled community.</P>

Subsequently the council submitted to the Department on 25th April, 1967, an application for sanction to the acceptance of a tender for the supply of light signals at the intersections. The application contained in effect details of the council's proposals for control of the intersections.</P>
      <P>The detailed design of traffic control arrangements for an intersection on a busy rural or suburban route is a complex matter, and in particular it is necessary to ensure that the total arrangements, including the design of the traffic islands and channels, are such as to ensure the best results from the point of view of accident reduction. Accordingly, in this case it was considered necessary to institute a study of the junctions and in particular of the accidents that have taken place there over a period.  This study is practically completed.  When it is completed, it will be possible to give a decision on the traffic lights proposed.</P>

    <P>NOTE: As regards the acreage remaining in the possession of the Land Commission, this is the peak of the allotment season and the position regarding lands taken over for division throughout the country generally is rapidly changing from day to day.  For that reason statistics of lands on hands, if compiled as of now, would be very quickly out of date.  In the circumstances, perhaps the Deputy would repeat this part of the Question in about a month's time when a more realistic assessment of the position should be feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the first part of the question, comprehensive surveys of this nature are being confined to the pilot areas and it would not be practicable in present circumstances to extend them.</P>
      <P>The precise information requested in the second part of the question is not available.  However, it might meet the Deputy's requirements to know that in County Limerick proceedings are at present in progress for compulsory acquisition of 20 properties aggregating 1,500 acres while negotiations are in train for voluntary purchase of 11 holdings comprising 800 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience, the question of delay over paying the price has been due generally to title difficulties. Sometimes it is caused by the vendors or their advisers.

      <P>The Deputy will agree that the unions would resent any attempt on my part to run their business for them.  The law and the Constitution in this country gives the liberty to both sides in industry to solve their problems.  As the Deputy is aware, I asked the union to hold off their strike action for two days so that the Labour Court could come in and help, and I was refused.  I have been asked since by members of the Labour Party why do I not do this and why I do not do that. I still think the unions would resent any attempt on my part to run their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that I met both sides on this, and as regards trade union recognition, I made it clear to the firm that there could be no question of pressure being brought to bear on them.  I think the House would agree that there should not be pressure brought in the context of our position where we allow freedom to industry and to workers to negotiate and to settle their affairs between them.  I did tell them that there would be no pressure on them to recognise a union, but that my experience <Col N="1053" /> in this country tended to show that the best interests of a company would be served by having a union, and also other things about discouraging a multiplicity of unions in a firm. However, I do not think the House would want me to exert pressure on either side.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the point the Minister made about requesting the union to defer action, is the Minister not aware that this company, El, misled the union with regard to negotiations for two years, and surely he would also agree that his request was made on the very eve of the expiration of the strike notice?  Furthermore, in view of the fact that people are concerned about infusing money into undertakings of this kind who discourage trade unionism, would the Minister not agree this calls for action from him to ensure that this does not continue.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is aware of the steps I have taken up to now to try to have this matter resolved. I do not think there is anything to be gained by my appearing to get involved in a dispute on one side or the other.  I have made clear what my advice was to the firm, and I am also clear that when I as Minister for Labour asked for a postponement of strike action so that the Labour Court could attempt to resolve this dispute, I was refused.  The reason I say that is that Deputies of the Labour Party are trying to pull me into the situation, and asking me what I am doing about it.

We appreciate he cannot force either side to do anything, but, in fairness, I think the Dáil and the country should know the situation.

      <P>I made it quite clear that my experience was that it would be to their advantage to do so, but I am very clear in my own mind that I do not think this House wants me to force any firm to make its workers become trade unionists.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Standing Order 121 of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business be amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;fourteen days prior to the consideration thereof, and not later than the first&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;seven days prior to the consideration of the ordinary yearly resolutions imposing taxation, and not later than the thirtieth&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment to Standing Order 121 proposed in this motion was recommended to the Dáil by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the Report circulated over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The Standing Order at present provides that the ordinary yearly Estimates be presented to the Dáil and circulated to Members not less than 14 days prior to the consideration thereof and not later than the first day of April.  This was necessary when a Vote on Account and a Central Fund Bill had to be passed before 1st April each year.  Since the passing of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965 the necessity for an annual Vote on Account and Central Fund Act has ceased.</P>
      <P>In these changed circumstances the Committee considered that the Estimates should be presented before consideration of the Financial Resolutions and not later than 30th April.  The Standing Order would then read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The ordinary yearly Estimates for Public Services shall be presented to the Dáil and circulated to members not later than seven days prior to the consideration of the ordinary yearly resolutions imposing taxation and not later than the thirtieth day of April.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over several days and there is little left to say so far as the pros and cons of the two proposals before the House are concerned.  It is not my <Col N="1062" /> intention to go back on statements made in the debate that took place in 1959 because that would serve no useful purpose.  So far as the merits of proportional representation are concerned, they were, I think, admirably summed up by the President in 1937 when he told this House that the system we have we know; the people know it; it gives fair representation to all Parties.  No change has taken place in the interim which warrants bringing before the House at this stage the two proposals to amend the Constitution. The President summed up the position very well in 1937.</P>
      <P>We know from the statistics provided by various speakers that proportional representation has given fair representation. The Government Party have benefited to some extent by getting a slightly higher percentage of seats than their actual first preference votes would entitle them to and I can see little reason, therefore, for this proposal now before the House, a proposal that is taking up a great deal of the time of the House and will later take up a great deal of the time of the Seanad. But there is another consideration: this referendum will cost a great deal of money which could be utilised in a more gainful manner.  It can be safely assumed from the opinions we hear expressed in the country generally that this referendum has no chance of succeeding. The people will reject it because they know it is not brought in from the point of view of the national interest; it is brought in purely and simply from the Fianna Fáil point of view.  Fianna Fáil in general, and the members of the Government in particular, believe that, if our electoral system were changed from proportional representation to the straight vote, they would have a good chance of remaining in office for the next ten or 15 years.</P>

      <P>So far as the recent by-elections are concerned, the Labour Party was the chief gainer because they increased their first preference votes while Fianna Fáil dropped 5,000.  In view of that gain and in view of the trend, it is most unlikely that Fianna Fáil will secure a majority of the seats here in the next general election.  I am satisfied that beyond any shadow of doubt this referendum is being imposed on the people.  I think the people are aware of that because changes have taken place here in recent times, changes of which cognisance must be taken.</P>
      <P>I believe we have overlooked in our discussion here the discovery, if I may use that word, made by Deputy Cluskey, of the existence of an organisation known as Taca and all that goes with it.  The reason I mention this is that I think it is completely out of place for the Government of any country, but particularly the Government here in Ireland, to be prepared to accept substantial sums of money from individual members of the community, from firms or from business people to help them along in their political campaign.</P>

      <P>I shall relate it to the amendment before the House. To satisfy the demands of the Chair, if <Col N="1064" /> the electoral revisions that are now proposed were to be approved, what, Sir, would happen?  Unless people who would normally look to the Government for something to which they were possibly not entitled, such as planning approval, import licences and so on, which could be of great financial advantage to them, were members of Taca and unless they subscribed to Fianna Fáil, there would be little use in their making representations to the Government.  I condemn vehemently any such system.  It is unfair; it is unjust.  It is a system that should not be tolerated and the people should know the purport of the Government's acknowledgment of the existence of a group of well-to-do people who, by virtue of even the smallest contribution, can buy favour from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises from the fact that, if Fianna Fáil were to get their way, this country would be administered in such fashion that only those who were members of Taca or of some other Fianna Fáil organisation could expect to get even more than justice and fair play and opposition groups and those who had no inner say with the Government would suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Bill. One is reminded of all the bad things the British did in the past, all that they have been guilty of, the time we were to build a wall, so to speak, around Ireland and have nothing to do with <Col N="1066" /> them, we should ignore them completely. Discussing this measure brings one back in memory to the time when we had the slogans: &ldquo;Burn everything British except their coal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank God, the British market is gone and gone forever&rdquo;.  All those come to one's mind in discussing this electoral reform because what we are being told by the Tánaiste and by the Government is that so far as electoral systems are concerned, the British were correct all the time and we were wrong, and as Deputy Carty has stated, it took Fianna Fáil until 1959 to know that this electoral system was not the best system and that it gave false representation so far as the election of parliamentary representatives was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It suited Fianna Fáil at one time to advocate PR and to speak most favourably of it.  I have given a quotation from our President.  Were it not for proportional representation, we would not have had Fianna Fáil government in this country for so long.  We would not have the man who is supposed to be behind the schemes, the present Minister for Local Government, as a Member of this House, because even though he asserts now that the kind of electoral system which is in operation elects people on fourth, fifth and sixth preferences and it elects them with a small number of first preferences, he had not such great luck with it when he first tried to get into this House.  Even with all the advantages that are supposed to be embodied in that system of representation, to get in here with relatively small support in the constituency, the Minister for Local Government failed to do so until, due to a stroke of good luck, a vacancy existed in the constituency because one of the Deputies did not go forward and he availed of that to get in here.  He was then promoted to Ministerial rank, not on any personal qualification but due to circumstances which are well known to the House.  Now he is the Minister who is lecturing us on electoral reform. He is the Minister who is telling us about TDs vying with one another for kudos in their constituencies.  He never had to make any representation in that line.  He had the good luck to get into <Col N="1067" /> the top ranks as soon as he succeeded in getting in here under the proportional representation system.</P>
    <P>Now we are following Northern Ireland.  It is no harm to mention our neighbour.  There was a by-election in Lisnaskea a few days ago.  This was something big in the place.  I think it was&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the first or second contest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The papers inform us that the Nationalist Party has 40 per cent of the votes in that constituency, but due to the system of election, there is no use putting forward candidates and the people in Lisnaskea, as in every place in Britain, have to be satisfied with the candidate imposed on them by the majority Party.</P>
      <P>We are told by the Minister for Transport and Power, of all people, that this change in the system would bring in young men of marked ability, that it would remove duds from this house and that we would have a big rush of young intellectuals coming in here to promote legislation and we would be all more or less in heaven henceforward.  This proposed system, in fact, instead of being conducive to that end, would produce the opposite effect because once a person is in here from a constituency which has a majority support for a particular Party, it would not be possible for others, even though they might be better fitted as public representatives, to become Members of this House so long as the outgoing Member felt like going forward for election.  That is what has happened in Britain.</P>

There are 10,000 supporters there, and if the straight vote system is introduced, those 10,000 people will have no representative in this House.  I am not worried from a personal point of view if the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious about me.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from a general national viewpoint.  May I say in further reply to the Parliamentary Secretary that I would not like to see that happen.  I believe those people are entitled to representation in this House and I believe the present system will continue to operate and they will continue to have a representative here as they are entitled to have by virtue of their numbers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power had a great deal to say about the merits of the straight vote.  He mentioned young intellectuals coming along here under the straight vote system, removing some of those who are not deemed to be intellectual. Mind you, the Minister has had his difficulties.  He mentioned people being elected on fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh preferences.  The Minister was very glad to get fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh preferences in some past elections. I know that he had a painful time, particularly at a few elections in the Longford-Westmeath constituency, where his share of the votes according to him would not secure his election on the second seat and as a result he had to change his constituency to Co. Monaghan.  The Minister for Transport and Power made it clear that the Party who had the majority of first preference votes was the only Party entitled to a representative from a constituency.  If he were honest about that he would not be a Member of this House at all never mind a member of the Government because it so happens that in the Monaghan Constituency the Minister's Party did not get a majority of the votes of the people even though they got a majority of the seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Statistics show that Fine Gael got a majority of the first preference votes recorded in the Monaghan constituency. He had the audacity to assert here that those who were entitled to be Members of Parliament were only those who had received the most first preference votes and that subsequent votes should not be taken into account. We had others offering us advice in this debate as to what is good for the country.  I think I must refer to the contribution of a former member of this Party, Deputy Patrick Norton, who has brought forward an amendment here and he has got great publicity for it.</P>

      <P>Mark you, we must bear in mind that had the system, which Deputy Norton now wishes changed, not operated since 1959, Deputy Norton would not be with us to give us that advice.  The alternative vote system in the first election he contested failed to secure his election. It was only because of the system of proportional representation that the Deputy now condemns that he is a Member of this House.  I am not saying this by way of reflection on the Deputy.  It is a factual statement.  Were it not for PR the Deputy would not be hear to give us advice on the election system or what could or could not arise from it.  He is one Member who quite clearly owes his election here to the present system of proportional representation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should be thankful for this system because&mdash;and I repeat it again&mdash;it is quite clear that were it not for that system he would not be a Member of this House.  The Deputy did not get the highest number of first preference votes and in the system which operated in the by-election he was the first candidate eliminated.  The Fianna Fáil people were not anxious to change this system in the 1920s, neither were they anxious to change it in the 1930s or the 1940s.  In the late 1950s they were anxious to change it because they felt at that time that there was a likelihood or a danger of their Party slipping and that unless they got a higher percentage of the votes their term in government might come to an end.  We had Deputy Childers, the Minister for Transport and Power, and also Deputy Carty, the Parliamentary Secretary, telling us they were going to be in power forever under the PR system.  I do not think so.  The President thought that in 1948 and he got out of it.  We had the inter-Party then.</P>

      <P>That is one of the best things that ever happened in this country.  Fianna Fáil at that time were going along on a dictatorial line. They felt then that there was no need for a change in our electoral system. They were defeated in 1948.  In 1951 I became a Member of this House and I am well acquainted with what the inter-Party Government did for this country in the two periods we had that system of government.  We were headcause&mdash;an <Col N="1071" /> ing towards dictatorship.  Unless you were a member of the Fianna Fáil Government or a known supporter of the Party it was unlikely you would get justice as far as grant applications and other entitlements that people would apply for were concerned.  You were told that if you wanted to get benefits under Departmental schemes or Government schemes you must be a member of the local cumann.</P>
      <P>The inter-Party Government in 1948-51 was set up as an alternative.  I am well aware of the work done during that time.  I was a public representative, even though I was not a Member of this House until 1951.  They did a very good job.  They did very good work in regard to housing and agriculture.  They did very good work as regards the land of this country.  They drained the land.</P>

      <P>Their work was so good mark you that our President had to leave the country for a long term at the time.  He took a long holiday during the first inter-Party Government period and stayed away from this country.  By a fluke, although this would hardly be regarded as Parliamentary, they were defeated in 1951.  Unfortunately, an opportunity arose over the health scheme at that time which resulted in the inter-Party Government not being defeated but being removed from office by Fianna Fáil getting the support of a few Independents.  We know how they got that support and how they have paid for it since.  Mark you, it must be said that in respect of this change which the present Government brought about with the support of Independent Members Fianna Fáil have honoured their obligation to some of them.  Did that ever strike the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>

Under the present system the number of people who oppose the Government is far greater than the number who support them but due to fragmentation in the Opposition Parties Fianna Fáil were able to bring about a situation in which they got a higher percentage of seats than the votes given them.  Of course under the other system they feel that the proportion would be much higher.</P>

      <P>We had an inter-Party Government in 1948 and in 1954 the people decided to elect another inter-Party Government.  Unfortunately, we had the Suez crisis at the end of 1956 and to use the words of the Fianna Fáil people, owing to international circumstances, there was a scarcity of funds in the latter part of 1956.  I stand by truth and do not hide or deny anything.  I was in the House and I felt disappointed that the Government should have had the election at the time they did.  I have no doubt that had the Government attempted it, in view of the work they were doing and in view of the confidence they were getting from the people at the time, we would have had many more periods of inter-Party Government since 1957.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear, giving my own personal views, that unlike Fianna Fáil, we are all unanimously against it. There are 70 of you at the present time and would any one get up and say: &ldquo;I am in favour of PR and against the straight vote system.&rdquo;  No one would do that.</P>

      <P>When the inter-Party Minister for Social Welfare took office in 1948, he had to change the system which obtained up to that time whereby old age pensioners had to collect allowances under two headings, one as social welfare from the Department of Social Welfare and the other as a home assistance allowance from the local health authority.</P>
      <P>My references to periods of Government other than Fianna Fáil were brought about mainly by contributions such as that made by our Minister for External Affairs&mdash;our man in Havana, or man in New York&mdash;and the Minister for Transport and Power, who stated that there is nobody else fit to rule Ireland or form a Government except Fianna Fáil.  I disagree with that, and I hope that if the electors so wish it, this disagreement will be proved by the people.  There are many people in the country who want to give Fianna Fáil a rest at the present time.  I think they should be given a rest.  We have this arrogant approach on the part of some Ministers which is due possibly, as Deputy Carty would say, to their being in office too long.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had this attempt nine years ago to bring about this electoral reform <Col N="1075" /> bringing in the straight vote, and the Government are renewing it now in view of the position that exists throughout the country, particularly among our honest working people, and the existence, to which I referred earlier, of a decline in Fianna Fáil circumstances. I think Deputy Childers and the Tánaiste need not be worried that an alternative Government can and may be achieved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the ground of discussion on this Bill has been very well covered by previous speakers and I know that this particular point has been covered, but I should like to refer to it briefly as I have already referred to it.

The Tánaiste said the English system is right.  There is a by-election coming up in England which involves a seat deemed to be safe for the Conservatives. An existing Member is retiring and not going forward in the next election.  They have 35 applications, according to last Sunday's press.</P>

That cannot happen under PR. All the Members of this House, with few exceptions, reside in their own constituencies.  The exceptions are because of Government office or there is some other valid reason for Deputies residing outside their constituencies.</P>
      <P>PR is a system I wish to see continuing and I cannot see any value in the argument put forward by Government speakers that it is too difficult for Deputies to get around their constituencies because multi-seat constituencies stretch distances up to 100 miles and that therefore it is extremely difficult for them to get around.  If that is so, Deputies have a way out.  During the 46 years this State has been in existence, there has been no shortage of candidates for the various Parties in elections, and if a sitting Member feels he is not physically or mentally capable of performing the duties appropriate to the multi-seat constituency system, there is nothing to prevent him from giving way, and there are many willing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>With my colleagues on the Labour Benches, I violently oppose this proposed system of election.  It has been brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government in the hope that even with declining support, they can hang on to <Col N="1077" /> office for a further period of ten to 15 years.  We cannot look too far into the future.  The motive for this proposal is purely personal.  Their objective is selfish and I have no doubt that when it comes to referendum day, the Irish people will give them the answer they deserve.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word about this tolerance business.  Tolerance would suit me all right.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has said, because he and his Party have been in office so long, many of the people had to emigrate from West Cork.</P>

Deputy Carty will agree that the two were to have been a package deal but that was knocked on the head after the Minister for Justice announced it on Telefís Éireann.  From the point of view of tolerance, and speaking from the point of view of the constituency I know best&mdash;South-West Cork&mdash;Deputies Cotter, Collins and I are adequate to represent the constituency.</P>
      <P>I should like to see as much representation as possible given to rural constituencies in the West, and if this proposal had been introduced on its own, there might have been a different viewpoint about it.  Rural Deputies possibly have more to do than urban representatives, but at the same time I am not satisfied that the motives behind this proposed amendment of the Constitution on this question are good. Therefore I recommend that the House reject this as well as the proposed Fourth Amendment.</P>

      <P>First of all, there may be a few among us who do not understand the dictionary meaning of &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, which I understand to be &ldquo;soldiers of destiny&rdquo;.  I wonder, then, whether Fianna Fáil are doing this for their own good or in a lofty moment of thoughtfulness, for the country and its people.  The PR system has been in use here since the foundation of the State.  It installed Fianna Fáil in office and helped to keep them there threequarters of the time since. Why then do they come to us and say, as soldiers of destiny, that the best thing for Ireland would be to change it to what they call the straight vote and I call the British system&mdash;the first past the post system?</P>
      <P>Politicians are pragmatists who think of the practical and are not usually of the lofty nature of the idealists who went before them in 1916.  We have got to look at this from the point of view of practical politicians deciding what is best and most practical for the Party and secondly, for the people.  I want to prove, if possible, that Fianna Fáil think that it is best for them that PR should go.  It has been pointed out that because they have won five or six by-elections, Fianna Fáil would feel happy under PR in the next general election. The fact is, of course, that by-elections tend to be easy meat for one Party or another.  For instance, I do not think they would like a by-election in my constituency at the moment. At the last local election, we polled 4,000 more votes than they did.  We have 13 Fine Gael councillors, ten Fianna Fáil councillors, one Labour councillor, one Independent&mdash;a young decent lad who was not selected by Fine Gael&mdash;and one Sinn Féin.</P>

      <P>Yes, he is, a very good Donegan man.  In that situation, I do not think they would like an election in that constituency.  A win for Fine Gael, if there were a by-election in that constituency&mdash;if I walked under a bus, which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would not like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But if Fine Gael won that by-election, that would not prove that Fine Gael would win the next general election.  What would indicate a change would be a trend over the six by-elections.  In the six by-elections referred to by the Taoiseach, the position was that there was a swing away from Fianna Fáil and a swing towards Fine Gael and a swing towards Labour.</P>
      <P>I want also to point to a complete mathematical mistake in the Taoiseach's speech &mdash; something that should be pointed to and must be adverted to.  I hope the mistake was made by his aides and not by himself. He said only one parcel of surplus was looked at.  That was done only in the Seanad election under proportional representation where each vote counts as 1,000 and where it is felt that the distribution could not materially affect the issue.</P>
      <P>I have been confirmed by the Parliamentary Secretary in my assertion that the swing in six by-elections was against the Government.  I just want to refer to the last countrywide test, the last test in which every voter in the State had the opportunity of recording his preferences under proportional representation, and that was in the local elections of last year.  The Taoiseach, in opening this debate&mdash;he will have an opportunity also of closing it&mdash;made very strong moment of his belief that these elections did not count, that when the big guns came in, such as the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, the results would be reversed.  That was an admission that the results were against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the number of county council chairmen as a result of the local elections in 1967&mdash;the chairmen being elected either by a straight vote of Fine Gael versus Fianna Fáil or by the selection in the normal vote for chairmen, which is a type of proportional representation, of a Fine Gael <Col N="1080" /> man or a Fianna Fáil man or a Labour man; there was a virtual disappearance of Independents last year.</P>
    <P>In Ulster, there was a Fine Gael chairman in Cavan and Monaghan and a Fianna Fáil chairman in Donegal; in Connacht, there was a Fine Gael chairman in Sligo and Leitrim; an Independent Fine Gael chairman in Roscommon and, in Mayo and Galway, Fianna Fáil chairmen; in Munster, there were Fine Gael chairmen in Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I now come to the province of Leinster. In Westmeath&mdash;and this is where your tolerance comes in &mdash; Louth, Offaly, Laois, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford, there were Fine Gael chairmen of the county councils.</P>

      <P>A very interesting point, and one that proves our point, namely, that if Labour wish to use proportional representation and if we want to use it for them next year, that is our right, prerogative and privilege. Deputy Allen has made a very interesting point.  There was an Independent Fine Gael chairman in Longford, an Independent in Meath&mdash;Deputy James Tully can say whether or not I am right in my judgment there&mdash;and one lonely <Col N="1081" /> Fianna Fáil chairman in the entire province of Leinster, in County Dublin, and a Labour chairman in Dublin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last countrywide test made Fianna Fáil make up their mind.  Here are the figures for the whole country&mdash;15 Fine Gael Party chairmen of county councils; two Independent Fine Gael; one Independent; seven Fianna Fáil and two Labour. Under the proportional representation system, on the last occasion of a test, that indicates to me that the Fianna Fáil Party are pragmatists, that they believe&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that, after the next general election, they will be over here and we shall be over there.  In that belief they have decided that the best thing they could do would be to imitate somebody who has gone from this House to somewhere perhaps higher in status and who used to say that when he wanted to know the wishes of the Irish people he looked into his heart. Fianna Fáil have looked into their <Col N="1082" /> hearts to find out what is best for them to do.  That is why they want to change the electoral system.</P>
      <P>The result, in fact, of the local elections last year was a gain of 78 Fine Gael seats and a very considerable gain for the Labour Party&mdash;I have not the figure.  The final proof of this is that, when there came to be elected the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils&mdash;which is the exact corollary in local government, as far as strength is concerned, of electing the Taoiseach here after a general election, which is the election that decides the Government&mdash;the person elected was a Fine Gael man.  Furthermore, when it came to the election of chairman of the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture the person elected was the Fine Gael shadow Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton.</P>
      <P>Following on that, I should like to say&mdash;and there is no secret about it&mdash; that two studies have been done, based on the votes cast in the local elections, on the result of the next general election. One study was done by Senator Garret FitzGerald and the other study was carried out by Senator Dooge, both front bench Fine Gael Senators. They gave us the results which I might not be too wise today in announcing to the House because they could be twisted.  It could be suggested, for instance, that I was not producing an overall majority for my Party; it would not take Fianna Fáil very long to use such an argument.  However, the result of the two studies, which approximated closely to each other, was 65 seats for Fianna Fáil, 55 seats for Fine Gael and 25 seats for Labour. That is based on the number of votes cast for each Party in the local elections last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the opportunity of examining this study and I am sure the Minister will believe that I examined it clinically and honestly. I do not think he has found me out in much dishonesty in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell you what I have found from this study.  Fiftyfive and 25 equal 80: the balance is 65.  So that it could well be that if there were no change since last year in the support for the various political Parties, the decision on who would be Taoiseach after the next general election might lie in the hands of the Labour Party and they might have the responsibility of deciding which of the major Parties would have a policy which was nearest to their desires.</P>
      <P>That is a position that looks like developing and, as a result of the possibility of that position developing, the Government addressed themselves in the most clinical and detailed way to the problem, with one end in view. When they wanted to see what was best for the Irish people, they looked into their own hearts to see what was best for themselves, just as somebody else used to do over the years.</P>
      <P>They are desirous now of introducing a system whereby they will be there for the foreseeable future.  Are they doing this in a straight, honourable way as far as the people are concerned? I submit to this House that they are not because on the last occasion that there was a referendum in regard to proportional representation, there was being held at the same time, in the same polling booths all over the country, an election for the Presidency. At that time Fianna Fáil, because they had what could be regarded as virtually the strongest possible candidate in the shape of Mr. de Valera for the Presidency desired to get the people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on two separate ballot papers.  On this occasion they want the people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the same ballot paper to two proposals.  The thing we must remember when taking part in this debate is that we are debating not only the Fourth Amendment but also the Third Amendment.  It would appear to me that too little attention has been paid to the Third Amendment and perhaps too much to the Fourth Amendment. I want to deal with the Third Amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1084" /> In 1958 when, in the course of their direction under the Constitution, the Fianna Fáil Party had reorganised the constituencies to preserve the directive in Article 16 whereby there would be one man, one vote and that the changes in population should be corrected every 12 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1958&mdash;what is coming now is what the Minister did not like&mdash;a private citizen in the shape <Col N="1085" /> of John O'Donovan took action against the Attorney General on the basis that in the division of constituency seats, he as a private citizen who might offer himself for election to Dáil Éireann was improperly treated.  The case was heard before Mr. Justice Budd.  Mr. Justice Budd's ruling&mdash;in the High Court, mark you&mdash;was that as far as is practicable, there shall be the same number of population per Deputy all over the country.  Mr. Justice Budd elaborated on that ruling and instanced that if, perhaps, there was a village which it might be necessary to carve into two slices, you would not do this; the normal practicable amount of tolerance would be allowed but that the practical limits could not be elastic, could not be extended either way to an extraordinary degree, and he defined as in or around four per cent average discrepancy as something that might be accepted as conforming to Article 16, which I intend to read for the Minister very shortly.  That meant one man, one vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, why is there such a thing as the Third Amendment?  If that is what that means, if Article 16 means that, before you start, why have you put on the Order Paper of this House the Third Amendment of the Constitution which says:</P>
      <P>A determination of constituencies shall be so effected that if</P>
      <P>i.  with respect to each of the constituencies, the number of members to be elected for it is divided into its population (as ascertained at the census last preceding the determination), and</P>
      <P>ii.  the average of the quotients of the divisions is ascertained,</P>
      <P>none of the quotients shall be greater, or less, than that average by more than one-sixth of that average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote from Part II of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, <Col N="1086" /> which we are discussing.  If what the Minister says is correct and you can vary by 33? per cent under the existing Constitution, why have you put in Article 3 in this Bill?</P>

      <P>Quite right, but there are times when the sort of thing the Minister tries to perpetrate and get across and which has to be dealt with leads one to be over exuberant or annoyed.  I am sorry if I have addressed anybody but the Chair.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that far more important for the people of Ireland is the Third Amendment than the Fourth Amendment, notwithstanding the great importance of the Fourth Amendment, and that, in fact, Mr. Justice Budd ruled in the High Court in 1958 that it was one man, one vote and that ruling was not appealed to the Supreme Court and the Minister's only excuse for that is that there was not time before the general election. The Minister and his Government have had since 1957 until the present day the opportunity of appealing to the Supreme Court and they have not done so.  Even if the appeal could not be taken before the election, there was no reason at all why they could not have lodged the appeal.</P>
      <P>I want to say also that the effect of this tolerance would be that three votes could be made to equal two somewhere else.  Deputy Costello suggested that from the starting off point there could be a 40 per cent discrepancy.  If we leave that out as something that is arguable, there is no doubt at all that there can be a discrepancy of two votes as to three.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the story of my constituency and the constituency next to it, Monaghan.  In one general election, we came near to electing two Deputies and reducing Fianna Fáil to one.  In 1954 we did that.  The best Fine Gael area in Louth is the Ardee area.  A slice was taken from that area, 4,000 votes, and put into Monaghan because at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a very interesting comment.  &ldquo;By Judge Budd&rdquo; is right.  I am trying to tell you what you did through Judge Budd.  You took the best slice&mdash;you had only four per cent to play around with &mdash; of Louth Fine Gael-wise and put it into Monaghan to stop me from getting my second Deputy, but inside one more election, you barely got home with your Minister in Monaghan by 120 votes and you have not a chance under PR of maintaining your two seats in Monaghan on the next occasion, or the two seats in Louth either&mdash;and he ran out of Longford before that.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make very clearly is this&mdash;the Minister interrupted on this point&mdash;if there was limitation by Mr. Justice Budd, what could the Government have done if they had 33? per cent tolerance?  If they could have made Louth smaller or Monaghan larger, Cavan larger or Monaghan smaller, or any other combination on the advice of their Deputies all over the country, how many Fianna Fáil TDs would we have here either under the system of proportional representation or under the system of the straight vote?  I quote from subsection (2) of Article 16 of the Constitution, lest the Minister disbelieves me.</P>

      <P>All right; I want to deal now with a few other items.  I am convinced that this question of tolerance offers the opportunity of gerry-mandering. I believe that is the reason why Fianna Fáil have brought it in. I am also convinced&mdash;when the Minister interrupted me five minutes ago I was almost put off it&mdash;that Fianna Fáil are now adopting the same strategy as in 1959.  They are putting two questions to the people.  On that occasion one question was: are you voting for Mr. de Valera as President? The second question was: do you want to get rid of PR?  They hoped for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in each case, and they very nearly got them.  They got one &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in relation to President de Valera and went within 36,000 votes of getting the other.  They are now asking two questions. One is Do you want tolerance? Do you want to have 33? per cent tolerance as to population per Deputy? The second question is: Do you want to get rid of PR?  No matter how much I talk in my constituency, no matter how much reporting I get from my local and national papers, no matter how much effort from this side of the House to try to get across to the people the meaning of the tolerance issue, it would be quite impossible between now and June, or whatever <Col N="1090" /> summer month the Government intend to go to the people, to disentangle the two issues and to get on the same day in the same polling booth every person going in, or even a majority of them, to decide on &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for one issue and &ldquo;no&rdquo; for the other.  The Party bosses producing their literature and posters saying &ldquo;yes, yes&rdquo; will find their supporters to be &ldquo;yes, yes&rdquo; on that side of the House and &ldquo;no, no&rdquo; on this side of the House, that they will go in and vote primarily for Party.</P>
      <P>You cannot get the people to understand the tolerance issue&mdash;a most detailed issue which the Minister and I could debate on Committee Stage for hours&mdash;and at the same time to understand the abolition of PR.  You have got to differentiate between the two and have two separate votes.  The ordinary decent working man or woman, who, unfortunately, in many cases has not had the advantage of a secondary education, particularly the middle-aged people, will not be capable of differentiating between the two issues.  The hope of Fianna Fáil is that this will be a Party vote and that they will get home.</P>

      <P>I will be corrected by the Chair and not by young Iosagán Molloy.  Deputy Molloy asked <Col N="1091" /> me how many people understand PR. I am ready to say a lot of the decent working people in this country, who did not have the opportunity of a secondary education and who are perhaps 30 years from national school, may not fully understand all the details of PR.  But they do understand one thing and that is, if they put No. 1 on a paper for Mr. Boland and No. 2 for Mr. Donegan, it means their second preference in that case is for Mr. Donegan and the first for Mr. Boland. That is sufficient to allow them to utilise PR, to get representation in the order of the strength of the vote within the constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sufficient for the people to understand and use PR. If this gerrymander is available to Fianna Fáil, if they are no longer bound by Mr. Justice Budd's ruling, they will see to it that the 65 out of 145, if you add one for a slight increase in population, which was produced by two outstanding economists, will become, if they can make it, 80 or 90. Then they hope there will be a disappearance of support for the other Parties, due to lack of hope, and that they will get themselves installed&mdash; even though, as Deputy Murphy says, they are in a minority at present&mdash;as the majority in Dáil Éireann for the next ten years.  That is their effort; that is their reason; that is what they are after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to the television commentary at all.  I want to suggest that one of the things that could <Col N="1092" /> be done in the West with this gerrymandering would be to take Fianna Fáil from the unsatisfactory position they find themselves in and instal them in a very satisfactory position.  There are 23 Deputies in this House from Connaught, 12 being Fianna Fáil and 11 Fine Gael.  The trend has been an increase for Fine Gael and a decrease for Fianna Fáil.  If one were to take the almost level distribution of Party support all over that area, it would be possible to denude the West of Fine Gael representation if they got the tolerance and if the Third and Fourth Amendment Bills to the Constitution were passed.</P>
      <P>That is part of the operation because they could use the bait to the people of the West: &ldquo;You are going to get more representation in Dáil Éireann. You have been denuded in population through emigration and we will give you more representation.  We will allow rivers, fields, pigs, horses and cattle to count in the enumeration for a Deputy.&rdquo;  The slight majority Fianna Fáil had is deteriorating and there has been an increased figure for Fine Gael. If they could spread the bread and butter equally and make it into areas of Party support so far as the constituencies are concerned, they think they would be able to get their nose ahead and Fianna Fáil would be established and Fine Gael would be run out of the West.  Fine Gael are entitled to almost equal representation.  We have 11 Deputies here against 12 for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take it as that, but I will not take much more.  I will leave if there is any more of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I should remark on is that the west of Ireland is a fertile field for that sort of activity because of swings of votes.  Massive swings of <Col N="1093" /> votes in any election in any part of the world are caused by one of two things: success on the part of the Government or lack of success&mdash;lack of economic activity&mdash;and the people reaching the end of their hopes and turning against the Government.  That is what has happened in the West. When I came here, they had something in the order of 15 seats in the West but that has now been reduced to 12:11.  That reduction has been steady. The West has given up hope and because Fianna Fáil have been in office during that period, they lost hope.  Fine Gael have gone up and Fianna Fáil have gone down.  If it were possible to get rid of the Deputies from the West on this side of the House, Fianna Fáil would hope that they would not get back again.  Lack of economic activity in the West has meant not a massive swing of support, but a constant drop in votes for the Government.</P>
    <P>Another matter that must be completely and absolutely criticised is the kite-flying by the Minister for Justice who will be Minister for Education tomorrow.  When a Minister goes on television or any other medium, he should realise that he is speaking as a Minister of State.  He said that there would be two questions and only one answer.  Fianna Fáil saw the bad reception given to that kite.</P>

      <P>I remember attending the Irish Sweeps Derby about four or five years ago with a very respectable retired local government official. I was not one bit horrified when I saw a Minister of State in sports coat and flannels reaching over the heads of six or eight people with a bookie's ticket to collect a few bob, but that man was horrified and said the Minister should have been on the stand in a dark suit. I do not worry about dark suits but I want to say this.  The behaviour of <Col N="1094" /> Ministers of State in this country is rather like monkeys performing on a stick.  The Minister for Justice went on television to fly a kite and see what the reaction would be among the people of Ireland to changing their system of voting which has operated since 1922.

      <P>The Minister is a bit heavy but he is now performing on a stick.  They discovered the bad reaction to that kite and they are now flying another.  In the <i>Sunday Press</i> last Sunday, the political correspondent said that the alternative vote with the single-seat constituency would be seriously considered by the Government.  That is Deputy Norton's amendment.  I hesitate to cross swords with Deputy Norton.  I never did since he came in here, because I had a great regard for his father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of votes cast in 1959 for the retention of PR amounted to 486,989 and the number of votes for the abolition of PR amounted to 453,322.  Would it not suit the political thimble-riggers if they could split by any thimble-rigging the 486,989 who voted against them on the previous occasion?  With the first past the post system, there would be no transference of second preference votes.  If Deputy Norton's amendment were accepted&mdash; and let us forget about its validity one way or the other&mdash;the voter would go into the booth and he could vote for the first past the post system, or the single-seat with the alternative vote or he could vote for the continuance of PR.  That would split the votes.  Therefore the position is that whether or not Deputy Norton puts this amendment down, it would be the action of a political thimble-rigger to accept it, because it would not give the people the chance to vote on the one issue&mdash; either PR or the first past the post system&mdash;because they will not have PR available to them in this referendum. If they had three choices, they could vote for PR first and if that were to be defeated, they could give No. 2 to the single seat proposal with the alternative vote, and if they wanted to vote the other way, they could give No. 1 to the first past the post system and No. 2 to the alternative vote.  If they wanted to go for Deputy Norton's proposal, they could indicate that and having done that, they might make a choice of PR or the first past the post system.  That possibility is not available to them on this occasion.  There should be an opportunity either to preserve PR or choose the first past the post <Col N="1096" /> system but everybody must come out horse, foot and artillery against any third question, and any third question is nothing but Fianna Fáil as usual trying to trick the Irish people.</P>

      <P>If the people of Ireland are to have an opportunity of deciding they can only get that opportunity by having a second choice, either PR or first past the post.  The task of making people understand anything else would be quite impossible.  In fact, the task of making them understand that there is also offered under Fianna Fáil the chance of making three votes in one place equal to two votes in another is probably beyond the politicians on this side of the House. We shall try to ensure that Fianna Fáil do not take over as they mean to do but the task before us of making people understand that there are two issues, the tolerance issue and the first past the post issue, is so great that it is quite possible that when the people go to the polls, very many of them will not fully understand the two issues at stake.  We shall try, with every atom of our being, to enlighten them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an interesting situation, again with the limitation imposed by Justice Budd in the case of John O'Donovan versus the Attorney General, that Deputy Norton should say while Deputy Murphy was properly speaking that if Meath and Westmeath sections <Col N="1097" /> had not been added to Kildare, thus making a three-seat constituency into a four-seat one, he would have been all right under any system and so would the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members representing that constituency.  Let us see how this change was made. Kildare in 1957, the year when there was a swing towards the Government, was extremely unsatisfactory to Fianna Fáil.  They received 13,171 votes; Labour got 7,088 and Fine Gael 6,339. The result was one Fianna Fáil seat, one Fine Gael and one Labour.  That meant that in this particular instance Fianna Fáil got very bad value for the 13,171 votes.  Immediately afterwards what happened?

      <P>That is not so, and the Minister knows that well.  The situation was that you had gerry-mandered a previous revision of the constituencies in a highly successful manner and when it came to the time to gerrymander on the second occasion and the period had gone by which was covered by Mr. Justice Budd's limitation, this is what was done.  I have given instances where Fianna Fáil succeeded either in preventing a gain for the Opposition or in getting a two-two instead of a one-two result with the limitation.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that. Finally, I should like to comment on this point.  I have been here or in the Upper House since 1954 and in every by-election held since, I did my stint. That brought me all over the country as it brought many other Deputies on both sides of the House.  The great difference I now see between the period 1954-1958-9 and the present day is that where you often went into a constituency at that time and found Fianna Fáil had a fair organisation or a very good organisation, you might find that Fine Gael had a very mediocre organisation and perhaps Labour had no organisation at all.  But if you come through the decade up to 1968 &mdash;and I have been in every by-election in which I could have been during that period; I missed one in 15 years when I was ill&mdash;you find there is a reasonable organisation for every political Party in every constituency and also in the rural areas the number of cars available to bring people to the polls&mdash;private cars, perhaps, not working for political Parties but just bringing neighbours&mdash;is such that you will have a much higher poll, perhaps ten per cent more, than it was in 1957-58 or that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is so, and if it was so in 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957 when Fianna Fáil were reorganised in some places and the others were not organised at all, and there is a swing against the Government, then the position I have outlined in the local government elections of last year will be repeated in the general election of perhaps next year.  If that is so, that is a reason why there should be a change so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  The organisation of both Opposition Parties will obviously improve.  If you went to Wicklow&mdash;I went all over the county&mdash; you found a number of young Labour workers busy putting up posters and canvassing.  I met them and discussed matters with them.  I suppose I met some of them again in Limerick.  I also met Fine Gael youth workers and others equalling in numbers and <Col N="1099" /> activities those available to the Government Party.  With all that activity, there will be no such place for the Government as the soft seat anywhere under PR but what the Government desire to do is to fragment the voting so that Labour Party preferences will not transfer to the Party whose policy is nearest to theirs, and then take the first past the post system under which perhaps 40 per cent representation from the people will give Fianna Fáil a 65 per cent representation in this House.</P>
    <P>What about the antipathy that will exist between town and country if it takes three votes to elect a Deputy in one area for every two it takes to elect a Deputy in another area?  When we come down to the question of industrial grants, road grants or allocations for housing or other things that the Minister sitting there has to decide upon and if, in the places where because of the gerrymandering that would exist, because of the two votes being equal to three, it is found there is more money going there than to other areas, will the Minister be able to answer the criticism that he is deliberately favouring the areas where there are most Fianna Fáil Deputies? This is a very real problem, and the town versus country situation is bad enough as it is without making it any worse.</P>
    <P>When the Budget is introduced and the fellow down in Dublin North East or in some other such constituency sees the farmer getting an extra £10 million which he may very badly need the townsman will say: &ldquo;That is because every two of their votes equals three of mine.&rdquo;  The Minister may smile, but if he goes down to his own constituency, say, to Ballyfermot, and sits down in some of the houses having a cup of tea he will find what I say to be true, that there is a great antipathy towards the farmer in his constituency as there is great antipathy towards the town dweller in parts of my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's Party is only trying to promote that.  It does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>That is not true.  The working man down in the Minister's constituency, who perhaps watches television but does not read too deeply, will say: &ldquo;Those farmers get everything for nothing.&rdquo;  And if you go to a meeting of the National Farmers' Association down the country they will say that the industrial wage is double what a man with £10,000 worth of land is earning down the country.  That situation will be magnified and there will be created a town versus country antipathy which will be bad for this nation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House too long on this matter except to say again that we must fight for proportional representation and keep to the ruling of Mr. Justice Budd.  There is no hope that the highly detailed arguments that can be put forward on both sides will be understood by every voter.  Even if this is delayed until September, there is no hope that such understanding will grow.  In such circumstances all that can be done from this side of the House is that Fine Gael and Labour will advance together against Fianna Fáil and see to it that when they ask their questions the answers will be &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and &ldquo;no&rdquo; a second time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made by the previous speaker to my constituency, Kildare, into which was put a portion of Meath and Westmeath; in fact, 4,000 votes in Westmeath and 4,000 in Meath were put into Kildare. I have a very good knowledge of what it is like to try to become known in such a constituency and how complicated is the working of a constituency that has portions of three counties all very close to one another.  First, we have three county councils to work with.  That involves a fair amount of work considering that each county council has a different system of grants, different systems for various matters, and difficulty arises in trying to remember all the regulations governing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be rather embarrassing when in the one constituency there are people living close together some of whom will get grants from their county council and others who will not.  One is trying to represent the people of all <Col N="1101" /> those areas.  It is particularly difficult where people have been used to turning their attention in one direction&mdash; for instance, the Westmeath people would be turning towards Longford-Westmeath or Westmeath itself&mdash;and to have to ask the Meath and Westmeath people to join up with Kildare.</P>
    <P>Possibly there would be no difficulty in regard to Meath joining in with parts of Kildare, because it is a very long border, between 30 and 35 miles, and there is a good deal of intercourse between the people there particularly in regard to postal arrangements.  Kilcock and Enfield cover an equal area of Meath and Kildare, and when I say an equal area I mean a very big portion of those counties.  For Enfield the telephone system goes right down to Ballivor and our whole telephone system is in that portion of Meath and about half the portion of Meath that is in the Clane electoral area.  It is hard for people to be suddenly changed and put in with another county, and if the Referendum did not go through, I would hate to see constituencies being carved up again.  Possibly 30 constituencies out of the 38 of them, would have to be changed.  People prefer to be left alone, to be left in their own particular units that have been set up through tradition or over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>With the single-member constituency, it would be much easier for Deputies to represent their constituencies.  I am talking about my own constituency which is probably no better or no worse than any other rural constituency.  Ours is only a four-seater constituency which ranges from within less than a mile of Carlow town on two sides to within less than a mile of Mullingar on three sides of it; there are three roads going into the town.  It stretches across possibly from Rathangan to Celbridge, and it ranges from 40 to 60 miles.  Take a five-seater constituency in this city.  It might be only four miles by one mile, and a person could cycle or walk around it in an afternoon.  We have a very big area to cover and it takes an amount of driving to do it.  It entails a great deal of travelling to get around the whole constituency, although you would have a colleague to take a certain <Col N="1102" /> amount of the load away from you.  Even still, people from different areas will be seeking your advice and there is a good deal of overlapping in the work to be done.  This is particularly so where anything of a public nature is involved and the four TDs will be consulted. In an area like that, it is important to provide the detailed attention to problems which the people deserve from their representatives.  If you had an area of 15 to 20 miles, containing some 11,000 to 12,000 votes, it would be easy to cover that area and you would know all the problems.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this Bill last week, I suggested that while there may be some case made for new planning legislation which would enable and encourage local authorities to adopt a more liberal attitude to their interpretations of their planning intentions, I pointed out that this Bill is not the correct way to go about it.  I should like to make just one reference to the exchange I had with Deputy L'Estrange.  He referred me to the <i>Evening Press</i> of 10th November, 1965, and subsequently, as it appears in the Official Report, to the <i>Irish Press</i> of that date.  I went to the Librarian and asked him to get me the copies of the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i> for that date.  He told me that the evening papers, both the <i>Evening Herald</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i>, are not retained for longer than a year.  I read very carefully <Col N="1103" /> through the <i>Irish Press</i> of that date and could not find anything in it which I could relate to Deputy L'Estrange's reference.  I was out of town over the weekend and had another engagement on Monday so that it was not until today that I found this out and, therefore, I had no opportunity of going to the National Library to look up the reference.  Until I see what Deputy L'Estrange is referring to, I must continue to assume that he was using the privileges which we are all granted in this House, for very good reasons, to try to make cheap electioneering propaganda on the eve of the election.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to refer to one of the Minister's decisions which has led to contention, that is, in relation to the Mount Pleasant Lawn Tennis Club.  As I pointed out to the House before, I am very familiar with this club, having been a member of it, and if I did not actually meet my wife at a dance in that club, I certainly met her at a nearby one and we danced in that club long before we were married.  I know that club for the past 25 years and, therefore, I am familiar with some of the difficulties it has experienced.  Today, on my way to Leinster House, I deliberately drove along Ranelagh Road and around Mount Pleasant Square and had a look at the club premises just to confirm my opinion, which is that any development here&mdash;I do not care what it is &mdash;will be an improvement to the amenities of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the best development would be for the local authority or the Board of Works to take responsibility for laying this ground out as a public park, or to landscape it, to do up the fences, or even for the ESB to paint their sub-station which is in the grounds. However, I do not think that this is a responsibility which either Dublin Corporation or the Board of Works would be very anxious to assume. Furthermore, I do not think it would be right to deprive the tennis club of the amount of land they intend retaining and which has not been used for the purpose of playing tennis&mdash;it is a sort of grass entrance to the club&mdash;<Col N="1104" /> without making an offer of a suitable open space for them on which to continue as a club, as I believe has been done in other cases.</P>
    <P>It seems unlikely, therefore, that either the elected councillors or the Board of Works would be prepared to take on themselves the financial responsibility of doing up the frontage of this property and all around it.  The only way in which the area can be improved is by commercial development. Deputy L'Estrange bandied about figures and said that this property was now worth £60,000.  I assume that Deputy L'Estrange has been on a local authority but certainly he has not been on a local authority for Dublin city or county or otherwise he would know that the first thing a petrol company will look for when planning to erect a petrol station is that the station will be on the left-hand side of the road as the traffic leaves town.  At Mount Pleasant it is on the right-hand side.</P>
    <P>The second thing they want to ensure is that the station will not be on a road on which a clearway will operate when catering for the main volume of traffic, which would make it difficult for people not only to cross from the clearway to the station but to get back into a lane again.  This could be an argument against giving approval for a filling station but it is also an argument to show that the figures mentioned by Deputy L'Estrange are completely out of the question.  No petrol man who is half sane would consider paying anything like £50,000 or £60,000 for that site.  I took the opportunity of asking one or two people in the business about this and they shared that view.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if some other suggestions had been made to the Minister, they might have been favourably considered. I cannot see how this proposed development will do anything but improve the site, a site which has been an eyesore in my constituency for as long as I can remember, even when I was dancing there as a boy.  It is all right to get up here and quote hypothetical figures.  It is the same as the man who won the Sweep and because, in some indirect way, somebody carried a poster at the airport supporting one of our Ministers, <Col N="1105" /> there was a lot of talk about corruption and jobbery.  This will not hold up in the light of cold examination. It is a reasonable assumption that probably hundreds of planning appeals go into the Department of Local Government every week.  If I take the three or four of which I may hear and multiply that by 144, even allowing 20 per cent off to cover those Deputies who do nothing, then it is reasonable to assume some hundreds of applications every week.  Last week I estimated that one in ten such appeals is approved and I suggested that was not enough.  I do not believe local authorities are liberal enough in dealing with planning matters and I do not believe the Department is sufficiently liberal either.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Dublin Corporation had power to make a compulsory purchase order in relation to the Grand Canal and suppose that were appealed by the various interested parties to the committee envisaged in this Bill, I take it those who would sit on this committee would be people who would have at least some special knowledge of the problem facing Dublin Corporation in that situation; if they looked at the situation only from the point of view of Dublin Corporation they would uphold the compulsory purchase order; but, when the final responsibility rests with the political head of the Department, then he would have to consider the other matters that would arise in that kind of situation, matters such as the development of the midland waterways.</P>
    <P>I have certain points of view on that. They are not relevant at the moment, but what I am trying to get across is that certain buildings may be proposed in an area which no Minister may have taken into consideration.  For example, take the development of port facilities in Dublin.  In many planning applications and in many planning appeals there will be far more to be considered than the mere local interest and the local amenity.  The development of Dublin port is causing some concern to people in the Sandymount area, but it is recognised by everybody that development is essential if Dublin is to continue to prosper.  I can visualise a situation in which a planning application <Col N="1106" /> will be refused and an appeal will be taken against that refusal from the point of view of a purely local interest. I can see situations in which more might be involved than just the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Agriculture and even the Minister for Finance might all be involved to some degree or other.  On occasion the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Defence might be involved. Because this particular planning matter is one that impinges on very wide interests I firmly believe the proper person to be the final arbiter is the political head of the Department of Local Government in consultation with his experts and with his colleagues in instances in which his colleagues are concerned.</P>
    <P>As I suggested last week, our whole approach to planning must be broadened.  The Minister's predecessor and, I think, the Minister himself have talked about greater planning zones. That type of development should be proceeded with as quickly as possible and the necessity of having to appeal should be eliminated as far as possible. I know that when Dublin Corporation bought certain properties in Wood Quay there was a public furore about it.  Every conceivable argument was used to try to prove that this entire property should be maintained in its existing Georgian style.  It was argued that a certain long-established business would be put out of business.  If this Bill were to become law Dublin Corporation would not be able to knock these buildings down in order to construct proper municipal offices.</P>
    <P>Every argument was used; the cost of the new building was trotted out. The pattern was identical with that with which we have become so familiar through the years, a pattern very noticeable when Fianna Fáil are in office and not so noticeable when Fianna Fáil are in opposition.  The pressure groups allied to the present Opposition are far better organised obviously in this type of thing than we are.  Of course, we have far less experience of opposition.  Despite the <Col N="1107" /> decision that was taken quite some years back very little progress has been made.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has had experience as a member of Dublin Corporation must agree that the quickest and best way in which to get efficient corporation administration is by having centralised offices.  I trust it is not because of the operations of some pressure group or some appeal against the corporation's decision that the project is being held up.  In a situation like that this Bill envisages getting a High Court judge to adjudicate against the local authority of the area in which he has jurisdiction. This kind of pressure and opposition can be very, very dangerous.  It is not a good thing to try to shake confidence in the Government of the day.  Any government should be given support during its tenure of office.  It can account for its stewardship later.</P>
    <P>I casually picked up since last week a publication called <i>Fogra.</i> This is published by the combined universities' branches of Fianna Fáil.  It is pointed out that the views expressed are those of contributors and should not be taken as representing the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is in this publication an extract from the <i>Irish Independent.</i> This is volume 1, No. 3:</P>
    <P>The Parties whip themselves into hysteria at the wrongheadedness and shortcomings of their rivals and, having completely undermined confidence in themselves that the people are becoming apathetic about the whole system and, worse still that foreigners and bankers among them are losing confidence.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be appropriate to this Bill because the kind of arguments we have heard in its favour can do nothing except shake confidence in the system of democracy in operation; in other words, the operation of a free society as distinct from a totalitarian one.  When I see the same people appearing on different pressure groups with the same type of tactics, I begin to wonder if all the moneys these people have are provided by local voluntary subscription.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it is envisaged says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> The Minister shall after consultation with the Board make regulations in relation to the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  the conduct of business by the Board,...</P>
    <P>The legal gentlemen can explain this to me.  Does this mean the Minister shall consult the Board and say: &ldquo;You are to conduct yourselves in this way because the Government want this appeal approved or disapproved?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The restraints on that Board are clearly laid down here in Acts of the Oireachtas.  Anyway, the Bill also says that it should keep records of all its decisions.  As I have said, it is reasonable to assume that the number of planning appeals for or against that come into the Department of Local Government every week must run into hundreds.  We are now to have a record of its decisions.  I suppose we should have these circulated to each Deputy, too, and we can get extra lockers to stack them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Tully's reference last week I agree with my colleague, Deputy Dunne, that the allowances are insufficient for individual Deputies to have their own research staff.  I think they are insufficient for even the leaders of the Opposition Parties to have private research staff and through the inadequacy of these allowances, democracy is being damaged in some way.  I would have liked <Col N="1109" /> to have done a lot more research on this Bill because I was interested in the last Planning Bill that went through this House.  I understood that it would in effect cut down on the number of appeals that would come to the Department of Local Government but it has had the very reverse effect.  I hope the Minister will consider having a look at the entire legislation. I do not believe this suggestion would work.  I do not believe it is practicable.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that it need not necessarily be three members on this Board, that extra members can be appointed.  Therefore you might have seven, eight or nine people trying to adjudicate on a planning appeal such as the one at Mount Pleasant or the one referred to by Deputy L'Estrange in Goatstown.</P>
    <P>I feel that the only thing that is of concern to the Opposition is that in some instances a man, by presenting a set of plans in a better way and with a better idea of the final development, may succeed in getting approval where a person with less experience or less appreciation of the official mind it might be referred to to inspect this proposal might fail to get it and that getting this approval may result in a considerable capital gain for the man who made the investment or speculation in development he had in mind. The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement last year said that he was going to examine the whole position with reference to capital gains and that he would in his Budget, which is due in two or three weeks time, make reference to this whole question of capital gain.</P>
    <P>If the concern is that a person by the use of his ingenuity and his psychology in dealing with the official mind that will have to look at his proposals should make a large capital gain, the way to deal with that is through the Department of Finance and not the Department of Local Government. After all this is 1968, the year of Human Rights.  Governments, to my mind, have been taking away some human rights little bit by little bit to excess, and I believe that if a man can, by his ingenuity and his investment <Col N="1110" /> and by his appraisal of a situation, bring about a situation where he can make some money, he is entitled to do it.  To me, profit is not a dirty word. Profit, to my mnd, is an incentive to people to work harder and to get better development in this country and the day we make it a dirty word will be a bad day for the country.</P>
    <P>I for one could not in any circumstances see myself giving any merit whatsoever to the contents of this Bill. I feel it was designed with the wrong motive, presented in the wrong way and that it is absolutely impracticable to give effect to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief on this.  I suppose Deputy Fitzpatrick is anxious to get in to conclude but because I am directly concerned with the administration of planning appeals, and that is what this Bill is all about, I am anxious to say a few words on it.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister indicated here that he was open to be convinced by reasonable argument that the system of dealing with planning appeals should be changed.  It was Deputy Fitzpatrick who introduced the Bill and I must say he was very reasonable in his general approach to the Bill.  Unfortunately, the trend of the debate changed with the entry into the discussion of Deputy Cluskey, who followed Deputy Fitzpatrick. He spent the best part of three-quarters of an hour shouting about corruption and malpractices in dealing with planning appeals, bribery and all kinds of things.  Yet, despite the fact that he spent something like three-quarters of an hour on his feet, there were only two cases he could pinpoint. He threatened us with more to come when these would be dealt with.  However, he confined himself to the two cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was strange that one of the cases had been dealt with by the Minister when he was replying to his Estimate here since Christmas.  He went into great detail to explain the reasons why planning permission was granted in the case of Mount Pleasant Square.  The other case was in regard to housing development in the Kilbarrack area, <Col N="1111" /> here in Dublin city.  The Minister has dealt very effectively with that.  Despite the fact that he has, I suppose Deputy Cluskey will not yet be convinced that the Minister, or his predecessor in the case of Kilbarrack, was right.  While he expressed the view that even if the Minister came in and answered the charges he was making to his satisfaction, I am afraid we would know from our experience of Deputy Cluskey, despite what the Minister had to say about it even if he satised the House, it is most unlikely he would be able to satisfy the Deputy.  However, the debate from time to time rose to higher standards.  Although we had a number of people both from the Fine Gael and Labour benches talking about the whole position of planning appeals there were some contributions which were worth listening to during the first three or four days.  Deputy Tully is one of those I listened to.  He could be regarded as a person, certainly amongst the Labour members, who knows his work and acts accordingly.</P>
    <P>The discussion that took place here for the past six or seven weeks brought in most of the Front Bench members of the Fine Gael Party.  This was to add weight to some of the charges made by some of the Fine Gael people about corruption in dealing with those planning appeals.  While this was going away from the drafting in the Bill and dealing with planning generally, this was worth while because we have all come to agree that planning is a very complex matter and people generally throughout the country are only now becoming plan conscious.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions made, and if you were to read through the debates you would see this, that this whole business of planning appeals should be done away with and that all planning should be the business of the local authorities because the charge was made that on a couple of occasions decisions were made by the Minister, to which exception was taken, which were different from those which the planning authorities had already taken.  If we accept the right of appeal, it is to be expected that some of the appeals which will be lodged will mean that the <Col N="1112" /> decisions of the planning authorities will be reversed.  I think about 50 per cent of the total number of appeals which come into the Department of Local Government are approved, or if you like, are granted.  That would suggest that as far as the local authorities are concerned justice would not be done if people had not the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>One of the things which struck me about Deputy Fitzpatrick's contribution, and it is one of the things I feel very strongly about, is that the individual down the country who is a cottier or small holder who wants to build a porch in front of his house or a back kitchen at the rere of his house, has a proposal which to him is just as important as the building of office blocks in the city of Dublin or anywhere else. When we accept this, it is only fair and right that we should have this right of appeal.  If you were to read through the debates we have had on this proposal, you would find that a number of Deputies suggest more or less that we should not have this right at all, that the thing should end with the local authority or if you like that the Minister had not the right to interfere with the decision of the local authority.</P>
    <P>One of the justifications for the Bill, according to Deputy Fitzpatrick, was a resolution passed by the Association of Municipal Authorities at their annual conference in Tralee during the past year.  I understand that because of the large number of resolutions on the agenda, and that this was towards the back-end of the conference, a large number of the resolutions were passed without a lot of discussion on them.</P>
    <P>I recall listening to three members of the Executive of the Municipal Authorities Association in an interview on television and I think it was the Fine Gael man who suggested the reason they passed the resolution was that they would have an opportunity of discussing it with the Minister if it was passed at the conference.  If it was not they would not have that opportunity of discussing that aspect of their activities with the Minister prior to this year's annual conference.  It really was not in that sense a decision of the Municipal Authorities Association in so far as there was no lengthy debate <Col N="1113" /> on it.  It was used as an executive opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister prior to the annual conference this year.  That is the only justification I can see in Deputy Fitzpatrick's contribution here to justify this charge.</P>
    <P>I am as conscious of difficulties throughout the country, as well as Deputy Fitzpatrick and anyone else and I have not come across a demand on the part of the public for this change.  I find that 50 per cent of the people I deal with on planning appeals have to be turned down and many of those are in my own constituency.  I am perhaps more conversant with those matters than many other Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. O'Donnell came in and made a contribution.  I was glad to see him because being a former Minister for Local Government, he would be conversant with the Minister's responsibilities in this regard and the volume of work which this involves.  He mentioned the number of appeals he had to deal with and the number of appeals the present Minister has to deal with. He then went on to explain how he dealt with some of those appeals when they came to him.  One of the things he said was that in one particular case in my own constituency, where an appeal was lodged and the recommendation was against granting permission, subsequently he decided he would visit the site himself.  I do not know what influenced him to visit the site.  After visiting the site, he decided that permission could be granted, subject to the resiting of the garage on the particular site.  I remember I was a member of Wicklow County Council at the time and we had this appeal.  We were one of the counties who were operating town and regional planning at the time.  Our county manager informed the council members that the then Minister had upheld an appeal in regard to this particular site.  The greatest critics of the Minister at the time were some of the people who are now members of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>I remember defending the Minister by asking what was the point of having the right of appeal if the Minister could not change a decision.  There was <Col N="1114" /> no point in going through the formality of an appeal if you were going to get the same result.  I felt at the time that the Minister was entitled to do what he did.  He was quite entitled to go and inspect the site and afterwards to grant permission if he felt he was justified in doing so.  This is exactly what we are trying to do, as far as the Minister and myself are concerned.  We are trying to deal with the planning appeals we receive in an objective way.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell also referred to the fact that he dealt with a lot of those appeals in his own kind of way, by just signing the form.  This is a matter entirely for himself and if that is the way he wanted to deal with those, that was his business.  I must confess that I agree with him that there is some difficulty.  I try to read all the recommendations that are put before me by the officials of the Department. At least I try to read the planning officer's report, as he is the technical person who has to advise.  There are times when we disagree with him and there are times when we try to satisfy ourselves that the planning authority's opinion is reasonable to the appellant or the person who is appealing.</P>
    <P>During the course of Deputy P. O'Donnell's contribution, he referred to a position developing whereby he would find himself confronted with 100 appeals in one day for signature.  That is an extraordinary statement.  During his whole term of office, he dealt with 460 appeals altogether.  If he could not afford the time to read them all, it was not because of his activities on other Local Government matters because these activities have increased substantially in the interim.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided that he would deal with some of the cases to which Deputy O'Donnell had referred and he saw in some decisions of approval given by Deputy P. O'Donnell as Minister for Local Government that there was a question mark after them.  There certainly should be a question mark after them.  I remember reading, although I cannot say who said it, where some members of the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party said that only two cases could be pinpointed in Deputy P. O'Donnell's whole term of <Col N="1115" /> office.  His term of office was something short of three years and in that time he dealt with 460 appeals and there were only two cases about which there was any doubt.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with 4,000 appeals in the same period approximately and the Opposition have come up with two cases where there is a doubt in their mind as to whether planning permission was granted.  If you were to take it on that basis, the greater offender was Deputy P. O'Donnell.  I do not accept that he was an offender because he did what he was entitled to do.</P>

I have no desire to go back delving into the filing system in the Custom House to see what Deputy P. O'Donnell did or did not do during his term of office. I defended him in regard to a particular case in County Wicklow with regard to an appeal and his right to reverse the decision of the county council if he thought it was the right thing to do.  If we are to accept the principle of the right of appeal, this must be allowed to happen from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy N. Lemass said he was in favour of the passage of the 1963 Bill through the Dáil and he anticipated at that time that the numbers of planning appeals would not be so great. <Col N="1116" /> That was my opinion too.  The more planning applications granted, the less planning appeals we would have.  I understand now that 66 per cent of the local planning authorities have their development plans prepared; they are now actually made, and the rest are in draft form.  I suppose when the local authorities and the public generally become more accustomed to the idea of planning, we can anticipate a fall in the number of planning appeals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy as a member of a local authority, should know that a local authority are quite entitled to amend their development plan from time to time if they think they were wrong in their assessment in the first instance.  It will be a matter for the local authority to change their plan to keep pace with the times.  I do not anticipate a substantial increase in the number of planning appeals.  I suppose it is true to say that most of the planning appeals we receive here are lodged because the person concerned believes he was right and that the planning authority's rejection in the first instance was wrong.  In some cases the appellant had good technical advice available to him, and this technical adviser might be regarded as an authority in his own field.  He, on the one hand, will advise his client and encourage him to lodge an appeal and the appeal comes to us in the Department and again the matter is considered by technical staff, who, as far as we are concerned, are the tops in the country in their profession and the best available to us at the moment.  It is a question of the technical people differing and somebody losing out on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctors differ and patients die. Planners differ from one county to another, even in the matter of providing contacts with the planning authority officials and the Minister's officials in the Custom House.  However, the number of planning appeals we receive would be an indication to me in deciding that the planning authorities are not as liberal as they should be in dealing with the original proposals.  The Minister <Col N="1117" /> and I have tried to get across to the local planning authorities that there should be more consultation with the original applicants in the first instance and, if this were done, we might find ourselves with a substantial reduction in the number of planning appeals.</P>
    <P>I think we can take it that up to 50 per cent of appeals that are subsequently upheld by the Minister could very readily have been approved of in the first instance by the planning authority.  If that happened, we would have much less to deal with in the Department of Local Government.  If you read the debates, you will find that it was generally agreed that planning authorities should have a more liberal approach in dealing with applicants. Some of the time I wonder why when a matter is being dealt with locally it is not thought about as a case on appeal.  However, we have to keep pushing our point of view in the hope that local authorities will become more liberal in their approach and, in that way, that a greater number of applicants will succeed, thus resulting in a reduction in the number of people who have to appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <P>We will find in two years that we will be there with a chance and you will not.  The figures were not all that bad.  However, Deputy L'Estrange referred to a case in Athlone and said that the Minister reversed the decision of the local planning authority at the behest of the Minister for Justice.  That is one of the cases I dealt with myself.  The Minister had nothing to do with it, except, of course, that he has to take the rap for the action of his Parliamentary Secretary, who was myself in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> I have no doubt whatever that in this case we were right.</P>
    <P>The individual concerned lived in the end house of a short terrace.  He applied in 1966 for permission to extend out over his front garden, towards the footpath, to build a room.  He got permission from the local authority. Subsequently he changed his mind and decided he would seek permission to convert the building into a licensed premises.  He had to go back to the local authority and, on this occasion, they knocked him, rejected his application on the ground that he was extending beyond the building line, though previously they had given him permission to do what he wanted in terms of building.</P>
    <P>The reason they refused him was that his proposal was to build beyond the building line.  It so happens that at the other end of the terrace, there is a business premises and the planning authority had already given permission there, though it meant extending to the same line.  The question of the building line did not arise in that case&mdash;they were prepared to give permission for a similar type of building on the same terrace.  What we had to ask ourselves was whether the planning authority had been unreasonable in the second case.  Personally I felt they had been unreasonable.  The question at issue was that on the one hand the building was to be used as part of the man's residence and on the other, as a business premises.</P>
    <P>The type of business that man intended to carry on was the subject of a licence application which would have to be decided in court and I saw nothing whatever wrong in granting permission for the building.  I had no say, of course, in deciding whether the building could become a public house; this was a matter entirely for the courts to decide.  However, planning permission was granted in this case and I believe I was right in so doing.  I should like to let Deputy L'Estrange know that it was not the Minister, that it was I, and I repeat that I have no doubt I did the right thing in this case. There are other aspects of that case which I could mention but I do not wish to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> The Minister has dealt fully with the Bill and what it proposes.  As he said, he is open to conviction as to whether the system proposed is not a better one than that which we have and which ties up a lot of the time of the Minister and me.  As far as I am concerned, I deal with all applications as I see them.  I go into the files or the parts of them that matter&mdash;the recommendations of the Departmental officers and the reports of the planning inspectors. Having read all that data, I decide whether I should add my name to the draft decision submitted to me because I am conscious when rejecting any appeal that the turning down of an application can create hardship for individuals.</P>
    <P>For instance, a case came before me from a small farmer in the West who wanted to build a cow byre on a small piece of ground in front of his house, bordered by the road on two sides.  The official view was that we should reject the application because the land might be needed at some future time for road widening.  In the case I have just mentioned, however, I thought rejection might create a terrible hardship for a small farmer with 20 to 25 acres of land.  Accordingly, I asked the inspector to go down again and have another look at the place, to go to the farmer and see if there was any way we could meet him.  That has been my approach to planning appeals and I do not think there is anything unreasonable in adopting that attitude.</P>
    <P>There are other cases when Members of the Opposition as well as of my own Party make representations to us in planning appeals.  I do not think it is all that bad to make such representations to the Minister on behalf of constituents.  One would gather here that it is a terrible crime&mdash;we can read it in the debates&mdash;that it is the worst form of skulduggery for a Deputy to make representations to a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of a constituent.  I do not accept that.  As public representatives we are entitled to make representations on behalf of a constituent no matter what his political persuasion.  It does not always happen&mdash;and why should it&mdash;that a constituent with Fianna Fáil leanings <Col N="1120" /> would go to a Fianna Fáil Deputy or that a constituent with Fine Gael leanings would go to a Fine Gael Deputy. If a man thinks his application will succeed by going to a Fianna Fáil TD or other Fianna Fáil public representative, that is where he will go.  When election day comes, he can go somewhere else and nobody can seriously object to it.</P>
    <P>However, the attitude of some Deputies speaking here is that this form of representation by Deputies should not be tolerated or entertained.  I do not accept that.  As far as I am concerned, the fact that a TD has made representations on behalf of a person who has an appeal before the Department might help me to look more closely at it to satisfy myself that I am doing the right thing.  I have not been beyond speaking to people who have made these representations to see if I can get over the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I can refer to a couple of cases.  A prominent member of the Opposition was dealing with a case and he and his client called at my house.  Within a few days, I met the Deputy for the constituency whose attitude was that the person concerned was getting a raw deal.  That is generally what happens&mdash; it is represented that people whose applications have been rejected by local authorities have got raw deals&mdash;and it is up to me to adjudicate and to see that any wrong is righted.  That is what we do and that is all we intend to do.</P>
    <P>This Bill as drafted is not acceptable to the Government.  At the same time, the Minister has indicated that he is having a look at this whole question of the determination of appeals and that he hopes to come up with something in the not too distant future.  In the meantime, I should like to lay the ghost about all this corruption that is alleged to be going on in dealing with planning appeals as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I have no reason to believe but that the Minister also deals with planning appeals after giving due consideration to the appellant's case on the one hand and the reports submitted to him on the other hand.  We try to be reasonable and fair.  The fact that we have been doing this is, I believe, <Col N="1121" /> one of the reasons the Fianna Fáil Government have remained for so long in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It has been recognised in this country as far back as 1934, at least, that some form of planning control is necessary in order to avoid unsightly building and haphazard layout of building throughout the country.  The Town and Regional Planning Act was, I think, introduced and enacted in that year. Under it, the planning authorities were required to provide a plan.  That Act was amended, I think, by an Act of 1939.  We know that the whole system under those two Acts was very loose. Indeed, some 15 or 16 years after the Act of 1934 had reached the Statute Book, some citizen of Dublin sued the corporation in the High Court for an order to compel them to carry out their duties under the Act of 1934.  I think very few local authorities did, in fact, comply with the terms of that Act.</P>
      <P>That situation being as it then was, with these Acts on the Statute Book which were really never implemented and operating preliminary plans in a quite unsatisfactory manner, the Planning and Development Act, 1963, was passed by this House after much discussion. Despite strenuous efforts by the Fine Gael spokesman on Local Government at the time&mdash;Deputy Jones&mdash;to have some sort of machinery inserted in it to deal with appeals, such as we now propose, it was allowed to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas without those adequate or proper appeal provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I want to say, in order to clear the air, that we in the Fine Gael Party entirely approve of proper planning.  We believe it would be an outrage to let the citizens of the country build higgledy-piggledy, any way they like.  We believe that if the beauty of our country is to be preserved, and its appearance improved, there must be planning control.  For that reason, we approved of the Planning and Development Act, 1963, and did our best to improve it and to send it out of this House a better measure than when it came into it.  However, the Minister for Local Government of the day resisted the best endeavours of Deputy <Col N="1122" /> Jones to provide an independent system of appeal which would do justice and which would appear to do justice, a system which would be divorced from politics and which would not appear to operate under political pressure.</P>
    <P>While I have said that we believe in planning, and believe in proper planning, we realise that a proper system of planning may operate to increase the value of property tremendously or to decrease the value of property tremendously.  It can make a man or break a man.  That is probably all right so long as it is done fairly and squarely and above board and so long as it is not open to any abuses.</P>
    <P>Now, we are dealing here only with appeals against decisions of the planning authorities on planning matters.  I accept the word of the Minister for Local Government that only about seven per cent of all planning applications come to the Department of Local Government by way of appeal.  I say, however, that if only one per cent came, it is still a very important business.  If only one per cent came, that one per cent should be adjudicated upon fairly, in a manner which would inspire public confidence, in a manner which would make it impossible for anybody to make the charges that have been made since the Second Stage of this Bill was taken up on 31st January last.</P>
    <P>Now, as I have said, the Planning and Development Act, 1963, was passed and, under it, very considerable power was conferred on planning authorities.  Practically any alteration in property has to be the subject of a planning application.  If a man wants to erect a pair of piers at the entrance to his property he must apply to the planning authority for permission to do so. If he wants to build a house, he must apply to the planning authority for permission to do so.  If he wants to change the colour of his house, he must first apply for permission from the planning authority to do so.  If he is thinking of using some of his land beside the town for building purposes, he must apply to the planning authority for permission to do so.  As I say, the result of the decision of that planning authority can be to increase the value of his land <Col N="1123" /> tremendously or very much to decrease it.</P>
    <P>The Planning Bill, 1963, provided that an appeal would lie from various decisions of the planning authority but that that appeal would be to the Minister for Local Government who would investigate the matter or give his decision on it, at any rate, behind closed doors and without, in many cases, giving any reasons for his decision.  It was inevitable that that system would not give satisfaction.  It is the understatement of the year to say that that appeals system was the subject of much criticism since the 1963 Bill became law.  It did not give satisfaction.  There have been suspicions that political influence was what counted rather than the merits of the case.  Indeed, during this debate we have had Deputy Molloy, for example, saying that he deals with at least six planning appeals per week.  I am not going to be offensive to Deputy Molloy but, I ask, what qualifications has Deputy Molloy or any other Deputy, unless he happens to be a town planner by career, to deal with these appeals?  What expert knowledge has he?  What qualifications?  Is it not obvious that the only qualification he has is that he is a member of the Government Party and is in a position to go to the Minister and to use his influence?  Deputy Molloy has even told us that supporters of the Fine Gael Party in Galway come to him rather than to their own Deputy.  Is it not obvious that the reason that a Fine Gael supporter or a Labour supporter goes to a Fianna Fáil Deputy in order to get him to make representations on a matter of this sort is that he believes that that Deputy has more influence with his Minister than a member of the Opposition would have?</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Lemass the other day telling us that a constituent of his was about to buy some property in Dublin.  Whom does he consult as to the advisability of buying the property or as to his chances of getting planning permission?  Does he consult his architect, his town planner or engineer?  Not at all.  He consults his Fianna Fáil Deputy.  He brings Deputy Lemass up and, according to Deputy Lemass, <Col N="1124" /> shows him the property and says: &ldquo;I am thinking of buying this.  What are my chances of getting planning permission to do such and such a thing with it?&rdquo; That is the sort of thing that gives rise to disquiet.  That is the sort of thing that created public unrest and lack of confidence in this system.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party introduced this Bill, not as Deputy Lemass said the other evening as a gimmick on the eve of the Wicklow and Clare by-elections, but as far back as 22nd June, 1967, and, again, it was not introduced by a number of senior counsel in this Party, as has been said during the debate; it was introduced by me as the Party spokesman on Local Government, supported by Deputy Jones who fought so valiantly to put the same provision into the 1963 Bill, Deputy Ryan who is familiar with Dublin city, Deputy Clinton who is a former Party spokesman on Local Government and Deputy Barry from the constituency of Cork.</P>
    <P>We introduced this Bill in order to meet a public demand which has been in existence since the 1963 Bill became law.  I have said that there is disquiet in the country.  I have said that there is unrest in the country, that there is suspicion about the way that these appeals are being decided.  We hear a great deal of talk about the mass media of communication but the newspapers in this country take up only those subjects that are agitating the minds of the public.  When such noncommitted independent newspapers as the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> agitate for an amendment of the method of determining appeals, the country is entitled to take notice of it. When the <i>Irish Times</i> campaigns, as it is entitled to do and as in my opinion it has a duty to do when it fears that there is a grave public scandal, the Minister for Local Government refers to them as craw-thumping hypocrites. Indeed, not alone do the newspapers that are free and unfettered think it is their duty to ventilate this disgrace and this public outrage but the State-sponsored television station, Radio Telefís Éireann thinks that it is its duty&mdash;and I do not think anybody can accuse that form of mass media of being anti-Fianna Fáil or of being pro-Fine <Col N="1125" /> Gael&mdash;to focus public attention on several cases where queer decisions had been given, to put it no stronger than that.</P>
    <P>These are the circumstances in which the Fine Gael Party decided to introduce this Bill.  We introduced it, as I have said, on 22nd June, 1967, but, because it had to take its place in the queue of Private Members' Business, it did not get as far as a Second Reading, until 31st January this year, when the Second Reading was moved by me in, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, a reasonable manner.  Indeed, other Members of this House have said that I introduced the measure in a reasonable and reasoned fashion.  The first person to say that was the Minister for Health, who was the first speaker on behalf of the Government.  He paid me compliments on the manner in which I had introduced the Bill.  It is significant that the last speaker on behalf of the Government was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and he concluded on the same note.  For that I am grateful.</P>
    <P>However, this debate has gone on from 31st January until today.  It has occupied 14 sessions of Private Members' Time of 1½ hours each.  I make that a total of 21 hours.  I want to suggest to the House in some detail before I conclude that this debate has made an unanswerable case for the system of appeals which we propose in this Bill.  The Minister for Health said that there was a lot of merit in the suggestions I put forward, that they deserve serious consideration.  That, I say, will justify the Bill.  But if one thing more than anything else justifies this Bill, it is the speech of the Minister for Local Government, who spoke for several hours on this Second Stage debate.  He justifies the Bill and demonstrates beyond doubt that it is essential.  He spent a great portion of his time attacking one of his predecessors as Minister, Deputy P. O'Donnell. I have instances&mdash;I will come to them later&mdash;in which he accused Deputy P. O'Donnell of corrupt practices, of giving decisions for wrong purposes and being influenced by his friends <Col N="1126" /> and by ex-Deputies and supporters. The Minister for Local Government made those charges against Deputy P. O'Donnell and we had counter-charges made against the present Minister by members of the Labour Party and of the Fine Gael Party.  Is that not more than justification for this measure?</P>
    <P>It is entirely unreasonable in a country so small as this, where everybody knows everybody else, that an appeal should lie to a Minister for Local Government or to any Minister on a matter of such importance.  The Minister for Lands does not decide what land the Land Commission is to acquire.  That is decided by an independent tribunal known as the Lay Commissioners, who have fixity of tenure and who cannot be removed from office unless for grave and serious reasons.  The Minister for Local Government does not come down to Cavan and decide what compensation is to be paid to the owner of land who has his land acquired for house-building. That is decided by a quasi-judicial officer, an arbitrator appointed under an Act of 1916.  He decides the compensation to be paid.  The Minister for Finance does not conduct income tax appeals because he has a vested interest in them, just as the Minister for Local Government would have a vested interest in the payment of compensation for land.  The Special Commissioners on Income Tax sit and adjudicate on that.</P>
    <P>Yet we are handing over here to the political head of a Department the right to adjudicate on whether a hotel is to be built here or here, whether that hotel, which would add perhaps £30,000 or £40,000 to the value of the land, should be built or not.  Take one case.  We had the matter of the hotel it was proposed to build beside the Rock of Cashel.  The Minister for Local Government told us about that case at great length.  He said he was worried about it.  He went down and inspected the site himself and made up his mind.  He said tremendous pressure was brought on him from this and that political Party.  Do you know what struck me?  I said to myself: Suppose, God forbid, in that constituency of Tipperary there had been a by-election <Col N="1127" /> six months before that: It was quite on the cards and not at all unlikely that the Minister for Local Government, who is general director of elections for the Fianna Fáil Party, would have been by virtue of that office stationed in the town of Cashel directing the by-election there.  It was also quite possible that the appellant in the hotel case might have been the best political friend of the Minister in the town of Cashel or, on the other hand, he might have been his arch-enemy.  In whichever position the appellant found himself, what confidence could the people of Cashel have in a decision given by a Minister for Local Government who came down in that capacity to a town where he had presided a few short months previously as a political boss? The matter does not bear serious consideration for a moment.</P>
    <P>As I say, there have been charges and counter-charges.  I feel I must go into these charges and counter-charges. I will not go into the merits of them except in one case which appeared in court.  I think it is sufficient for me to show to the House that members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party are charging the present Minister for Local Government and his predecessor with malpractices and that the present Minister for Local Government is charging Deputy P. O'Donnell with corrupt practices and malpractices&mdash; without going into the merits and demerits of them&mdash; in order to prove conclusively that a system which leaves itself open to that sort of charge could not inspire confidence in any section of our citizens.</P>
    <P>What we propose in this Bill in substitution for the present system is a simple, informal, inexpensive tribunal presided over by a judge of the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court.  I think it is most likely that he would be a Circuit Court judge.  When the Fianna Fáil party throw up their hands in horror at the appointment of a judge, do they forget the Army Pensions Arbitration Board under which Judge Sheehy and later some other judges went around the country in an informal way deciding who was or was not entitled to a pension?  When the <Col N="1128" /> Fianna Fáil Party want to add weight to or bolster up a bad case or to inspire confidence in a doubtful measure of their own, do they not introduce a judge?  Have they not introduced into the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution measure&mdash;which they know they cannot carry in the country&mdash;in order to lend weight to it and make it more palatable to the people, to inspire confidence to try and get it through this House and through the country, a Commission to outline the constituencies, a Commission to be presided over by a judge?  What is the object of that?  Surely it is to say that if a judge is the man in charge things will be done fairly.  Of course, the only difference between what I suggest and what the Fianna Fáil Party suggest in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, is that they will have an appeal from the judge back to the Fianna Fáil Party, and I do not propose that here.  I propose that the appeal be to a tribunal presided over by a judge assisted by two assessors.</P>

      <P>As I was saying before Private Members' Time, there are three counties in my constituency. There is no other Deputy who depends on support from three counties.  I live in the centre and I know from personal experience the troubles caused by having counties split up.  There are different county councils.  There is also the attitude of the people.  It is hard to get people who lived all their lives in Mullingar or Kilbeggan to realise that they are now in Kildare constituency. They know when they are voting, but still if anything happens in the rest of the county of Westmeath, their minds turn immediately to it. When there was a controversy in Westmeath, I had the utmost trouble at my own meetings in getting the people to talk and think about what was happening in Kildare, and if I did not keep control of the meetings, they would talk about Westmeath.  When Labour or Fine Gael representatives come into Kildare, they find they are with another body and they cannot feel at home, and it is the same with the people.  When you have been used to one county, you like to stay there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my own experience, I am safe in saying that 85 or 90 per cent of the people who call to my house to see me live within a radius of 15 or 20 miles of the house.  If I am to serve the rest of the people, I must go out and meet them in different parts of the constituency.  I have offices all over the constituency and they can meet me there.  People do not want to travel too far, and it is not fair to expect them to travel long distances to find their representative.  If we had single-member constituencies, it would be quite simple.  They would all know their Member of Parliament and he in turn would know their problems.  He would know every single one of them and he would know all the roads and <Col N="1130" /> laneways in the area.  It is very hard to get to know people over a big area. Those are some of the advantages of the single-member constituency.</P>
    <P>There is no Member who would refuse to try to help someone who had worked against him at a previous election.  I have often had people who worked against me at an election coming to me after a while&mdash;maybe not the next day but after a month or two&mdash;to do some favour for them, or to give them some assistance with a Department, to try to hurry up a grant or something like that.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy agrees with me, I must be speaking the truth. Every member of the electorate should feel that with the single-member constituency, whether or not they supported <Col N="1131" /> a particular member, that member would represent them and do his utmost for them.  The point has been brought out strongly by the Opposition that if people worked against a certain person who was elected they might not expect to get any assistance or any representation from that Member, or expect that he would see that they would get what was due to them.  That is the important thing, that one should get one's rights.  One must ensure that the Civil Service is providing what people are entitled to get, to prevent them from leaving something undone or forgetting something.</P>

      <P>No member would discriminate among the electorate and rural people would have a better chance of getting a member within a reasonable distance of them.  We have places in the country with two or three Deputies within a couple of miles of each other while other areas have no such representation.  The single-member constituency would ensure that Deputies would not have to travel too far and that their constituents would not have to go too far.  Deputies could give more time to legislation, the purpose for which they are elected. At present other duties take up much of their time and not as much as they would wish is left for legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the single-member constituency, you always get a Government with a majority in the House.  Very rarely in any country such as Britain with single-seat constituencies do they have a Government without a working <Col N="1133" /> majority.  Even the previous British Government had three and they considered that was not a working majority.  Any Government here would think themselves on the pig's back if they had an overall majority of three. In most cases the Government work on a slight minority which tends to give a Government insufficient power to put through legislation that is good for the country and they are forced to alter or delay it, as happened in the case of the inter-Party Government who put things off until they had no option but to run.</P>

In any European <Col N="1135" /> country where there is PR, the Government would give anything to get away from it because they have seen the results of it in the multiplicity of Parties.  They can never have majorities.  Sometimes you find countries without a government for a month.  France was a typical example, with changes of Government at all times.  I heard a comedian&mdash;I think it was Ted Ray&mdash;say that when in Paris, he went up to see the changing of the Government, as one would speak of the Changing of the Guard in England. One of the first things General de Gaulle did in 1958 when he was brought back to power was to change the electoral system into some form of a straight vote, a form which would give the Government a strong majority, and do away with the system of PR they had.  We have seen the results of it since then.  They have never had to devalue their currency.  They have not changed the Government since that time; they have had elections but always the same Government and the same President have been returned. England has devalued its currency, but France has had no need to devalue its currency.  Away back in 1949 when England devalued, all Europe had to do so.</P>

      <P>We have seen the results <Col N="1137" /> of proportional representation in the Governments of Europe where there has been a multiplicity of Parties. It is not good for a country not to have a Government for a reasonably long period of years.  Even in Germany recently, the two strongest parties had to join up because the smallest one that normally supported the Christian Democrats had asked for too much and had to be let go.  If you have strong government for a reasonable period, when the election comes around the people can do what they like.  The people can throw that Party out if they cannot stand on their record during their years of service.  What we propose here is that, if the public so decide in a referendum, there be a Commission with three Members from this side of the House and three Members from that side, presided over by a Judge and that they carve up the single-member constituencies.</P>

      <P>Not in the least.  You would love to mix up the electorate. You tried to confuse the electors but now that the people have had time to think again about it, we hope they will see it correctly.  Fianna Fáil have been in office for 30 out of the past 36 years.  We saw the danger of what could happen under PR.  In 1959 we asked the people to vote for abolishing it as we saw what was happening in Europe and we saw that the divisions which had existed among our people since 1922 were on the way out, and also that there was a large number of <Col N="1140" /> small Parties growing up.  The last Government in their wisdom decided it would be better to offer the people the straight vote system so that future generations would always have a strong Government.  Now, after nine years, a completely new Government. with only a few of the original members who were there in 1958-59, again see the wisdom of abolishing PR and again they are asking the people to abolish it.</P>
      <P>As a progressive Party, we have always felt that what we would like to do and what we do is for the betterment of Ireland both in the present and in the years ahead, and we are asking the people again to vote for the single-member constituency so that they can be always sure of having a strong Government.  You can see that in England there can be great changes from one election to another but at least whoever gets in has a working majority.  We have seen too much of what minority Governments have done here.  The 1955-57 Government was the worst, but even the 1951 Government had to go out of office because there was a split in the Clann na Poblachta Party.  They fell out among themselves and they had to go.  In 1957 three members left your ranks.  They tabled a vote of no confidence in the Government and the Government fell.  It is terrible to think that a Government depend on three particular people.</P>

      <P>It is much better to keep the county boundaries.  It appears, since the decision of Mr. Justice Budd, that we require to have a revision of constituencies after every census because of the shifts of population which are taking place and which are bound to take place.  This would leave the western areas with very few people to represent them and the representatives would have long distances to travel and would not be able to do it. I know what it is like trying to cover a whole county with two other portions. You would require to have 36 hours instead of 24 in the day.  Under the other system, you would be sure of being able to represent the people and of knowing their problems intimately. I hope the House will approve the two amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons given for the introduction of the straight vote and the single-seat constituency is that Deputies have long distances to travel under the present set-up.  There is a little more than that to it: very often constituents do not like approaching their own representatives. People in Thurles come to me asking me to make representations for them about the division of land, reconstruction grants, or something else and, on the other hand, electors in North Tipperary very often approach Deputies representing South Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in North Tipperary.  There are three Deputies for North Tipperary, Deputy Fanning, Deputy Tom Dunne and myself. If a constituent comes to me to do something on his behalf and I fail to satisfy him, then he can go to either Deputy Fanning or Deputy Dunne. There is, in other words, some element of competition in the present system. The result is no TD can be either dishonest or lazy.  There is a certain rivalry in the multi-seat constituency and I think that rivalry is very healthy. If proportional representation is done away with, the people will have no choice.  Suppose I were elected to a single-seat constituency, I could never be beaten in any subsequent election. I would make it my business to pick out the people with the widest connections and I would work for them.  In that way I could build up a huge vote, possibly dishonestly.  That is an aspect that does not seem to have been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 30 years Fianna Fáil have got a huge grip on the older people in particular.  Every job&mdash;rate collector, water inspector or anything else&mdash;was in the giving of Fianna Fáil because they had a majority on most of the local authorities.  I was in Clare during the by-election and I saw more <Col N="1143" /> rate collectors driving around in cars helping Fianna Fáil.  That is why Fianna Fáil have such a vast organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason proportional representation is being abolished is that the younger people are not so easily influenced as people were in the past.  They are better educated and more intelligent and they will not countenance graft and corruption.  I do not say that political parties on local authorities are today electing their own as rate collectors and so on. The system has improved.  The old system was for Fianna Fáil to meet in a public house at a quarter to ten on the morning of a county council meeting and, when they left the public house, they had one name and he was the man who was appointed rate collector when the voting took place. We are doing things differently now. A man is appointed as a rate collector openly and honestly if he merits the appointment.  That is one of the reasons why the Government are now anxious to abolish proportional representation.</P>
      <P>I was reared in a republican tradition. I remember 1922-1923 and then 1929 and 1933.  That was the time of the North.  There is no proportional representation in the North but I always thought that we were more republican in the South.  I never thought I would see the day when a so-called Republican Government would try to introduce the straight vote system of the Unionists in the North of Ireland.  It is a big change from the Republicans I used to know back through the years.  Of course, the young lads do not mind at all.  They were not reared in those republican views. They accept everything that comes from the leaders down.  This will be beaten but it is terribly foolish to put the country to such vast expense.  The figure of the cost given in answer to a question was £100,000, but it will be half that much more.  The people will turn it down and I feel that the Taoiseach should examine whether this £150,000 could be used in a better way than in a referendum.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil talk about one man, one vote.  The Bill changed that.

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is surprising to find ourselves facing another referendum a little more than <Col N="1146" /> eight and a half years after the people rejected a somewhat similar proposition. What is proposed now, of course, is more radical.  As far as I remember on the last occasion, it was a simple question of abolishing proportional representation, but now it is a three-pronged attack.  There is the establishment of the single seat; there is the abolition of PR; and there is the tolerance vote.  I admit that the question of tolerance voting has been introduced as a result of a High Court action which took place here around 1960.  Mr. Justice Budd is the person who has been blamed for making it necessary to incorporate this section in the Bill.  We have been told that we have, in fact, been exercising a degree of tolerance, willy nilly, down through the years and I suppose we have.  I could not say exactly what percentage it is.  I expect it varies and has varied from county to county, and of course it had to increase due to the emigration of the population from the rural areas of the West and the tolerance had reached a stage of becoming an intolerance.  Mr. O'Donovan proceeded to take some action about it which culminated in this High Court decision by Mr. Justice Budd.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister is endeavouring to clear that issue and have it incorporated in the Constitution, so that from now on we will have up to a maximum of six per cent tolerance, as they call it, which, in effect, will mean, of course, that in one area somewhere about 16,066 votes will be sufficient and in another area 33,333 votes will be required.  Those are the figures, so at all events it would appear that there may be a 40 per cent difference between the value of a vote in one area and that in another. One man's vote will be 1½ times as valuable as another man's.  A man living in certain rural areas would have a decided advantage.  I presume this will be decided on by the Commission. This man's vote will have an exaggerated value as compared with the vote of a person living in Dublin, Cork or other built-up areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned a couple of points which are of particular value and which could bear <Col N="1147" /> emphasising but before I go on to that, I wish to correct one point raised here by Deputy Crinion, which has been raised time and time again. I refer to the question of France, which is held up as the bogeyman.  It is said that all their constitutional and parliamentary difficulties appear to have stemmed from some kind of PR system they had there.  I do not pretend to understand the French system but I heard Deputy Esmonde speaking about it and I presume he knows more about it than most Deputies.  He said that the disputes there arose because when a government was removed or altered, they had a re-alignment and another group came in without any election being held.  Their difficulties are apparently caused by a change of government and PR is not entirely to blame for it.</P>
    <P>There are many features of the PR system as we use it here which are highly desirable.  Even some of the Government speakers who have spoken adverted to the fact that there were virtues in PR.  First and foremost, there is the matter of a choice. Under the straight vote system, you will have a choice of only two or three candidates.  In this country you will have probably Fianna Fáil candidates, Fine Gael candidates and in a number of constituencies, Labour candidates. An analogous position obtains in Great Britain where you have a choice between Tory candidates, Labour candidates and in some constituencies, Liberal candidates.  In most areas the average choice in this country for Dáil elections has been between eight and nine.  I submit this is a very desirable thing.  It has even an educational value and it gives the electorate a wide range not alone between different Parties but between different members of the same Party.</P>
    <P>Most voters, if they are Fianna Fáil, will vote first for Fianna Fáil candidates.  They have an opportunity of exercising their preference as between one Fianna Fáil candidate and another.  If a voter is not a very strong-minded political man, he may be the type of person who would like to give the first vote to a Fianna Fáil <Col N="1148" /> candidate, his No. 2 to the Fine Gael candidate, or vice versa.  That has been a good characteristic of the PR system.  Even when you go around canvassing, the average voter finds it very helpful to say: &ldquo;We will give you some kind of a vote.  We cannot give you the No. 1 but we will give you some vote.&rdquo;  Fine Gael feel no embarrassment about this because we know we will get the No. 3 or No. 4 vote at least.  Those people can always tell you truthfully: &ldquo;We will put you in somewhere.&rdquo;  It may not be very good to us because Fianna Fáil very often come out first but it has a good social effect generally.</P>
    <P>Under this straight vote system, the people will probably say: &ldquo;We cannot vote for you at all.  We are Fianna Fáil and we cannot vote for you.  We wish it were the other way.  We preferred that.  We are sorry we cannot vote for you.&rdquo;  That opportunity will no longer be there and it is a pity.  That is one of the desirable features of the PR system which we will lose under the so-called straight vote.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is not crooked.  Those people will tell you that they cannot give you the No. 1 vote but that they will put you in somewhere else.  They will tell you that they will give you the No. 2 or the No. 3 vote.  You then know they are telling you the truth.  It is when you know they are Fianna Fáil and they tell you that they will give you the No. 1 vote that you know that a revolution has taken place.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is canvassing, very often goes into Fine Gael houses and they will tell him: &ldquo;We will give you the No. 2 or the No. 3 vote.&rdquo;  I am sure he often comes up against that.  We get votes from Fianna Fáil people and the same applies with regard to Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That system of preference will no longer be available to us and will create some slight embarrassment, both <Col N="1149" /> for canvassers and electors when we come to their doors.  From the point of view of the voters, the PR system has the advantage that the great majority of the voters see their No. 1 candidate elected and they also see their No. 2 or No. 3 candidate elected. This gives a great incentive to people to vote and it is reflected in the percentage of voting which takes place. As far as I know somewhere around 75 per cent of the people vote in Dáil elections.  I know that is not the exact figure but it is an approximate figure. That is a very good figure for a rural country like ours where people have to travel considerable distances and sometimes in bad weather.  In other countries, they have had to introduce some measures to get people to vote. The reason for the high percentage of voters in this country is the fact that even if their No. 1 choice is not elected, their second or third choice may be elected.  It is like place betting in a race.  If your No. 1 does not get past the post, your placed one may, and at least you get a placed bet and it is more satisfactory than coming home without a winner at all.</P>
    <P>In contrast, in 1950 in England, 44.8 per cent of the people saw their single vote ending in scratch.  Nearly one-half the voting population in Britain in that year of 1950 were virtually disfranchised. They went in, voted one single vote and the person they voted for was not elected so they might just as well have stayed at home.  Deriving from that of course is the situation that obtains in England, the large number of uncontested seats.  I am open to contradiction on this but I am not aware of a single Dáil seat ever passing uncontested in this country.  There may have been in the past, but I am not aware in recent times of any single Dáil seat passing uncontested, and I do not think that under proportional representation it is likely to happen, particularly with the multi-seat constituency.  It is not uncommon in other countries, particularly in Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Occasionally there is a situation where under proportional representation it might suit one or other side if they saw no chance of winning it.  If there was agreement, I could understand it, but, by and large, under proportional <Col N="1151" /> representation here, the number of uncontested seats is very small.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said that the number of uncontested seats in Northern Ireland is 27.  If his figure is correct, that is extraordinary.  It is an average in Northern Ireland under the straight vote system.  I believe that the percentage of uncontested seats here will be higher than obtains in England and probably will be more analogous with what obtains in Northern Ireland, if what Deputy Tully says is correct.  We are traditional voters, just as they are in the North of Ireland, where they are Unionist and Protestant on the one side, and Nationalist and Catholic, on the other.  We would regard them as a traditional type of voters.  In our own fashion we are just as traditional down here, which is the explanation for the lack of change in the electoral picture for elections south of the Border.</P>
      <P>Apart from these factors, proportional representation from the point of view of the citizen gives complete or partial satisfaction to almost all voters, provided they exercise their preferential right in full.  There would be only a few left without any voice in the selection of a national Assembly.  I think it was Deputy Tully who also said that the number of unused votes under proportional representation is 15 per cent.  He did not seem to be quite sure if that was correct: he was quoting from memory.  That is a different picture from what could obtain under the straight vote system where 40 per cent of the electorate in a constituency will have their votes made fruitful in selecting a candidate and the other 60 per cent may fail to get anybody elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency, for example, South Tipperary&mdash;and the same would arise in every constituency&mdash;under the tolerance voting, for instance, a lot of our people would vote and not succeed in electing anybody.  In England, there are millions of voters who voted during their entire active lives and never succeeded in casting a valid or effective vote for any Member of Parliament. That picture never arises here.  From the point of view of the voter, there is <Col N="1152" /> a far more satisfying and a far more favourable picture.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the Liberal Party in Britain.  In how many constituencies would it not be as well for the Liberal Party to stay at home?  In how many single-seat constituencies?  The Liberal Party nowadays would be the smallest Party but they go to the polling booth and vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I agree that probably in the first instance Fine Gael would contest all the 144 seats.  Labour would probably do their best to contest as many as they could, but when I speak about contesting seats, I am not referring to the situation next year but in five years or in six years.  In the Dáil contest after next year, a number of Deputies will be beaten.  Will these Deputies contest the seats after another four or five years?  I very much doubt it.  However, I was dealing with what I termed disfranchisement and I was pointing out that in constituencies in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, where the system has always been in operation, in every election a large percentage of the population has been disfranchised.</P>
      <P>In this country, if PR is abolished and single-seat constituencies apply, the mere fact that PR is abolished will mean that a large percentage of the electorate will be disfranchised.  Let us consider the percentage poll which Fianna Fáil can rise to.  Only on one occasion did they get more than 50 per cent of the votes&mdash;I think they got 52 per cent once but so many figures are being bandied about that it is difficult to keep them in mind.  However, generally speaking, Fianna Fáil have been getting between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the majority of elections, therefore, they have failed not alone to secure a majority of the seats of the House but to secure more than 50 per cent of the votes.  If their advantage record is 40 per cent or a little more does that not mean that in the future a big percentage of the remaining 60 per cent of the voters will be disfranchised?  That being so, how many of that 60 per cent of the voters would go to the polls to vote without the satisfaction of being able to elect a candidate?  It will be a substantial percentage and it will be bad for democracy and bad for the country because people will eventually lose interest in elections.  It has been agreed by all Parties&mdash;I have heard it expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House&mdash;that people do not take <Col N="1154" /> sufficient interest in politics nowadays, though we go to considerable trouble to get the electoral lists right and, on television and otherwise, try to encourage people to vote.</P>
    <P>Surely, then, it is a retrograde step to abolish PR and substitute the single-seat system.  That is the strongest deterrent ever introduced against voting.  Even the most ardent supporter of the Opposition, be it Fine Gael or Labour, will be after one or two elections, disheartened and disinclined to go to the polling booth because when repeatedly they have not succeeded in electing candidates they will begin to lose hope.</P>
    <P>Under the PR system, in every constituency there are two, three or four candidates put up by every Party, particularly the two major Parties. Most constituencies return one Fine Gael Member and though Fine Gael people think they ought to get two, at least they have the satisfaction of getting one elected.  Therefore, people have reasonable faith in the electoral system because though they did not get all they wanted, they succeeded in electing a candidate and that encouraged them to vote next time.  If we divide that into four parts and presume these people succeed in getting one candidate elected, what about the other three?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> As regards representatives, it is arguable&mdash;I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealt with that aspect of it&mdash;how much we should seek to elect representatives and how much we should seek to elect a Government.  He made the valid point that in our electoral system we are trying to do two things &mdash;we are trying to elect a Parliament which would be, so to speak, a <Col N="1156" /> microcosm of the nation, representative of the people, and, at the same time, thereby and through that, we are trying to elect an Executive.  He thought we were trying to do two rather opposite things through the same system.  There may be something in that argument.  I feel there is nothing incompatible in having Parliament representative of the electorate and also in having it adapted to elect a Government.</P>
      <P>I shall give the figures for the last election here to show that proportional representation does give a very representative picture.  In the 1965 general election, Fianna Fáil got 47.7 per cent of the votes and 72 seats, that is, 50 per cent.  If they would like to split hairs and to say that one of the seats was a non-contested one, it would be slightly more than 50 per cent.  Fine Gael got 47 seats, that is, 32.6 per cent, Labour got 15.4 per cent of the votes and 22 seats which gave them a percentage of 15.2.  The others got 2.9 per cent of the votes and three seats, which works out at two per cent.  It will be seen, therefore, that there is a complete parallel, percentage-wise, between the amount of votes cast in favour of each Party and the number of seats subsequently secured by that Party.  From the point of view of getting adequate and accurate representation, I think it would be hard to obtain any system which could improve upon that.  The two figures on both sides are practically identical.</P>
      <P>On the obverse side of the coin, under the straight vote, a Party getting no more than 40 per cent of the votes could quite easily get 60 per cent or more of the seats in a national Assembly.  A system like that can give an excessive and a disproportionate Government majority and it can lead to a powerless Opposition.  It can lead, ultimately, to the establishment of a one-Party system.  As I have already emphasised, that danger is particularly present in our society by virtue of the fact that we are traditional in our habits, particularly in our voting habits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued that one advantage of the proposed new system is that it would give greater stability.  That <Col N="1157" /> seems an extraordinary claim.  Whether or not it is due to proportional representation, we have had an amazing degree of stability here.  Certainly, Fianna Fáil have no reason to complain because they have had 30 years of government in the past 36 years. Of the past 12 elections, they have succeeded in winning ten.  Therefore, on first observation, one wonders why they have chosen to look for a change and why they have chosen this particular time.</P>
    <P>Of course, as regards stability, we compare, in terms of Parliament, quite well with the British system. The last five British Governments have lasted, on an average, slightly less than three years and the last five Irish Governments have lasted, on an average, slightly more than three years.  So, as regards length of parliamentary life, there does not seem to be much difference between the one and the other. In fact, I think our stability has got to the stage of almost verging on stagnation.</P>
    <P>An advantage of the present system, which was mentioned by the previous speaker, is, I think, important because it concerns not the member of the House but the citizen.  Under our present system, in practically every constituency, no matter what Party a man may support&mdash;I am referring to the three major Parties&mdash;he will usually succeed in his own constituency in being able to go to a Deputy of his own Party.  There is no Fine Gael Deputy in North Kerry and the Fine Gael supporters there have no Fine Gael Deputy to go to.  There are areas all over the west of Ireland where people who may be inclined towards Labour have not a Labour Deputy there to consult.  But, by and large, in most constituencies, even in constituencies where the Opposition Parties are weak, there is a Deputy to whom people can go and for whom probably they have voted.</P>
    <P>Under the system now proposed, there will be many areas where the people&mdash;particularly supporters of the Opposition, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash; will be constrained to go outside their constituency, may have to travel a <Col N="1158" /> good distance to find him, if they want to consult a Fine Gael or a Labour Deputy.  They may even be constrained to go to a Fianna Fáil Deputy whom they have not supported and who, in all probability, knows they have not supported him.  This is an embarrassing situation.  A previous Deputy mentioned a development of that which had not occurred to me but which could possibly arise.  He suggested that, in a single-seat constituency, a Deputy, entrenched in office, could exercise discrimination in his support of people coming to him and asking him for particular services.  He would be the only Deputy in a particular area and if there is a conflict between two persons, he might be inclined to support the person he thinks will be more useful afterwards rather than be governed by strict impartiality.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already in respect of the straight vote system its lack of proportionality but there is also another factor in it which sometimes arises, that is, the question of unpredictability. Apart from its being non-representative, the voting result can be illogical and unpredictable.  To give some examples: In 1945, the Socialists in the United Kingdom got 48.7 per cent of the votes; they secured 82.3 per cent of the seats and had a powerful Socialist Government.  In 1950, the Liberals got 19.1 per cent of the votes but got only 1.4 per cent of the seats. The Socialists did better proportionalwise. They got 46.3 per cent of the votes and 50.4 per cent of the seats.  In 1951, the Socialists got 48.6 per cent of the votes and got 47.4 per cent of the seats and there was a Conservative Government.  An example mentioned here by Deputy Costello was Canada. Canada has been mentioned also by the Taoiseach, amongst others.  In 1953, the Liberal Party got 48 per cent of the votes and got a two-to-one majority of the seats.  These figures show not alone disproportion but a degree of unpredictability which is sometimes difficult to explain.</P>
    <P>Probably the strongest point to be made in support of our present system and the point that has been made by all the speakers here at this time and <Col N="1159" /> eight and a half years ago is the question of minority rights.  I recognise that perfect proportionality is not possible to attain.  The nearest to it would be to have the whole country as one constituency and, of course, that is impractical. Proportionality is the inverse of the number of seats per constituency. Down through the years, there has been a cutting down of the seats in this country by various Electoral Acts to the Constitution minimum of three. I cannot say offhand how many three-seaters we have now but the majority of our constituencies are three-seaters, and it is only in special cases, I presume, that we have retained the four-seater and five-seater.  This progressive lowering of the number of seats has given a bonus to Fianna Fáil electoral-wise, if I may express it that way, but it has also ill-favoured Labour and other minorities.</P>
    <P>I presume that each time these Electoral Bills were introduced in the House, Labour must have resisted the cutting down of the number of constituency seats because they would be perfectly aware of the fact that each time the number of constituency seats was lowered, their position was being worsened as regards representation in this House.  Now it is proposed to carry that further and to complete the step from three-, four- and five-seat constituencies we have to the single seat. There was a time here when we had eight-seat constituencies and I believe we had a nine-seat constituency on one occasion.  These may have been too large and unwieldy but certain it is that multi-seat constituencies must be retained from the point of view of proportionality, from the point of view of the rights of minorities, if they are to get representation here proportionate to their numbers, or anything like proportionate.  They have suffered down through the years by the reduction in the number of seats per constituency&mdash;not only Labour but Independents and all minorities&mdash;and Fianna Fáil have gained correspondingly. I could not give the actual figure of the gain but any mathematician would probably be able to work out statistically what the actual gain was.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> As regards the questions, whether we want to elect an assembly here, whether we want to elect a representative assembly or merely want to elect a strong Government or whether our system is not suitable for the election of both, that is a matter open for debate but if the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party feel that the election of a strong Government or an Executive is the more important aspect to elections, then the obvious thing for them to do is to adopt something on the lines of the American system where there are two elections, one for an Executive, the President, and one for a House of Representatives.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was Chairman of the Committee on the Constitution and it was open to him, if he felt strongly on this matter, and to other Fianna Fáil members of that Committee, to suggest a departure on these lines if they thought that was the proper thing to do.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> An all-Party Committee, yes, but only the Fianna Fáil people have adverted to the fact that the electorate had a function and they thought a very important function was to elect a strong Government, to elect a strong Executive, and representation and proportionality were, apparently, of less importance than the election of a strong Government.  If that was so, then the logical thing to do, I think was to plump for, or even to discuss, some system like the American system.  As far as I know, it was not discussed. Certainly, I looked over the report and did not see any advertence to that aspect of things but the Minister did mention it when he was speaking in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point to be made in favour of our present system is the old-fashioned point that we have had it for 50 odd years, that we are familiar with it, that we know how to operate it, that there has been no public outcry against it, that the people in general seem to like it.  The familiarity of the <Col N="1161" /> people with the system is proved by the fact that over many years now the number of spoiled votes is somewhere around one per cent.  If you take from that the number of votes spoiled merely because a presiding officer forgot to put a stamp on them, the figure will probably be lower.  I do not know what the percentage would be under the straight vote system in England or any other country, but I think that spoiled votes to the extent of one per cent is extremely satisfactory.  It shows that our people understand the system, are quite familiar with it, that they like it and know what they are doing. They make no mistakes.  I would not say that in the ultimate they know what they are doing because they have consistently elected Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> As regards utilising the system, they certainly know how to operate it.  I mentioned already that under the straight vote system or crooked vote system&mdash;whatever name you like to put on it&mdash;which the Government are now proposing, you will have a number of uncontested seats.  They may also be called safe seats.  I mentioned that there is a very high percentage of these uncontested seats in Northern Ireland. It is very undesirable that we should have any form of electoral system which discourages people from voting and which will ultimately culminate in a number of seats being uncontested. It is ultimately of lesser importance who wins the seat; what is important is that the seat should be contested. Democracy is beginning to fail and is not being properly utilised in any system where a high percentage of the seats ultimately are not contested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the system now proposed, I believe there will be a greater degree of central authority by the Party managers.  I suppose this is the age of the manager&mdash;we are in the managerial era&mdash;but surely we should not let it extend into politics?  Our methods of selecting candidates are the same in all <Col N="1162" /> three Parties.  We have a constituency convention, usually three or four names are put up and three or four candidates are selected.  These have to be ratified by Party headquarters. Occasionally somebody is not ratified, but that is the exception.  It would be very seldom&mdash;I do not think it ever happens&mdash;that a Party would be prepared to turn down the whole three or four candidates.  Under the single-seat system, the people will have a limited choice.  They will have to select one candidate and give the Party bosses, the managers behind the scenes, the faceless men&mdash;they are in the political machine as well as the Civil Service&mdash; an opportunity of exercising a power which I do not think should be given to them.</P>
    <P>Another undesirable feature which may arise and which has arisen&mdash;and even in this Island of Saints and Scholars, I would not say it would not arise here also&mdash;is the question of vote splitting.  The multiple-seat constituency does not lend itself to vote splitting, but the single-seat constituency does. If you have a strong Party, like Fianna Fáil at the moment, not sure of winning a seat in a single-seat constituency and they are dealing with an Opposition which, I regret to say, is divided&mdash;the Opposition consists of two Parties, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash;there is quite a temptation to put up a stooge to split the vote of the Opposition.  Therefore, in a constituency where they might not have a chance of winning on the first past the post principle and where there might be a Fine Gael or Labour man strong enough to threaten their security, it is possible to put up another candidate merely to split the vote.  The multiple system does not lend itself to that to the same degree.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did not do so well in the last local government elections. They are still smarting from the effects of that.  Under this system, they will rectify the position considerably. It is not necessary to have a referendum to alter the method of local government election.  Heretofore it has been on the proportional representation system.  That principle is in operation as regards local government elections because it is laid down by the Legislature; <Col N="1163" /> it is not incorporated in the Constitution.  I presume, today or tomorrow or the week after, the Government could introduce a Bill and abolish proportional representation in local government elections.  But it will be appreciated that it would be a very illogical thing, even for Fianna Fáil, to do.</P>
    <P>If they failed eight years ago to abolish proportional representation, it would certainly seem rather daft, and certainly an undemocratic procedure, to introduce legislation to have a multiple voting system here, to have our Dáil elected under proportional representation and our county councils elected under the straight vote system. But if this referendum is carried in favour of the Government, then they will come back to the House and by a simple Bill will say: &ldquo;The people have told us they want the straight vote system and the logical thing to do now is to introduce a similar system for local authority elections,&rdquo; and nobody could say anything to them.  They would have an expression of the public viewpoint behind them and that would be the logical follow-up.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the public have appreciated that this referendum carries in its tail a Bill, later to be produced in this House after the referendum, making local government elections straight vote elections also? I believe all the objections that apply to the straight vote system in respect of Dáil Éireann will apply in large measures here also.  I believe the results which the Government hope will accrue to them electorally by the abolition of proportional representation as far as the Dáil is concerned will equally accrue to them as regards local government elections.  I can see them establishing a first past the post voting technique whereby they will secure the reversal of the position which now obtains in many local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not improper for one to try to project what would be likely to happen as a result of the abolition of PR. No one has the gift of prophecy.  An attempt has been made to make a <Col N="1164" /> projection of the possible outcome of the single-seat, straight vote system. This work was carried out in the political science Department in Trinity College under Professor Chubb, I think.  It was discussed on RTE. It was based on the results of the last local government elections, the county council elections and corporation elections. It was felt that these areas, from the point of view of population and geography were the nearest that could be got to what the future single-seat constituencies would be, if we take it that a future single-seat constituency would be roughly an electoral area and a half.  The figures they came up with were as follows: Fianna Fáil would secure 93 seats, Fine Gael 34, Labour 8 and Others 9.  That makes a total of 144.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> A Party securing less than 40 per cent of the votes will end up with 100 seats. When I mentioned the question of uncontested seats, Deputy Andrews seemed to think this was impossible. I will put it to him this way: If at a general election a year and a half from now, the Government Party succeeded in getting 100 seats, there would be 100 constituencies in which there would be no Fine Gael or Labour representation.  These are small seats, as I say, about the size of an electoral area and a half&mdash;a county council electoral area&mdash;in built-up areas of the city, perhaps a little more than a square mile or 1½ square miles.  Put any Deputy into that position as the only Deputy there and give him a complete monopoly.  Would it be possible to displace him after five years?  In many cases it would be impossible to get a candidate for Labour or Fine Gael to stand there.  That is why I mentioned uncontested seats.  I believe the percentage of such seats that would arise under that system here would equal, if not exceed, that obtaining in Northern Ireland because of the fact that we are traditional voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been put up that a small swing under the straight vote system would give a disproportionate bonus of votes, or perhaps the reverse, but I think that argument falls down because first you must get <Col N="1168" /> the swing and we are, as I say, traditional voters.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Secondly, Fianna Fáil have over 70 seats and we have fewer than 50 and I do not think any form of swing can do anything but damage the smaller Party when the gap is so large.  If our representation approximated more to that of Fianna Fáil, there would probably be more accuracy in this mathematical argument about swings but with this large gap, I cannot see how the argument would apply.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Further, there is no predictability about the results under the straight vote system and the big swings, mentioned particularly by Fianna Fáil speakers when they want to sell us this idea, do not always come off; they sometimes go the other way.  I have listened to various arguments advanced here by different Fianna Fáil speakers in regard to PR and our electoral system in general.  The first argument advanced&mdash;I think the Minister for External Affairs, was very strong on this and being a senior Member, if not the most senior Member, of the House, one would expect him to be better versed in the history of the subject&mdash;was that we objected to PR because it was imposed on us by the British.  Anybody who has read even the little book <i>Report of the Committee on the Constitution</i> will realise that is not so, that PR has been the favoured method of election here for many years even before we got our own Government.  The Irish people in general, especially Sinn Féin and Arthur Griffith, were very much in favour of PR.  Too often we hear it argued that we must get rid of PR because it was imposed by the British and in the same breath, that we should introduce a system that is being used by the British at present.  I fail to see the logic of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that PR leads to <Col N="1169" /> instability or weak Governments.  I cannot recall any great degree of instability here.  I suppose Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour must be three Parties that are among the oldest in Europe.  Fianna Fáil must be one of the oldest Governments in Europe. In the past 36 years, they have been in power for 30 years and I cannot see how that represents any degree of instability. I do not attribute that stability to our electoral system entirely. I think it is partly due to the Irish character: we do not change easily.</P>
    <P>Another objection to PR is that it leads to the evolution of splinter Parties. Splinter Parties seem to be like a bad thought to Fianna Fáil.  Every time you speak of them to a Fianna Fáil supporter, you imagine he has a blister and that the splinter is hurting him.  There are no splinter Parties in the House at present and we still have PR.  They came and they went; I do not know that PR had much to do with their arrival or departure. They left; they joined other Parties or went for various reasons, but now when they are gone, to say that we must abolish PR to avoid their coming back seems rather illogical.  Until I heard of a liberal Party appearing in Wicklow, I was not aware of any other political Party coming up.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> They have been with us for a long time under various guises.  We have no splinter Parties now and to say that we must abolish PR in case any more splinter Parties descend upon us seems ridiculous.  It is quite undemocratic. If a new Party wants to evolve here, why not provide it with the constitutional methods of evolution?  What is wrong with that?  Is not this the safety valve we should provide?  Is it suggested that underground movements should start in the country? Is it not far better to let them see how far they can go, let them put up any ideas or policies they have and see if the people will support them which they may do for a while and then they may reject them.  I do not know if you could really say that Fianna Fáil themselves began as a splinter Party <Col N="1170" /> but it was a majority Party, much smaller than it is now.  They used PR and it helped them to get into power.  I do not see why they should deny the same right to any other Party that will evolve in the future.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> It displays a considerable degree of industry to collect all these puerile arguments in favour of the abolition of the present electoral system.  One of those arguments is that the system is complicated and confusing.  I do not know who complicates it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I do not think so.  When you consider that the percentage of spoiled votes is so extremely small in election after election, it is clear that the people do not find the system complicated or confusing. I would challenge any of the Deputies on the far side of the House to give any evidence as to how the people find it complicated and confusing. To stand up here and say that this system is complicated and confusing is merely confusing the issue.  Not a shred of evidence has been offered to show how the system is complicated and confusing to the electorate.  It may be complicated for the people who count it.  There is little more trouble in it than simple addition, which would be all the straight vote X would involve We are not operating an electoral system for the benefit of the county council officials who make these counts, who have no difficulty in carrying them out and who show great expertise in doing so.  All the results come through at reasonable speed and very seldom is there the confusion or complication which Deputies on the far side of the House like to pretend there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument offered against the present system&mdash;this is a nice argument and there is a little meat in it&mdash;is that Deputies are overworked. They would all like now to have nice, small, compact electoral areas which would cost them less money to contest and less money to visit and control afterwards, and involve much less work.  This is a very human consideration. It would be hypocritical of me to say that any person would not aspire to improve such conditions but we are not adapting our election system to suit Deputies, whether they be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  The <Col N="1173" /> primary purpose of an election system is to suit the electorate, and while I have every sympathy with Deputy O'Connor from Kerry who writes 500 letters a day or a week&mdash;I do not know which, but it is some astronomical figure&mdash;and every sympathy with the man on television who is writing 2,000 letters a week, still they came in here of their own volition, and if they are so terribly overworked, there is an obvious remedy open to them.  I do not see any of the Deputies taking that remedy.  The question of overwork is a factor, one of the operative factors. Another reason offered is competition, undesirable competition between Deputies.</P>

He spoke about Deputies running around the country pretending to be doing things for the people, things to which the people are entitled, and with a view to stopping all that, he wanted single seats.

It is particularly a problem when a Party become excessively strong as Fianna Fáil have, and the more Deputies they have, the bigger that problem becomes. It is absolutely essential for the peace of mind of the poor Taoiseach, because they are running in and out to him every day complaining about one another to get them separated.  A degree of cannibalism has set in to constituency rivalry and the only treatment for cannibalism is to get them separated.  The poor Taoiseach finds himself in this terrible dilemma that he must segregate the boys up and down the country.  If he could divide each county into nice little parishes where he could put all his bold boys, to stop them beating each other, he would be a much happier man. Individual Deputies would be happier too, because there is no constituency in which there is not another Deputy, or a Senator, or a Deputy aspirant breathing down the neck of the Deputy.

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Another argument advanced for abolishing the present system was the question of multiple representation.  Apparently Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and civil servants are being overworked and tormented by representations made not just by one Deputy but by three, four or five Deputies, depending on the numerical representation accorded to the particular constituency. That is offered as a reason for changing our electoral system.  Does that involve any particular extra work? Surely it is merely a matter of an extra carbon or two?  I presume that county councillors, urban councillors, town councillors and others write to Departments making inquiries and presumably they get replies.  I do not see any reason why they should not.  I presume any individual seeking a grant, or any old age pensioner anxious for information, can either write himself or get the local teacher or the local solicitor to do it for him; I hope these would get a reply in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> It seems a rather foolish argument to advance for abolishing proportional representation; by doing away with the multiple seat constituency, it is apparently thought that representation on a particular matter would be made by only one Deputy.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that such would be the evolution because my experience is that people have got into the habit of approaching every Deputy and, even if a constituency is broken up into three or four separate parts tomorrow morning, these people will still go to every Deputy, because they think that, if they get four Deputies to write in, they will get better representation than if they get only one.  I fail to see the validity of the argument.  Even if the present situation does make for extra work for civil servants, it must be remembered that they are servants, honoured servants, of the country and they are obliged to answer all correspondence from local representatives.  If the people like it that way, and if they want it that way, then that is the way it should be.  That position has obtained for a number of years and I see no reason now for going to the extreme of altering the electoral system on that weak premise.</P>
    <P>Another reason advanced has been the fate of Germany in the past and the fate of France.  Deputy Esmonde dealt with France.  I was rather amused by Deputy Booth, who dealt extensively with Germany.  I do not know how much he knows about European history.  I do not know how much he knows about Germany.  He was in excellent form; he seemed to be enjoying himself.  He was picking facts at random.  He attributed the last war and Hitlerism to the electoral system in Germany.  I lived in Germany in Hitler's time and I probably know as much about the situation there as Deputy Booth.  Irrespective of the electoral system, Hitlerism would have arrived because, as Hitler himself said so many times, it was a war of revenge and it stemmed from the Treaty he cried about so often and ultimately repudiated, terming it the <i>diktat</i> of Versailles.  Hitlerism had nothing whatsoever to do with the electoral system in Germany and I do not know by <Col N="1177" /> what system of logic Deputy Booth was able to deduce that the dictatorial system in Germany and the Second World War stemmed from proportional representation or some analogous system of voting.</P>
    <P>I was amused, too, by a reason offered by the Taoiseach.  I do not know whether the Deputies on the other side of the House were amused or not.  Perhaps they did not think it applied to them.  But the Taoiseach said that the abolition of proportional representation would lead to a better type of Deputy.  Mark you, Fianna Fáil speakers in the debate all seemed to accept that.  I presume they took it for granted that the Taoiseach was speaking about those of us on this side of the House.  Certainly they seemed to accept that the reason offered by the Taoiseach did not apply to them.  I do not know how they can feel they are excused.  I suppose each Deputy thinks his own house is in perfect order and it was to the other fellow the Taoiseach was referring.</P>
    <P>This system will give us better Deputies.  It will not do anything of the sort.  It will give us a bunch of &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; because, whatever flexibility exists now in the selection of Deputies, the matter is still in the hands of local constituents, but, under the single seat system, Deputies will be picked by headquarters.  Indeed, I believe that is one of the attractions the system presents to a Party tending more and more towards centralisation.</P>
    <P>I have picked out as many of the reasons advanced for the abolition of proportional representation as I could find in the Official Report.  I do not think I have omitted any.  If I have, I crave the indulgence of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have done their homework for them.  I have assembled all the arguments marshalled by the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Deputies who followed him.  When all is said and done, there is really no argument of any validity to justify the abolition of proportional representation, as the House must appreciate, having listened to me so carefully for the last hour.</P>
    <P>What is the real purpose behind the proposed abolition of proportional <Col N="1178" /> representation?  It is not for the various reasons put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am satisfied that all the arguments advanced are merely so many smokescreens to hide the real purpose, the real purpose which is not being admitted.  The real purpose is, first and foremost, to wipe out the Labour Party, and to maul Fine Gael, to produce in this House a very attenuated Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce adverted to the fact that it was most important to have a good Opposition and that the real purpose of abolishing the present electoral system was to give the Opposition an opportunity to produce a first-class Opposition. It is rather naive that he has suddenly become so fond of Fine Gael and that Fianna Fáil have suddenly fallen so much in love with us that they are now prepared to spend £100,000 of the people's money to alter the electoral system so as to build up an Opposition that would be a formidable Opposition and an alternative Government.  If I really thought that Fianna Fáil meant that, I would say that they are a magnanimous Party, but I candidly do not believe it. The very fact that they are concentrating on securing for themselves&mdash; and they would be the greatest beneficiaries&mdash;single seats, comfortable and easily administered is the kernel of the thing.</P>
    <P>If, at the same time, they can get a disproportionate representation here and can secure for themselves 100 seats and can reduce considerably the Opposition, they will have put themselves in a very happy position for the future. If at the same time, they can cut down work and eliminate competition, particularly for the members of their own Party, but also for the members of the Opposition, they will be in an extremely happy position.  I do not blame them for trying to secure that position. It is quite understandable.  Possibly any other political Party might try to do the same thing.  However, the question arises will the Irish people be so concerned for the comfort of the individual Fianna Fáil Deputies, for their security and for their welfare, that they <Col N="1179" /> will be prepared to give up the protections enshrined in proportional representation in order to make the various Fianna Fáil Deputies more secure and more happy.  I hope they will not; I do not believe they will.</P>
    <P>I think that as far as this referendum goes, the Government Party will be beaten.  I recognise that in the last referendum eight and a half years ago the margin was very small&mdash;33,000 votes&mdash;which I think is two per cent or three per cent of the electorate; but I feel that on this occasion the margin by which the Government Party will be beaten will be larger.  I do not pretend to think that it will be an easy contest.</P>
    <P>I have read criticism in the newspapers by the political commentators that Deputies have shied away from discussing their own electoral areas in reference to this matter.  I do not propose to shy away from discussing my own electoral area.  When I first entered the House we had in South Tipperary, and it was then one unit corresponding to the South Riding County Council area; three Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Fine Gael Deputy.  In 1961 the constituency was altered and West Waterford was brought into the South Tipperary area.  This followed the High Court action initiated by Professor O'Donovan at the time.  South Tipperary had four seats and Waterford had four seats.  As a result of this High Court action, neither constituency was able to qualify for four seats in the future.  Consequently, it meant that they had to be reduced to three-seat constituencies, or else something had to be added to one or the other.  In the event, a portion of West Waterford was added on to South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>At that time there was a Fianna Fáil Deputy in Clonmel and it seemed that this addition of West Waterford would secure his election, but that did not happen, and a Labour Deputy, Deputy Treacy, was elected instead of him.  This left the position one Fine Gael Deputy, two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Labour Deputy, and in Waterford the position was one Fine Gael Deputy, one Fianna Fáil Deputy <Col N="1180" /> and one Labour Deputy so that the position was three Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> That is easy at the moment.  The position, if the constituents remain as they are will probably be three Fianna Fáil, two Fine Gael and two Labour. Under the new tolerance voting, that is, less than 20,000 per Deputy, South Tipperary would again qualify for four Deputies and Waterford would qualify for four Deputies, and if Tipperary were divided into four parts and Waterford were divided into four parts and the division were done by Fianna Fáil, my viewpoint is that Fianna Fáil would get the eight seats. This would derive from the simple abolition of multiple seats and the abolition of PR.  I feel quite convinced that in South Tipperary without any difficulty Fianna Fáil would so manipulate things that they could divide the constituency into four parts under the new tolerance system and they would get the four seats.</P>
      <P>There you would have the position of seven seats between Waterford and Tipperary before the referendum with three Fianna Fáil, two Fine Gael and two Labour Deputies, culminating in seven seats being replaced by eight and the eight being eight Fianna Fáil seats. I do not know how things would evolve in other areas.  One would need to be living in an area to know.</P>
