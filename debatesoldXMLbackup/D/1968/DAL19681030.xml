      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the total tonnage and value of raw and refined sugar imported into this country from January to October, 1968; and the justification for this importation, in view of the statement of one of the chiefs of the Sugar Company that too much sugar was being produced in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of raw sugar this year up to the end of August, the latest month for which official figures are available, amounted to 41,621 tons, valued at £866,035.  Imports of refined sugar in the same period were 222 tons valued at £9,562.</P>
      <P>I understand from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann that the imports of raw sugar are required to enable sugar to be supplied at an economic price for the export trade in sugar-containing goods. The imports of refined sugar consisted mainly of special types of sugar for which there is only a very limited demand in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question at issue is not whether I agree or disagree. This is something the Sugar Company and the beet growers arranged to operate between them.  From the information I have available, the Sugar Company, from the imports and dealings in sugar&mdash;that is imported and <Col N="1590" /> raw sugar&mdash;make, and I imagine will continue to make, a profit on these transactions.  I have no doubt that this is to the benefit of the overall financial structure of the Sugar Company, not only in regard to its sugar-making enterprises but also in regard to its vegetable processing in Erin Foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this allegation of too much sugar has been used by the Sugar Company to deprive the beet growers of 11/- a ton to which they are entitled and which amounts to £580,000 from the beet growers' proceeds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from the operations of the Sugar Company and from the growers' representatives over the years that this matter of price has been arranged between them in practically all cases and in an amicable and satisfactory manner.  I hope that this system of reasonable arrangements in regard to pricing for the farmers' produce will continue to operate in the future as it did in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from Bord Iascaigh Mhara is that in the past three years seven transfers took place. There were three cases in the past 12 months, two in the previous year and two in the year before that, and the method of compensation which I have outlined in my reply was applied in all these seven cases.  No claim was made for additional compensation nor is there any claim for such under consideration.</P>

      <P>This man was transferred from Dingle to Dublin and had started to build a house because he was going to get married.  He was transferred in order to provide a job for the secretary of a Fianna Fáil Cumann in Turner's Cross in the Taoiseach's constituency, and for no other reason.

That has been the practice for a long time and was considered reasonable.  This question relates to post-primary pupils.  If it was reasonable for children above 10 years of age, attending primary schools, then it should be reasonable for pupils attending post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>My information is that a number of parents would be prepared to avail of the free transport service into Avoca but for certain pressure brought to bear on them by other parents who take a very strong view in these circumstances.  The Deputy will be familiar with the fact that these arrangements have been made in the interests of the children.  In the past 20 years, there have been eight qualified principal teachers in this school and there have been a number of unqualified teachers in the school for prolonged periods.  Because of this and of a similar situation arising again, the Department decided that the thing to do in the interests of the children attending the school was to amalgamate.  I understand the position has been explained fully to the parents.  It is true that many of them do not accept the Department's view on this but experience shows, I think, in similar instances in different parts of the country that some of those who have been most vociferous in their opposition are those who have appreciated most the benefits of the amalgamation scheme afterwards.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there are about 60 pupils concerned in this instance who are not now being educated at all as <Col N="1602" /> far as school-going education is concerned because of the Department's decision to close down this school? Furthermore, is the condition of this school first-class as far as repair, and so on, are concerned?  Is it in first-class condition and is it a fact that the parents in the area were eminently satisfied with the teaching given in the school before it was closed down?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that while the condition of the schoolroom is important the quality of the education being imparted in the school is very important.  I have indicated to the House the frequent change of principal teacher there and the prolonged period when unqualified persons were teaching there.  That cannot have been in the best interests of the children attending the school.</P>

      <P>The difficulties that arise from this come to light only when the children have left school and are seeking employment.

The school in Avoca to which it is proposed to bring them now has five teachers and will soon be a six-teacher school where they will get a much wider curriculum and better educational facilities.</P>

    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>Tá orm an meamram leis seo a chur chugat maidir le deontais i leith leabhair agus gabhálais in aisce a íoc le daltaí atá ina gcall san scoilbhliain 1968/69.  Tá cuóta sealadach de £ á cheadú dod scoil chun críche na scéime sa scoilbhliain sin agus íocfar an tsuim sin leat go luath.</P>
    <P>Cuirim chugat leis seo freisin Foirmeacha LS/1 agus LS/3.  Iarrtar ort an fhaisnéis a lorgaítear ar an bhFoirm LS/3 a chur isteach comh luath agus is féidir é ach gan é bheith níos déanaí ná an 13 Meán Fómhair, 1968.  Ba chóir an Fhoirm LS/1, agus í cómhlánaithe go cuí, a chur isteach comh luath agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>Is mian leis an Aire a bhuíochas a ghabháil le hArdmháistrí scoile as ucht a gcomhoibriú i bhfeidhmiú na scéime sa scoilbhliain seo caite agus iarrann sé orthu cabhrú leis arís sa ghnó seo sa scoilbhliain seo.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Free Books and Accessories, 1968/69</P>
    <P>I am to forward the attached memorandum concerning the payment of grants towards free books and accessories for necessitous pupils in the school year 1968/69.  The sum of £ is being allocated to your school as the provisional quota for the purposes of the scheme in that school year.  This sum will be paid to you in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am also to enclose Forms LS/1 and LS/3.  You are requested to be so good as to forward the information sought in Form LS/3 as soon as possible but not later than the 13th September, 1968.  The Form LS/1, properly completed, should be forwarded as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to thank Headmasters for their co-operation in operating the scheme in the past year and requests their assistance again in the matter for the present school year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Mise, le meas,</P>

    <P Just="Right">Leas-Rúnaí.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Leabhair agus Gabhálais in Aisce, 1968/69</P>
    <P>Féadfar deontais i leith leabhair agus gabhálais in aisce d'íoc sa scoilbhlian 1968/69 de réir téarmaí an mheamraim seo ar son daltaí meánscoile atá ina gcall.</P>
    <P>1.  Baineann an scéim le daltaí bochta atá ag fáil saor-oideachais faoi théarmaí imlitreach M.15/67.  Ní áirítear sa scéim daltaí atá ag íoc táillí leis an scoil ach amhái in gur féidir le daltaí bochta lae, a sealbhaíonn scoláireachtaí, cúnamh a fháil maran leor méid bhliantúil na scoláireachta chun na táillí agus costais leabhar a ghlanadh.</P>
    <P>Nuair aistríonn dalta ó scoil iar-bhunoideachais go dtí scoil eile tar éis tosach na scoilbhliana ní chóir cúnamh faoin scéim a thabairt dó san dara scoil mura bhfuil an tArdmháistir sásta ná fuair sé leabhair saor in aisce cheana nó gur thug sé ar ais leabhair a fuair sé sa scoilbhliain seo.</P>
    <P>2.  Chun críche na scéime seo is féidir a mheas mar dhalta bocht, dalta a bhfuil anró fíor sa bhaile de bharr dífhostaíocht, tréimhse fhada breoiteachta tuismitheora, muirín mór le teacht isteach uireasach, máthair ina baintreach 7rl.</P>
    <P>3.  D'fhéadfadh méid an deontais i leith gach dalta ar leith bheith ag brath ar an gcúrsa atá á leanacht aige ach ar meán is féidir é a áireamh de réir £8 don chéad bhliain de chúrsa na Meánteistiméireachta agus de réir £4 in aghaidh gach bliana eile den chúrsa sin; de réir £10 don chéad bhliain de chúrsa na hÁrdteistiméireachta agus de réir £5 d'aon bhliain iar sin. Bheadh costas cóip-leabhair agus gabhálais eile san áireamh ins na figiúirí sin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir costas iomlán, nó cuid de costas leabhair agus gabhálais a íoc i leith dalta.  Lomháltar leabhair a cheannach ar athlámh ach an tArdmháistir bheith sásta, trí'n a mbreithniú, gur fiú costas iad.  Áirítear leabhair Teagasc Críostaí faoin scéim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" />
      <Col N="1610" /> Beidh na leabhair agus na gabhálais a soláthrófar trí deontais a thabhairt do dhaltaí ar leith ag dul do na daltaí féin.</P>
    <P>4.  Más mian le hArdmháistir scéim iasachta a fheidhmiú ní miste dó déanamh amhlaidh ar an dtuiscint go bhfanfaidh na leabhair a soláthrófar amhlaidh i seilbh na scoile.</P>
    <P>5.  Tá soláthar sealadach airgid chun críche na scéime á íoc le gach scoil.  Ní cheadmhach iomlán an chuóta shealadaigh sin a chaitheamh muran gá sin chun freastal don líon daltaí bochta sa scoil.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir aon lacáiste a lomhálfaidh díoltóirí leabhair a úsáid chun críche na scé ime.</P>
    <P>Má tharlaíonn nach bhfuil an t-iomlán den chuóta sealadach ag teastáil chun críche na scéime sa scoilbhliain 1968/69 ní mór an méid ná fuil ag teastáil a chur ar ais chun na Roinne chomh luath agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>6.  Ba chóir meastachán d'iomlán na n-éileamhar cúnamh i ngach scoil sa scoilbhliain 1968/69 a chur chun na Roinne chomh luath agus is féidir é ach gan é bheith níos déanaí ná an 13 Meán Fómhair, 1968.  Tá foirm (LS/3) leis seo chuige sin.  Tá an t-eolas sin ag teastáil i dtreo is go bhféadfaidh an Roinn an cuóta críochnaitheach do gach scoil a chinntiú go luath agus, ar an ábhar sin, iarrtar ar Ardmháistrí comh-oibriú trí na meastacháin a chur isteach in am.</P>
    <P>7.  Ní bheidh an Roinn sásta caiteachas de bhreis ar na cuótaí sealadacha d'aisíoc le hArdmháistrí mura mbíonn cead na Roinne don bhreis faighte roimh ré.  Déanfar iarratais ar méadaithe sna cuótaí sealadacha a scrúdú sa Roinn i láthair an eolais a soláthrófar sna meastacháin atá luaite in alt a 6 den mheamram seo.  Ní mór ráiteas a chur isteach i dteannta gach iarratais ag míniú na dtoscaí is bun leis an iarratas.</P>
    <P>Sa chás go meastar go bhfuil níos mó ná 25% de na daltaí lae i scoil i dteideal cúnamh faoin scéim a fháil moltar go láidir go dtosófaí scéim iasachta sa scoil in áit deontais a thabhairt do dhaltaí aonaracha.  Ní fhéadfar dóthain airgid a chur ar fáil chun deontais aonaracha d'íoc le níos mó ná 25% de na daltaí lae i scoileanna i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>8.  Ní gá a thuille ainmneacha na ndaltaí atá ag fáil cabhrach faoin scéim a chur ar fáil don Roinn ach caithfear an fhoirm LS/1 a ghabhann leis seo, agus í chomhlánaithe go cuí, a sholáthar i leith an chaiteachais go léir faoi théarmaí na scéime.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Free Books and Accessories, 1968/69</P>
    <P>Grants towards free books and accessories may be paid in respect of necessitous pupils in secondary schools in the school year 1968/69 in accordance with the terms of this memorandum.</P>
    <P>1.  The scheme applies to necessitous pupils who are receiving free education under the terms of circular M.15/67.  Fee-paying pupils are not included except that necessitous day pupils who hold scholarships may be given assistance to the extent that the annual amount of the scholarship falls short of the combined cost of the fees and books.</P>
    <P>Where a pupil transfers from one post-primary school to another after commencement of the school year he should not be given assistance under the scheme in the second school unless the Headmaster is satisfied that he has not already been given free books or has returned any free books already supplied to him in this school year.</P>
    <P>2.  For the purposes of the scheme a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, mother a widow, etc.</P>
    <P>3.  The grant in respect of each individual pupil may vary in accordance with the course followed by him but on average it may be reckoned at £8 for the first year of the Intermediate Certificate course and £4 for each of the subsequent years of that course, at £10 for the first year of the Leaving Certificate course and £5 for any subsequent year.  These figures would include the cost of copy books and other accessories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" />
      <Col N="1612" /> The full cost or part of the cost of books and accessories for a pupil may be paid.  The purchase of second-hand books is allowed provided such books are examined by the Headmaster with a view to ascertaining that they represent good value.  Books in Christian Doctrine are included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Books and accessories supplied by means of a grant to individual pupils become the property of the pupils.</P>
    <P>4.  Should a Headmaster prefer to operate a loan scheme, he may do so on the understanding that books provided in this manner shall remain the property of the school.</P>
    <P>5.  A provisional allocation of money for the purposes of the scheme is being paid to each school.  The expenditure of the full amount of this provisional quota is not permitted unless the number of necessitous pupils warrants it.</P>
    <P>Discounts received from booksellers should be used for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>If any amount of the provisional allocation is not required for the purposes of the scheme for the school year 1968/69 the amount not required must be returned to the Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>6.  An estimate of the full extent of the need for assistance in each school in the school year 1968/69 should be forwarded to the Department as soon as possible but not later than the 13th September, 1968.  A form (LS/3) is enclosed for the purpose.  This information is required in order that the final allocation for each school may be decided at an early date and, accordingly, all Headmasters are requested to be so good as to co-operate by furnishing the estimates in time.</P>
    <P>7.  The Department will not be prepared to reimburse Headmasters for expenditure in excess of the provisional allocations unless the prior approval of the Department for the excess has been given.  Applications for increases in the provisional allocations will be examined by the Department in the light of the information supplied in the returns referred to in paragraph 6 of this memorandum.  Each application should be accompanied by a statement of the circumstances giving rise to it.</P>
    <P>Where the number of pupils considered in need of assistance under the scheme exceeds 25% of the number of day pupils in a school it is urged that a loan scheme, rather than a scheme of grants to individual pupils, be introduced.  It will not be possible to make sufficient money available to enable direct grants to be given to more than 25% of the day pupils in schools generally.</P>
    <P>8.  It is no longer necessary to furnish to the Department the names of the pupils benefiting under the scheme but the enclosed Form LS/1 properly completed, must be furnished in respect of all money expended for the purposes of the scheme.</P>

Is mian leis an Aire Oideachais a chur in iúl do Bhainisteoirí agus do Phríomhoidí go bhfuil socair aige scéim leasaithe a thabhairt isteach chun leabhair scoile saor in aisce a sholáthar do dhaltaí gátaracha atá ar na rollaí i Ranganna II go VI i scoileanna náisiúnta.

    <P Just="Center">NOTICE TO MANAGERS AND PRINCIPAL TEACHERS OF NATIONAL SCHOOLS SCHEME FOR THE PROVISION OF FREE BOOKS FOR NECESSITOUS PUPILS</P>
    <P>1.  The Minister for Education wishes to inform Managers and Principal Teachers that he has decided to introduce a revised scheme for the provision of free books for necessitous pupils on rolls in 2nd to 6th standards in National Schools.  The grant will be at the rate of £1 per year for each necessitous pupil in these standards and will be calculated as shown in paragraph 4.</P>
    <P>2.  For the purposes of the scheme a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, mother a widow, etc.</P>
    <P>3.  Managers and Principal Teachers were asked in October, 1967, to furnish statistics, on a form specially prepared for the purpose, of the percentage of necessitous pupils on the roll in 2nd to 6th standards in each school.  The information asked for has not yet been supplied in respect of many schools.  <i>No grant can be paid until the form duly completed has been returned to the Department.</i></P>
    <P>4.  The amount of the grant payable in each of the next five years will be based on the application of the percentage of necessitous pupils as shown on the form referred to in paragraph 3 to the average number of pupils on rolls in 2nd to 6th standards for the previous school year, e.g.</P>
    <P>Percentage of necessitous pupils=20%</P>
    <P>Average number of pupils in 2nd to 6th standards for year ended 39th June=80</P>
    <P>Amount of grant=20% of 80 X £1=£16.</P>
    <P>The figures already furnished on the form which issued in October, 1967, will suffice to make this year's payment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" />
      <Col N="1622" /> 5.  The grant will be paid to the Principal Teacher in the June Quarter each year.  Formal application for the grant will not be necessary.  The Principal Teacher will ensure the proper disbursement of the grant and will account for the expenditure on all books purchased by him for the pupils.  For this purpose a simple accounting form has been devised for completion and retention in the school records.  A five year supply of the form is being sent to each school.</P>
    <P>Discounts received from booksellers should be used for the purposes of the scheme.  The accounting form when completed should be countersinged by the school manager and should be available for inspection by the Department's officers.</P>
    <P>6.  Books supplied under the scheme shall be the property of the pupils.  The pupils should be instructed to care for the books and have them covered.</P>

    <P Just="Center">LEABHAIR AGUS GABHÁLAIS IN AISCE&mdash;AN SCOILBHLIAIN 1968/69</P>
    <P>(1)  Tá iarrtha orm ag an Aire Oideachais a chur in iúl duit gur féidir deontais i leith leabhair agus gabhálais in aisce d'íoc de réir téarmaí na litreach seo le daltaí gairm scoile atá ina gcall agus atá ag freastal cúrsaí lae lánaimsire a thagann faoi scéim saoroideachais iarbunscoile.</P>
    <P>(2)  Chun críche na scéime seo is féidir a mheas mar dhalta atá ina gcall, dalta a bhfuil anró fíor sa bhaile de bharr dífhostaíocht, tréimhse fhada breoiteachta tuismitheora, muirín mór le teacht isteach uireasach, máthair ina baintreach 7rl.</P>
    <P>(3)  D'fhéadfadh méid an deontais i leith gach dalta ar leith bheith ag brath ar an gcúrsa atá dhá leanacht aige ach ar meán is féidir é a áireamh de réir £8 don chéad bhliain de chúad bhliain de chúrsa na Meánteistiméireachta agus de réir £4 in aghaidh gach bliana eile den chúrsa sin de réir £10 don chéad bhliain de chúrsa na hÁrdteistiméireachta agus de réir £5 d'aon bhliain iar sin.  Bheadh costas cóip-leabhair agus gabhálais eile san áireamh ins na figiúrí sin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir costas iomlán, nó cuid de costas leabhair agus gábhálais a íoc i leith dalta.  Lomháltar leabhair a cheannacht ar athlámh ach an tArdmháistir bheith sásta, trí'n a mbreithniú, gur fiú a costas iad.  Áiritear leabhair Teagasc Críostaí faoin scéim.  Beidh na leabhair agus na gabhálais a soláthrófar faoin scéim ag dul do na daltaí féin.</P>
    <P>(4)  Más mian le haon choiste scéim iasachta fheidhmiú, ní miste dóibh déanamh amhlaidh ar an dtuiscint go bhfanfaidh na leabhair a soláthrófar amhlaidh i seilbh an choiste.</P>
    <P>(5)  Tá suim <i>nach mó ná £</i> á dháileadh ar do choiste chun an scéim a fheidhmiú i 1968/69 ach ní ceadaítear dul faoi chaiteachas den méid sin maran gá sin chun freastal don líon daltaí atá i gcall sna scoileanna.  Meastar gur dothain an tsuim atá dáilithe ar do choiste ach más dóigh leo go bhfuil cúrsaí eisceachtúla ann a thuillfeadh soláthar níos airde, bá ch óirlánfhaisnéis faoi na cúrsaí san a chur chun na Roinne le breithniú; go dtí go dtugann an Roinn breith, ní ceadmhach an soláthar atá ceadaithe a shárú.</P>
    <P>Ní mór an locáiste a gheibhtear ó dhíoltóirí leabhar a úsáid chun críche na sc éime.</P>
    <P>(6)  Beartaítear an modh oibre a bhí i bhfeidhm i 1967/68 a fheidhmiú arís i 1968/69, i.e., a cheadú don choiste méid an deontais a dháileadh ar na scoileanna ar leith de réir a mbreith ar riachtanais gach scoile agus méideanna na ndeontas a íocfar le daltaí ar leith nó ceist na leabhar a thabharfar ar iasacht, de réir mar is cuí, a fhágaint, cuid mhór, ar chómhairle na nArdmháistrí.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" />
      <Col N="1624" /> (7)  Ba chóir eolas beacht a fháil óna hArdmháistrí faoi na micléinn go dtugtar leabhair dóibh saor in aisce nó ar iasacht agus ba chóir an t-eolas seo a chimeád in oifig an choiste le bheith iniúctha ag an iniúchóir.</P>
    <P>(8)  Ba chóir an fhoirm éilimh leis seo ar aisíoc le ciste do choiste a chomhlánú agus é chasadh ar an Roinn ar an 15 Samhain, 1968, ar a dhéannaí.  Ní ceadaítear do na coistí airgead a chimeád le dáileadh i ndiaidh an dáta sin.</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister for Education desires me to inform you that grants towards free books and accessories may be paid in accordance with the terms of this letter in respect of necessitous vocational school pupils attending whole-time day courses which come under the scheme of free post-primary education.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the scheme a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, mother a widow, etc.</P>
    <P>(3)  The grant in respect of each individual pupil may vary in accordance with the course followed by him but on average it may be reckoned at £8 for the first year of the Intermediate Certificate course and £4 for <i>each</i> of the subsequent years of that course, at £10 for the first year of the Leaving Certificate course and £5 for any subsequent year.  These figures would include the cost of copy books and other accessories.</P>
    <P>The full cost or part of the cost of books and accessories for a pupil may be paid.  The purchase of second-hand books is allowed provided such books are examined by the Headmaster with a view of ascertaining that they represent good value.  Books in Christian Doctrine are included in the scheme.  The books and accessories so supplied become the property of the pupils.</P>
    <P>(4)  Should any committee prefer to operate a loan scheme, they may do so on the understanding that books provided in this manner shall remain the property of the committee.</P>
    <P>(5)  Your committee is being allocated a sum <i>not exceeding</i> £ to operate the scheme in 1968/69 but expenditure of that amount is not permitted unless the number of necessitous pupils warrants it.  It is not anticipated that the sum allocated will be inadequate but if there appear to be exceptional circumstances which, in the opinion of your committee, would warrant a higher allocation, a full statement of such circumstances should be submitted to the Department for consideration; pending the Department's decision, the approved allocation may not be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Discounts received from booksellers should be used for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>(6)  As was the case in the school-year 1967/68, it is proposed to allow your committee to allocate the amount of the grant among their various schools according to their judgement of the needs of each school and to allow headmasters a wide measure of discretion in the amount of grant which may be paid to individual pupils or in the matter of books to be loaned, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(7)  Precise information concerning the students to whom books are given or loaned should be obtained from headmasters and this information should be kept in the committee's office for inspection by the auditor.</P>
    <P>(8)  The attached claim-form for reimbursement of the committee's funds should be completed and returned to the Department not later than 15th November, 1968.  It is not open to committees to retain money for disbursement after that date.</P>

Is he aware that though we in the Limerick Health Authority specified that the holder of a medical card would qualify for free books, a circular has been sent by the Department of Education to the secretary of the health authority stating that this could no longer apply, that this was a manager's function&mdash;that all applicants for free books would be controlled by the decision of the headmaster of the particular school to which I am referring?  In a school where there are 670 primary pupils, I should like to know how a headmaster could be expected to investigate the circumstances of each individual family.  Will the Minister also tell me why, when a sum of £600 was requested in respect of a school of 670 primary pupils, the amount <Col N="1627" /> allocated was £150 for 15 classes with an average of 45 children each?  That meant that the headmaster or the manager could allocate only £10 to each class of 45 pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Incremental salary is payable quarterly to registered secondary teachers but monthly advances are payable at the option of the <Col N="1628" /> teacher.  In fact, the majority of teachers are paid monthly advances. Similar provisions apply to the payment of the relevant allowance to teachers engaged in serving the year of teaching experience necessary for registration except that it is not possible to pay an advance in the first quarter of the school year, because of the necessity, before any payment may be made, of verifying that the conditions governing payment have been satisfied in each case.  These conditions include prescribed academic qualifications and teaching hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely in respect of the first quarter that I am concerned. It involves young teachers starting off.  They come up from the country, they have to get digs and that can amount to considerable hardship. They are three months in digs in Dublin before they get any money from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This can only apply in the first quarter of probationer teachers.  There are about 700 of these and it is necessary for the Department to verify, in the case of each of the 700, that they have the necessary educational qualifications&mdash;the higher diploma in education and the required number of teaching hours.  This means consultation with the schools to verify the timetables in the case of each of the 700.  It is not possible to do this in a time shorter than the first quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to accept this&mdash;to think it should take three months when a teacher is being employed for the first time.  Surely the schools concerned have to require certain qualifications before they take on the teacher in the first instance.  It should be accepted by the Department that only qualified teachers are employed in secondary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The claimant in this case is a married woman and in order to qualify for benefit she required to have 26 contributions paid on her behalf in respect of employment subsequent to her marriage.  When she made a claim for unemployment benefit in May, 1968, the records of the Department showed that she had only 25 contributions.  She had, however, furnished an insurance card in August, 1967, with two further contributions in connection with a claim to maternity benefit.  Inquiries were necessary as to whether these contributions could be accepted as having been validly paid. On completion of the necessary investigations they were in fact so accepted and her maternity benefit was paid. Due to a regrettable oversight the two contributions in question were not placed to her credit and were consequently not on record when she later made her unemployment benefit claim. The record was not finally corrected until 16th September, 1968, and as she had continued to furnish evidence of unemployment in the meantime her claim was authorised on that date and payment of all benefit due to her was made on 20th September, 1968.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1965 the cost of the work to be carried out was in the region of £45,000 and that then the company, Rossmore Collieries asked for a technical assistance grant.  Again in 1966 the company, in view of the Departmental attitude, prepared a new scheme at a cost of £30,000 and there was the eventual offer from an Foras Tionscal and again there was considerable delay.  I want to ask the Minister is he aware that, due to the delay in his Department in the paying of these grants, there is unemployment at the moment in the mine?  There has been a strike in the Rossmore Collieries and, due to the fact that the money has not been available yet and no guarantee given, the company is not in a position at the moment to pay increased wages?  Would he at this late hour consider the matter and give an undertaking that this money will be made available to the company?  Considering that there have been thousands of pounds&mdash;something in the region of £20,000&mdash;already put into new development by the present director, Mrs. Fay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There can be no question of a grant being paid in order to pay wages or increase wages.  I do not accept that there has been delay in my Department or in An Foras Tionscal which has contributed to the difficulties which have arisen.  The situation is complicated.  I am not saying that the delay is solely due to the proprietor but the actions which have been taken by the proprietor have not <Col N="1637" /> helped to expedite the payment of money.

      <P>Surely the Minister appreciates that the reason for the application for this money is not to pay increased wages, but that the company has already spent the money for the purposes for which the application is made from their own funds?  If my information is correct, a prepared agreement was completed on the 19th September, and the Minister's Department was so informed.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not at all encouraged, Sir, by the repeated assurances of the Minister for Justice that legislation is to be introduced to provide more adequate maintenance for deserted wives and children.  We have had promises of such legislation for at least the last seven years and it always intrigues me to see repeated statements by Government Ministers treated as though they were startling fresh news.  I noticed today that some of the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate once again headlined as something to look forward to promises which have been made by the members of the Government over the last ten years, promises of legislation to do something about the neglected wives and children, promises of legislation to do something about malicious injury compensation, promises of legislation to do something about the injustices of our existing landlord and tenant statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person who has any casual acquaintance with the law must be sick and tired of the inordinate delays on the part of the Government in introducing legislation of real reform as distinct from introducing legislation to meddle with matters which are satisfactory enough.  What is needed in relation to the deserted wives and children is an immediate piece of legislation which would remove any ceiling on the amount of compensation to be paid to deserted wives and children. What is needed is legislation which would entitle the court to take into cognisance the income, the earnings and the property of the husband who neglected the wife and children.  It is inexcusable that at the present time a deserted wife has to be limited in compensation to the sum of £2 10s and that wives and children are expected to survive on paltry awards from the court of £4 or thereabouts.  It is not good enough to promise for the fifth time legislation to deal with this shocking injustice.  One must deal with that <Col N="1643" /> as a separate item and take the lid off the awards which can now be made to wives and neglected children and anything I may now say should not be used as an excuse for postponing that very necessary reform.</P>
    <P>It does happen that distressed and deserted wives hesitate about going into court to get awards of the kind I have been talking about.  I do not think it matters so much in urban areas where issues of this kind are conducted every day in court without any particular notice being paid to them but in rural areas where every event in court is a matter of public property it causes not a little embarrassment and difficulty to have these matters conducted in open court.  I naturally hesitate to recommend anything which would encourage the administration of justice other than in open court but I think it is very proper that the sensitivities of wives and families should be considered and I would hope that some system would be introduced which would avoid the necessity of dragging the sorrowing wives and their children through the open court.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are fortunate in having a police force which is second to none in the world.  We have a police force which is respected and, indeed, loved by the vast majority of our people.  They are respected by our people and not feared and, mind you, that is a valuable thing to have in this modern world in which so many States have police forces which are feared, hated and detested by large sections of the people.</P>
    <P>If the Garda Síochána are respected and admired by our people it is because since their foundation they have been beholden to no political group. They have discharged their duties as the guardians of our society without fear or favour.  In recent times, however, we have seen a growing tendency on the part of the Fianna Fáil administration to use this Force as their political tool.  We have had several cases in which, by direction of the Government the Garda Síochána have been obliged to enter into political disputes, terrifying those involved with <Col N="1644" /> the full majesty and rigour of the law. We have seen cases in which members of the Garda Síochána under direction from the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General, have been obliged to go into court demanding in the name of the Government the most vicious penalties for what were, in fact, no more than political offences, the offence, if such it may be called, of demonstrating about something which the people concerned believe to be wrong, to be unfair.  Those who might query whether it is fair to regard such behaviour as evidence of attempts on the part of the Government to make tools of the Garda Síochána I would answer that it is not without significance that when it suited the political needs of the Government to use the Garda as political tools to demonstrate the wrath and power of the Government they did it.  As soon as it suited the Government's political purpose to change the tool entirely those against whom the full vengeance of the Government had been voiced through the Garda Síochána were relieved of the penalties which the Government had imposed on them, using the disciplined force of the Garda Síochána for their ulterior purposes.</P>
    <P>This is wrong and unfair.  It does a disservice to the servants of the people, the Garda Síochána, and it has tended to bring this force of splendid impartial public servants under a certain amount of condemnation which they certainly do not deserve.  It is time for us to say: &ldquo;Hands off the Garda Síochána and stop using them as political tools.&rdquo;  I think the vote of the people as expressed on 16th October was a vote not only in relation to the Constitutional issues which were put before them but was also a vote for fair play. The Irish people have a great sense of fair play and a nose to smell out any tendencies which are unfair.  It is because the Irish people realise that the present Government is so unscrupulous as to use and abuse the Garda Síochána and use and abuse other powers available to them that the people emphatically rejected the proposals of the Government.  It was not only because of a lack of merit in the <Col N="1645" /> proposals but also because of what the people have seen associated with the Government's behaviour in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he proposes when introducing or on the Second Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill to answer the criticism that has been voiced against that Bill.  I have not the Minister's speech before me but I think he referred to the criticism as unfair and ill-advised or some words to that effect.  All one can say is this; that it is not unreasonable to accept the Government's intentions in relation to the Criminal Justice Bill as part of the pattern of totalitarian Government which they believe in.  We still have on our Statute Book the Offences Against the State Act.  We still have on our Statute Book&mdash;and in this we are alone in Europe with the dictatorships of Greece, Spain and Portugal&mdash;legislation at the whim of the Government to open concentration camps and establish military courts.</P>
    <P>We think this is wrong and when coupled with that you have the Government's declared intention of prohibiting public meetings, prohibiting pickets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different ways of imposing dictatorship.  You can have a military coup or you can have dictatorship by stealth, by leaving on the Statute Book legislation which empowers you to have concentration camps and military courts; dictatorship by stealth by which you introduce powers which when introducing you probably say you will never use.  We are aware that on the Statute Book of Ireland was put an Act making it an offence to picket in the precincts of Leinster House.  The Fianna Fáil Government which put that Act on the Irish Statute Book declared at the time through the mouth of the Minister for Justice when introducing the Act that it would not be used in industrial disputes. He said it would only be used against people who were undermining the security of the State.  That is on the records of Dáil Éireann but we have seen within the last few years that the same power which is concerned about the very security and existence of the State being used to serve the political purposes of the Government when they were embarrassed by farmers, telephonists and others who were in dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> I have no doubt that it is undesirable for any people to picket the National Parliament.  I have told those who have picketed Leinster House that is my view and I have told them that in picketing the Dáil they are picketing themselves because we have no authority, no power, no rights except the authority, power and rights we get from the people.  We are their representatives and even as I fought for some of those involved here on the floor of this House I told them that I would pass their picket whether I was for or against them.  But, having said that, I think it is wholly wrong to put in gaol, to treat as common criminals, to arrest with the aid of dogs and to stuff into black marias people who are protesting against what they believe to be injustice. That is something which more than smacks of dictatorship in any Government which indulges in that kind of action.</P>
    <P>It is because these things have occurred in this State in recent times not only with the blessing of the Government but at the Government's dictation that we are concerned about the trends which are developing here and which, as I say, the people emphatically rejected on 16th October. Notwithstanding the voice of the people on the 16th October the Government are apparently incapable of interpreting that decision for what it means and that is that the vast majority of the Irish people stand for fair play and will stand against anybody who tries to destroy that principle.  In case there is still in anybody's mind any doubt about the intentions of the Fianna Fáil Party, may I recall the fact that twice this year in the European Assembly of Nations I have heard the Leader of the Fianna Fáil delegation, a man who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Government for several decades, support and comfort the police State of Greece.</P>

    <Col N="1649" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to see here the kind of police state that there is in Greece.  We want to see here what we have had until recent times, a Garda Síochána serving all sections of the community, a Garda Síochána beholden to no political junta, a Garda Síochána which could act fearlessly and impartially, a Garda Síochána which were not made the tools of any political party in or out of power and as we have every reason to be worried about the readiness of the Government to abuse the Garda Síochána and to establish here the kind of police state that there is in Greece and elsewhere, we have a duty to warn the people about what is happening. If the Government, as I say, want to re-establish themselves in the eyes of the people, and in the eyes of the Garda Síochána in particular, then they will withdraw from the present unsavoury position in which they have put themselves and into which they have tried to drag the Garda Síochána in recent times.</P>
      <P>I said that the Garda Síochána are respected and admired by the vast majority of our people and our people repudiate the vexatious accusations, many of them from non-nationals, in recent times, that the Gardaí have engaged in&mdash;to use the term of vulgar abuse which is used internationally at the present time&mdash;police brutality.  We do not accept that that is happening. We believe that there are certain elements in our community, and they are an almost insignificant fraction, who would endeavour to provoke the Gardaí who, after all, are human, to reply in kind to the assaults which are committed upon them and I think it is very much to the credit of the Force that, notwithstanding all the provocation they have received from this section of the community, they have restrained themselves and have exhibited the very best traditions of the Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent twelve months period, we learn with horror, there were over 200 brutal attacks made on members of the Garda Síochána.  It is a very frightening figure that over 200 attacks should have been made on members of the Garda Síochána and <Col N="1650" /> most of them, I am sorry to say, here in the metropolis.  Very fortunately, serious injury did not occur in all cases but I understand that, in a twelve months period, 12 of these cases did result in injuries which were serious.</P>
    <P>I advocated at the time that extra precautions should be taken to prevent injury to Gardaí Síochána when discharging their duty and I am not entirely satisfied that sufficient protection is given to the Gardaí in the discharge of their duty or that when they are injured sufficient compensation is given to them and that is something to which the Minister ought to look so that justice would be done.</P>
    <P>There is one area of inactivity in the administration of justice here which ought to cause us more concern, and that is, in relation to dog and badger trials.  The activity of dog and badger trials is something which all decentminded people will condemn.  I will not call it a sport and I will not call it a game because it is neither.  It is a cruel, vicious and indecent activity but it is going on in contravention of the law; it is going on in contravention of the rules of the Kennel Club and the other organisations which pretend to ensure that cruelty is not inflicted on either badger or dog.</P>
    <P>The crime statistics, unfortunately, do not give us the exact number of cases which come to notice.  Perhaps that is as well because I fear that if the statistics were available they might be negative because I am not at all satisfied, and many people are not satisfied, that sufficient is being done to curb this most undesirable activity.  Nothing will ever stop this unfortunate activity until such time as there is an obligation on the organisers of dog and badger trials to notify the Garda in advance.  It is surely asking too much to expect the Garda to be in a position to inspect dog and badger trials if they do not know they are happening.  The only way to ensure that the law is being observed is for the Garda to receive advance notice of dog and badger trials.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the Protection of Animals Acts of 1911 and 1965 is carried out, of course, by the Garda <Col N="1651" /> Síochána but it can only be carried out by them when they know that activities in relation to those Acts are in progress.  I would, therefore, urge the Minister to take such steps as might be necessary to see to it that the Garda are advised and must be advised in advance so that the law can properly be enforced.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have received exhortations from the Minister for Justice and his predecessor to prepare ourselves for the new legal world into which we must move when Ireland becomes closely associated with Europe.  We have not heard so much about Europe in recent times and there are those who would prefer that Ireland's activities abroad might not be discussed at all here in the House. There have been, as I say, these exhortations to the legal profession, in particular, to prepare for this new world, this great new European association with which we may one time be amalgamated.  To do this it is very proper that law students would have a better understanding of European legal theory, systems and practices.  I have asked the Minister for Justice to provide a subsidy for our law libraries, particularly those used by law students, so that they would have on their shelves the necessary legal tomes in relation to European legal theory and practice.</P>
    <P>In the past we have had subsidies from the State for the assistance of law libraries because of the importance of lawyers, qualified and in training, being kept abreast of the legal position.  We have a very polite notion that every man is presumed to know the law and that no man can be held not to know it.  I am glad that the State, through the Department of Justice, has accepted a more practical understanding of the situation, that people cannot know the law without having the necessary textbooks available to them.  The amount of money available for the stocking of our law libraries is far from adequate.  The Council of Europe have already advocated that member states would use their good offices in parliament and with governments to ensure that governments would make financial <Col N="1652" /> assistance available towards the extension of education in European legal theory and practice.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister for Justice to seek from the Minister for Finance a sum of money which will enable him to equip our law libraries to face the challenge of the legal future which will be ours when we become a part of any European legal entity.  There is also a great need for more studies by law students of European legal systems.  At present, most European law schools have dispensed with the obligation, which came down from early ages, to have Latin as a necessary qualifying subject.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are very much behind in the study of European languages. This year, for the first time since the foundation of the State, I understand we have the same number of Leaving Certificate students taking French as we have taking Latin, but that is not good enough.  It is quite apparent that if one does not have a modern European language it will be impossible to study European legal practice and theory except where the books are available in the English language, and the number of these is very rare indeed.</P>
    <P>On that account I ask the Minister for Justice to use his good offices with the law schools in urging them to abolish the precondition of a Latin qualification for entrance to the schools and to replace it with a precondition of a qualification in a modern European language.  The Minister says he has no responsibility in the matter.  I believe he has.  I believe he has a responsibility for the future of our whole judicial and legal system and that it is not good enough for him to say that he has no statutory responsibility as such for the education of students of our law schools.</P>
    <P>For several years the Minister for Health took a somewhat similar view in relation to the medical and dental schools and, because of that, we have a situation in which many of our dental, medical and nursing graduates are no longer acceptable in countries abroad.  We have a clear duty to see to it that our Irish lawyers have a full understanding of European legal systems, but we will not have that until <Col N="1653" /> there is adequate help from the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>One strange anomaly in our State Departments is, unless the situation has changed, that the Garda Síochána have not within their own control an up-to-date record of the ownership of motor cars.  Certainly the situation used to be&mdash;and if it has changed I should be glad to hear&mdash;that in order to learn the ownership of motor cars the Garda Síochána were obliged to seek the assistance of the local authorities.  That may be all right in relation to what might be called static offences or an offence committed where the parties involved have given the necessary information to the Garda.</P>
    <P>However, the situation is intolerable in regard to hit and run accidents. Cases have arisen where some alert bystander has been able to get the registration number of a car and pass it on to the Garda Síochána but, having done that, several hours have elapsed before the Garda were able to trace the owner of the car involved, simply because of the necessity to seek the assistance of the local authority concerned.  I do not have to indicate that that could easily facilitate the escape of a drunken driver from the full rigour of the law, because ample time would have elapsed between the taking of the number of the car and the ascertaining of the ownership to allow him to sober up.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why in this modern electronic computer age we cannot have a dual record, one in the office of the local authority and the other immediately available to the Garda Síochána and within their control.  It should surely be possible to transmit information from the office of the local authority to the Garda simultaneously.</P>
    <P>In this day in which more and more people are being encouraged to fit their cars with seat belts it is very disturbing to learn that of a Garda fleet of 248 cars, as of November last&mdash;the number is probably larger now&mdash;of which 34 are Ministers' cars, only 34 are fitted with seat belts.  The 34 in question, I understand, are Ministers' cars.  That leaves a situation in which more than 200 Garda cars have not got seat belts. One can certainly appreciate the need <Col N="1654" /> for Gardaí to make a quick ejection from a car, but seat belts are very easy to get out of.  It may be a little inconvenient to get into them or to fasten them, but this is no justification for not having seat belts in the Garda cars. There have been accidents resulting in serious injuries, as the Minister well knows, and I believe it would be proved justified to have seat belts fitted without any further delay.</P>
    <P>Two and a half years ago Dublin Corporation presented new street trading regulations to the Department of Justice, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Health.  It is very disappointing, to say the least of it, that, because of delay on the part of the Government Departments concerned, including the Department of Justice, the necessary amendments in the law have not yet been made.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister therefore to allow sufficient attention to be given to the reform of street trading in Dublin and to see to it that, as far as his Department is concerned, this matter will be cleared without further delay. If it has been cleared as far as the Department of Justice is concerned, I hope I will be forgiven for referring to the matter; but my information is that the matter is not yet through because of delay on the Government side.  I am not sure which particular Department is involved but I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>There is the situation.  We have a Department of Justice which, as I said earlier, is not living up to its name. The people of this country are being ruled by intimidation.  We have had the fine, upstanding members of the Garda Síochána used to intimidate people to serve the political purposes of the present Government.  Let us have an end to it.  Let us return to the happy situation in which the people can regard the Gardaí as their protectors and not their prosecutors.  That is what the Garda want to be.  They are not seeking the unnecessary powers which the Government suggest they need.</P>
    <P>I want people to know exactly what occurs at the moment when parades and public meetings take place. <Col N="1655" /> Irrespective of legal obligations, sensible people will, of course, notify the Garda of their intention to hold a parade or a public meeting in the street.  They have the right to hold these parades and public meetings without getting permission to do so, and I think that is the way in which our society can contribute in the future as in the past.  However, as I say, the practice is to notify the Garda. This is a prudent one, because by notifying the Garda the amount of inconvenience to other road users and other people who resort to public places will be reduced.</P>
    <P>The Garda are only too happy and too willing to give every co-operation to anybody who wants to use the roads and the public places in Ireland for lawful purposes, and I have never known it to be otherwise.  The Garda, with their wide experience of traffic problems, can certainly make alternative suggestions to the organisers, and the vast majority of our people are reasonable and will accept such advice from the Garda Síochána.  As far as I am aware the Garda are not looking for any drastic powers to enable them to prohibit people who are in entire agreement with their suggestions from assembling.</P>
    <P>I would hope that wiser counsels will prevail, and even though the Taoiseach is unable, as he said he was yesterday, to make a reasonable decision, one would hope reason will prevail and that we shall continue to have the situation which has existed in the past. It is only by so doing that we will preserve for our people the right to free speech and the right of free assembly which are critically necessary if democracy and fair play are to survive in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, in case there should be any mischiefmakers who would try to construe it otherwise, that what I have said about attempts to establish a police state here are not a reflection on the Garda Síochána.  They have been made the innocent victims of an outrageous conspiracy on the part of the Government to misuse them. They do not want it.  It is a good thing that we have this debate on the Department <Col N="1656" /> of Justice at this particular time, so that the voice of the Garda as well as that of the people can declare that the powers the Government want to impose in the Criminal Justice Bill are not wanted by either the Garda or the people.</P>
    <P>One final word about the Garda and it is this: the Minister announced some time ago&mdash;and he repeated the statement in his speech yesterday&mdash;that he was carrying out a review of the organisation of the Garda Síochána. One would think that a Minister for Justice would consult with the Garda before he would embark on that kind of activity.  However, he has declared that he has for some time past been reviewing the organisation and structure of the Garda with a view to the better use of existing personnel and capital equipment and also with a view to seeing whether or not it is necessary to increase the numbers in the Garda.  The Minister has also declared he is considering the whole structure including, apparently, the hierarchy of officers and men.</P>
    <P>The members of the Garda Síochána resent&mdash;and I think they are justified in resenting&mdash;that the Minister for Justice should be embarking upon studies affecting their future as members of the force without consulting with the force itself.  This is most unfair.  I would urge upon the Minister, in relation to such reviews as he will conduct, to take into his confidence not only the commissioner and senior officers, who, of course, must be consulted and whose views it is very proper the Minister should hear, but also all ranks&mdash; chief superintendents, superintendents, inspectors, sergeants and gardaí.  They are all concerned and very much concerned. Their own individual futures and the futures of their families are at stake.  It is most desirable that, if any changes are to be made, they be made only after full consultation with all ranks so that such changes will have the consent of the force which now, as in the past, is dedicated to serve the people.  The Garda Síochána want to serve the people and they should be taken for what they are, a body of responsible men.</P>
    <P>The pay of the Garda is also being reviewed at present.  One would hope <Col N="1657" /> that the deliberations in that connection will be speedy and that at the conclusion the conditions of service and the remuneration of Gardaí will be such as to encourage the very best people to enter that force and to be promoted in that force.  As I say, notwithstanding the disappointments of the force in recent times under the Fianna Fáil Government in relation to pay and so forth, they have remained a wonderful body, and we thank God for them.  We can only hope they will be fairly served by the present administration in whatever few weeks are left of that administration and that the administration will not further blot its own copybook and the copybook of democracy in this country by any further misuse of this splendid force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): On this Estimate each year we very properly hear tributes paid to the Garda force for the work they have done since the inception of that force. That is only right, and I want to join in saying how fortunate we are in having such a fine impartial police force as the Garda Síochána.  I wonder, however, do we show our appreciation of the members of the Garda in a practical way by providing those of them who are obliged to live in married quarters with suitable accommodation. There is something being done at the moment to meet the serving Gardaí on the question of salaries, and I do not propose to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion, however, within the last 12 months to take up with the commissioner and the Department of Justice the case of a young married sergeant who is living with his wife and two young children in a Garda barracks in a village on the borders of Cavan.  In this day and age we find that there is neither running water nor sewerage facilities in that Garda station.  It is not a very old building; I would say it was probably built within the last 30 years.  Although there is a public water supply in the village, this barracks has not been connected to that water supply, nor has it been provided with elementary toilet and sewerage facilities.  That is hard to <Col N="1658" /> believe but it is a fact.  The excuse given by the Commissioner's office and by the Department of Justice is that there is some vague consideration going on about closing down certain stations and that it has to be decided what stations will be closed down and what stations will be kept open.</P>
    <P>That is happening as a result of a commission that sat last year or this year and certainly that is no excuse for having this Garda barracks, which is supposed to house a young sergeant in his late 20's, his wife and a couple of young children, in this condition.  It is not possible in 1968 to get a grant from the Department of Local Government for a new house, not even in a remote part of the country, unless the house is properly serviced and the term &ldquo;properly serviced&rdquo; means that water and sewerage are provided.  It is no answer that there is no public water supply in the vicinity because the applicant for a grant is expected to bore a well and get a supply of water and if there is no public sewerage system in the locality he is expected to sink a septic tank and connect his house with it.</P>
    <P>That is as it should be; those are minimum requirements and conditions in 1968, or indeed much earlier, but yet we have this case which I mention, in the village of Finea, where this sergeant, his wife and family are living under these conditions.  The barracks is structurally sound; it is a single storey building which, of course, could be utilised in the morning as a dwelling house if it were no longer required as a barracks.  My information is that it will continue to be used as a barracks and even if it is not surely if there was an expenditure of a few hundred pounds to connect it with the local water scheme and for the provision of a septic tank this would be justified.  It would add to the value of the house if it were to be sold subsequently.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many more cases there are of this type of living quarters for non-commissioned officers and men of the Garda Síochána still in existence. I say it is a reflection on the Minister and on his Department that <Col N="1659" /> this position should continue to exist.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that this barracks is put into a habitable condition.  I do not think I am exaggerating by saying that a house which has not got running water and sewerage facilities is not habitable according to civilised, everyday standards. I hope it will not be necessary to comment on this sort of complaint again.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned the case of members of a section of the Garda Síochána who had opted under the 1951 scheme to continue on a pension of two-thirds of their salary and who had failed to opt for a pension at the rate of 50 per cent of their salary and a lump sum on retirement or death.  As I said previously, in 1951 conditions in the Garda Síochána were altogether different, their rates of pay were lower and many of them retired as early as they could.  Now that things are different they are inclined to stay on longer. All this is on record and I do not want to repeat it.  There is a small number of men involved from the rank of superintendent down who now regret very much that they did not opt for the smaller pension and the lump sum and who are at a loss as a result.  On their behalf I appeal to the Minister to let them have second thoughts and let them exercise an option now which would give them the right to a substantial lump sum on retirement or death. Then, of course, they will have to be satisfied with the lower rate of pension. This would show a practical appreciation for the force and it would be an encouragement to men to remain in the force in the knowledge that they are appreciated in a practical way.</P>
    <P>I understand that the older members of the force who served in more difficult times and played a very noble part in establishing the force we have today and in gaining for it the respect it undoubtedly gets, are badly treated in regard to pensions.  I understand that men who retired from the Garda prior to 1960 would require a 35 per cent increase in pensions to bring them up to present standards.  Further, I understand that members of the Garda who retired in 1964 have had no increase in <Col N="1660" /> their pensions since then, notwithstanding the fact that the cost of living has increased enormously and notwithstanding the fact that other sections of the community, including Members of this House, have received what we might call status increases or, at any rate, substantial increases.  This is something that calls for attention. While we are inclined to be generous and fair to serving personnel in all grades, whether it is in the Civil Service properly so-called, in semi-State bodies or, indeed, in private enterprise &mdash;which is not much thanks to us because the people in active service have the power to compel us to be decent and to do the right thing&mdash;it is too bad that we are not as generous or as fair or as just as we should be to those who have served the nation and have gone into retirement.  It is ungracious and uncharitable that we more or less ignore them and treat them much less favourably just because they can do nothing about it, because they have not got the power to exercise a substantial influence on the Government or on society.</P>
    <P>The widows of Gardaí have a real grievance.  I know this because from time to time I have representations made to me by Garda widows who do not receive the old age pension or a widow's pension.  It is brought home to me even more clearly when I find that they qualify for some of the widow's pension or some of the old age pension.  That made me prick my ears because I said that, if they are entitled to some of the old age pension or some of the widow's pension, then the pension they receive as a Garda widow must be very small indeed.  If I had been told they were not entitled to any old age pension or any widow's pension, I might have said, without going into it further, that the Garda widow's pension must be substantial.  But it is not substantial.  It was increased lately, as the reply to a question revealed today, to £170 a year.  That is a very small pension for a Garda widow in this day and age.</P>
    <P>We are, I think, entitled to compare that pension with the pension payable to widows of policemen in Europe and in Britain.  Very frequently young men who join the Garda become disillusioned <Col N="1661" /> subsequently and leave the service; they then join some other police force elsewhere.  I understand that the widows of policemen in Europe receive half their husbands' salaries by way of pension.  In Britain, the widow of a policeman receives 33? per cent of her husband's salary and she is entitled to social welfare benefit on top of that.  Here, a widow receives a quarter, 25 per cent, of her husband's salary and that is assessed against her under the social welfare code so that she is much worse off than is her sister in Europe and less well off than her sister in Britain.  This is something that needs attention.  Our police force should be put on terms as favourable as those that operate in other police forces, particularly in Europe.  It is no answer to say that police forces in other countries are paid much better than is our police force here.  I have mentioned percentages. We should at least put the Garda widow on the same level as her sister in Britain, namely, on 33? per cent of her husband's salary and give her social welfare benefit on top of that.</P>
    <P>Certain extra work will fall on the Garda as a result of the passing of the Road Traffic Act earlier this year.  The Minister for Local Government was responsible for piloting that measure through the House, but it is the Minister for Justice who will enforce its provisions, with the assistance of the Garda.  There are some very far-reaching provisions in that Act.  They are law now and nothing can be done about them.  There is the blood test. There are powers of arrest for comparatively trivial offences.  There are traffic wardens.  These are just a few of the things arising out of that Act.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the provisions of the Act are operated in a reasonable way.  Nobody justifies, encourages, or even tolerates, drunken driving but, at the same time, the provisions of that Act should not be used solely to annoy or to make life unbearable for the motoring public. The provisions should be introduced gradually and operated in a reasonable way.  I will not say in a sympathetic way because there should not be any sympathy for drunken drivers.  The people I am concerned about are the <Col N="1662" /> ordinary people going about their business or their leisure.  Everybody who drives a car should not be regarded as a criminal.  Before the Garda are entrusted with the enforcement of certain sections of the Road Traffic Act they should have very considerable experience.  Six months training in a depot is not anything like sufficient experience to equip a Garda to deal with the motoring public under this Act.  The Gardaí should get an intensive and extensive course of training instruction and advice to equip them to enforce these provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with law reform and he mentioned wide fields in which he proposes to introduce legislation to reform the existing law.  He promised a great many of these reforms within the present session.  He will be a very busy man if he gets all these dealt with in this session.  Perhaps he had his speech prepared before he knew his colleague was going to introduce the second electoral reform Bill, which is due for its Second Reading on 12th November.  At any rate, the Minister, or some successor of his, will deal with the various law reforms mentioned by him.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, any Bill proposing to change the existing law in a drastic way, or to change established custom, irrespective of whether it affects the family, individual citizens, or citizens as a whole, should receive very mature consideration, indeed, before it is introduced into this House because, once a Bill is introduced here, it becomes a matter of principle and, however ridiculous it is, the Minister may find it very hard at that point to run away from that principle.  I want to sound a note of warning.  My mind goes back to the Succession Bill.  That Bill must have been drafted by technically-minded civil servants.  It must never have been seriously considered by the responsible Minister.  It could never have been seriously considered by the Cabinet.  It certainly did not come before the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was a crazy bit of legislation which did violence to conditions here, to the practice of will-making, to the family farm, to the family business: I need not go over the whole field again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Give credit where credit is due.  There was a change of Minister.  The Minister who introduced it was promoted and was succeeded by another Minister.  He availed of the opportunity to admit that the whole thing was fantastic.  It was drastically amended and his own mother would not know it when it left this House.  That is a very good reason, I think, for saying that Bills which propose to reform the law should be considered at grass-root level, at the ordinary man-in-the-street level.  The Minister should have the fullest advice. I am glad to see, according to his brief, that he is availing of the advice of the Incorporated Law Society on certain matters and will thus draw on the vast field of experience and wisdom which that body acquires in its ordinary day-to-day dealings with the public, apart altogether from its technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>I might avail of this opportunity to say that I certainly hope that, under the present Minister, whether he be in that office long or short, whether his Government lasts for a month or a year or longer, there will be a very great improvement in the relationship existing between himself and his Department and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  If the Minister avails of the experience and the vast amount of wisdom&mdash;I use &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; in the narrow sense&mdash;acquired by contact with people and by dealing with such a variety of problems as could never be met with in the Department of Justice, or in any Department, then he and his Department will benefit a lot by it and legislation introduced here will be much more practical.</P>
    <P>Maybe this would be the point at which I should deal with a matter that was brought to my attention.  Deputy Ryan has dealt with probate fees.  In the old days, very old farmers used to warn their sons that there would come the time when the rates would be higher than the rent.  I think they said the &ldquo;cess&rdquo;, as they used to call it, would be higher than the rent.  Certainly, the time has come when probate fees far exceed estate duty.</P>
    <P>When some of us started to practise first, estate duty was payable on estates <Col N="1664" /> over £100.  Now, estate duty is not payable unless the estate exceeds £5,000 in any case and, indeed, with certain concessions granted to widows and children, it could be far above that.  However, probate fees have increased several hundred per cent.  It is nothing now to find them, in a case, running to £20, £30 or £40.  In cases where estate duty is not payable, probate fees should not be charged.  If that is going too far, we should have a small flat rate for probate fees where estate duty is not payable.  The Minister, who is a lawyer, cannot say that that is unreasonable.  There used to be an old 15s, or 30s flat rate.  I think a flat rate should now operate in any case where estate duty is not payable. I leave that to the Minister and his advisers to work out.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point in the field of probate.  We have here a principal probate office in the city of Dublin and we have a number of district probate offices throughout the country.  I do not know the exact number of district offices: it is between ten and 15&mdash;probably 13.  Between them, these district offices issue about 10,000 grants of probate and administration each year.  It is considered, on the best legal authority, that all of these grants of probate and administration issued by district probate offices each year are null and void and have no effect and, if challenged in any court of this country, will be thrown in the waste paper basket.  That may sound extraordinary and the Minister may be surprised to hear it.  I invite him to look into the position.</P>
    <P>The district probate offices here were established under the Letters of Administration (Ireland) Act, 1857. That Act provided for the appointment of district registrars who were appointed, all down the years, I understand, up to 1945 when the Court Officers Act came into force.  Section 9 of the Court Officers Act provided that, where a vacancy existed in an office allocated to a court, the Minister could, instead of filling it direct, authorise a court officer to perform the duties of the vacant office and, of course, the Minister for Justice, on the advice of his experts, ceased to appoint <Col N="1665" /> any more district probate officers. Instead, pursuant to section 9 of the Court Officers Act, 1945, he directed and authorised the county registrar to carry out the duties of the vacant office of district probate officer, which he was entitled to do under that section so long as there was a vacancy in the office of district probate registrar.</P>
    <P>However, along came the Succession Act of 1965, and it abolished <i>in toto</i> the Probate (Ireland) Act, 1857 and, with it, bang went the office of district probate registrar.  The Succession Act of 1965 repealed <i>in toto</i> the Probate (Ireland) Act, 1857, and automatically repealed the position of district probate registrar.  Go through the Succession Act of 1965 as you will, line by line, and you will not find there any provision for the appointment of a district probate registrar.  The Act refers glibly here and there to district probate registrars but there is nothing in the Act to provide for the appointment of a registrar.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if there is no such office as that of district probate registrar, that office could not be vacant; and if there is no vacancy, if there is not the vacant office of district probate registrar, section 9 of the Court Officers Act, 1945, could not be brought into operation to fill a vacancy in a non-existent office. There is an all-powerful saving provision in the Succession Act about existing practice and procedure but it is doubtful, in my opinion, whether it helps at all.  It certainly cannot help in any way the new district registries, eight in number I think, established by the Minister for Justice under the provisions of the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that in some quarters it is realised that the probate registrar has not the authority he purports to exercise because until recently all grants of probate and letters of administration issued by district registries were signed by the county registrar. It was a nice title, an added title, for the county registrar, one which, I am sure, he liked to use&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He got paid for it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Of course he got paid for it.  However, a short time ago the county registrar <Col N="1666" /> dropped the title of district probate registrar, and the grant is now issued and signed by the county registrar over the description &ldquo;Person authorised by law to perform the duties of district probate registrar&rdquo;.  What I want to know is who, or by virtue of which law, is the county registrar authorised to perform the duties of district probate registrar.  The first point I want to make in that respect is that there is no such gentleman, no such official, as the district probate registrar, because he went bang with the Succession Act of 1965.</P>
      <P>I say therefore that it is difficult to see under which law the various county registrars are authorised to perform the duties of district probate registrar.  It is really an alarming state of affairs that we are issuing grants of probate and letters of administration by the thousand which may not be worth the paper they are written on.  So, the best legal opinion I could get advised me.  I am not saying this off the cuff.  I am speaking about something which has been the result of deep research and long consideration.  Even if the advice I have got is not right&mdash;I accept it&mdash;it is still an alarming state of affairs that there should be any room for doubt, for argument, as to the validity of grants of probate or letters of administration through which people are dealing with thousands, perhaps millions, of pounds worth of property.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister therefore to avail of the earliest opportunity he has to have this matter looked into.  I have given him my reasoning, I have given him the facts on which I base my argument.  As I have said, the Succession Act glibly refers to the position of district probate registrar and refers to a lot of the things he has to do.  Of course, by far the most important duty is the issuing of grants of probate and letters of administration, particularly letters of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have said enough about that to ensure that the Minister will have it looked into at the highest level. I am not sure the attention of the Minister or his Department has not already been directed to it.  From his reaction, I gather that the Minister had not heard about it previously and I <Col N="1667" /> accept that.  Might I say that the Minister, if he comes to the conclusion that what I have said is correct, should then direct that the probate registrar will be the county registrar and nobody else.  In that way he will ensure that the probate registrar has proper legal qualifications and, indeed, experience to deal with the functions entrusted to him.  It is more important now than ever before because we find there is more work being given to the various county registrars.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister speak about his proposal to increase the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts.  It has been talked about for quite some time and it is long overdue. One hears criticism from time to time about the cost of litigation.  Much of that cost is due to the fact that expert witnesses, lay witnesses and others have to travel to Dublin to the High Court to have their cases decided in a very formal atmosphere, in a very formal way.  There is a lot to be said, therefore, for a substantial increase in the jurisdiction of the district court. I do not know when it was increased to £50 but it was after considerable consideration and, of course, the figure was out of date before it was brought in.</P>
    <P>I am a bit alarmed about the Minister's reference in his speech to bail. I see there an indication that the Minister believes that, unless there are very good reasons to the contrary, a person charged with an offence in any way serious at all should be detained in prison pending his trial.</P>
    <P>In my opinion that is a dangerous trend.  I think that the contrary should be the case.  If there is going to be any change in the law the onus should still be on, and very much on, the prosecution to establish reasonable grounds for depriving a man of his liberty pending trial, because the presumption of innocence until a man is found guilty still stands sacred and I hope will continue to do so indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I just cannot get the point in the Minister's speech and I certainly would ask the Minister to travel very, very slowly here.  We had occasion, when the Road Traffic Bill was passing <Col N="1668" /> through the House, to complain bitterly about the powers of arrest without warrant given by that Bill and I feel this is all part of the same trend.  Under that Bill the Garda had power to arrest without a warrant a person found guilty of dangerous parking.  I do not object to the Garda having the right to tow away the offending vehicle, but why should they have the power to arrest without warrant?  So far as I know, it remained in the Bill.  We objected to it here and I do not know whether it was amended.  The trend is creeping into legislation, giving the State more and more power, putting the private citizen on the wrong foot as much as they can.  I know it is all being done in the name of society and under the pretence that it is necessary to adopt very strong measures in order to protect law-abiding citizens.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but this was the practice to my own knowledge for many years.  In applications for bail the police officer went into the box and gave his view.  If the man had a bad record that was taken into consideration. It was only in recent times, through a decision of the High or Supreme Courts, that was all changed.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It was always operated in a reasonable way.  Except in cases involving injury to Gardaí or in cases where the accused person was likely to interfere with witnesses or impede the course of justice or to abscond, he should be given bail. If a police officer went into the witness-box and said that a man was a habitual criminal, that he had recently come out of jail and that he had several terms of imprisonment for physical violence, then I would say that it would be reasonable to keep him in prison.  I would urge the Minister as a man of long experience as a lawyer in a practical way, to give this matter considerable consideration.  I do not want to appear to be pontificating, but I am worried about the trend.  In my short time in this House I see it creeping into legislation, giving the authorities more power, perhaps unnecessary power, and using a sledge hammer to kill a fly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> We do not want this island of ours to become a police State.  It will not become one in five to ten years or overnight; but it can do so by degrees, by getting people to settle for less and less and by getting them to have less regard for their liberty and their individual rights.  I have taken the Road Traffic Bill as an example because it was fresh in my mind.  So long as I have voice and influence here I will continue to stand up for the rights of the individual citizens as against society in general while, at the same time, giving reasonable protection to society in general.  If an individual, as such, loses his rights it means society in general has lost them.  It is absurd to say you can submerge the individual right in the interests of the common right because all individuals together form society.</P>
    <P>There was a point I intended to make when dealing with pensioners in connection with a couple of retired circuit court judges who had something less than the necessary ten years service to qualify them for a worthwhile pension.  This has been brought up in the House on a number of occasions. I am asking the Minister to look into these two individual cases again. There is a precedent for meeting them in a special way.  That precedent is to be found in an Act in Northern Ireland. I do not say we should follow the example of Northern Ireland in every sphere but, where we can find something of a charitable and Christian nature in their code, we should follow it.  Indeed, sometimes judges are quite advanced in years when they are appointed and have not the opportunity of serving a sufficient length of time to qualify them for pensions.  For that reason I urge that these two men should get special treatment.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put up here by the present Minister's predecessor when he introduced a special Bill to deal with one judge.  I do not object to that Bill at all.  It was a Bill introduced to deal with one judge on his appointment and to ensure his pension. On his appointment he would have had less than the statutory period to qualify for a full pension.  It was urged then that much could be said for doing <Col N="1670" /> this when a man had served for a long time at the Bar because he brought to the Bench a vast accumulation of experience and legal knowledge.  He was much more valuable than a young inexperienced man.  You have the case in Northern Ireland and you have the case of this special Bill which we had introduced here within the last couple of years to deal with a special case. That, if I might say so without disrespect, was a case of meeting somebody who was quite right in not accepting the position unless he was properly provided for.  In my opinion it is not going too far to say that a couple of men who came in and gave equally good service and who did not have their interests protected before accepting office should have these interests protected now.  Naturally, as they are retired men now, it is something which cannot wait indefinitely.  It should be attended to in the reasonably foreseeable future before it is too late.  The same thing applies to some district justices who are now in poor enough circumstances.  These cases are becoming fewer and fewer as the years go by.  There are only a few of them left and they were paid, I think, at the rate of something like £1,000 a year for many years and, indeed, they retired on small salaries.  As a result they had very small pensions and I would ask the Minister to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The only other matter with which I should like to deal is the Land Registry. There are delays in the Land Registry, particularly in the mapping section, which I am satisfied are due to shortage of staff and equipment.  It might be said that you could not regard the Land Registry as a monopoly. It can be said that, indeed, it is; people must deal with it.  A man wants to build a house.  He must get a site and a Land Registry map before he can get finance to build.  The building section of the county council will not talk to him until he has a site.  He must get a new folio opened and he cannot get a folio until he gets a map, and there is up to six months delay in getting a Land Registry map.  This hurts a lot of people.  The man who builds a house is in trouble with the building <Col N="1671" /> contractor who is shouting for money which is not available until title is in order and title cannot be put in order until Land Registry formalities are dealt with.  There is a whole chain of people involved.  The man who gets the blame for the whole thing is the unfortunate country solicitor upon whom descends the client, the building contractor, the builder's suppliers and probably one or other non-legal Deputy telling the constituents who come to him that the solicitor is to blame for the whole thing.  He is not.  These delays occur in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with the points which occurred to me and beyond that I do not wish to say anything except to again urge on the Minister the necessity to improve and consolidate during his term of office, be it long or short, a reasonable relationship between him, his Department and the Incorporated Law Society.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to go into the technicalities and the mechanisms of the legal profession. We have proper and plenty of representation on their behalf in this House. I come here to speak for a few moments as an ordinary member of the public.  The Department of Justice have much to do.  First of all, we must take into consideration the guardians of the peace&mdash;the Garda.  The Minister says that our crime detection compares very favourably with that of any other country in Europe.  That is something about which we are all very happy.  However, very little compensation and recognition has been afforded to the devoted and dedicated men who are there on call 24 hours of every day. They should be treated in a much <Col N="1672" /> more human way.  Their pay is not commensurate with the work they are called on to do.  I have expressed certain fears on many occasions.  I want to impress on the Minister that he should use whatever pressure lies in his power to see that, in so far as Limerick is concerned at any rate, the Office of Public works will provide suitable accommodation.  The accommodation provided is an absolute shambles and I can assure the Minister that if we in the local authority had the power to condemn the premises as an unfit and dangerous dwelling we would be in there in 24 hours and have an order made for its demolition. I would ask the Minister to press as a matter of prior urgency for the provision of a suitable Garda barracks in the expanding city of Limerick which has grown beyond all our dreams in the last 10 to 20 years.</P>

Let that be clearly understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the unhappy plight of Garda widows. These men have served us well and their widows are given little or no consideration.  The Minister, being the humane man I know he is, should take up their case and give these unfortunate widows something on which to live in frugal comfort, which they have not got at the present time.  Their husbands served the State well, maybe in much more troublesome and dangerous times, and the least that should be done for them is to give them enough to provide them with a living in frugal comfort.  That is not done <Col N="1673" /> and I would ask the Minister in the name of humanity and charity to give his sympathetic consideration to this appeal.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That in view of the widespread unemployment and consequent hardship caused by the merger of minor employment and bog development schemes with rural improvement schemes, the reduction of the total vote in respect thereof by approximately one-half, and the absence of any or any adequate plan or scheme to absorb those who have lost employment, Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government to restore the said schemes in their original form and the amount of money needed to implement them.&mdash;(Deputy Lindsay).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was not tabled without reason.  I say that coming from an area which has been hardest hit by the change brought <Col N="1674" /> about by the Minister for Finance through his Parliamentary Secretary. I feel that the occasion should not be allowed to pass without mentioning a few points.  The wording of this motion is: &ldquo;That in view of the widespread unemployment and consequent hardship caused by the merger of minor employment and bog development schemes with rural improvement schemes....&rdquo;  That is the beginning of the motion.  I know the effect this merger is having on the unfortunates in the poorer areas along the west coast who have been hardest hit by this merger.  Heretofore, we had minor relief schemes which were given on the basis of unemployment in an area and on the basis of the assistance thereby given.  Now these have been merged into a scheme whereby these unfortunates have to pay a share for works that heretofore were carried out on a full cost grant by the Department. It is all right trying to knock blood out of a turnip but when you try to knock it out of a stone you are up against it and God knows we have enough stones in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this is the thinking of a man, with due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, far removed from the area.  I will be more than surprised tonight if the two Deputies for West Galway vote against the people on whom they are counting to support them.  Those unfortunates who have been led up the garden path have not been told that this is a Fianna Fáil effort to deprive them of these full cost grants.  I will be very interested and so will these unemployment assistance beneficiaries to know how these Deputies will vote.  This shows the mentality of a man far removed from the area and not in touch with it but when you see two Fianna Fáil Members from West Galway trotting after the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary in depriving these people of what was given by a Fine Gael Government in the past&mdash;I suppose that is one reason why they are going to be deprived of these grants&mdash;it is worse still.  This shows the mentality of a man who is out of touch with the needs of the West. This was proved quite recently in <Col N="1675" /> their tolerance effort.  If you talk of tolerance let us have a little more tolerance from Fianna Fáil.  Let them tolerate the schemes that we brought in and that meant a lot to the unfortunates who were depending on getting a bit of turf out or getting into their houses and who could not afford to pay for road schemes.  A man on unemployment assistance certainly cannot afford to pay for road schemes and, mind you, that is no credit to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Those schemes have been lumped in together and handed over to the local county councils.  They have all been wrapped up in one to which everyone must contribute.  I shall not go back over the grounds of why these unfortunates in the areas worst hit should have to pay.  I wonder what great slice of the economy has gone to the Aran Islands?  We talk of tourism doing something for the West.  Tourism is no good to the unfortunates at the back of beyond and those are the men I am speaking for here.  These schemes have been handed over to the county councils and handed over with a big backlog.  We have a backlog piling up at the county council offices.  The administration cost paid by the Department is about ten per cent I understand. That shows that not alone the Parliamentary Secretary but the officials are completely out of touch if they think that this can be done on ten per cent.  The actual cost, from what I understand in areas where work was carried out, is 23 per cent; in other words, the Government are foisting over 13 per cent and in some cases maybe a lot more on the local rates.</P>
    <P>Good work has been done in the past on these roads.  It may not have been the best work but at least people were able to get in, lorries were able to get in and out with turf on roads that were heretofore waterlogged and where unfortunate children had to wear wellingtons going to school.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary smiling but there are more wellingtons worn in my area than there are in his whole county or the next county to it.  Of course, these unfortunates are forgotten because they are at the back of beyond <Col N="1676" /> and can be forgotten as far as this Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>The administration of this required engineers and this caused a lot of the backlog that we see.  Engineers from the Board of Works were let go.  Can the county councils get engineers now?  Young engineers who should be available do not want this type of work; they want experience.  Galway County Council are finding it very hard to get engineers despite their efforts and I have not heard that they have got them yet.  Even then we know how long it takes to go through the channels of the local appointments commission to get a permanent official.</P>
    <P>This work has been stretched out and it is disgraceful that jobs are allowed to pile up.  Drainage is also included in this scheme.  I cannot see an area where you can get the kind of money required and that means the work will not be done.  You may have people interested in a bog that requires to be drained, one man living ten miles and another five miles away.  It is not easy to get them together even if they could pay.  They may use the bog for a few weeks in the year but they are entitled to get out their turf.  We talk of trying to help the economy through a fuel effort but in this matter the people are being bogged down by the Department and it is wrong that they should be deprived of a right given by a Fine Gael Government in the past. It is hard to see unfortunate people dragging turf out for miles when previously they could have brought in a lorry and helped themselves and their neighbours when they had a road on which a lorry could travel.</P>
    <P>The work that will be done will be well done by the county councils but what I object to is that those who cannot pay will be deprived of the benefit of the scheme.  If there was a means test I would agree with it because many of those people would qualify.  This motion calls on the Government to restore the scheme to its original form and also provide the amount of money needed to implement it.  I would be very interested to know, and so would many in my area, how the Fianna Fáil representatives will turn when it comes to voting tonight. It would be more decent for them not <Col N="1677" /> to vote.  They should have the courage of their convictions and go the opposite way but, being brainwashed, they must follow the leader.</P>

      <P>I am merely intervening on behalf of the Minister for Local Government to point out that this motion is typical of the Fine Gael Party, an appeal to leave things as they are.  Several Fine Gael Deputies have spoken to the motion already and part of what they said&mdash; this is a very common Fine Gael tactic &mdash;is true.  The true part is that there are thousands of people living in rural Ireland, the approaches to whose homes are very bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and urgently need to be repaired.  I was listening to Deputy Coogan&mdash;and this is where the falsity comes in&mdash;and his whole speech was a plethora of inaccuracies and&mdash;I do not want to say falsehoods because I do not want to suggest he would deliberately misrepresent the facts&mdash; distorted facts.  For instance, he seems to be under the impression that this <Col N="1678" /> scheme for the improvement of rural roadways and lanes has been abandoned altogether.  He laboured sedulously to cultivate this idea in his speech which, I imagine, was made mainly for the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> and local papers.  It was also plain&mdash;in fact, he almost said it&mdash;that he would be glad to meet his Fianna Fáil colleagues outside the chapel gates and again expound the inaccuracies he has been expounding here.</P>
      <P>I call this motion a reactionary motion because in typical Fine Gael manner it calls for preservation of the <i>status quo,</i> the holding of the line as it was.  Deputy Coogan and others admitted that the type of work done under the old scheme was inferior.  My personal opinion about any scheme aimed at the improvement of roads is that pretty early on you must decide whether you want to improve roads in order to give people access to their houses or merely want to lay on a relief scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell yesterday displayed incredible ignorance of the scheme to the point of referring to it as a relief scheme.  This is Fine Gael mentality. This is the workhouse approach. We want to get rid of that.  It may be all right for Deputy Coogan to go to the chapel gates in iar-Chonnacht and explain that this could be the approach to the people's problems, the workhouse approach, the handout, and debase the people in that manner but what the rearrangement of this scheme aims at doing is to provide a proper service for the people.  I am sure Deputy Coogan and his colleagues would be very disappointed to notice that the amount of money allocated for this scheme has gone up considerably between last year and this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the making of a change as radical as the one we made is almost certain to produce teething troubles such as the county councils are running into at present.  But unlike Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy Lyons and others who spoke to the motion, I feel the county council staffs are perfectly competent to deal <Col N="1679" /> with the problems they have.  Admittedly they have the problem of setting up an organisation of their own in the counties to handle these schemes.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind it, the decentralisation of the handling of these schemes into the counties, is definitely sensible and logical.  It is bound to produce more efficiency and, even more important than that, it will produce better communications between the people who use these laneways and roads and their local county engineer or local county councillor to whom they now make representations about their roads. The old arrangement where the thing was handled from Dublin, where a form was filled in and sent to some anonymous person in a Government office in Dublin, where it reposed, perforce, for a long time because of the great demand there is for these schemes, is now being replaced by a far more intimate one, a system which will involve the applicants themselves in their own business.</P>
      <P>I advocated this from the time I went to the Office of Public Works because I disliked this anonymous centralised method of dealing with rural people's problems.  It might appeal to Fine Gael because it would appear that they like it this way; it would appear that they would like to have their neighbours' work done for them in Dublin, but I and my colleagues feel quite differently about that. We want to get this scheme implemented on the ground by local engineers who know the people, who know their problems and who can be advised by members of county councils who live among the people and who, quite likely, live in roadways such as the ones we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan was under another misapprehension.  Perhaps it was a misapprehension; perhaps it was something else.  Anyway, he got it wrong. He seems to feel that it is no longer possible for people to avail of a full-cost grant.  That is not the case.  There is an interesting difference in counties, or rather there was, when the old scheme was in operation.  County Cavan, in my recollection, was a county that predominantly availed of the rural <Col N="1680" /> improvements scheme.  Cavan, as Deputy Coogan knows, is a county of industrious small farmers.  They are very hard-working people.  It is typical of them that they prefer to contribute to the scheme for the improvement of their own roadways.  The contribution was not large and, small though it was, we reduced it further.  This was the scheme that was by far the most popular in Cavan.  There are other areas of the country with different types of problems where the full-cost grant schemes were done.  There was a great deal wrong with the full-cost grant schemes because of the system of selection of roads.  It was very defective, indeed, because it related to the local unemployment condition.  That in turn gave rise to the repeated repair of roadways in certain areas, although they were not being availed of as roadways very much at all.  However, in the neighbouring townland you might have a road in a really desperate condition on which, because of the regulations governing the selection of roads, it would not be possible to do a full-cost grant scheme.  That was one defect that, plainly, had to be remedied.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy O'Donnell miscalled it a relief scheme.  As I have said before, this is the wrong way to approach this problem of giving the people of rural Ireland decent access to their houses.  We must not approach it in a victorian, Fine Gael, reactionary way like that.  We have to be much more radical about it.  The Fianna Fáil Government, in the last five years or so, introduced a great many new schemes that are of far more value to the people of the west and the country generally in the matter of the improvement of their farms, in the matter of the provision of better advice in the use of their land and a score of other things like that.  That is our technique rather than this workhouse mentality of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Another obvious drawback associated with the old scheme was that it scattered responsibility for roads.  It was quite conceivable that you could have four or five road authorities operating in the same area and it was quite usual to find county councils <Col N="1681" /> putting one secondary road into repair with their engineers and working side by side with them there would be a SESO scheme in progress, with different standards and different staffs&mdash; everything duplicated.  That was, in my opinion, a great waste of skilled staff we cannot afford to waste.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies dwelt upon this matter of staff and the fact that there is a serious difficulty here in the recruitment of engineers.  It is necessary to point out that, this being the case in many Government Departments, when the old scheme was abandoned engineers who worked on those schemes had no difficulty at all in finding employment in other Government services which themselves were very badly off for engineers and all of those engineers who wanted to are still working in the Government and since they are in the Government service, they are working for the people.</P>

Contrary to what Deputy Coogan said, it was a Fianna Fáil Government who introduced this scheme in the first place, in 1933, I think.  Deputy Coogan, as one would expect from a Fine Gael Deputy, said it was a Fine Gael Government who introduced these schemes.  As far as I know, to be historically accurate, there never was a Fine Gael Government.  There was a Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

      <P>In the interests of accuracy, I was pointing out that this scheme, aimed at the improvement of the conditions of the people of rural Ireland, was introduced, maintained and expanded by Fianna Fáil and this most recent change is a further move in that direction in order to prevent the waste of money and waste of staff and the frittering away on inefficient work of hard-earned taxpayers' money.  That is what the scheme is aimed at.  I want to get that into Deputy Flanagan's head because it is important that he should know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable in the Fine Gael contributions in this debate that Fine Gael speakers had no confidence at all in the competence of county council staffs to implement the new scheme.  They say that the people of rural Ireland are being abandoned.  The people of rural Ireland are being abandoned, but they are being abandoned to the engineering staffs of the various county <Col N="1683" /> councils.  I, like Deputy Flanagan, have done my share on county councils and I think I would be pretty accurate in saying that this country is well looked after by the kind of engineering staffs we have in the county councils.  We have devoted people in every county that I know of and, unlike the Fine Gael Party, I am quite confident that the staffs of the various county councils are providing an excellent service for the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, on a point of accuracy, then, I should like to correct a suggestion made yesterday by Deputy O'Donnell.  He suggested that the allocation for Donegal was £33,000.  Of course, if Deputy O'Donnell had any interest in this scheme, he would at least know that the allocation for his county is not £33,000 but £45,000. Practically every contributor from Fine Gael displayed this type of inaccuracy.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the arrears that have accumulated in the matter of applications.  This is true simply because the scheme is so popular and so effective.  There are, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, so many miles and miles of these roads in the country that it would be impossible to do them all at once.  The introduction of the local improvements scheme is an excellent device to provide the best possible means for the people of rural Ireland to get their roads done.  There will be a great many applications, possibly more than the county councils will be able to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We postulate that it is far better for the people to deal directly with the county council staffs, whom they usually know, than to fill up a form and send it off to Dublin to some nameless person, a faceless bureaucrat <Col N="1684" /> in Dublin.  I have experience of those people who are referred to as faceless bureaucrats and I would say of them that they are an excellent body of men, doing an excellent job.  However, the machine in which they were working was not the best possible one that could be devised and the one now being introduced by the Department of Local Government is much better.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why the Minister is not accepting this motion and it is also the reason why I myself would seriously ask the members of the Fine Gael Party to think about this again, to think about the great disservice they are doing to the people of rural Ireland in trying to inhibit, to prevent and stop the provision of an adequate scheme by which this small service road problem can be dealt with.</P>

In my constituency, and to my knowledge, in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency also, some very valuable and useful works have been carried out under the local authorities.

      <P>The position is that the Parliamentary Secretary has put forward a case inferring that it is more convenient for the applicants living on those accommodation roads, rather than completing an application form and sending it to some nameless person in Dublin, to address communications to county councillors or county engineers whom they know.</P>
      <P>During the 25 years or more I have been dealing with the Office of Public Works concerning bog development schemes &mdash; the greater part of my constituency, particularly County Offaly, is comprised of bog&mdash;these schemes have been of immense value to the people in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been my experience that the staff of the Office of Public Works, known as the Special Employment Schemes Office, has always exercised courtesy and efficiency.  That experience <Col N="1686" /> goes for the greater part of the quarter of a century.  The staff dealing with all these bog development schemes were men of practical experience and could not be described as bureaucrats in the sense that the Parliamentary Secretary has described them.  I recall very many years ago one senior inspector, a man named Cody&mdash;may the Lord have mercy on him&mdash;who was in charge of this work and who had a wonderful idea, not based on theory but on fact and on his own experience as to how people lived along such roads and lanes.  He particularly understood the problem of the turf-cutters who had to draw turf by ass and cart in areas where today the motor car can drive into the bog with a trailer and have the turf taken out.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland today, particularly in the midlands, there are vast areas of bog unsuitable for development by Bord na Móna and where there is the slane-cut turf which many local residents find it more economical to save and bring home than the briquettes or turf they can obtain from Bord na Móna.  These people are now being deprived of the benefits of a good scheme which provided a reasonable roadway right up to the turf banks which they were cutting.  Hand in hand with the bog development proposals there were the bog drainage proposals which dealt with the opening of new drains along newly-opened turf banks. This was an advantage to rural Ireland and I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government should decide to deprive the turf cutters in rural Ireland of the facilities which had been there up to now.</P>

      <P>It has nothing to do with that.  I had been speaking about the bog development schemes and the schemes dealing with bog drainage.  Now I am speaking about the number of applications that were not dealt with, and the reason they were not dealt with was that the Government did not want to provide the money.  That is the whole reason, because they were schemes which again were benefiting rural Ireland.  It is like the Local Authorities (Works) Act which was of immense benefit to the people of rural Ireland.  Having disbanded that scheme, they have now decided to make a similar attack on the bog development schemes and the minor employment schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a better scheme.  There are various opinions on that.  The Minister for Local Government has communicated with the local authorities and has given a list of priorities under which these schemes may be carried out.  I know a case on the borders of my own constituency, <Col N="1688" /> convenient to Banagher, which happens to be in County Galway where a new accommodation road is urgently required through callow and bogland.  It is near the banks of the Shannon and quite an amount of hay was lost because the local residents had no road or no suitable bridge by which to get the hay taken out of the local callows.  I made representations to the Galway county engineer in the matter.  I received a very courteous reply, but the latest, I understand, is that the Minister for Local Government has listed the priorities and it may be a considerable time before an urgent proposal such as this one can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>This proposal involved quite a number of people resident in the counties of Galway and Offaly and, in the ordinary way, before the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government got together to tinker with this scheme this proposal would have been disposed of long ago in a satisfactory manner; the grants would have been provided, the engineer would have been notified, and the work would have been going ahead.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, not to be in great haste in dismantling these schemes.  The reason I ask him not to be in haste in doing so is that they are going to make it a little more difficult for the new Government in the New Year to get back to the provision of these facilities of which the people are now being deprived.</P>

May I have a guarantee from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Minister for Local Government is going to issue a circular to the county managers and the county engineers asking them to employ additional men forthwith to carry out the improvement schemes referred to in the motion?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 12 or 18 months ago the Parliamentary Secretary saw fit to abandon ship.  He handed over to the Department of Local Government these various schemes and he now finds himself in the position of having to come in here and defend the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary for making a complete hash of an already bad job.  I have respect for Deputy Gibbons.  I have found him a reasonable man.  He has always treated me with courtesy.  It is not his fault that he inherited a bad situation when he accepted responsibility for the Office of Public Works. At that time questions were being addressed to his predecessor about the grinding to a halt of the rural improvement, bog development and minor relief schemes.  It was denied that there was a credit squeeze.  It was denied that there was no work being done, despite the fact that there was a refusal to send application forms to intending applicants. If that did not spell out that the Special Employment Schemes Office was grinding to a halt I cannot interpret the writing on the wall.  The Parliamentary Secretary succeeded to some extent in convincing certain Members&mdash; I was not one of them&mdash;that this was not the fact and that work was progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then these schemes were transferred to the Department of Local Government and subsequently from the Department of Local Government to the local authorities.  The local authorities have inherited the sad situation that existed when Deputy Gibbons was appointed Parliamentary Secretary. The backlog was foisted on the local authorities.  Had a reasonable amount of money been made available the local authorities could have made some kind of reasonable approach towards finding a solution to the problem, but the Department of Finance refused to provide sufficient money to enable local authorities to <Col N="1697" /> carry out this very urgent work.  It is very urgent because, not alone has it provided a very necessary service in rural Ireland, but it has provided work for the type of person who generally can be described as a casual labourer with the local authority.  This type of person found that, because of this work, he could get 13 stamps and qualify for unemployment benefit for a number of weeks in the year. Between his small-holding or any other type of work he could find locally, this helped him to live.  Now, this branch of county council labour is disappearing.  Many casual labourers appeal to their public representatives to ask the county engineer for God's sake to give them two or three weeks work to help them over a bad time.</P>
    <P>The blame has been put on the county manager or on the county engineer or, indeed, on the local authority in general but, if one goes back, the blame should properly be placed at the door of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy P. Brennan, or, indeed, on Deputy James Gibbons who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I do not know who decided to transfer this to Local Government but it does not do him much credit because it has not solved the situation at all.</P>
    <P>There are 10,000 to 12,000 more unemployed in rural Ireland now than this time last year.  This is not accidental. One reason is less money is being spent this year on schemes such as these than last year or the year before that.  The Parliamentary Secretary was quick to obtain the information that a sum of £250,000 was spent on this work this time last year and that that was double what was spent in 1966-67.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>For rural improvement schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1966-67 we had a credit squeeze.  The Special Employment Schemes Office had virtually closed down and the only work done by them was work which had not been completed in the previous year.  People were asking public representatives about having certain types of accommodation <Col N="1698" /> roads repaired which, heretofore, were repaired free, gratis and for nothing under a minor employment scheme, either because there was a need for it or because unemployment was high in the area.  Only last week, a member of the staff of CIE visited his mother in a rural part of Donegal but could not get his motor car to his mother's home.  He has not been home since Christmas.  When he telephoned me, he did not have to impress upon me the bad condition of the road because I have recently visited his mother's home to ask her to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, which she did.  However, that is a type of road that would have been fixed under a minor employment scheme.  There is no such way in which that road can now be fixed.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the local improvement schemes now operated by the county engineer will fulfil the purpose, but I disagree with that view because the local authorities have not received enough money to clear the backlog which they have inherited. Even if they had taken over the schemes with a clean sheet, the moneys now being provided are most inadequate to meet the demands on local authorities in relation to such schemes.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  To me, that Act is still in operation.  The only reason it cannot be put into commission is that, in 1957, the Fianna Fáil Party considered it necessary to abolish that scheme and refused to vote money for it.  Unless I am wrong, local authorities are still permitted by law to operate any scheme under the Local Authorities (Works) Act provided the money is provided.  I cannot understand the grounds for the move by Deputy J. Gibbons, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, to transfer his responsibility to Deputy P. Brennan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  I cannot see the wisdom of that move nor the reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy J. Gibbons, must agree that that there was machinery available to every local authority in Ireland to implement the Local Authorities (Works) <Col N="1699" /> Act, provided the Government made enough money available for this type of work.  I realise that the Parliamentary Secretary must in public uphold Government policy but, privately, he must agree that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was one of the best schemes we ever had in this country. Coastal erosion, drainage, the clearing of small rivers blocked by trees; indeed, roads which were collapsing; it covered a very wide range of subjects. Nobody has ever told me why that Act has been abolished&mdash;killed&mdash; by not providing enough money.  The Government spend their time in introducing legislation and, having convinced the people that it is good, they proceed to tell them they will make it better.  The fact is that no work is being done.  The amount of work being done this year in Donegal under local improvement schemes &mdash; rural improvement schemes, minor employment schemes and bog development schemes all bunched into one &mdash; is not adequate to meet even a percentage of the backlog which the Donegal County Council has inherited from the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may explain it but he is not satisfying the costings staff of the county engineer that this ten per cent will cover expenses, and well he knows it.  If he is properly advised by the officials in the Special Employment Schemes Office he will be told that ten per cent is much too little to cover the expenses.  It is very difficult for a public representative to say, when a person approaches him about the bad condition of the road leading to that person's home, that it will take only £200 or £300 to fix that road, that these roads had been fixed under the Local Authorities (Works) Act by the inter-Party Government, that that man's neighbour on the other side has had his road repaired under the minor employment scheme, free, gratis and for nothing, and that he now must subscribe.</P>
      <P>Not alone must he subscribe but he must take his place on a waiting list. It makes things very difficult for me. The constituent who comes to me has already gone possibly to the Minister for Local Government or to the Parliamentary Secretary or to some other public representative.  They do not all come to me first.  I can reasonably say that the average person who comes to me has been with some other public representative.  I explain the reasons why I cannot help him and he says: &ldquo;Mr. Harte, you said in the Dáil recently that a bathroom suite was provided for the Minister for Finance, all done up in eggshell pink&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not a well up on colour schemes.  When a constituent comes to my home he wonders why he cannot get £200 or £300 with which to repair his road even when he is prepared to pay 25 per cent of the cost.  I tell him it is impossible because the Donegal County Council have been victims of bad administration in a sorry state of affairs which has resulted in the Parliamentary Secretary now here abdicating from his authority and passing the buck to Deputy Paudge Brennan, now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, who in turn passes it on to the county engineer, who in turn tells the ratepayers: &ldquo;You must shoulder the burden but, even if you do, less money will be spent.&rdquo;  The result is that fewer people are being employed at a time when more money is being spent on Government offices.  It is one of the reasons why a lot of people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; the week before last&mdash;a most emphatic &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Though the Government admittedly had difficulties and the people saw it, when the Government were at least honest and went to the country and asked the people: &ldquo;If you want us, put us back&rdquo;, the people <Col N="1702" /> decided otherwise.  When I last made that statement the Parliamentary Secretary was more vocal than he is now. I wonder why he is not saying: &ldquo;You did the right thing&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having cleared my position, I should now like to dwell on how first offenders, particularly juvenile delinquents, are dealt with. This first offence can be committed in the exuberance of youth.  They are <Col N="1705" /> brought before the court and in many cases much publicity is given to their actions.  Their cases could be dealt with outside the ordinary code of criminal justice.  It should suffice to bring these lads before a peace commissioner and issue a warning.  That should meet the case and ensure the future not alone of that boy but also the family's good name.  We have cases of juvenile delinquents and, indeed, district justices in administering the law should in many cases cease setting themselves up as psychiatrists sermonising and lecturing those unfortunate boys and girls and telling them what they should and should not do.  Such district justices overstep their powers in these matters.  Let them administer the law and give their decisions and let the other matters be dealt with by the parents.</P>
      <P>These matters, particularly with regard to juveniles, could easily be handled by a peace commissioner instead of having the family going to all the trouble, expense and the worry and leave it at that.  I would ask the Minister to give that careful consideration. If boys, particularly, are convicted and sent away for some trivial offence they meet in institutions boys who are much worse than they and, therefore, start off on a career of crime because they have not been enlightened and have not had the benefit of proper parental control.  They are sent to such institutions as Daingean or St. Patrick's and thus enter into an atmosphere that leads them on the road to crime in their adult years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal particularly with the Adoption Board.  This board is doing a tremendous job of work and its members are to be congratulated for the manner in which they delve into all the details before they allow any child to be adopted.  They are doing great work and they should get every encouragement from the Department. All of us in public life, whether we are on local authorities or in Dáil Éireann, know exactly how this Adoption Board works.  We know the trouble that is involved.  We know the inquiries that are made and we know the visits that are paid afterwards to the people who adopt these children. <Col N="1706" /> This must be encouraged and I would ask the Minister to give the Board more and more encouragement, whether financial or otherwise, because of the great work they are doing.  One result of their work is the closing of the old reformatory schools and the orphanages where young boys were treated as if they were scum with no intelligence and who were sent out late in life as third&mdash;or fourth-class citizens with the stamp of the reformatory written all over them.  The Adoption Board have done something to wipe out the stigma of the orphanage and I would ask the Minister to continue to help in every way the work of the Adoption Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of granting bail at every hand's turn to professional criminals is a matter that deserves serious consideration and I congratulate the Minister on what he is doing in this respect.  There is the old habitual offender; up he goes, out on bail and away he goes on his career of crime, back again, in and out and in most of these cases, like the recurring decimal, every day he is in and out of prison.  Some of them would prefer to be habitually boarded in prison than living in society as we all have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="1707" /> will allow discussion on the Criminal Justice Bill.  Let us impress on him that as far as we in the Labour Party are concerned we oppose every clause and sentence in it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to come to the question of prisons generally and the treatment of the criminal be he an old lag or a young criminal.  The position in regard to criminals should be tackled more from an educational viewpoint.  There is no use sending a fellow into jail, giving him a shovel, a pickaxe or a whitewash brush and telling him to scrub the floor, whitewash the wall or paint the windows and so on.  In Portlaoise they have to do farming work.  That is not the solution.  Psychiatric treatment and classes should be arranged within the prison walls.  Criminals, particularly those who are in for the first time, can be rehabilitated by such means.  That encouragement should be given to them so that, when they emerge from the prison gate, they can walk into society and be accepted again as ordinary law-abiding citizens.  Unfortunately, that is not the case at present.  An indelible brand is imprinted all over them through no fault of their own maybe. It is a disease that can be cured; and psychiatric lessons should be part and parcel of prison life.</P>
    <P>Many of these cases are due to alcoholism. I know that the Minister would get the full co-operation of that noble body, Alcoholics Anonymous, in this matter.  They would be only too delighted to go into prisons and lecture to the prisoners on the disease which has overcome them and which perhaps has been the cause of putting them inside prison walls.  There is no use in giving a fellow two years in jail and branding him for the rest of his life as a criminal.  Most of them suffer from diseases which should be treated as diseases.  Treatment with a whitewash brush, a shovel or a pickaxe is not the correct treatment.  That is only giving those people time to communicate and converse with criminals worse than themselves.  I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of this if he is going to reform the law and if he is going to treat this matter in the serious manner <Col N="1708" /> in which it should be treated but was not treated in the past.  I speak as a layman who mixes with people.  I am not talking about the mechanics of the Minister's Department.  They mean nothing to me.  That is a matter for lawyers.  Let them battle it out; I am not interested in them.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to what I regard as the most important point, and that is the Malicious Injuries Act.  I speak again from experience, without any technical or legal knowledge.  In this Malicious Injuries Act you have the local authority saddled with responsibility for something done by somebody outside the jurisdiction of that local authority.  It may be done by a juvenile or man from outside the borough or the area in which the act is committed and thousands and thousands of pounds can be involved. It is a battle then between the local authority and the insurance company. It goes to the law, and there are you. The man who committed the offence could be from Athens.  It is in the news at the present time and that is why I mention it.  He could be from anywhere coming into our city and causing damage to the extent of thousands of pounds. Then the local authority is saddled with compensation is most of these cases. The ratepayers have to put their hands into their pockets and pay for something for which they have no responsibility. I have raised this at local authority level and protested to the Department about it because of our experiences in Limerick.  I hope the Minister will agree that the ratepayers should not be saddled with this expense. This is a matter of great importance. We have in Limerick many experiences of this kind.  I speak from experience, having served over 20 years on the local authority.</P>
    <P>Having said what I said about the district justices and their lectures, I want to impress on the Minister: let them administer the law and stop.  I want to come now to another matter, that is, the question of the delay in the Land Registry Office.  I do not know what they are doing over there in Chancery Street.  I know I have a pain in my finger from writing letters <Col N="1709" /> to them&mdash;folio this and folio that and when is it going to be done.  Most of my complaints are coming from the legal profession in Limerick.  They ask me: Will you get on to the Land Registry?  Will you get this done and will you get that done?  I do not know for the life of me what they are doing over there and who is there to do anything. It takes months and months, particularly in the mapping section. Whether that is because they are understaffed or inept or dilatory, I do not know; but I know from experience that the delays caused there are absolutely unnecessary.  The Commission set up to price a gallon of milk took about six years to put a price on the production of a gallon of milk.  The Commission set up on education took about eight years to tell us something we all knew before they started.  But I cannot for the life of me understand what the delay is over there is Chancery Street.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he has to use the whip, for God's sake use it and do not have unfortunate people waiting, particularly people who intend to marry and are looking for a map of an area or this, that or the other thing to build a house.  The loans are granted on the production of this document and the grants are made on the production of that document&mdash;and these documents are held up for months on end. I am not the only one who has put this point to the Minister.  It is not a matter confined to a particular constituency; it concerns the whole country and it must be remedied one way or another. If they are understaffed, give them staff.  Let us have efficiency and let those people who want to marry and build a house go to work, because by their building a house other people are being provided with work.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by congratulating the Minister on the introduction of the portable machines the Gardaí are now using.</P>

      <P>They are certainly a great acquisition.  Most important of all, they are a great time-saver.  Men can be on the spot and can be directed to a particular place within seconds of any particular happening.  It was a <Col N="1710" /> great idea and I hope it will spread to other areas.  We have had experience of it in Limerick and we were all very happy at its introduction.</P>
      <P>I urge on the Minister the importance of satisfying the people who uphold the law, the men who work a 24-hour day, our Gardaí.  If they are not satisfied&mdash;I must congratulate them on their speedy detection of crime; as the Minister said in his speech, our statistics of crime detection compare more than favourably with other European countries&mdash;we shall be killing the goose.  These people must be satisfied and happy in their work.  They must be given decent conditions of work.  They have not got them, particularly in Limerick.  I ask the Minister to send any of his inspectors to any Garda station in County Limerick to see the conditions in them, particularly their allowance of fuel for the year.  It would not keep them going for two months. They get the cheapest available fuel &mdash;any old stuff is thrown into the Garda station&mdash;because it is given by tender.  I know it from my experience in my constituency.</P>
      <P>If these premises were subject to inspection by the local authority, we in Limerick would condemn them out of hand.  For instance, we condemned the Garda station in William Street in Limerick 20 years ago as being dangerous but nothing has been done since.  Wherever he gets the money to provide these men with decent offices, a decent place in which to work, the Minister should do it speedily even as a tribute to the hard and great work they are doing in the national interest.</P>

I have heard solicitors from the other side say their experiences have been different.  Admittedly, they have more contact with land registry than I but that has been my experience.</P>
      <P>On the question of school attendance. I mention it for the purpose of getting information from the Minister. I should like to know how many cases under the School Attendance Act came before the courts in the last 12 months.  My impression is that the School Attendance Act is in a semi-lapsed condition.  This has happened for a number of reasons.  First of all, I admit that today, with the emphasis on education in all its branches, the public and the parents are conscious of the need for education.  It is, therefore, quite possible that we have advanced&mdash;I know we have&mdash;in school attendance and that there would not normally be as many cases as there were some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I still have the feeling that the School Attendance Act is not being used effectively.  I am not blaming the authorities for it.  It is very discouraging for Gardaí to bring such cases before the courts and to find that they are dismissed summarily without any reference to the number of times the particular cases have come to the courts and without any reference to the circumstances.  It is seldom that any disciplinary action is taken at all.  In this respect I must again express <Col N="1712" /> objection to the amendment of the Act last year or the year before, particularly to the stipulation that school-going children can be brought to court.  I objected to it at the time the Bill was being debated.  I think it is bad legislation and that it should be amended because it is the duty of the parents and when there is failure in that duty it is the parents who should be brought to court and not the children.</P>
    <P>As I have said, not enough action is being taken mainly because the Gardaí find it most discouraging, having gone to all the trouble, firstly, of visiting parents and giving them warnings and then going back later to find the warnings have not been heeded, and then as a last resort bringing the cases into court where very little is done about them.  It is necessary we should have in operation a School Attendance Act which will give results. We are not getting results now.</P>
    <P>The second matter I wish to mention is the operation of the Road Traffic Act, again in the same context &mdash;first of all the difficulties Gardaí have in finding the culprits, those who offend on the public highways, those who cause injury and death.  There is difficulty in finding those responsible for accidents.  We see in the newspapers accounts of accidents of a serious nature due to gross negligence and carelessness on the part of motorists and others.  We read, however, that in the courts the sentences imposed make us rub our eyes, have another look at the paper and say to ourselves: &ldquo;Surely in a case like this the person should not have got off scot-free or with such a light penalty.&rdquo;  At the moment some of the accidents on our public highways are a disgrace to the motoring public.  Most of them are caused through carelessness and thoughtlessness and a fair number are caused by an excessive use of alcohol. I know it is not the duty of the Minister to interfere with the district justices but, as it is a serious matter, it is no harm to say here what we think and what we read in regard to these cases.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to mention is the recent controversy in regard to <Col N="1713" /> licensing of guesthouses for the consumption of alcohol.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I will not go any further with that.  The next matter I want to mention is the worldwide wave of protest marches and demonstrations experienced in all democratic countries and recently in what used to be regarded as totalitarian countries.  I agree that this is a good healthy sign of democracy.  Any group or organisation should have the right to have orderly marches, protests, peaceful demonstrations in support of their own cause or of any cause which they may adopt.  This is democracy at its best.  It is the safety valve which allows the particular problem of a group to be brought to the notice of the public and the press and provides an opportunity for the public generally to learn what that group has to say. It is, however, a feature of such marches that while the promoters are genuine and are correct in staging a public protest, march or demonstration for the purpose of airing their grievances, the marches are used by others who have ulterior motives.  They are used by hooligans who want to do damage; they are used by looters who want to cash in on the disturbance which is caused.  It is a pity that this is happening.  Police authorities in every country in the world are finding it difficult to cope with the extraneous elements which follow in the wake of genuine protesters or marchers.  This is something that is reaching this country now.  It would be a pity if the good name of our Gardaí were affected by <Col N="1714" /> their dealing with the undesirable elements in these protest marches.  It would be a bad thing if the good name of the organisation staging the protest should be lost because of actions of which they are the nucleus, and unwilling nucleus at that.</P>
      <P>This is a problem and the Minister should have the wholehearted support of all the Members of the House in efforts which he may have to take to deal with this sort of thing.  If the Gardaí go out against undesirable elements in these events it should not be said that they are against the promoters or against those who have very good reason, indeed, to march and to protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister will take it amiss from me if I describe the speech that he made in introducing this Estimate yesterday as a humdrum statement. When we look back upon the stormy debates and the frequently bitter discussions that we had in this House not so many years ago on the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Justice it is a source of public comfort that we can have a humdrum speech on the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Justice which, as Deputy Burke pointed out yesterday, is responsible for the maintenance of law and order, and even a humdrum debate on that Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very proud of my knowledge of ancient Roman history but when I came into this House on the first day of this session of the Dáil, the first thing I noticed was that the protective grille had been removed from the visitors' gallery.  My mind went back to some time ago when an old friend of mine and I used to walk up by Ship Street in order to avoid the depredations of the Black and Tans here in Dublin.  On the way home from court we passed Ship Street Barracks. There are steps going up from Ship Street into the Castle.  When the gates were closed, the Black and Tans were in operation or there was some disturbance in the city and, when they were open, things were quiet.  My friend recalled that that was like the Temple of Janus.  The Temple of Janus had <Col N="1715" /> its gates open when the city was peaceful and the country was free from conflict.  When the gates were closed, there was disturbance in the city.  The removal of the protective grille can be taken as an indication to the public that the country as a whole is peaceful and free from conflict.  May I recall what Deputy MacEntee said here, mostly by way of interruption, the other day during Question Time when he referred to the ill-advised passage of the Republic of Ireland Act?  It would not be unhelpful to suggest to Deputy MacEntee that in his less provocative mood he might think a little longer and, perhaps, come to the conclusion that the removal of that grille was in some way at least due to the passage of that legislation by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins when he was replying to the Minister paid a well deserved tribute and expressed goodwill to him in his new office.  That recalls to me the fact that I think I ought to put on record here, that apparently, there has been a change, a welcome change, of policy in regard to the appointment of the Commissioner of the Garda.  I should also like to place on record my own appreciation of the fact that it now appears to be the policy of this Government, and I hope it will long continue to be the policy of this or any other Government that succeed it, that the high officers of the Garda should be recruited exclusively from the members of the Garda.  I cast no reflection on the two highly-distinguished persons who occupied the position of commissioner of the Garda for a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is a great incentive to young, ambitious men in the Garda Síochána to know that they have the option, by hard work, by their own ability and with a little bit of luck, of gaining the highest commissioned post in the force. It is proper policy that that should be adopted.  It is better for the Garda and for the country.  It gives them the chance of reaching, through their own efforts, high positions.  It enables the system of promotions to work more rapidly and prevents the blockage of <Col N="1716" /> promotions which took place in the force when there was not this movement. It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that a change has been made and I hope it will continue in the future to be as it is now.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the Garda logically leads me to mention the very welcome change referred to by the Minister in his speech, that is, the relieving of Gardaí of duties in connection with the parking of motor cars.  The Minister gave disturbing statistics of the increase of crime here.  As everybody knows, there are a lot of burglaries in the city and suburbs.  It is degrading for the Gardaí to be placing tickets on cars while those crimes are being committed and the criminals are operating at their leisure.  Duties in connection with parking offences requires no intelligence. All the Garda has to do is to put a sticker on the windscreen of a car and make a note in his book. That is a waste of time and public money.  It is, therefore, very welcome to me, and I am sure to the public, to find that the Gardaí are now being released from these duties, duties which must be soul destroying for them and a cause of annoyance to the public.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a tendency on the part of the public to be critical of the Garda, to be over anxious to find fault with them&mdash;the root cause of all this antagonism towards the Gardaí at present is the manner in which duties relating to traffic offences are handled by the Gardaí.  It is to be deplored that Gardaí feel they have a right to lecture the owners of motor cars.  A commissioner stated that he had regarded it as his function and duty to impress on young Gardaí coming out that courtesy and politeness to the public are absolutely essential.  When Gardaí give lectures like this there is no comeback on the part of the offender&mdash;or, if there is, it is paid for in the courts.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine, whom I know to be a very law-abiding citizen, was trying to offer an explanation to a Garda on one occasion but the Garda said: &ldquo;Look here, my boy, if you give me any more guff I will take you down to a place where my word will be taken against yours&rdquo;.  That is the <Col N="1717" /> sort of thing which causes annoyance to the public and it is, therefore, a good thing that the Gardaí are to be taken off traffic offences.</P>
    <P>The statistics given by the Minister for the increase in crime are somewhat alarming.  But in spite of that alarming increase and in spite of the fact that there is so much world unrest, I think we can take comfort from the fact that we are the most law-abiding people in the world today.  That is a rather high-sounding phrase, but when one looks at all the unrest in the world I think I am justified in saying this. On British television the other night I heard a young man say that he was looking forward with pleasure to a demonstration which he said was only the beginning of the revolution in England.  We can take comfort, too, from the fact that our people have grown up in this country.  They have become more politically educated and more politically mature.  We are at present as free as possible from the terribly disturbing symptoms afflicting the USA and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the programme of law reform.  As I have said before, I have faith and confidence in and respect for the work being done by the Law Reform Committee. They are doing a very difficult job extremely well, as is shown in many of the law reform measures that have come before the Oireachtas.  Of course, they cannot please everybody. They do not even please me, although I am sympathetic to their work and I appreciate the efforts they are making to bring law reform up to date and into line with modern conditions. They are officials doing a job but they sometimes go too far in their zeal for reform of the law.  They sometimes look too far into the Continental system.  They forget we have our own system here fashioned for our own needs and that we do not want too much of the Continental code.  It is the Minister's responsibility when these people put forward their very well thought out suggestions for law reform, to cull from those suggestions &mdash;some of which may arise from zeal or perhaps too much learning or too much research into other systems&mdash;<Col N="1718" /> those which are suitable and useful for our own country and circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the Labour benches spoke about what the Minister has said in regard to bringing in legislation on malicious injuries.  From time to time views change and vary.  On strict theory the malicious injuries code was a British system introduced into this country in order to penalise the ordinary natives of the country, because the landowners of that time thought they were not getting a fair deal from some of the so-called peasants of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the basis of the malicious injuries code.  On the other hand, if there are people going around maliciously destroying property, then there is some duty on the public to help the Garda in their investigations of these matters and the prosecution of them, if possible.  To that extent there is a justification for the malicious injuries code.  However, I do not want to discuss the matter.  It is a matter which is neither black nor white.  There are views on both sides.  A relation of mine was walking down Grafton Street some time ago and he saw a gentleman taking up a large implement and throwing it through a plateglass window in one of the Grafton Street shops.  It was a somewhat difficult situation for him, and the gentleman who did it turned round and said to him: &ldquo;Do you want to make an issue of it?&rdquo; My relation said he did not.  Of course, if there was neither insurance nor the malicious injuries code, the position would be somewhat difficult.</P>
    <P>On the other matters of law reform the Minister has given some indication of what he intends to do.  I have two suggestions which are not very important, because these things are working all right at the moment, but it is proper that the law should be settled straight away.  It has recently been held by Mr. Justice Kenny that it is no longer necessary in spite of the statute, to get the fiat of the Attorney General to sue a Minister.  That is the decision of the High Court.  However, it is a matter that may at some stage be brought higher and possibly be reversed or it may even be affirmed. There is a condition of uncertainty about it at the moment, coupled with <Col N="1719" /> the fact that we still have the archaic British law in this country based upon and proceeding from the old legal British maxim that the King can do no wrong.  An ordinary citizen cannot yet sue a Minister of State or any of his officials because of that principle, and because also of the principle that a civil servant or officer of the State is not the servant of the Minister, the Minister cannot be liable.  That is gone in England for some years, and it is time it should be reversed here.  It is illogical that any citizen should not be entitled to sue any Minister just the same as he can sue any other citizen.  It is based upon a principle entirely outworn and one deriving its origin from the old maxim to which I referred: The King can do no wrong.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I should like to refer is that mentioned by Deputy Coughlan of the Labour Party, the question of bail.  The Minister indicated that he intends to bring in what I think is a rather restrictive provision in connection with bail overruling, in effect, the decision of the Supreme Court.  I did not anticipate any discussion on that, but again because it was mentioned I should like to issue one note of warning, that what the Minister says should be further considered.</P>
    <P>The decision which I think brought the Minister to the point of introducing this legislation was a decision of the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court, under the Constitution, is the guardian of the liberty of the citizens of this country and there should be profound respect for any decisions of our Supreme Court, and decisions springing from principles enshrined in the Constitution should not be lightly set aside, even though there may be, as the Minister indicated in the few passages in which he dealt with this matter in his speech, a good case for setting it aside.</P>
    <P>In individual circumstances he can make a case.  Deputy Coughlan made a case about 85 offences being committed by a person when he was on bail.  That might happen.  There may be instances where it would be wrong to have a man out on bail, but the general principle should be the over-riding consideration in the Minister's <Col N="1720" /> mind.  I would ask the Minister, before he introduces this Bill, at least to have the Supreme Court decisions further examined and to give it very much more respect that apparently it is going to get in this Bill that is indicated.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred, if only indirectly, to his intention of increasing the jurisdiction of the district court and the circuit court.  Nobody will object to a reasonable increase in jurisdiction in both courts but, once again, I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully the danger of going too far.  An action involving £500 or £600 is a big action for a citizen of this country, even taking the fall in the value of money into account.  The district court is supposed to be the people's court and over the years tributes have been paid to the district justices for the manner in which this court has operated since it was founded in 1923.  But it must be remembered, in considering the extent to which increased jurisdiction should be given, that the district justices are operating under very difficult conditions. If big cases are brought before them there are no facilities for looking up the law or for having legal matters properly argued.  The same applies to the circuit court.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to go to the High Court with important cases.  It must be remembered, as far as the individuals concerned in a case, that there is no other case in the whole world, in the whole judicial system in this country or anywhere else, that is of equal importance to that case.  Every citizen should have the opportunity of going to the High Court.  The efforts that have been made in recent years to minimise the costs in the circuit court and the district court have been largely futile.  People need not think that by increasing the jurisdiction of the circuit court or the district court they are going to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>It is not only the legal costs, the costs of my own profession or of the solicitors' profession which are involved. There are also the costs involved in witnesses' expenses, in particular, the expenses of professional witnesses such as engineers, doctors, <Col N="1721" /> photographers and all the rest.  These expenses far outweigh those of the legal profession.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider carefully this question of increasing the jurisdiction of these courts and not to overdo it.  A reasonable increase is not merely justified but is necessary.  By letting people go to the district court you may save expense but you may also do grave injustice.  It was once said that the function of the inferior magistrate was to be quick, courteous and generally wrong.  Well, now, do not let him go loose too much on an extended jurisdiction on that principle.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the question of free legal aid.  I am not really acting as an advocate for either my own profession or the solicitors' profession in this matter but I think I am entitled first of all on behalf of my own profession to pay tribute to the Minister that in his introductory speech there is not even an undertone much less a tone or a suggestion of menace to my profession or to the solicitors' profession. We have had enough of that for some years and I am glad that there was not even an undertone of it in the Minister's speech yesterday.  The free legal aid scheme was introduced not long ago and members of my own profession and of the solicitors' profession felt it a matter of duty, although many of them hated doing criminal work, to put their names on the panel.  It was not in order to get the miserable fees that they did this but to do the duty asked of them in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The system has not been applied to the district courts and I think it is necessary that it should be.  The Minister should carefully consider introducing the system for the proper kind of cases in the district court.  We have had the case of a man whose solicitor appeared in a district court five times for a preliminary investigation but after five adjournments the district justice in the end refused informations. If the case had gone to a higher court the solicitor would have got his fees but he does not get them in the district court.  The Minister should reconsider all that.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the Department of Finance will object&mdash;I remember hearing <Col N="1722" /> an official of that Department being described as a walking negative, meaning that he said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to everything&mdash; and no doubt they will say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this but a case should be made for my profession and the solicitors' profession in regard to a certain type of case which occupies a considerable time in the courts, namely the running down case. Both solicitors and barristers, by the method they adopt and through custom which has grown up over the years, are saving the taxpayer money in legal aid by the system of having two seniors and a junior in these running-down cases.  They are really doing a social work which is unpaid.  In many cases you know that you have not got a chance of winning.  You go into court knowing that you are going to get nothing out of it.  In England they pay for this legal aid but we are doing the job for nothing.  The Minister should inform the Department of Finance that they should pay for this type of work for the right type of case and, in addition, they should increase the miserable fees which are at present paid to those whose names are on the panel in the Circuit Court and in the Central Criminal Court.  Nobody wants these cases&mdash;personally I would not touch them&mdash;but people put their names down purely as a matter of duty and they are quite perturbed when they are asked to take on a case and take it on for a miserable fee.</P>
    <P>I am not going to speak about this famous Criminal Justice Bill which is causing so much trouble except to refer to one matter in regard to criminal justice procedure.  The first thing which should be done is to get rid of that awful Green Street building.  A prisoner is supposed to be innocent until he has been found guilty by a jury but if you go into Green Street for a criminal case you find that you could almost cut the atmosphere it is so heavily charged against the prisoner.  It is a little better now than it used to be.  This is something which the Minister should consider. If it requires legislation, then it should be put into this Bill instead of some of the clauses which are in it.</P>
    <P>It is completely absurd to have an accused person stuck up in the dock. Anybody who is familiar with Green Street knows the awful passageway <Col N="1723" /> that lies behind the dock.  One is also familiar with the tones of menace used by the county registrars.  There was one such man, since dead, who was particularly menacing when he read out the charge: &ldquo;You, so-and-so, are charged that you did in the County of Dublin, so-and-so&rdquo; and so on and when I was up there I always felt I was the prisoner in the dock.  The prisoner in the dock has to say &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not Guilty&rdquo;.  His counsel cannot say that for him.  A small reform which could be carried out would be to make it possible, if a prisoner is professionally represented, for his counsel to answer for him.  This procedure comes to us from the British procedure when there was some distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour.  As I say, the professional man should be entitled to plead for his client instead of having all this rumpus read out, putting the prisoner in charge of the jury, and so on.  I notice that one of the circuit court judges made some observations recently on the fact that he had no dock.  I understand that one of the committees which is advising the Minister has recommended that the dock should be taken away and the Minister said that he has accepted that recommendation.  I hope he has.</P>
    <P>Another extraordinary thing is that in the course of an ordinary civil case your client is behind you and so is your solicitor.  If you are appearing for an accused person in any court he is a mile away, surrounded by bars. You cannot get to your client to question him about some point raised by the prosecution.  You may see a solicitor running up to him and surreptitiously passing him a note.  The dock should be done away with and the accused person should be brought nearer to his professional representatives.</P>
    <P>I hope that the press will not add me to their growing list of those whom they say are casting aspersions on them but I think I am entitled to object to the way newspapers always refer to the prisoner or accused person.  He is never &ldquo;Mr. Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. Robinson&rdquo;. He is always &ldquo;Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Robinson&rdquo;. Does that not clearly show that far from assuming that the person is <Col N="1724" /> innocent he is guilty because he is &ldquo;Jones&rdquo;?  Then you have the awful way in which some judges on passing sentence say &ldquo;Take him away&rdquo; as if he were a piece of dirt.  At least let the newspapers wait until after an accused person has been convicted before they refer to him as &ldquo;Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Robinson&rdquo;.  At least an accused person is entitled not to be regarded through the instrumentality of the press as a man already found guilty.  That is a small point.</P>
    <P>These are some small matters which the Minister might consider in connection with his law reforms.  That is all I wish to speak about at the moment and I should like to wind up by saying that we have problems in this country but they are not anything like what they are for the Home Secretary in England or the police there. We are entitled to pay this tribute to our own people for that condition. They have grown in political education, especially as they showed recently in their voting in the referendum, and they have a more fundamental respect for the law than even the British people had in years gone by.</P>
    <P>That, I think, should be fostered by the Minister.  The relation between the Gardaí and the public should never be allowed to deteriorate.  At the same time, there should be nothing like the persecution of motorists with parking tickets, and all the rest of it, because from these beginnings stems antagonism ultimately towards the Gardaí. We have gone through a good deal but we have now a country with which, I think, we are reasonably entitled to be satisfied.  We can take comfort in the degree of peace and law and order that we have today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that a policeman's lot is not a happy one, but I think the job of the Minister for Justice in any country in the world today is not a happy one because, all over the world, in both democratic and totalitarian societies there is a challenge to the Establishment.  In a democracy it is recognised that people have a right and a duty to protest, and protest publicly, if they so desire.  In totalitarian countries protesters are dealt with in a way we would not tolerate <Col N="1725" /> here.  Every speaker so far has praised the Gardaí for their conduct generally. I join with previous speakers in urging the Minister, though I do not think there is any need to urge him, to deal generously with the Gardaí from the point of view of both salaries and conditions. I know the Minister appreciates the position even more so than I do and will act accordingly.</P>
      <P>While there is a tendency to praise the Gardaí there is also a tendency to leave it to them to preserve law and order without very much help from the public as a whole.  Earlier in the year the members of the municipal council were subjected at each meeting of the council to threats and, indeed, to actual physical assault.  Had it not been for the Gardaí some of them would have suffered grievous injury.  On one occasion some protesters broke into the meeting and assaulted one of our members.  They were ejected by the Gardaí.  They resisted.  Now I thought the Gardaí were restrained in their conduct to the point of being almost foolish.  Members of the press and members of Dublin Corporation saw the way in which the Gardaí removed these people, but the very next day we had the usual cry about police brutality. This is an imported catchcry.  The worrying feature is that we have those in our community joining in protest marches who really should know better. Their aims may be quite worthy.  In the housing march there were people who did not have proper houses, but they were used by another element, an element which did not care whether they got houses or not, for their own nefarious purposes.  They saw an opportunity of creating trouble and strife.  We should, I think, have regard to the intentions of these troublemakers who lead protest marches before deciding to support them.  When that is done we can really regard ourselves as a mature people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello said we are one of the most law-abiding peoples in the world.  I suppose compared with other countries&mdash;the United States, Britain, France&mdash;we are law-abiding.  However, unless the people give their full co-operation to the Gardaí, that proud boast could easily be negatived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister <Col N="1726" /> to set up a commission to inquire into the conditions and salaries of the Gardaí.  I look forward to a satisfactory finding by the commission.  A word of thanks is due to the chairman and members of the Commission for devoting their time, energy and talents to seeking to bring about a satisfactory solution to the difficulties that exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the censorship of films.  He gave some details. Twenty years ago censorship ensured that no films would be shown which might adversely affect youth.  Things have changed now.  Even if films for public showing in cinemas are censored, there is no censorship where television is concerned, apart from that on the home station.  Some day someone may discover what effect and influence television viewing is having on youth.  Possibly youth does not look very much at television; youth is more inclined to frequent the dance-hall or watch the pop group.  The task of the Minister in trying to achieve a proper standard of entertainment is a hard one.  We cannot, of course, wrap ourselves in cottonwool.  Neither can we keep out outside influences.  We must face the fact that the day when we could exclude such influences is gone and the only thing we can do then is to gear our society to meet the new challenge.</P>
    <P>The censorship of books has been debated here on several occasions. Today, there is what is regarded as a more liberal approach and, if one criticises certain books, one immediately gets letters of protest, advising one not to be narrowminded.  Now I think books are far more dangerous than television viewing because the printed word can leave a much more indelible impression than the fleeting scene on some television or cinema screen.  I criticise the Minister's predecessor for lifting the prohibition on certain books.  I have since read some of the books and I have not changed my mind about them.  Looking at those countries in which censorship is either non-existent or negligible one finds that crime statistics are very high.  One also finds that the people are not really a happy people fundamentally.  I urge the Minister to give the lifting of a <Col N="1727" /> prohibition order on any book very deep thought before he takes action.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to malicious damage.  As Deputy Costello said, there are various views on this.  The ratepayers have to pay for malicious damage.  Surely there should be some way of making the perpetrators of this damage pay for the damage.  There is a problem; one of the biggest fires in this city was caused by a person who was sentenced for the offence but who could not pay one penny towards the damage he did.  Perhaps society owes him a debt because of his upbringing; I do not know.  But that gives little comfort to those who must foot the bill by way of increased rates.</P>
    <P>The prison service is also a responsibility of the Minister.  Each year, I mention the prison officers because I regard these men and women as every bit as important, in our scheme of things, as the Gardaí.  I do not think we can pay them well enough or give them conditions good enough in view of the very difficult task they have to do.  The crime rate statistics show that their work will not decrease.  I should like to see this service well paid and well cared for.  We must at all times get people for it who are dedicated to duty.  Unless we get the right person in the prison service, more harm than good will be done.  It will be much easier for the prisoner if the right type of prison officer is there: our whole attitude should be towards rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>In concluding, might I ask the Minister to bear in mind the wonderful reputation which the Garda Rowing Club have achieved.  Through their sportsmanship and ability, they have brought a new image of the Garda to many people.  If there is such a thing as leave for these men, I hope the Minister will be very generous about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The words I shall use at the beginning of this speech are borrowed from the Minister.  Really, they belong to another debate which will probably be one of the most outspoken and long drawn-out debates ever in this House.  I refer to the Criminal Justice Bill, which the Minister mentioned when moving his Estimate. <Col N="1728" /> I hope he will live up to the promise he gave that, when the Bill came to be discussed in this House, he would dispel misconception.  Unless the Minister wishes for as big a shock as he got from the results on the two referendum Bills, he will dispel misconceptions in respect of the Criminal Justice Bill by getting his Department to work as fast as they can to produce the Minister's amendments to the Bill before it ever comes into this House. That is merely a passing remark, as was the remark of the Minister.  However, it is no harm that he and people such as Deputy Cunningham should know the position.  Deputy Cunningham has said he thinks people should have a right to demonstrate and to march &mdash; evidently without asking the permission of the local Garda officers.  It is well that such people should be warned of the attitude towards this Bill, on its face value, even of Fianna Fáil back-benchers and people outside this House.</P>
      <P>I join in the tributes to the Garda. There is no need to traverse the same ground as has already been covered by speakers from all sides of the House except to say that the tributes are richly deserved.  I add my voice to the pleas from all parts of the House to improve the lot of our Gardaí.  Their lot is not a happy one at the moment and they deserve better.  So, indeed, do the Garda pensioners to whom reference was made so often in this debate. I do not repeat the reasons, as they have already been given by many speakers, but I mention the matter again so that the Minister will know the feeling of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serving Gardaí deserve the fullest support and co-operation of the Irish people.  There is a new spirit of lawlessness in this country.  By that, I do not mean an increase in crime but the sort of hooliganism that is being justified all over the country and, indeed, all over the world.  It appears quite right and proper that anybody with any sort of grievance may squat, singly or in numbers, on the public highway, and obstruct the doctor going to an urgent case or the priest taking the Last Sacraments to some person or even the young Romeo who is going to meet his young Juliet, irrespective of the rights of other citizens.  The Garda <Col N="1729" /> will have to show a great deal of patience and forbearance in the face of that sort of approach to public problems. Recently, in Dublin, some protest marchers, who started off to go to a certain Embassy, threw bricks through the windows of shops and hotels and other places on the way back.  That is not patriotism.  That is not the exercise of civil rights.  It is hooliganism.</P>
    <P>Another sorry aspect of all this was underlined in my constituency.  The Cork Fire Brigade Chief had to indicate that in Cork last year the number of false alarms was 159&mdash;a 100 per cent increase on the previous year. The grim lesson to be learned there is that in 1956 only six false alarms were dealt with in Cork.  It indicates the difficult world ahead of the young Garda when he comes out of Templemore. I am glad to note that the Minister intends to introduce legislation to encourage the public to co-operate with the Garda in the sure knowledge that, if they are injured while doing so, they have absolute indemnity from the State.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister had been a little more explicit about his intentions as regards the malicious injuries code. He said legislation is at present being prepared to consolidate, amend and reform the law of compensation for malicious injuries.  We have heard that before in this House.  We have been told for a number of years that this will happen.  The matter has been quite a burning problem for years. One would think the Minister would give some indication of the manner in which he intends to amend or reform the law on malicious injuries.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to the subject of the Garda Síochána for a moment to refer to a very worthy section of that Force.  There is a determined effort to make the words &ldquo;Special Branch&rdquo; a dirty word.  This new technique is being used by those who have subversive leanings.  The Government is &ldquo;the Establishment&rdquo;.  Similarly, the Bishops are not &ldquo;the Hierarchy&rdquo;; they, too, are &ldquo;the Establishment&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;Special Branch&rdquo; is referred to in a tone of voice which conveys that those whom the Special Branch investigates <Col N="1730" /> are being persecuted; it is equated with police brutality when the police try to stop a noisesome mob.  The most recent references to this description quite interest and intrigue me.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 22nd October, 1968, we read that on Sunday, 21st October, 1968, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, a theatrical producer, claimed that there are people in Telefís Éireann who are being persecuted by the Special Branch.  He went on to say he could name names and the people should be present but they were so fed up with the whole thing that they would not bother their backsides being there.</P>
    <P>This intrigues me.  It is something with which the Minister should deal because if it is true that the Special Branch are investigating some of those who are active in RTE it strikes me that there are some elements in RTE whose activities, either within or without RTE, call for investigation.  I do not believe that we have a Special Branch which goes around investigating people whose activities do not call for investigation.  I believe if there are people working in the centre of our mass medium of communication whose activities call for investigation by the Special Branch it is a matter so serious that the Minister should bring it to the notice of the House.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Mr. Jim Fitzgerald in a twisted sort of way exonerates the newsroom people in RTE.  Of these he says &mdash; I gather he does not intend the reference to be complimentary &mdash; that they are all old-fashioned Catholics who can be frightened.  He says political influence is most easily executed through religion and it is the old type of religious people who are accustomed to an authoritarian state who are most easily influenced.</P>
    <P>There are many good citizens in RTE and I would question the <i>bona fides</i> of Mr. Jim Fitzgerald who complains about people in RTE being persecuted by the Special Branch.  I deprecate the use of the word &ldquo;persecute&rdquo; in relation to the activities of the Special Branch.  They are there for the comfort and care of the State and those who come under their surveillance, even though they may say they are being persecuted, no doubt deserve what they get.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> I return briefly to the Minister's forecast of legislation in respect of malicious injuries.  I have said already that he should have been more explicit in stating what he intends to do.  Does he intend so to amend the malicious injury code that local authorities will no longer be in danger of getting huge bills due to the fact that somebody, possibly living outside their area, has caused damage running into tens of thousands of pounds?  If so, he should also investigate, if he amends this particular code as I think he should, the impact on insurance tariff rates, of such a reform because at present that particular measure relieves many insurance companies of liability to pay large amounts which ordinarily they would have to pay.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with law reform and there is one particular and important aspect of law reform to which I draw the Minister's attention.  Unfortunately, it probably refers more to my constituency than to any other because I have the misfortune to represent the constituency of Cork city which has been described by sea captains with experience of ports all over the world as one of the dirtiest ports in the world.  The situation is &mdash; and I speak fully briefed by those who know most about this shocking scandal that exists in the second city of the State &mdash; that about 80 females, from girls of 13 up to women of 52, are being used in a prostitution racket at the port of Cork in a most shocking way.</P>
    <P>This has led to a situation within the last few weeks in which girls of 14, who were really what is known as &ldquo;rotten drunk&rdquo; around the quays of Cork, were being conveyed by foreign sailors into foreign ships for purposes which can well be imagined and the Garda Síochána and the Port Chaplain had to stand by while these girls were taken on board and could do nothing about it.  That is wrong and bad.  The situation under existing law is that these girls are visitors of the captain and crew of the ship and the Garda have no right to cross into that ship to remove these girls whose souls and bodies are being destroyed in a <Col N="1732" /> conscious cooperation between citizens of Cork who do well out of this particular trade.</P>
    <P>The situation at present is that undoubtedly the Garda can do nothing and at this stage, as the Minister is dealing with law reform, I think he should treat this as a very urgent problem.  I know that the Minister has investigated this because I have addressed Dáil questions to him on the matter before, and any insufficiencies there are in the law at present should be righted and amended so that the Garda can rescue these unfortunate girls.  I am not talking so much about the women of 52 or about the married woman who has her own car and takes herself and some of her older and more experienced friends to those boats: I am talking of little girls of 14, 15, 16 or 17 who are being attracted to those places by the hope of excitement.</P>
    <P>I shall tell the Minister how it happens.  They are taken to public houses in Cork &mdash; and I can give the Minister the names of them as also can the Port Chaplain and the Gardaí&mdash; and there they meet the foreign sailors. There they are given drink and some Members of the House will recall that as a result of this procedure one girl was murdered and another was drowned.  When these girls get there they can be shipped like cattle by special taxis from the publichouses to the boats and sailors can and, indeed, have phoned these public houses&mdash; there are only a few of them &mdash; and have said: &ldquo;Send us down a car load of girls&rdquo; for the purposes I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>This is a sort of minor white slave traffic which is being operated in my constituency and I deem it my duty as a Deputy of that constituency to bring it to the notice of the Minister and implore him to do what he can to stop it at this stage.  I want to ask him why is it that when the licences of the publichouses in question came up for renewal on the last occasion a few weeks ago &mdash; the licensing session is in September each year &mdash; there was no objection made by the Garda to the renewal of these licences.  Perhaps from the technical garda point of view it is easier to have these people concentrated <Col N="1733" /> in small areas so that the Gardaí can know where they are.</P>
    <P>I think it should be approached from another angle &mdash; that these are well-known centres to which little girls can be taken by their elder sister, by their friends and by various others interested in prostitution.  I would ask the Minister if he would investigate whether under existing law the public service vehicles licences of taximen, who transport these girls as if they were cattle to the slaughter of their bodies and possibly of their souls, can be denied to them.  If not, I would ask the Minister to investigate how that law can be amended to enable this matter to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I might say that the use of drugs is now also suspected amongst these girls. So we have drugs, drink, venereal disease, pregnancies and various other things being propagated as a result of the vicious vice racket in my own constituency.  The Minister cannot say he is not hearing about it.  I have brought it to his attention before.  I would be glad if the Minister would accede to a request I have made to see the port chaplain and to learn from him what he has seen night after night, week after week, month after month, so that the Minister himself may realise the enormity of the problem in Cork city.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to keep the House much longer, but I have something very important to advocate to which I have drawn the Minister's attention on previous occasions.  I am referring to the common law rule of <i>caveat emptor</i>&mdash; let the purchaser beware &mdash; under which, if somebody purchases something and finds there is anything wrong with it, he must bear the loss.  That was only when you purchased something like bacon, butter or something you could inspect, say, perhaps, a beast, a bull, an ass or a horse.  Then there came the Industrial Revolution and the Sale of Goods Act incorporated into such contracts conditions and warranties.  It protected the purchaser.  That was a very sound thing even in those days. Nowadays legislation of this nature is even more necessary.  If I buy a TV set, what do I know about the workings of it?  How am I supposed to know <Col N="1734" /> if there are any defects, latent or patent, in it?  If I purchase a motor car, how am I expected to know whether there is anything wrong with the engine, the chassis, or any portion of the motor?  The same thing applies to electric irons and various other things, the insides of which are mysteries to the average man.  When we purchase one of these things, we find that the manufacturers, the wholesalers and the retailers present to the purchaser a document which is dignified by the description of warranty or guarantee. Woe betide the man or woman who signs that guarantee.  What he or she is doing is signing away all the rights given to him by the Sale of Goods Act.  If anything goes wrong with any of the things I have mentioned, all the purchaser can get in the case of a TV set, for instance, is a guarantee which says &ldquo;Send back the TV set and, if there is anything wrong with it, we will replace the part&rdquo;.  But you have to pay for the transport of the TV set, the repair man's time and the cost of transport back to you.  This is something which should be altered by legislation.  A weak attempt has been made to do that in the Hire Purchase Act.  It has not been satisfactory.  I would suggest this is the time for the Minister to review this in order to assist the unfortunate purchaser who believes he is getting something wonderful when he gets a guarantee as well as a TV set, a radio, an electric iron or a car.</P>
    <P>I would not like any wrong significance to be read into what I am going to say next.  I would like to refer to something which has given me cause for much disquiet and which has given many litigants in this country even greater cause for disquiet.  It is the practice which has grown up, under a bond of friendship usually, of the district justices meeting the Garda superintendent or the sergeants after the court hearing and having some social time with them &mdash; perhaps a cup of tea, coffee, lemonade or whatever district justices and Garda officers drink when they get together.  I see nothing wrong in that at all in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not want anything sinister to be attached to it.  I say this, <Col N="1735" /> and I have found it time and again, that the ordinary litigant who goes into court, fighting his case, feels &ldquo;What chance have I when the district justice is going out with the superintendent or the sergeant afterwards?  Since they are friendly, is he not going to have a bias towards me?&rdquo; I am not suggesting this bias is present in the district justice's mind or that the fact that the district justice is friendly with the superintendent will in any way influence him.  The cliché I am about to mention is very true: &ldquo;It is not enough that justice should be done but it should appear to be done&rdquo;.  I am certain in the civil courts or in the High Court if one of the litigants went out of the court with the judge after the case there would be a strong protest. I would suggest that the Minister should tactfully suggest to both the district justices and the officers that they should not consort together on such occasions as these.  Deputy Costello in his few words earlier on &mdash;if I heard him correctly &mdash; referred to the question of legal aid.  I would like to refer to the fees which are paid to members of the legal profession at the Bar in that regard.  I understand &mdash;the Minister can correct if I am wrong &mdash; that when the legal aid panel was first opened certain fees were agreed on between the Minister and the Bar for a trial period.  That period has gone on for many years and nothing has been done to increase the fees, although wages and allowances of all descriptions have increased.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Minister's plan to introduce traffic wardens. It is a good idea, but in a way I regret it for the reason I referred to already&mdash; lawless elements and the lawless wave sweeping all over the world and approaching our own country.  I rejoiced when I saw the Garda Síochána standing outside the schools waiting for the children to see them safely across the road.  I always felt that here we had public relations officers with children at their most impressionable age and that each child who stood there waiting for the Garda to assist him and preserve his life and limb from traffic would look upon the Garda at this earliest age as his friend <Col N="1736" /> and guide.  I thought this was one of the most healthy things that could happen.  I regret now that the Gardaí are being removed and that traffic wardens are being put there instead.  I realise the Minister's difficulty: that the Gardaí are being highly paid and that they have other duties to perform. But I feel that, if the Minister were operating a commercial firm and if he were looking for a public relations officer, he could not have got better value than the value he got from introducing the Guard in the guise of a friend, mentor, assistant and protector of young children.  That would pay rich dividends in the years to come.  I do not suppose anything can be done about it now but I think the Minister should cogitate on the suggestion and hesitate before he extends any further the number of traffic wardens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to say anything on this Estimate that has not already been said.  The whole field of the Department of Justice has been very extensively covered and I hope that, as a result of this debate, the Minister for Justice will go from the House reinforced in the knowledge that this has been not alone a very practical but a very useful debate. Therefore, it is not my intention to detain the House or the Minister who I am sure is anxious to have his Estimate concluded after what we consider has been a very trying debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, there are a few observations I wish to make.  With regard to one of these observations I cannot say whether it is a reflection on Radio Telefís Éireann or a reflection on the Department of Justice.  I remember some months ago there was a very special &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on which a number of youths displayed their ability as to which of them would be able to administer the greatest number of stitches to their colleagues with knives.  I do not think I have ever seen such a degrading programme.  I do not know whether the police authorities were consulted before a public display over Telefís Éireann on the use of these knives among a certain element in this city and elsewhere was given.  I would have felt that <Col N="1737" /> rather than give the widest possible publicity to the disgraceful conduct of slashing each other with knives this was something that should be concealed and hidden as far as possible. There is a certain element in this country that can not only appear on television but can actually boast that they can meet their colleagues in arms. The one way which to them proves who is the best in using these knives is which has received the greatest number of stitches as a result of the infliction of wounds.</P>
    <P>We all know the Gardaí have a difficult time with people using knives not alone on their associates but on anybody who intervenes?  I want to pay a special tribute, if I may, to the Gardaí particularly in the city of Dublin.  A short time ago they made short shrift in the city of a certain element who were out to create distrubance by the drawing of knives and such activities.</P>
    <P>We have a police force of which we can be very proud, a young police force, one which was established under very trying and difficult conditions. Unlike, perhaps, other police forces the Garda were established during a difficult period.  During the past 40 years the Garda have acted in a manner which has reflected very great credit on them.  It is only right that a tribute should be paid to the retired commissioner of the Garda, ex-Commissioner Carroll.  Many tributes have been paid to commissioners who spearheaded the activities of law and order in this country.  I take great pleasure in paying my tribute because ex-Commissioner Carroll was a Laoisman and, as the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, it is seldom a Laoisman will get to the top but in this case a Laoisman got to the top.  He must rank as one of the outstanding commissioners of the Garda.  He was a man who came up from the ranks, realised the problems and difficulties and can be regarded as an outstanding policeman not only in this country but in Europe.  I wish his successor every success.</P>
    <P>Our police force is something of which we can be justly proud but there are a number of aspects in connection with our police force which we must <Col N="1738" /> bear in mind.  In order to have a dedicated police force they must be contented in their employment.  They are the custodians of law and order and they are the people who protect the public and defend life and property. That is the purpose for which the Garda were established.  We have as we had in the past a certain amount of uneasiness within the force on the question of pay claims.  I feel, and I am sure many others share my views, that they are the section of the community who have the most difficult task to perform and whose lives in the discharge of their duties are in great danger.  That is why I think that such people, who are there to safeguard life, to protect us and our property, should rank among the best paid people in the State.  I would deeply regret if any young member of the Garda who was completely dedicated to his work as a policeman had any hesitation about remaining in the force because of the attractiveness of more comfortable employment elsewhere or that he might be compelled to emigrate to join a continental police force or even the police in the United States or Canada.  I think every effort should be made to pay our men well.  The pay of all grades of the Garda should be very substantially increased.  There is no member of the general public or no member of the ratepaying public who can or should complain about this because the very people who will benefit as a result of greater efficiency and greater contentment on the part of the Garda are the general public.</P>
    <P>As has been said by many Deputies they are there to safeguard life and property and to protect the general public against all kinds of intrusion. While I am speaking on the activities of the Garda it is regrettable that we have had this odd spectacle of members of the public standing by and seeing members of the Garda Síochána attacked.  It displays bad citizenship on the part of the public.  It is easy to understand it because our country is a comparatively young country and we had a foreign police force here for many years suppressing and defying the people, whereas our present force is there to assist and help the people. It is difficult to get it into the minds <Col N="1739" /> of our people that the Garda Síochána are their friends.  It has been said by Deputy Barrett that our young people are now realising this and I think it should be taught in our schools particularly in civic lectures that the Garda Síochána are there for the use of the public and are always available to help us, to co-operate with us and assist us, that their main purpose is to be the friends of the people and in no degree to be the enemies of the people.</P>
    <P>A number of Dublin daily papers in their editorials seriously criticised the general public who stood by from time to time and saw members of the Garda Síochána attacked by mobs and by rowdies who had no respect for themselves, for the public or for the Garda.  People may say it is difficult for the general public to intervene. They do not have to intervene.  They could go to the nearest telephone kiosk and telephone the Garda station for other Gardaí to come to the aid of the one attacked.  I hope that a campaign will be started by the Minister for Justice for a greater degree of co-operation between the public and the Garda.  I am happy to say that whatever prevails in the city of Dublin there is in rural Ireland a very good spirit of co-operation and friendliness between the Gardaí and the public.</P>
    <P>The old-timers who are now out on pension were very successful and what was mainly responsible for their success was the fact that they mixed with the public and chatted with them.  They had their ear to what was going on. If there was any crime in an area they always had the support of the public in detecting whatever crime was in that area.  I hope the younger members of the Garda who may not be as familiar with the public, particularly in rural Ireland, will familiarise themselves with the public just as the older members of the force did.  I think the force deserves the greatest possible credit.  At the same time, in so far as it is possible members of the Garda, who are experienced in crime detection, should be released completely from traffic duties.  There should be a very highly-trained section of the Garda for traffic duty alone and when someone is entering the force he should be asked <Col N="1740" /> if he would care to specialise in the detection of crime of one kind or another or if he would prefer to devote his energies to traffic duty.  I have seen members of the force on traffic duty who I considered to be excellent men in the detection of crime.  I often felt that they were wasting their time on traffic duty, watching parking offences and so on.  However, I suppose the Garda authorities probably know more about it and know what the men are best suited for and it is difficult for a lay person to decide what sphere of activity a member of the Garda is best suited and most qualified for.  The force should be divided into different groups and there should be a highly-specialised group for dealing with traffic and a highly-trained group for dealing with other offences.  I agree that the radio communication and the patrol equipment have been vastly improved in recent times.  That is a good sign and I hope that the Department of Justice, irrespective of cost, will see that the Garda are equipped with the most up-to-date methods of communication.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the introduction of more police dogs. I do not know what the views of the Minister or the views of the police authorities are on this.  I understand that there are a number of highly-trained police dogs but to what extent I cannot say.  This is an essential part of a good police force.</P>
    <P>If not already organised, a special mobile squad should be formed to deal with housebreaking, men who are specialised in dealing with housebreaking. Housebreaking not alone in this city but in the country has become alarming.  While the funeral of a friend of mine in this city was taking place and while the relatives were out at the Requiem Mass and burial the house was ransacked and everything of value &mdash; silver, jewellery and everything the thieves put their hands on &mdash; was taken.  Is that not the lowest form of theft?  This is something which is dragging on and it must be stopped. The sad part of all this is that district justices are too lenient with this type of person.  There is no great encouragement for a specialised squad <Col N="1741" /> to deal with housebreaking or to make a successful arrest when instead of the rigour of the law being applied to such people who can be described as a menace in society they are given a suspensory sentence of one month or two months.  There is one way to stamp out this housebreaking.  People's property must be saved.  The way to stamp it out is to apply the full rigour of the law.  District justices and others have failed miserably in their duty to deal with offenders responsible for breaking into private houses at dead of night, breaking in on old people, who in many cases were living alone and were subjected to serious assault by the intruders solely concerned with looting all they could from these good and law-abiding citizens.  District justices and those who pass judgement should examine their consciences as to whether they are really doing justice to the people who want their property safeguarded when, too frequently, these judges and justices give the benefit of a doubt that probably does not exist to people who are continually housebreaking and threatening the lives of others.  The time has come to examine the whole legal structure with a view to putting down such crime.</P>
    <P>Another type of crime which is not only usual in the city but throughout the country also is breaking into parked cars, raiding their boots and so on.  A careful citizen who parks his car will usually lock it but there appears to be a well-organised and equipped squad with keys which, in many cases, open these cars.  When such offenders are discovered the law should show them very little mercy.  If a citizen parks his car he is entitled to expect to find it in the same place and undamaged when he returns.  Because of the continuance of such crimes, interference with cars, housebreaking and other types of crimes to which I have referred, old people being attacked in their homes and savagely assaulted.  I believe there is only one way we can counter that and it is by having the Garda force built up rather than reduced in all areas.  In the larger towns the number of Gardaí has been reduced in recent times.  That was, and is, a mistake.  It may be the opinion of <Col N="1742" /> the Minister for Finance who wants to economise or of the Department of Justice that fewer Gardaí will be able to maintain proper law and order, but for the detection of crime the force should be brought up to full strength.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland I think it is the duty of the State, whether the work be undertaken by the National Building Agency or not, to provide the most modern type of houses for members of the Gardaí.  I am glad there has been an improvement in the standard of Garda barracks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ask the Minister to ensure that the provision of additional Garda barracks where these are required shall be undertaken with the least possible delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to Garda widows' pensions and there is little I can add to what has already been said.  In my own constituency I was particularly interested in the case of the widow of a member of the Gardaí who lost his life while on duty some years ago in County Cavan. Gardaí should at least be encouraged in their work by knowing that, if they die in the discharge of their duties as members of the force, their wives and families will be properly provided for. I am disappointed at the scale of pensions provided for Garda widows.  It is generally agreed that the Garda and his wife must live up to a higher standard than any others in the area.  They must remain aloof from the public, not through snobbery but for the sake of impartial discharge of their duties.  But the moment the Garda's wife becomes a widow her circumstances are so deplorable that great embarrassment is caused in the case of people accustomed <Col N="1743" /> to better times.  It is extraordinary that a native Government after 40 years has not adequately provided for widows of Gardaí.  There can be no comparison between other widows and widows of Gardaí and the time has come when the Government should consider introducing decent pension schemes for widows of Gardaí.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to refer to the question of transfer of members of the Garda Síochána.  We have frequently been told that political interference in such transfer does not and cannot take place.  That is all cod.  There has been political interference with members of the Garda in the discharge of their duties.  This is well known and established. It is most regrettable that members of the Irish police force cannot impartially discharge their duties because of the fear and threat of being transferred.  The transfer means complete disruption of their homes, breaking up of family life as well as disorganisation of the education of their children.  We have seen more than one case where, because of the impartial exercise of their duty by members of the Gardaí, they are transferred to the most remote areas in the country.  If we want to create greater confidence in the force and confidence, respect and love amongst the members of the force for the authorities, greater care must be exercised when it comes to interference in the work of the Gardaí.  It is wrong that there should be any question of political interference or political intervention, either by members of the Government or by Members of Parliament who may seek to have Gardaí transferred.  I venture to say that there is no Member of this House who would like to be in the position that anybody superior to him could direct that he be transferred from one place to another.  That is the position in which Gardaí find themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has introduced his first Estimate for the Department of Justice.  May I wish him luck? I hope and trust that, as a legal man, he will do his part so far as is possible to divorce his Department completely from interference in the matter of the <Col N="1744" /> transfer of Gardaí.  This is a matter that should be left to the sole discretion of the commissioner.</P>

It would be a very sad day for this country if any group, say, a group of auctioneers or a group of solicitors that had a protest to make could not go out and march and make their protest.

The idea of this becoming a police state is not brought about by the activities of the police themselves but by instructions that have been given by the Government to the police authorities to carry out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us hope so. If we want to continue the good spirit of friendliness and co-operation between the Gardaí and the public, is it not high time that instructions were issued to the Garda Síochána that they should devote their energies to something besides sticking tickets on motorcars and taking the names of decent people who may be making a reasonable protest?  The detection of crime, such as house breaking and the safeguarding of life and property are the real duties of the Garda.  It is a cause of embarrassment to the Gardaí to have to spend their time watching how long a car is parked, putting tickets on windscreens and, in the event of a perfectly legal protest, having to take the names and addresses of those who are perfectly entitled to make their protest against living conditions.  No blame attaches to the members of the Garda in this respect.  They are carrying out instructions.  They should not be put in that embarrassing position.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a brief reference, if I may, to the prisons, especially the prison in my own constituency of which I have a reasonable knowledge. My knowledge of Mountjoy, though, is extremely limited.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister for Justice must be aware of the splendid condition in which that prison is kept.  He must be aware also of the high standard of the food which is made available within the prison.  I recall calling there unexpectedly on one occasion.  I requested the Governor to let me have the same dinner as the prisoners were getting. The meal consisted of well-cooked, good, wholesome food and was, in my opinion, second to none.  The food was of an excellent quality, mainly grown on the prison farm.</P>
      <P>All the lands surrounding the prison have been well worked, well manured and are in an excellent state of cultivation. I feel, however, that the houses provided for the prison staff at Portlaoise&mdash;they can be seen on the main Dublin-Cork road&mdash;are out of date.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister will visit Portlaoise at some convenient time and when he does he will not be impressed by the appearance of the houses in which the prison staff live.  They look drab and are very old.  These houses are not architecturally attractive and something <Col N="1748" /> should be done about providing more modern houses there.  The prison grounds are beautifully laid out.  I visited Armley prison in Leeds for the purpose of seeing a prisoner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am not mistaken some of the Deputy's constituents were in the same prison but, needless to say, I did not make inquiries. The atmosphere in the prison was cold and drab and the conditions there could not be compared with those in either Dublin or Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>However, something should be done about the young offenders who are sent to St. Patrick's.  It is high time that the Government took some positive action in regard to St. Patrick's.  It is not a fit institution for young offenders. The time has come when we must have an entirely new approach to this question.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about our young people running wild.  I do not believe that.  Our young people today are as good as ever they were.  They may require a little more advice or they may be slow to take advice but, having regard to the modern world in which we live with its attractions for our young people, I believe they are a lot better in this country than in any other part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to say what is responsible for the amount of crime that exists among young people.  Perhaps it is because so many of them are living in a dream world.  Perhaps it is because of the cinema or the television or, perhaps, they have reached the stage when they must have some outlet for their energies.  It may be that there is not proper supervision in some homes but it is difficult to point one's finger in that direction because crime has been committed in families where there has been excellent supervision in the home. Some crimes committed by young people occur when the father of the family is away working and maybe the mother is out working as well, depriving the family of a good deal of home life. <Col N="1749" /> During the few moments I have left, I wish to make some reference to a matter in which I am particularly interested, that is, the part which the Garda have played in the prevention of accidents.  As we all know, since the introduction of the speed limit on the dual carriageway between Naas and Dublin there has been a considerable improvement and we have had no fatal accidents on that stretch of road since.</P>
    <P>The time has come, and is, indeed, very ripe, when the most serious view possible should be taken of the drunken driver.  The drunken driver is not only a danger to himself but can be responsible for taking the life, say, of the father of a large family who may be returning to or from his work.  Any action which the Garda take or any action which the courts may take in order to ensure that our roads will be free from drunken drivers should have the full support of all the Members of the House.  With the increased volume of traffic on our roads driving is hard enough for people who are fully sober and conscious and any driver who takes to the road in a drunken condition deserves to have the law fully enforced against him.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make every effort to speed up the activities of the mapping section of the Land Registry.  It appears to me this section is understaffed.  This should be remedied in view of the importance and the urgency of the issue of new folios to people, because people will not get loan facilities from the local authorities until their new folio is issued.  No blame whatever attaches to the staff of the Land Registry who have always been courteous and highly efficient, but if the staff was increased it would certainly lead to greater expedition of the work.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will consider the points raised on this Estimate by the various Deputies, particularly those from this side of the House, because those raised on the far side of the House have been extremely limited. Certainly the Minister for Justice has got from this side of the House, particularly from Deputy John A. Costello and Deputy Stephen Barrett, food for thought which will assist him in no <Col N="1750" /> small way in moulding the policy of his Department and in keeping him informed of what the people want.  It is very well established that not alone the Minister for Justice but all his colleagues in the Government have been living on the moon and are not close to the problems of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence by offering the Minister my best wishes for the success of the work he is doing in this Department.  I am very much concerned about his intentions to alter the law on bail.  There is ample justification for this.  I do not think bail should be given to the habitual offender who so often avails of this to commit further crimes.  In the event of his altering the law in regard to bail, it is very important for him to consider a special remand home for people who have been deprived of bail, because we must remember they are not guilty until convicted, and no matter how serious a charge may be against them they are innocent until proved guilty.</P>
      <P>One other aspect of the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer concerns these maintenance orders where wives are deserted.  The Minister proposes to increase the maximum amount, but there is no purpose whatsoever in increasing the amount that may be paid to a deserted wife if there is no means of enforcing this maintenance order.  I have seen so many cases where maintenance orders were made and could not be enforced on husbands in England.  This is a bad state of affairs, and some form of reciprocal arrangement should be made with Britain to enforce these maintenance orders in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion quite recently to seek the assistance of the Adoption Board.  I was surprised that I did not get any co-operation from the Adoption Board, who told me they could only deal with a case through a solicitor.  As a public representative acting on behalf of people who are not in a position to pay for solicitors, I think the Adoption Board should have given me the information I requested.  Recently I checked on adoption societies and I was very disappointed to notice that there is no doctor on the committees <Col N="1751" /> of some of these adoption societies.  It is important that we have doctors on these committees who will, perhaps, be in a position to assess cases a lot more sympathetically than other members. I would ask the Minister to look into this important problem.</P>
    <P>Again in regard to adoption societies, I understand that both of the adopting parents must be of the same religion as the mother of the child to be adopted.  I should like to ask the Minister what happens in the case of mixed marriages.  This is something we should consider, as it works very much against certain people.  The maximum age for adoption is nine years and I am wondering if there is a case to be made for increasing this.  While on the subject I would ask the Minister to consider introducing a simplified system of registering births which have not been registered or amending the surnames of children who no longer use the surnames of their original parents.  This presents a problem for foster children and the situation is made very complicated and difficult for them.  We have seen a few cases where children adopted by Hindu mothers were not covered by the Adoption Bill.  This is something we should look into.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the Garda Síochána who are doing an excellent job.  The greatest criticism of the Garda perhaps is that they are a bit too humane.  This is the only country about which it can be said the police force are really sympathetic and understanding. They work under tremendous difficulties and in the country they live and work under medieval conditions. Their hours of duty belong to another age.  In the courses for Gardaí I should like to see basic psychology and sociology included because this is important for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for permission to raise on the Adjournment tonight the question of the action taken by the Minister for Local Government in relation to certain objections to the <Col N="1752" /> employment of an individual, Mr. William Davis, on the referendum counting staff for the Laois-Offaly constituency. I did so because I believe this to be an instance of petty political victimisation.  I believe it to be an example and an instance of an effort to use the jackboot and the big stick against a defenceless officer who ordinarily might be expected to do nothing about it.  The officer concerned, Mr. William Davis, has been in the public service for 45 years.  He is in the position of assistant to the country registrar in Laois.  He is a person who in his own right commands respect throughout the County Laois and a person who has given exemplary service in every possible respect.  In addition, he is a person whose word is regarded as his bond.  He is generally known to be a man of integrity and, indeed, a person who would do harm to himself rather than in any way perform an act which might be dishonest or transgress in any respect the very high principles by which he lives.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should add that for as long as I can remember election counts in Laois-Offaly, Mr. William Davis has been an integral part of every count that has taken place in the constituency.  He has done it cheerfully, he has done it well and he has been the recipient of many tributes from those who waged battle as candidates and who either won or lost in the elections.  That is his background.</P>
      <P>On polling day for the referendum, on the 16th October, a telephone call came to the Court House in Portlaoise and the person telephoning sought to communicate with the county registrar. The telephone was answered by the registrar and as a result the registrar was asked to be in his office to receive another telephone call.  I understand, although I am not in a position to establish it, that the county registrar was then informed that the person speaking to him was speaking on the express instructions of the Minister for Local Government to transmit to him, the county registrar, as the local returning officer, the direct order of the Minister for Local Government, that Mr. Davis be not employed on the counting staff in Portlaoise on the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> I do know that following a communication received by the county registrar Mr. Davis was informed that the county registrar was precluded by the Minister for Local Government from employing him on the staff the following day.  He naturally was concerned to know whether a charge had been brought against him, whether his honour was being impugned, or whether some suggestion had been made which affected the principles by which he lived.  He could get no information.  He was merely informed that this order had been issued and, of course, not unnaturally he made a simple request that the order might be put in writing.</P>
    <P>I may say that when I learned on polling day of this development I was shocked, shocked to think that any Minister on whatever information he might be acting, could so grossly interfere in the affairs of a constituency.  I may say that as the rumours spread a very sharp reaction took place amongst those who were expected to count the votes the following day.  That reaction might easily have led to a situation in which the Minister for Local Government himself might have had to go down to Portlaoise and count the votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But, in fact, the reaction was stemmed and stopped and contained by the public spirited action of the officer in relation to whom I have raised this particular matter.  He had to abide by the order.  It had to be so and, indeed, subsequently when I raised the matter, I raised it because this was an instance, just one of many, of so many defenceless small people having to accept some decision handed down relating to them and do nothing about it and I was determined to do something about this.  I raised it at the conclusion of the count and subsequently, on the 24th October, I raised it in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary question in which I asked whether the Minister had sent any instruction, whether the returning officer, the county registrar, had been instructed not to employ a named officer on his counting staff for the counting of votes on the referendum, <Col N="1754" /> or how such instruction was conveyed and when and under what authority he purported to act, the Minister answered &ldquo;I issued no such instruction&rdquo;.  In reply to supplementary questions the Minister said:</P>
    <P>A telephone conversation as specified by the Deputy did not take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that a letter, as I had suggested, had not, in fact, been issued.  I want to suggest that what the Minister was saying was not in accordance with the facts. First of all, I suggested that, on his behalf and in his name, an instruction was, in fact, issued.  I have here in my hand a copy of a letter, which is dated&mdash;and I ask Deputies to note the date&mdash;16th October, 1968.  That happens to have been polling day.  The copy of the letter I have here is directed to the county registrar in the circuit court, Portlaoise, and it starts with these words:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to say that an objection has been received to the proposed employment of a Mr. Davis at the counting of votes at the Referenda.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government&rdquo; and attention is directed &ldquo;to the proposed employment of Mr. Davis&rdquo;.  I ask Deputies who have commonsense&mdash;they are mostly on this side of the House&mdash;to appreciate the significance of the date on the letter, 16th October.  When would it have been received?  I suggest it is a fair inference that a letter dated 16th October, polling day, referring to the proposed employment at the counting of votes the following day, was preceded by a telephone call from the Department of Local Government on that particular day referring to objections having been received.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister on 24th October from what source these objections came and he replied:</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wants to know let him put down a question.</P>
    <P>I am asking for that information here and now publicly in this, the nation's Parliament.  I want to know who <Col N="1755" /> objected to the employment of William Davis and, if the Minister does not answer, I shall suggest that the objection came from the Fianna Fáil Cumann in the town of Mountmellick. I suggest that it is from there it came.</P>
    <P>I accept, because I have to, and I try to be charitable despite provocation from Fianna Fáil, the word of Deputy Lalor, the Parliamentary Secretary, who stated at the count, that he knew nothing about this development.  Be it so.  I suggest that a certain person in the town of Mountmellick had the ear of the Minister for Local Government and telephoned, or got in touch with, the Minister for Local Government to raise an objection to the employment of William Davis.</P>
    <P>Why?  Because in 1967 there was an election for the Town Commission in Mountmellick contested by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  That contest resulted in the election of seven Fine Gael members out of a total of nine and, if there had been more Fine Gael candidates, it might well have resulted in the election of nine Fine Gael members to the nine seats.  However, an error occurred in the count.  The returning officer was not William Davis; he was merely one of the people concerned there.  An error occurred and the error was raised in this House by the Fianna Fáil Deputy for the constituency, Deputy Nicholas Egan, and it was suggested that, if this error of&mdash;I think it was either eight or eleven votes&mdash;had not occurred, there might have been three instead of merely two Fianna Fáil candidates elected.  In fact, of course, that would not have happened but an effort was made, in relation to that count, to browbeat those who were concerned with it; some example had to be made and the can had to be carried by William Davis.  He had had nothing to do with it.  He made no mistake.  He was in no way responsible, but he was to be blamed.</P>
    <P>I do not need to spell out for hard-headed Deputies in this House what views of current problems Mr. Davis normally holds, but I suggest that he is not amongst the strongest supporters of the Minister's Party.  And he had to be punished.  An effort was to be <Col N="1756" /> made to show that, even if the Fianna Fáil Cumann in Mountmellick represented nothing but themselves, they nevertheless had some influence outside Laois-Offaly and they would show what they could do.  So, following objections received, as the Minister says, to Mr. William Davis, down comes an order from Dublin that this decent Laois man was not to be employed doing what he had done honourably and successfully for over 30 years.</P>
    <P>I suggest this was an outrageous bit of political victimisation.  It does no credit to the Minister.  It does no credit to the nameless individual who put it in motion and it certainly indicates the kind of Government this country avoided by the way in which the people decided the Referenda issues on 16th October.</P>

      <P>I endorse everything Deputy O'Higgins has said. This was a disgraceful performance, a performance of which the Minister and the Government should be ashamed. Mr. Davis is one of the most outstanding men in the county.  He is a man of the highest integrity.  We should know why an order was issued by the Minister designed to prevent him participating in the referenda count.  The Minister must be aware of the fact that Mr. Davis was the only non-Catholic employed at the counting of votes in the area.  He is a man of the highest possible standards in every respect. Like Deputy O'Higgins, I believe this was a piece of savage victimisation.  It is something which the people of Laois and Offaly, who have known Bill Davis for over 40 years, deeply resent.  It is something which should make the Government hang their heads in shame and disgrace.  It is something which will not be forgotten for many a long day in Laois.</P>

I could not have made such an untrue statement except through my own knowledge.  This is something that must be within my own knowledge. Therefore, Deputy O'Higgins clearly stated in fact that I, in reply to the Parliamentary Question last week, stated what I knew to be untrue.

      <P>Let me proceed with my reply to what Deputy O'Higgins has said here to-night.  Here is what happened.  Arising out of experiences at the last local elections in Mountmellick, certain people there telephoned my office objecting to the employment of this particular man at the count. An officer of my Department telephoned the Returning Officer and drew his attention to the complaint and to the experience at the local election and to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there was. The Returning Officer said he would consider the matter.  He telephoned back to the officer at my Department later that day and said he had decided not to employ this man at the count.  He asked that a letter setting out the objection be sent to him. That letter was sent to him.  Deputy O'Higgins purported to quote that letter but he neglected to quote all of it: he quoted only part of it.  He tried to represent to this House that this letter was an instruction to the returning officer not to employ this man although he knew that this was not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Higgins had read the letter in full, it would have been apparent.  This letter was in reply to a request from the returning officer that a letter, setting out the objections, be submitted to him.  Here is the full letter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to say an objection has been received to the proposed employment of a Mr. Davis at the counting of votes at the Referendum. Your attention is directed to the terms of the memorandum for the guidance of Returning Officers, issued with the letter of 6th ultimo, <Col N="1764" /> and to the experience at the counting for the Mountmellick Town Commissioners in 1967&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The decision not to employ this man was made by the returning officer.  The Minister for Local Government has no power to instruct him as to whom he should employ&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and no such instruction was issued.  With regard to the question of competency, the question of what Deputy O'Higgins referred to as an &ldquo;error&rdquo; at the election for the Mountmellick Town Commissioners, that is, I suggest, a particularly charitable way of looking at it.  Possibly it was an error.  I think that, if this person had all the experience of counting votes under this &ldquo;simple&rdquo; system to which Deputy O'Higgins has referred, it was rather peculiar that that mistake should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that, in distributing Deputy Flanagans's surplus, Mr. Davis displayed quite a good knowledge of this particular rule and he distributed Deputy Flanagan's surplus correctly.  However, when he came <Col N="1765" /> to the distribution of the surplus of the second candidate&mdash;who was not of the same political Party as Deputy Flanagan&mdash;only a percentage of the surplus was distributed.  This was an &ldquo;error&rdquo; in counting votes, Deputy O'Higgins says.  I think it is quite obvious it was no such thing.  It would take me too long to read the rule dealing with the distribution of surpluses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the effect of it is that the total surplus is distributed provided the surplus is less than the total number of transferable papers. This rule was applied correctly to the distribution of Deputy Flanagan's votes but, when it came to the distribution of a Fianna Fáil candidate's votes, a different rule&mdash;which does not appear under the Rules of Proportional Representation&mdash;was applied.</P>
