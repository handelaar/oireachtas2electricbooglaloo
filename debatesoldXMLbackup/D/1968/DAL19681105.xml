      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 to 14 together.</P>
      <P>In my talks with the British Prime Minister we covered a number of questions of mutual interest regarding the development of fruitful co-operation between the two countries in the economic field.  We also touched on the prospects for the expansion of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement but not its revision <Col N="2015" /> was discussed.  The position of Irish immigrants was not amongst the subjects discussed.</P>
    <P>My primary purpose in meeting Mr. Wilson was to make known to him the views of the Irish Government in relation to the recent civil rights protest in Derry and to indicate to him that we regarded the partition of our country as its root cause.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Northern Prime Minister is anxious to promote civil rights and I am hopeful that, as a result of our respective discussions with Mr. Wilson, progress will be made to this end.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that there is any early prospect of tripartite talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that his own statement on Partition has not helped the position in regard to co-operation between Catholics and Protestants in the North, as witnessed by the remarks of Mr. Gerry Fitt in the House of Commons yesterday?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do regard them as important but, as I said, my primary purpose was to discuss the Derry incidents. I also discussed trading matters, but the time available did not permit of a wider range of discussions between us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach says he is satisfied with the working of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement. How does he square this with his speech on April 29th last in which he told the Management Institute he expected one-third of the Irish home market would be lost to British competition? In those circumstances, how can he say the agreement does not call for revision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to lose sight of the fact that free trade arrangements between countries throughout the world are coming nearer and nearer and that we cannot hope to live in isolation against that.  In direct reply to the Deputy's supplementary, our exports of manufactured goods have been rising spectacularly in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan)</i>: Does the Taoiseach not think that his interview at Dublin Airport on his return, when he commented on Captain O'Neill's reference to the Taoiseach's reference to Derry, was extremely weak, and would he not agree his interview at the airport amounted really to an apology for going over and raising the Derry incident?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the increasingly uncertain fate of Ireland's application for membership to the EEC, it is his intention to seek a review of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement with a view to restoring Ireland's industrial trading advantage in the remaining years of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear what the Deputy means by restoring our industrial trading advantage as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement opened up additional industrial trading possibilities in the British market.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind the home market I would refer him to the reply I gave on 7th May last to a question by him, to which I have nothing to add.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the remaining years of this agreement will be to the disadvantage, increasingly, of this country?  Will he agree that all commentators have agreed on that?  The Taoiseach may plead that some advantages accrued this year and last year but will he not agree that next year and the year after the disadvantages will lie with this country?  Our employment will suffer and any advantages we have gained in that respect will be reversed.  It is the industrial employment in towns that will suffer during the remaining years of the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the agreement is working to our advantage at the present time.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The Third Programme for Economic Expansion&mdash;covering the period 1969 to 1972&mdash;which is to be published about the end of the year, will concentrate on policies designed to secure increases in employment and national output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of increased industrial employment is acknowledged as the principal measure to reduce unemployment. To this end, the campaign for the attraction of new industry and for the adaptation and expansion of existing industry is being pursued with vigour.  The promotional effort of the Industrial Development Authority abroad is being intensified.  The purpose <Col N="2020" /> of the reorganisation of the authority, at present in progress, is to expand its resources, to provide greater flexibility in meeting its staffing requirements, and to strengthen its decision making powers.  A revised industrial grants structure which will include generous facilities for modernisation and re-equipment by existing industry and for incentive packages tailored to meet the special requirements of particularly attractive new projects likely to make a special contribution to the economy is being introduced.  The Committee on Industrial Progress which was recently established will determine the best way of concentrating State resources on the potentially most successful firms.  Finally, the Small Industries Programme, at present in progress, is aimed at the development of small industry, particularly in areas which have not experienced large scale industrial development.</P>

Is he further aware that the NIEC considered we should provide <Col N="2021" /> something like 12,500 new jobs a year?  Has the Taoiseach any answer to that?</P>

      <P>Surely, as a sportsman the Taoiseach must realise that in most countries where the State contributes generously to the development of sports, gold medals were won in the recent Olympics.  Those mainly concerned in the recent Olympics were countries where the State contributed generously to sports.  Surely the Taoiseach realises that for the development of youth and of sport it is necessary that the Government should give assistance in every way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our efforts in the recent Olympics did not compare badly <Col N="2022" /> with other countries, and, indeed, with many countries who have greater resources than ours, Canada and Belgium being two.  In many of these countries the athletes were practically full-time sportsmen, not only with liberal time off but with total time off from their jobs.  I do not think that kind of amateurism is something we should develop here.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (Acting Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not formulated any plans in relation to the promotion of athletics and sport.  We consider that, in keeping with our tradition of amateur standing in the fields of athletics and sport, this matter is best left to the many organisations which cater for those interested in the various sporting activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tangible support for athletics has, of course, been given and will continue <Col N="2023" /> to be given by the Government. The Department of Education make provision for physical education in the National, Secondary and Vocational Schools' system.  The Department of Local Government is empowered to subsidise borrowing to provide swimming pools and to give grants for works of public amenity.  The Commissioners of Public Works in their capacity as managers and controllers of the Phoenix Park, provide playing pitches and dressing rooms for a variety of sports&mdash;hurling, football, camogie, soccer, hockey, cricket <i>et cetera</i> are permitted in the Park.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing the income of all sports organisations in the country is exempt from income tax so long as the income is used to promote athletics or sport.</P>

When I first became Minister for Education in 1957 there was such a backlog of bad and unsanitary schools that I had to double the school building programme and it is being maintained apace.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a company (name supplied) engaged in the export of sheepskins were hindered in their work by an officer of his Department investigating export quotas; that during the course of this investigation an official of his Department travelled abroad for the purpose of interviewing and questioning customers of this company; and that such action resulted in serious damage to this company's prestige and trade; if he will state the results of this investigation; and if he is satisfied that such an investigation was warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The export of sheepskins is prohibited except under licence <Col N="2025" /> issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Customs are responsible for the enforcement of this prohibition.</P>
      <P>In the course of investigations into the export of sheepskins an officer of Customs and Excise had occasion to examine the records of exports by the company referred to by the Deputy.  In accordance with normal procedure in such cases the officer also visited the company's customers in Northern Ireland for the purpose of verifying the transactions involved.  I do not accept that the officer's actions either hindered the legitimate trade of the company concerned or seriously damaged its prestige.  Moreover I am satisfied that the investigation, which is continuing, is warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the officer in question, who went right along to the business premises to demand the books, never mentioned the fact that he could take copies in the office, as was suggested to him, and that these people had to go to the office of this customs officer at 9.30 in the morning to ask for the return of the books?  The officer did not come in until 10 o'clock and ordered them out of this office despite the fact that his colleagues had met them in the office?  Is he aware that this company is operating for 40 years and has customers for that length of time?  Is he further aware that they have had no orders since due to this action by the customs official?  Is he further aware that, when there is an allegation that the quotas are exceeded, in actual fact an officer of the Department goes along to ensure that the requisite number of skins are exported, that he counts them, tallies them and seals a whole lot of them.  In fact, this investigation is not an investigation of the company but of officers of the Department.  Is the Taoiseach aware of these facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Which facts?  I do not know the details of the manner in which the investigation was carried out, nor have I any knowledge of how long the company to which the Deputy refers is in business.  I do know that the purpose of the licensing control over the export of sheepskins is to <Col N="2026" /> maintain employment for Irish people in Irish factories.  If sheepskins are exported beyond the number provided by licence, then there would be disemployment in Irish factories.  That is the whole purpose of this control.  As I said in the last sentence of my direct reply, the investigation to which the Deputy refers was found to be warranted and is to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the primary functions of Taiscí Stáit Teoranta is to give loans on preferential terms in part substitution for industrial grants where the maximum grant which could be authorised is large and is considered excessive having regard to the level of employment given by any particular project.  The investments mentioned in reply to Question No. 10 on the 23rd October represent loans which for the most part are interest free for a number of years and are repayable only at the option of the borrowers.  As was explained to the Dáil when the legislation governing the establishment of Taiscí Stáit Teoranta was being debated in 1963, loans of this type have been regarded as not being strictly in <Col N="2028" /> accordance with the functions of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically everything Deputy Tully has asserted is not correct.  The idea of an official opening at all originated with the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation because they felt that this type of opening was necessary.  There was no list supplied by the Office of Public Works to the Regional Organisation at all. What did take place was an informal conversation between a junior officer of the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation and an officer of the National Monuments Branch but it was completely informal.

      <P>What is true is that the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation felt that a show was necessary to draw attention to the fact that the tumulus was open to the public again.  This was not really the opinion of the Office of Public Works because the Newgrange Tumulus had been in the hands of the Office of Public Works for many years but, acceding to the wishes of the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation, the Board of Works agreed to let them handle the invitations.  If Deputy Tully will get a hold of one of these invitations he will see that the wording is something like this: &ldquo;The Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation request the company of such and such ...&rdquo; They undertook the issue of the invitations and if it was not satisfactory it is probably true to say that they, and not the Office of Public Works, are responsible.  On the last occasion when Deputy Tully raised this question I did accept technical responsibility for it and I did express regret that local public representatives may have felt offended.  Since the invitations were issued by the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation I have nothing further to add to that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs when he last visited any gathering of Irish emigrants in Britain; and if he will make arrangements to pay frequent visits to Irish emigrants in large centres in Britain in order to hear expressions of their opinions and needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the opinions and needs of Irish citizens living in Great Britain as I am in constant communication with them through meeting individuals and groups, through correspondence and through the Ambassador and staff of our Embassy in London.</P>
      <P>I have not attended a specifically Irish function in Great Britain within the last three and a half years but at least 30 such functions have been attended by the Taoiseach and other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
      <P>I may add that seven years ago I appointed a special officer in our Embassy to keep contact with Irish societies and within the last few months I appointed for the same purpose an officer with the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it desirable, having regard to the many problems of Irish emigrants in Britain, that he should make a personal effort as Minister for External Affairs to meet and consult with the Irish emigrants' organisations in London, Birmingham, Coventry, Leeds, Bradford and other large centres where the Irish emigrants have many problems which cannot be satisfactorily dealt with by the correspondence which the Minister has mentioned? Does the Minister not agree that he cannot wash his hands of <Col N="2032" /> responsibility for Irish emigrants and that the Government have a responsibility? Surely the Minister would consider it beneficial in the interests of the Irish emigrants and the solving of their problems to at least go over and see for himself, for example, the conditions in Camden Town?</P>

      <P>The Minister must realise that Irish emigrants have many problems and that it would be much better, instead of &ldquo;hobnobbing&rdquo; around New York and Washington, if he devoted some of his energies towards the problems of the Irish emigrants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the problems and opinions of the Irish in Great Britain.  I do not rely on the few visits that a Minister here can make and I, for the first time, when the emigration was less than half of what it was in the Coalition time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping it clean. For the first time I appointed a special officer in our Embassy to keep contact with all the Irish and within the last few months, with the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Government, we have decided to appoint a Minister Plenipotentiary so that he can go around and keep contact with the Irish in these various centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided that the management functions in respect of Shannon and Cork Airports at present exercised by my Department should be transferred to Aer Rianta as my agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> Arrangements for the transfer are proceeding and it is intended that as far as possible Aer Rianta will have effectively assumed management responsibilities by 1st April, 1969.  It is my intention at a later date and in the light of experience of the new managements, to introduce legislation to constitute Aer Rianta as an Airports Authority with full responsibility for the three Airports.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to issue, very shortly, a statement to each affected member of the staff at Shannon Airport apprising him of his position on the changeover.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous Questions, the position of the staff affected by the transfer of management of Shannon Airport to Aer Rianta Teoranta will be safeguarded. They may be assured that there will be no worsening of their conditions of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to say.  The second interim scheme, as the Deputy knows, is now being considered. It is a matter for negotiation between the union, the management of CIE and also the Department of Finance which has to make sure that the scheme relates in a general way to other similar pension schemes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity <Col N="2035" /> Supply Board that Upper Tully is in the Board's Dungloe rural area and Croveigh and Meenamara are in the adjoining Rosses rural area.  Under the planned post-development scheme, both areas are scheduled for re-canvass towards the end of 1969 and construction work should commence about six months later.  The electricity supply will then be extended to all applicants who accept the terms quoted and have their houses wired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this is a Fíor-Ghaeltacht area and should get some preference because many people are leaving these three particular townlands because they do not enjoy the amenities their neighbours have?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is a Fíor-Ghaeltacht area but I would point out that the electricity supply has already been extended to this area and that this is a question of a re-canvass which is being done on a planned basis. This re-canvass of the area towards the end of 1969 is by way of giving further preference to that area.</P>

Taking the two things together, you find that creamery milk suppliers, far from being badly treated in this matter&mdash; particularly the small people who represent about 80 per cent of the total&mdash;will be getting a higher percentage increase in real incomes than are the other sectors who have made claims through unions and so on and have got seven per cent, nine per cent or eleven per cent increases.

      <P>The House will have learned with profound shock and the deepest sorrow of the sudden and untimely death of Deputy Don Davern, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh sé.</P>
      <P>The dedication, the integrity, the talent and the ability needed to pursue and to shape a distinguished and fruitful public career&mdash;all these Don Davern had in abundance.  From his boyhood years it became evident that, following a long and proud family tradition of patriotic service to Ireland, Don Davern's career also lay in public life. His deep interest in, and the keen intellect which he brought to bear on the problems of rural Ireland and, in particular, those relating to agriculture and education; his deep concern for the poorer sections of the community; the selfless dedication and boundless energy which attracted him to such worthy causes as the care of mentally-handicapped children; the deep sense of patriotism which brought him into the ranks of the FCA as a boy of sixteen &mdash;these were some of the great qualities which distinguished Don Davern.  They endeared him to all who knew and admired him.  They were the qualities of leadership.</P>
      <P>During his short three and a half years membership of Dáil Éireann and his even shorter period as a Parliamentary Secretary, Don Davern displayed the highest administrative ability and Parliamentary skill.</P>
      <P>That death should take him in the prime of life is a tragic end to all too brief a career, so full of great promise. Always gay and good-humoured Don Davern proved a most loyal colleague and sincere friend.  He typified what was best in young Ireland.  Ireland can ill-afford his loss.  Tipperary was never short of patriotic sons.  To its Roll of Honour it can add Don Davern's name with pride.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (Acting Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Financial Motions on the Order Paper for today are a clear expression of the Government's sense of responsibility for good management of the economy.  The Government have faith in the readiness of the Dáil and the people to support a Government which do their duty even in face of the temporary unpopularity this must at times entail.  We will deserve best to retain the confidence of the people by showing both courage and responsibility.</P>
      <P>Ireland has enjoyed two excellent years.  In 1967 the rate of growth was about four per cent and this year it is likely to be between four and a half and five per cent.</P>
      <P>Increased industrial production has made a big contribution to national progress in both years.  The volume of output of transportable goods industries rose by nine per cent in 1967 and even faster in the first half of 1968.  Activity in building and construction has been much greater in both years, while agricultural output, which had fallen between 1964 and 1966, rose by two per cent in 1967 and should show a similar increase this year.  An important factor in the increase in national output has been the vigorous expansion of exports.  Merchandise exports rose by 16 per cent in 1967 and have maintained the same percentage rise in the first three quarters of 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the economy shows many satisfactory features which it is important to safeguard, there are clouds on the horizon and these cannot in prudence be ignored.  Imports in particular have risen much faster this year than last.  In 1967 they increased at the unusually low rate of five per cent and this was one of the causes of the surplus of £15 million in the balance of payments.  This year in contrast they rose by 22 per cent in the nine months January-September.  Even taking into account an increase in net invisible receipts, the likelihood is that, for the year as a whole, the balance of payments will be in deficit to the extent of <Col N="2052" /> £15 million, representing a negative swing of £30 million between last year and this.</P>
    <P>The fast rise in imports this year is directly due to a strong upsurge in personal consumption.  The retail sales index, turnover tax receipts and registrations of new motor cars, all provide evidence of a significant increase in personal consumption and suggest that the pace of the increase is accelerating. As compared with last year, the volume of retail sales, for example, was up this year by one and a quarter per cent, four and a half per cent and six and a half per cent, in the first quarter, the second quarter, and the month of July, respectively.  On this evidence, consumption has been increasing recently much faster than national production.</P>
    <P>To go back a further link in the chain of cause and effect, it is clear that the increase in personal consumption stems from the substantial income increases in recent months which have far outpaced the average rise in productivity. Besides the eleventh round increases, which for wage-earners in general have amounted to between 30s and 40s a week, phased over a two-year or shorter period, there have been many cases of increases as a result of service pay awards and other factors, while hours have also been shortened. The phasing of most of the agreements means that there will inevitably be a further large rise in incomes in 1969, with the threat which this poses of a further fillip to consumer demand and a widening of the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>There are clear indications that the economy is gathering speed too quickly at present and that if the brake were not applied we would run into trouble in 1969.  We need not be concerned about the calendar year 1968, with its prospective balance of payments deficit of £15 million.  Even a much larger deficit&mdash;of the £30 million order &mdash;could be tolerated next year without undue concern, having regard to the normal capital inflow and the high level of external reserves.  What must be avoided, however, is a deficit considerably in excess of £30 million and it is because such a deficit is threatened that precautionary action must now be <Col N="2053" /> taken.  A paper recently published by the Economic and Social Research Institute foreshadowed the possibility of a deficit of over £50 million in 1969 unless policy measures were taken to prevent it.  Without being quite so pessimistic, the Government are satisfied, from the analyses and projections presented to them, that the risk of a deficit of well over £30 million is real enough to require that some measures be taken now so that more severe action will not be necessary later.  In this way the Government hope it will be possible to maintain growth at a high rate, ensure that the balance of payments deficit does not get out of hand and avoid the serious and prolonged dislocation to which present tendencies, if uncorrected, could lead.</P>
    <P>What has to be done is to reduce prospective national expenditure in 1969 by some millions of pounds and to do this with the least adverse effect on production and investment.  Spending on consumption has to be curbed and personal saving encouraged. In relation to public expenditure this means that outlay on current services should either be reduced or be paid for out of existing, rather than newly-created, money.  Reduction of such expenditure is not possible without a drastic and undesirable reversal of policy: the Government do not consider it necessary or justifiable to cut back on social welfare, education or agriculture, or to refuse, as an employer, to extend to the public service a standard of pay increases comparable with those granted in outside employments.  Effectively, therefore, the only course open to the Government is that of seeing that the increase in current expenditure this year beyond budgetary expectations is met, as far as possible, from current revenue rather than by extra borrowing from the banks.  Higher taxation and post office charges are necessary for this purpose.  Policy aims must also include a less liberal use of credit for consumer purposes and an increase in personal saving.</P>
    <P>The general increase in incomes is having its impact on the Exchequer. The cost in 1968/69 of the public service pay increase is estimated at close <Col N="2054" /> on £9 million; and price and income supports for agriculture are likely to cost some £6 million more than was foreseen last April.</P>
    <P>The excess on agriculture arises mainly on wheat and milk.  The over-production of wheat this year in relation to bread and flour needs will involve the Exchequer in making good a loss of up to £1½ million on the disposal of the surplus.  The record milk output will draw £4 million more from the Exchequer by way of subsidy than was provided in the Budget last April. The increases in the milk price allowance announced yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries calls for a further £625,000 this year and £1.65 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Since 1962 the milk subsidy, including the quality bonus, has been increased by 7½d. a gallon.  Supplies of milk to creameries have risen in the intervening six years by over 60 per cent.  The total support provided by the Exchequer has gone up from £3 million to £25 million.  This figure of £25 million does not include an Exchequer liability of about £2½ million which will have to be discharged in disposing, as opportunity arises, of surplus butter stocks.</P>
    <P>A few facts about milk may help to put the problem in perspective.  This year about 520 million gallons of milk will be delivered to creameries.  Of this, 200 million gallons will be consumed at home, mainly as butter.  All the rest of the milk must be exported in some form, at a loss which increases steeply with the quantity exported.  In 1968 about 240 million gallons will be exported mainly to the United Kingdom. The export market price is on average 1s 1d a gallon; the farmer's net return of 2s 2d a gallon comes from this and from an Exchequer subsidy of 1s 1d a gallon.  In other words, the Exchequer is supporting these 240 million gallons of milk on the basis of one pound for each pound's worth of milk produced &mdash;a high rate of subsidy justifiable only on the basis that the associated production of cattle and beef is of great value to the economy.</P>
    <P>The remaining 80 million gallons of current milk production have to be sold outside the UK market.  Here the <Col N="2055" /> element in the farmers' return supplied by the export market price averages only about 2d a gallon.  It costs the country more to produce this milk than the country gets for it abroad and it is scarcely open to question that agricultural resources could be used to better advantage.  The world market for dairy products seems likely to remain depressed for years ahead.  For this reason it is nationally important that there should be a switch-over, at the margin, from milk to beef production, for which the market prospects are much better.  The Government, therefore, decided to confine the extra assistance for milk to farmers whose annual deliveries to creameries do not exceed 7,000 gallons&mdash;these include all the smaller farmers&mdash;and to introduce a new incentive to encourage production of beef which is not associated with increased output of milk for sale off farms.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry is in a position to reduce processing costs by the amalgamation and reorganisation of creameries, for which substantial State grants are available.  This will yield higher incomes to farmers without an increase in milk sales.  To achieve economies of scale, separating stations should have an annual capacity of 1 million gallons.  Operating costs decline from 2¼d a gallon to 1d a gallon as capacity rises from 200,000 to 1 million gallons.</P>
    <P>To help those herd owners not in commercial milk production, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has announced the terms of a new beef incentive scheme to be introduced as from 1st April next.  The cost in that year is estimated at over £2 million which will be an additional charge on taxation.  This scheme should offer a definite incentive to increased beef production through the development of suckling or nurse herds.</P>
    <P>The House will recall the statement of the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech that, in the course of the year, some liabilities might arise for which specific provision was not made and which were not covered by the allowance for errors of estimation.  The Minister said that, if through increases <Col N="2056" /> in incomes and public expenditure, an unfavourable balance of payments were threatened, the Government might have to introduce additional taxes.</P>
    <P>In fact, apart from the £15 million of extra expenditure on public service pay and on agriculture, other liabilities have materialised this year; these will absorb most of the allowance for errors of estimation.  Fortunately the revenue is fairly buoyant and should bring in £7½ million more than the budgetary estimate.  This will reduce the estimated excess of current expenditure over revenue from £18¾ million to £11¼ million.</P>
    <P>A deficit of this size, which would become much wider as 1969 progressed, would give a powerful impulse to inflation and must, therefore, be taken in hand right away.  So far as taxation is used to withdraw purchasing power, it is my intention that it should do so without affecting the cost of essentials of life and with the maximum impact on the less essential items of expenditure, of which many are imported.  The most suitable general tax from this standpoint is the wholesale tax, which does not apply to food, fuel, petrol and oils, clothing, medicines, books, drink, tobacco or items exempt from turnover tax.  I propose that the rate of wholesale tax be increased by 5 per cent as from 1st January next.  The yield in the final quarter of this year will be only £1¼ million; in a full year it will be £8¾ million.  The yield from this tax will be buttressed by raising the rates of duty on tobacco, beer and spirits with effect from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>I propose to increase the main rate of customs duty on leaf tobacco by the equivalent of 3d on a packet of 20 standard-size plain cigarettes, having made allowance for the incidence of turnover tax.  The prices of these cigarettes will, however, rise by 4d for 20. The additional 1d represents an increase which the tobacco manufacturers have found to be essential to cover increased costs as a result of the devaluation of sterling in November, 1967.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has accepted the case for this increase.  Corresponding increases will apply to other tobacco products including tipped cigarettes, pipe tobaccos, snuffs and cigars.  There <Col N="2057" /> will be the usual charge on tobacco stocks held by manufacturers at 5 p.m. today.</P>
    <P>I also propose to increase the beer duties by the equivalent of 2d a pint and the spirits duties by the equivalent of 2d a glass, making an allowance in each case for the incidence of turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The services provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are expected, taking one year with another, to produce the income necessary to cover expenditure, give a reasonable return on capital invested and provide adequately for pension liability and depreciation. This has been the traditional policy of successive Governments in relation to Post Office finances.</P>
    <P>Post Office charges have not been increased since 1964.  In the past two financial years the commercial accounts of the Department have shown deficits of over £400,000 a year. These deficits were attributable mainly to the effect of wage awards and improvements in conditions in the postal service, where staff and related costs constitute some 77 per cent of total expenditure.  The telephone service was, of course, also affected and had, in addition, to pay for the substantial capital investment of recent years.</P>
    <P>Because of current increases in wages and salaries the Post Office now faces extra costs which are likely to raise the overall deficit on the services to over £3 million a year.  It would clearly not be practicable to eliminate an annual loss of this magnitude without rate increases.  Details of the revised charges, which will be brought into operation on 1st January next, will be announced by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I shall refer here only to the principal changes.</P>
    <P>There will be increases of 1d each in the 5d rate of letters and in the 3d rate for postcards, printed papers, newspapers, etc.  Inland parcel rates will be raised by amounts ranging from 6d to 2s 6d, according to weight. There will also be increases in foreign letter and parcel charges and in poundage for postal orders and money orders.</P>
    <P>The minimum rates for inland and cross-Channel telegrams will be raised by 1s 0d.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2058" /> The telephone rentals for residence and business lines will be increased by £2 a year and the connection charges for exchange lines by £5.  The charge for local calls from subscribers' telephones will be increased by 1d, and from coin-box telephones by 2d, but the latter increases will not be put into effect until late next year.</P>
    <P>Apart from some adjustment consequent upon the changes in the local fees, trunk call charges will not be increased.</P>
    <P>This year's Christmas shopping, posting and telephoning will not be affected by the increases proposed in the wholesale tax and post office charges.  Because the greater part of this financial year is already gone and these particular proposals come into effect only on 1st January, the extra revenue accruing to the Exchequer by 31st March from all the changes proposed is not expected to exceed £4.2 million.  In a full year the increases in Post Office charges will offset the increased commercial deficit which would otherwise add to the budgetary gap; the tax increases may be counted on to produce £15.4 million.  Extra revenue of £4.2 million will not enable us to avoid a deficit in the current budget for 1968-69&mdash;the kind of taxation needed to do that would be much too severe and would be quite unjustifiable on economic grounds&mdash;but it will be effective during the year 1969 in reducing what would otherwise be a dangerous contribution, by way of budgetary deficit, to an already inflationary situation.  It will help to keep the balance of payments deficit within manageable bounds.  The estimates of current expenditure in 1969-70 which we have obtained from Departments point to an inevitable increase far exceeding any hope of revenue buoyancy and there is no doubt whatever of the need for every penny of the extra revenue now being raised to meet the extra expenditure to be faced next year under existing commitments and policies.  To illustrate the magnitude of this extra non-capital expenditure, I may quote some of the increases over the current year which are looming up&mdash;over £9 million on Central Fund services, as much as £8 million for agriculture, £5½ million for education, <Col N="2059" /> £2½ million for social welfare and over £2 million for health.  It will obviously be necessary to adopt a very severe attitude in 1969 towards new expenditure proposals.</P>
    <P>As a further check to consumer spending, the Government have decided to introduce moderate hire-purchase restrictions.  Orders effective from midnight tonight have been made under the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Act, 1960, prescribing minimum deposits and maximum repayment periods for a range of goods.  For private cars, motorcycles, scooters, record players, radiograms, tape-recorders and juke boxes the minimum deposit has been fixed at 25 per cent of the cash price.  There will be a minimum deposit of 15 per cent on radios and certain items of domestic electrical equipment. The maximum repayment period for all the specified articles has been fixed at 30 months.  Conditions of this kind are already applied by many hire-purchase firms in their own interest and the terms fixed by the orders cannot be regarded as severe.</P>
    <P>In view of the problems facing the industries concerned, the hire-purchase controls are not being applied to television sets or refrigerators.</P>
    <P>As regards bank credit generally, the Government were in agreement with the warning issued by the Central Bank on 30th September last that available credit should be reserved so far as possible for strictly productive purposes.  A less liberal attitude to credit for consumer purpose is obviously desirable in present circumstances.  The Government regard it as important that adequate financial resources should remain available for the public capital programme and for productive activities in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The intake from small savings has been disappointing for some time.  In the current year so far there has been a net outflow of £1.6 million from the Saving Banks.  This is a disimprovement of £4.7 million as compared with the corresponding period last year.  I have, therefore, decided on certain measures to improve the attractiveness of the various savings media available in the public sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> The rate of interest payable on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank will be increased from 3½ per cent to four per cent.  Taking account of the income tax concession on the first £70 of interest, this will give a gross yield equivalent to six per cent on the first £1,750 invested.  The present limit of £5,000 on deposits will be abolished.  The amount which may be withdrawn on demand at any of the 1,400 Saving Bank Post Offices will be increased from £10 to £30 and the amount which may be withdrawn by telegraphic advice will be increased from £25 to £100.  These improvements will come into effect on 1st January, 1969.</P>
    <P>The interest payable on ordinary deposits in the Trustee Savings Banks will be increased to four per cent and the withdrawal facilities will be improved also.  The Trustee Savings Banks are being authorised to introduce on 21st November a new type of investment account carrying an interest rate of 6½ per cent.  Tax will not be deducted at source, but will be assessed by reference to the income of the recipients. Any person who holds an ordinary deposit of £50 in the Trustee Saving Bank may open this new investment account.</P>
    <P>The savings certificates now on issue give a tax-free yield equivalent to eight per cent gross if held to maturity and sales of the certificates continue to be reasonably satisfactory.  The only change which I propose to make is to increase the permitted maximum holding from £2,500 to £3,500.</P>
    <P>Net receipts from prize bonds are tapering off, mainly through increased withdrawals.  In order to encourage bond holders to retain their investment for longer periods there will be special draws for five prizes of £1,000 each in every month in which no draw is held at present.  This will begin as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.</P>
    <P>A new type of savings medium, to be called an investment bond, will be put on sale early in 1969.  Bonds may be purchased in units of £10 through any bank or post office and will carry interest at the rate of 6½ per cent per annum.  Interest will be paid to the <Col N="2061" /> purchasers half-yearly, without deduction of tax at source.  A bond which is held for five years will receive a special bonus of £3 per cent on repayment.</P>
    <P>I hope that these measures will attract and retain more small savings. They are in line with the views and advice of the savings committee and I hope they will further the committee's good work.</P>
    <P>It is customary at this time of year to float a national loan which provides a suitable outlet for the investment of longer-term funds.  This year's loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 11th November.  It will be for £25 million.  The issue price will be £97½ per cent and the rate of interest will be 7½ per cent per annum.  The stock will be redeemed at per not later than 1993 and may be redeemed at any time from July, 1988.  The yield to final redemption is £7 14s 6d per cent, as good as any obtainable from comparable investments at present.  The loan will carry all the usual income tax and death duty concessions, and in addition will carry the right of conversion into any other Government issue offered for public subscription within the State during the next three years.</P>
    <P>Life assurance companies and other financial institutions have applied for <Col N="2062" /> and are being allotted £9.8 million, and Departmental funds are applying for £3.2 million.  The remaining £12 million available for public subscription has been underwritten jointly by the associated banks and the Government. If applications for more than £12 million are received from the public, the allocation to Departmental funds will be scaled down.</P>
    <P>I must express my appreciation of the record-making support given to this loan by the financial institutions.  This augurs well for the success of the issue and is an expression of confidence in the economic and financial security of the State.  I am sure that, leaving matters of current political controversy aside, all Deputies in the House will support the loan, which will be used for the financing of the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>In bringing these financial proposals before the House at this time, the Government are confident that the House and the people will realise that the proposals are intended and are needed to safeguard our economic progress. I know full well that the increases in taxes and charges will not be welcomed but this Government never flinched from taking unpopular measures when they are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have gone stone mad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to express our regret that the Minister for Finance has not been able to be here today and I join with the Taoiseach in expressing the hope that he may recover quickly from his present indisposition.</P>
      <P>May I deal first of all with what the Taoiseach has said in relation to the national loan?  I think I can say that, so far as we on these benches are concerned, we have always supported a national loan which we considered to be necessary and desirable in the interests and the advancement of the country.  We continue to express that support.  We do so because we regard the economy of this country as being sound fundamentally.  We can say that it has continued to be sound, despite the gross mismanagement from which it has suffered during recent years.</P>
      <P>When we say that the economy is sound today, and it is economically, we do not say that it does not suffer from clear and significant problems and difficulties.  I shall not go into detail about these at this stage but the economic difficulties and the problems which face our country at the moment can easily be spelled out in full, in housing, in higher unemployment figures, in continuing emigration and in an appallingly low level of social welfare standards.  To the intent and to the extent that the money now sought by way of national loan can assist towards the solution of these problems we will support this loan. Indeed, we would always support any loan which would represent productive capital investment so far as the people are concerned and which will be designed towards advancing the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we support this loan, and we do so, we will advise, in so far as our advice is capable of reaching those with money to invest, strong support for this attractive loan and for its attractive terms.  Indeed, they must be somewhat unprecedented but, at the same time, I should be wrong if I did not, from this side of the House, deplore <Col N="2064" /> the timing of the announcement of this loan.  It certainly is without precedent that a Government that is facing, in this House, a motion of no confidence should, on the day that that motion is designed to be taken, announce a national loan.  Has it been designed or so thought that it will divert or stifle this debate?  If so, another think may be necessary on the part of the Government and its Leader. This Government is going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Government will not have the responsibility in the next few months of solving the problems which this loan is designed to help.  They will be the responsibility of a new government and I believe that will be a Fine Gael Government.  To introduce this loan at this time and in these circumstances, appears to me to be an exercise in timing which is, to put it mildly, inappropriate.</P>
      <P>This loan might easily have been announced last month or next month but the Taoiseach has chosen to do it today so today it is.  I welcome it for its terms for it is an indication that some steps are being taken by the Government towards a solution of the problems that face our country and our people.  Having said that, I wish to make it quite clear that our support indicates no confidence in the present Government and those concerned with the loan.</P>
      <P>May I pass from the loan and may I say a word or two with regard to the financial resolution which the Taoiseach's words introduced?  I did not believe that it would be possible for any Minister for Finance or any person acting as such, to introduce, for the second time within a matter of months, what can no longer be regarded&mdash; though it was so described in the papers&mdash;as a mini-Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the kind of minimal or minor adjustment which the Minister for Finance indicated might be necessary if there was a possible error in estimation.  At the time of the Budget he indicated that if a minimal or minor adjustment proposal of that kind might be necessary, he would introduce <Col N="2065" /> it.  This is far more.  This is something approaching a significant financial proposal by the Government in the fall of the year, at the beginning of the second half of the financial year.</P>

      <P>Unless Deputies appreciate what is involved in this&mdash;I have no doubt if Deputies here do not appreciate it the people in the country generally will be quick to realise the significance.  This discloses an error a few months ago by the Government and the Minister for Finance of something around £18¾ millions.  That is an unforgivable miscalculation of what the financial requirements of this country would be. How was it that in April the Government could introduce a Budget which was intended to be the yearly proposals in relation to our financial affairs and which erred so grievously and so drastically?</P>

      <P>Maybe the referendum.  Maybe it was a process of sugaring the pill.  One does not know. It is certain that one reason for the error has been that the Government did not appreciate what wheat was going to cost this year.  There was not a farmer in Ireland who did not know it. There was not a Deputy representing a tillage area in Ireland who did not know it.  The only person who did not know it was the Minister for Agriculture because he was not talking to the farmers.</P>

This year we were going to have a surplus of wheat and under our policy a surplus of wheat would mean an indent on the Central Fund.  The Minister for Agriculture did not know that.

      <P>He did not know milk production was rising this year and, although £21 million was provided by the Minister for Finance in his Budget, everybody else knew it was going to cost considerably more this year and it is certainly costing something in the order of £25 million or £25½ million.  This is the Government that is supposed to be looking after the affairs of the people of this country.  They do not even know what is good for themselves, as recent events have demonstrated.  How can they look after the affairs of the ordinary people when they cannot plan a simple Budget for 12 months ahead?  After four or five months they have to come in and now indicate that, although revenue has increased by £7½ million&mdash;let Deputies note that&mdash;over the Budget estimate, we are having the same old story again of more taxation, more indents on the people and more appeals to the ordinary people to tighten their belts and wait for the good times that are always just around the corner so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>

      <P>I would remind Deputies of the very serious situation of this country.  We have foretold it.  We pointed out, prior to the first Budget of this year, that with the collapse of our Second Programme <Col N="2067" /> for Economic Development we were getting back to a situation of drifting along from crisis to crisis.  We indicated that the Government were so devoid of policy that they would endeavour to chart a course for a month or a couple of weeks ahead bearing in mind existing political difficulties of one kind or another.  We indicated that without some form of interim planning and some form of all-over looking at the requirements of our economy we would be back to the situation of &ldquo;stop&mdash;go&rdquo; which has been developed and acted upon for so long.  Here we are five months later back again.</P>

After the appalling incompetence shown by the Fianna Fáil Governments in 1964 and in 1965, and with the deflation of 1965 and 1966 from which it took the economy of this country last year and this year to recover, we are back again into the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; situation because this Government have no plan and no policy and do not know where they are going except that they are going out.  That is the result of failure to decide on a workable and achievable policy, of failure to decide on targets and aims which are attainable.  The result has been that this Government are living from day to day and from month to month.  The people suffer.</P>

      <P>The fact is that by reason of a failure to foresee, new demands are now being put on the people.  There is going to be an increase in the wholesale tax which, despite what the Taoiseach has said, is going to affect significantly the cost-of-living. There are going to be various other increases designed, the Taoiseach says, to take away excess purchasing power.  It is certainly going to lead to a business recession and the appalling result is that, directly resulting from incompetence in Government, we are now going back to a period of deflation.  I do not want to say anything that might be more strictly relevant on the motion that will shortly be moved&mdash;the motion of no confidence in the present Government&mdash;but the first indication of no confidence in the present Government is shown by the Government itself today.  They have no confidence in their own policies, plans and Budgets and they are endeavouring now to gloss over a very serious defect that has emerged from their own thinking and planning even in the short space of 12 months.  I have little doubt that the people will look with interest at this latest indication that this Government do not know where they are going.</P>

      <P>The Government have faith in the readiness of the Dáil and the people to support a Government which does its duty even in face of the temporary unpopularity this must at times entail.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach serious about this?  Is he serious about this when we remember the Budget introduced in April of this year&mdash;a Budget which certainly could be called a referendum Budget because it was designed for no purpose other than to get support for the Fianna Fáil Party in the proposals in respect of the changes in the Constitution. Here we are, six months later, presented, mark you, not with a mini-Budget but with a Budget which, in my opinion, will have a great impact on this country as far as the cost of living is concerned, as far as jobs are concerned, as far as our general economic progress is concerned.  There is one thing that may console the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party in this Budget and it is that there will not be a general election until after next April.</P>

      <P>The Government have perpetrated a huge fraud on our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2070" /> Every single thing that has happened now could have been forecast in April this year.  It was no secret in April last that there was a movement for an increase in wages and salaries.  It was no secret that cattle numbers were dropping and that we would have a balance of payments problem.  All of these facts, and this Budget, reflect the neglect of the Government due to the referendum campaign in which we have been engaged in the past 12 months&mdash; 12 wasted months during which neither the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance nor any member of the Cabinet gave any attention whatsoever to the trends which have now been described by the Taoiseach who is acting for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is true, indeed, that we had a spectacular increase in our imports.  It is true that exports have not kept pace with these imports.  The result is that we have a balance of payments problem this year of an expected £15 million.</P>
    <P>I remember saying to the Minister for Finance, in the course of the Budget debate of last year, that we could not expect the same results, as far as the market and the prices are concerned for our cattle exported to Great Britain.  It is true that there has been an offset to the extent that industrial exports have increased by 15 per cent but this has not been sufficient to make up for the expected deficit of £15 million or £16 million in the balance of payment for the year 1968.  That is not too bad but we are told that, if corrective measures are not taken, our deficit for the year 1969 will be £53 million.</P>
    <P>The Government must decide in what direction their policy lies as far as their main priority is concerned.  Is it to be employment or are there to be purely financial considerations related directly to our balance of payments, to our external reserves or to our external assets?  The Labour Party say that the priority should be employment.</P>
    <P>In accordance with what happened in 1964&mdash;four years ago&mdash;it seems to me that we are going to sacrifice jobs, employment, to the financial considerations of the balance of payments or our external reserves.  Last year, the <Col N="2071" /> Minister for Finance said there was no need for our external reserves to grow any more.  I understand they stand at about £225 million to £230 million.  Of what use is that £225 million?  Are we to use this money in order to employ people here in their own country or is it still to be invested in Great Britain by the banks and by private interests? We believe that, if there is any use at all for that money, it could be employed to give Irish people work here in their own country.</P>
    <P>The economic forecasters indicate that employment in this country can be expanded.  We had the peculiar situation last year, and the year before, where industrial production increased but where we had not a corresponding increase in employment.  We are told by the economic experts and industrial experts that, if no restrictive measures are taken by the Government or by the banks as far as credit or the availability of capital is concerned, there can be a much-needed increase in employment.  It seems to me, therefore, that restrictions on hire purchase, on credit, on the availability of capital, will put us back into the situation which this Government created in 1964 in which we found ourselves, in 1965 and 1966, in a virtual depression.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> If necessary, we should be prepared to run down our external reserves in order to ensure that employment will be expanded here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Why &ldquo;down&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have an increase in capital inflow which, in turn, will be the means of cutting down the deficit we have in our balance of payments.  What are these there for? What are they to be used for except to employ our own people?  We have all asked the question over the past few years: what would be a safe figure for our external reserves?  It is not too much to ask the Minister for Finance and the Government why this money should lie abroad when we have this trading problem that, in 1969, will leave us with a deficit of about £65 million.</P>
      <P>Despite what the Taoiseach said in reply to questions today, our unemployment figure is eight per cent higher than last year and our employment targets have absolutely fallen down. Therefore, it seems to me that we are sacrificing men to the principle of preserving our balance of payments and maintaining the £240 million or so that the banks in this country hold in Britain and in other countries as external reserves.</P>
      <P>For various reasons and for all of the foregoing reasons, we do not propose to support the measures put before us today.  We believe these measures will have a very harsh effect on many of our people.  The 4d on the packet of 20 cigarettes, the somewhat similar amount on the ounce of tobacco, the 2d on the pint, 2d per glass on spirits&mdash;all these will have an effect on people who got the increase of 7s 6d from August this year, old age pensioners and unemployment assistance beneficiaries.  Those who are in the insurance benefit group will also have their 7s 6d reduced by what they will have to pay for tobacco, beer and spirits.  The increases in the telephone charges, on local calls, on letters, and so on, will also have their impact and, of course, the wholesale tax, apart from the exceptions that were mentioned, will affect the cost of living of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> A lot of the action that has been taken here today has been taken because salaries and wages have increased.  No matter what workers do to better themselves as regards their wages or salaries, they appear to create a situation where there is inflation or overspending. Where a worker gets an extra suit, buys himself a car or a television set or a radio or some other luxury like that, the attitude of the financial experts appears to be that he should not have them, that some of the money should be taken away from him.  It appears to be as simple as that to the members of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us should begrudge the workers of this country, the wage and salary earners, the farmers, and every other section, anything they get.  As far as industrial production is concerned, the workers have earned any increase they got this year.  They have more than matched in production the increases they got in wages and salaries.  If you are to have, as Deputy O'Higgins described it, this stop-go-stop mentality over the next four or five years there will be despair amongst the workers, despair amongst all the people; they will say that any increased income which inures to them will be siphoned off by the Government.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to vote for these proposals announced by the Taoiseach. We do not propose to endorse the policy of the Government.  We believe these proposals are not courageous, as they have been described, but cowardly, proposals which the Government were afraid to bring in prior to the referendum. In view of the fact that we have had so many Budgets this year, it seems that Fianna Fáil are a Government who can budget for all seasons according to the political climate.  If they think they can fool the people with these proposals in the guise of a patriotic appeal by the Taoiseach they are very much mistaken.  The people showed in the referendum they could not be codded.  They are not going to be codded by any of the sleight-of-hand tricks of the Fianna Fáil Party, who are now, believe it or not, building up for the general election of 1969.  This <Col N="2074" /> is fraudulent.  They want to build up enough revenue between now and April and they do not care what happens in regard to unemployment or the cost of living.  Fianna Fáil did not fool the people in the referendum.  They will not fool them with these proposals, and they certainly will not fool them at the time of the next election.</P>

    <P>(9)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution or on the 12th day of November, 1968, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in paragraph (5) of this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th day of November, 1968, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 27th day of March, 1969, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(10)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(11)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty imposed by paragraph (5) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (5) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(12)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory <Col N="2079" /> effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <P>Replying to Deputy L'Estrange's intrusions, it was my intention to move this motion in conjunction with the financial proposals but as a result of the meeting of the Whips earlier today, I decided to split the two motions.  Three of the financial resolutions have been passed and the fourth has been suspended until next Tuesday when the debate on the resolutions will proceed.  In the meantime, I understand that this debate will finish on Thursday at 5 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is naturally prompted by the result of the recent referendum. Therefore, one can only conclude that the motions involve a certain amount of political opportunism.  I say that deliberately because I know that only political opportunism can be relied upon to bring together in the Dáil two such oddly associated Parties as Fine Gael and Labour.  They will unite on this motion or on their respective motions which, I presume, will have the same end result&mdash;no confidence on the part of Fine Gael and, speaking in an election, on the part of Labour. They will unite on this motion as against the Government but they know that in a general election they will go their own separate ways, or so they say <Col N="2092" /> they will, each asking the voters for a majority of the seats but each knowing full well that neither will achieve that majority, intending, instead, that a bargain will be made in some way or another, on some basis or another after the election in order to secure office on some basis on which the people will not have been consulted beforehand.</P>
    <P>The electors, in such an arrangement as we envisage and as, no doubt, both of these Parties envisage, will be kept in the dark as to what policies such a Government would pursue or, indeed, the electors would be kept in the dark as to what Government they would be voting for.  Surely, this is not the kind of democracy that the Irish people want?</P>
    <P>The Opposition Parties now frantically want to believe that the rejection of the Government's referendum proposals means that the people want Fianna Fáil to resign office.  Fianna Fáil were given a clear mandate in 1965, a clear constitutional mandate to form the Government of this country in that year, and this mandate has been most convincingly re-affirmed in successive by-elections.  The mandate is still valid and it runs up to April, 1970. The referendum is now over; the people have made known their views and their preferences on the issues which we put forward to them as their direct concern in their capacity as electors.  We make no apologies for consulting them on such issues but we do say, and in this we have the support of unbiased comment from many sides, that rejection of the referendum proposals was no more a demand that the Government's period of office should be shortened than that an acceptance of them would be that it should be lengthened.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that lessons are not to be learned as a result of this referendum&mdash;and the lessons will have been well taken, I can assure the Parties opposite&mdash;but we have no intention of resigning.  We will go before the electorate to seek a renewal of the support they have so consistently given us, the support they have so consistently given our policies, when the proper time comes.  I believe, and my Party believes, that to throw in the sponge now would be to fail the people by reneging our responsibilities as a Government.  It <Col N="2093" /> might have been considered by some, perhaps, as clever tactics on my part immediately or very soon after the referendum results became known to seek a dissolution, but apart altogether from the constitutional requirement, following the recent census, that a new electoral law be enacted redefining constituency boundaries before the next general election, I knew and the Government knew&mdash;indeed I announced it in two separate speeches in public before the referendum was held&mdash;that there were, as I said earlier today, economic clouds on the horizon which could gather to the point of becoming a storm of economic recession next year, that is, unless adequate and timely remedial action were taken.</P>
    <P>It was not our intention to run away from these problems and, as I said, we could have done so.  It was not our intention to run away as the two Coalition Governments did before, leaving problems of this nature and indeed perhaps more serious problems behind them.  It has never been a characteristic of Fianna Fáil to run away from problems of this nature or, indeed, of any other kind.  We are not afraid and never will be to tell the people the facts of a situation, even though they may be unpleasant facts.  We are not afraid and never will be to take decisions that we know will be politically unpopular, as long as they are in the country's best interests.</P>
    <P>I may say again that the time for a general election is not yet.  There is an urgent need for Government action to safeguard the progress that has been made in the economy over the past ten years and, I might say, the spectacular progress made in the last two years during which we attained such a high rate of economic growth that we can be regarded as being almost unique in Europe at the present time, a high rate gained under no other Government except under Fianna Fáil.  Certainly over a sustained period like that such a rate of growth was never attained in this country.  Under the Coalition Governments, and particularly under the last one, our economy suffered from stagnation&mdash;in fact I think stagnation is too mild a term to apply&mdash;and certainly in the 1956-57 period our <Col N="2094" /> economy was running downhill very, very rapidly.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, it may be a hard enough task to stop something from reversing downhill but once the reversal has begun it is a very difficult task indeed.  We succeeded in doing that.  We came into power in the spring of 1957 and found the economic engine running at full speed backwards.  We stopped the engine, reversed it and put it at full speed in a forward direction. The difficulty that we face now is of an entirely different kind.  It is precisely because we have been doing so well and are doing so well at present that a danger has arisen which we must bring under control.  That danger is that the speed of our advance is such that we risk running off the rails and we must, therefore, apply the brakes a little in order to ensure that we move safely, as well as quickly, towards our objectives.</P>
    <P>Now, before I come to the substance of the motion in my name, I should like to refer briefly to the charges that have been made, charges that the holding of the referendum was a power grab by a small clique in the Fianna Fáil Government; and I should like to refer briefly also to the suggestion that I did not personally favour the holding of the referendum, that I did not personally favour the proposal, in particular, in the Fourth Amendment&mdash;the single seat straight vote system&mdash;and the proposal to establish an independent commission to recommend to the Dáil the determination of the constituencies.  I want to say here and now that there is no power grabbing clique in this Government.</P>

It was made as a result of a decision taken, a decision approved by all the Members of the Government, a decision of which all our Parliamentary Party approved, and a decision which, I want now to affirm, I personally and wholeheartedly supported.</P>

      <P>In bringing the financial proposals to the House earlier today the Government were confident that the House and the people would realise that these proposals are intended and, indeed, needed to safeguard the present high rate of economic progress.  I know full well that the increases in taxation and in other charges will not be welcomed but, as I said earlier, this Government have never flinched from taking unpopular measures so long as those measures were in the national interest.</P>
      <P>I propose now to give an indication why I think the affirmative motion in my name, the vote of confidence in the Government, should be passed by the House and accepted by the country. When we came into office in 1957 the state of the economy was one of crisis. The country was on the verge of despair.  A floodtide of emigration was sweeping the population away.  Unemployment was at its highest in the recent history of the State, running at about 95,000 or 96,000 on the unemployed register in the last weeks of 1956 and the first weeks of 1957. The economy was being rocked by a balance of payments crisis.  It was making no progress.  In the wake of all this, and this is, perhaps, the most serious consequence, the morale of the people was at its lowest ebb for many generations.  We immediately started on the uphill task of restoring confidence in the nation's capacity to go forward, socially and economically. As other western European countries were doing at that time, we strove to develop the country's potential for growth and to maintain this growth at the highest possible level without incurring excessive balance of payments deficits.  Linked with this was the objective of ensuring that the less fortunate sections of our community would share in the growing national prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The First Programme for Economic Expansion introduced in 1958 marked a watershed in our economic history. <Col N="2096" /> I think one set of statistics should be enough to establish the greatness of the change that was wrought.  In the years 1954 to 1956 the Irish economy had shuffled along at a miserably low rate of about ½ per cent increase per annum and that miserably low rate of increase took place in a general atmosphere of despondency.  The growth rate was raised by our First and Second Programmes 3¾ per cent per annum on average over the last decade. This is a growth rate that stands up spectacularly well by any international comparisons.</P>
    <P>Over the years 1954 to 1956 exports declined by £2 million per annum on average.  They rose by an average of £16 million a year from 1957 to 1967 and, at the present time, they stand at a spectacularly high record level. I shall refer in detail &mdash; Deputy L'Estrange may smile&mdash;to this rate of increase in exports in a moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our external assets averaged from £241 million in 1953 to £183 million in 1956.  From that low point they have climbed to £295 million in 1967.  Deputy Corish, in the course of his comments on my statement earlier this afternoon, said there was no problem at all about diminishing external assets; we should not bother about maintaining these payments invested abroad.  Now Deputy Corish was a Member of the Government which permitted this decline in external assets and that decline was followed by a growing lack of confidence in the country, by despondency, by a lowering of morale, by a floodtide of emigration and a high level of unemployment.  All these were inevitable consequences of permitting the situation to develop as it did in 1956 and 1957 and that situation developed largely because the Government of the day rather than ask the people for the necessary taxation to maintain a healthy and steady growth rate in the economy, drew on external assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those years, too, and particularly in 1956, total savings formed 7.1 per cent of gross national product.  The ratio for 1967 is 12 per cent.  I could <Col N="2097" /> pile up the evidence, contrasting our successes with the failures of the Coalition Government.  An unbiassed answer to the question as to which experience gives ground for greater confidence&mdash; again, I refer back to Deputy Corish's facile suggestion about using up our external assets to create employment&mdash; can be found in the greater flow of foreign investment into our country. Foreign investors apply very hard tests as to stability and profitability in deciding where to invest.  In the period 1954 to 1956 there was an average capital outflow from this country of almost £1 million a year.  By contrast, between 1957 and 1967, we have enjoyed an average capital inflow of over £20 million a year.  These figures speak loudly and clearly and we are content to be judged on our record since we assumed office in 1957.  Over that period we have doubled expenditure on social welfare, trebled expenditure on health and education, and given a fourfold increase to agriculture.  Outlay connected with industry has increased dramatically and I will refer to details of this increase presently.</P>
    <P>State expenditure on agriculture has been progressively increased over the past decade from approximately £20 million in 1958-59 to an estimated £78 million in the current year.  This, I think, is evidence of the Government's special concern for the improvement of our basic industry, and of our practical help in raising farmers' incomes.  These incomes as the House is aware, and, indeed, as the farmers themselves are aware, have been increasing at the rate of about nine per cent per annum in the past two years.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, the major schemes we introduced were those for calved heifers, the eradication of diseases, beef, mutton and lamb subsidies, incentive bonuses for small farms, headage payments for farrowed sows and mountain sheep, grants for glasshouses, grants for milk coolers and other equipment.  Apart from new schemes, assistance under existing schemes has been increased in almost every sphere, as in the case of the advisory service, farm buildings and water supplies, the land project, fertiliser subsidies and higher guaranteed prices for wheat, barley, pigs and milk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2098" /> I do not propose to go down the list exhaustively and furnish the very many other instances of expanded aid to agriculture.  Deputies who are particularly interested in this matter are, of course, familiar with them.  Suffice it to say, however, that by increasing support for commodity prices, making successful drives to eliminate livestock diseases and pests, by widening the range of grants available for building and other improvements, and extending the advisory and research services, the Government have done as much as was possibly in their power to improve agriculture while having, at the same time, due regard to the claims of other sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the Government's programme for economic expansion&mdash;and now I come to the manufacturing side&mdash;the volume of output in manufacturing industries in Ireland has grown at an average annual rate of about 6½ per cent.  Employment given by those industries rose from 142,000 in 1958 to 177,000 in 1967.  In the same period industrial exports rose from the 1958 level of £33 million to an estimated £147 million in 1967. The total capital invested in new industrial enterprises by this State in the nine years from 1959 to 1967 is estimated at £98 million.  Of this sum the State's investment was roughly about one-quarter.</P>
    <P>These industries have an employment potential of some 44,000 people and already about 30,000 of our people are engaged in good employment in them.  Most of these enterprises are, happily, producing for export.  I think this trend is reflected in the satisfactory expansion of industrial exports in recent years.  Since 1957, industry has played a major role in the development of our economy and has provided a valuable source of employment for those who have left the land for one reason or another in the past 12 years or so.</P>
    <P>During the most recent intercensal period, total employment showed a rise of 13,000 in all.  The Government are determined to intensify the industrial promotion programme.  The part played by new firms in the economy has become increasingly important and this trend is expected to continue as the <Col N="2099" /> scale of new projects increases.  The amalgamation of An Foras Tionscal with the IDA, and given as they are increased resources, together with the training facilities provided by An Chomhairle Oiliúna should ensure that a steady stream of new firms providing worthwhile employment will be attracted to Ireland.  Since 1959 the Industrial Credit Company has advanced capital totalling £28 million to industry, the major portion being loan capital.  Again this is evidence of the confidence which the industries concerned place in our future progress.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the Shannon Industrial Estate.  Since its inauguration in 1959, I think we can claim that it has made a notable contribution to the development of industry in the western part of the country.  At present there are upwards of 4,000 people gainfully employed there.  Problems are bound to arise in a period of rapid development such as we have achieved since 1957 and I think we have endeavoured to meet them.  We met those problems in 1965 and in 1966, and when we explained them to the people during the course of those by-elections to which I have referred, they acknowledged that these problems were there.  They knew the reasons why we had to introduce remedial measures, and they saw the end result&mdash;two subsequent years of unprecedented growth. The people having been told what the situation now is, and the people having been told the necessity for remedial measures, I believe they will accept them in the same way and we can go forward with the same type of growth we sustained over the past two years.</P>
    <P>We are glad to have been able to make many worthwhile innovations and improvements in such areas as manpower forecasting, worker training, placement services and working conditions themselves.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna to which I have referred was set up in 1967 mainly to train unemployed and redundant workers.  We also have a redundancy payment scheme which provides resettlement allowances for displaced workers.  I think this was welcomed by Deputies on all sides of the House as a most valuable addition to our social security scheme.  The fine <Col N="2100" /> performance of our exports to which I have referred gives grounds for confidence in the security of the additional employment that is being created and in the soundness of our industrial policy generally.</P>
    <P>Recognising the importance of investment in education as a foundation for economic development, we have in the past ten years spared no effort to improve our teaching systems and to bring higher education within the reach of all.  Again I want to say as I said before, that this has been a ten-year programme.  I had occasion earlier today in the House to mention the fact that our school building programme when we resumed office in 1957, was permitted to run down&mdash;not only permitted, but the Government of the day were obliged to let it run down because of a lack of capital resources.  Our first task was to ensure the restoration of our school building programme, and it was doubled within one year.</P>
    <P>The second task was to ensure that adequate training facilities would be available to increasing numbers of national teachers, that our vocational system would be expanded, as it was, that facilities would be created for higher technical education, that a system of grants and other assistance for secondary schools would be created in order to ensure first of all that an increasing number of national school pupils could be taken in, and in order to ensure as well that the system which we were about to introduce of free secondary education would not overtake the kind of accommodation we had.  All these things happened during that ten years and that is why I say that this programme of education was carefully developed and carefully thought out.</P>
    <P>The proof of the success of this programme may be found in the fact that since 1957 the number of pupils attending secondary schools has increased from 59,300 to 118,800&mdash;an increase of 100 per cent.  The number of fulltime registered secondary teachers has increased from 2,850 to 5,080.  In vocational education, the trend has been the same.  The number of pupils attending wholetime day courses has grown from 22,000 to 42,000 since 1957 and the number of teachers has grown from <Col N="2101" /> 1,500 to 2,800.  Student numbers in the universities have increased from 7,700 to 16,000 in the same period.  These substantial increases could not have been made, first of all, without this carefully thought-out programme of education and certainly not without very substantial capital investment in school buildings, in equipment and so on.</P>
    <P>Non-capital expenditure on education has more than trebled since 1957. School curricula have been modernised Career guidance has been introduced and modern teaching techniques and aids are now widely used.  The classrooms of yesterday have been transferred and are being transferred to the attractively-designed and well-equipped rooms of the present day. School textbooks are being provided free of cost where this is necessary.</P>
    <P>One can say, therefore, that there is equal opportunity for all.  What has long been the chief social objective of our educational policy has now been achieved or achieved to the point where no student need be denied, through lack of means, the opportunity of advancing to the highest reaches of education.</P>
    <P>In each of the last ten Budgets we have given increases in social welfare payments, the highlights being 10s a week in 1965 and 7s 6d this year.  I think it can be claimed and, indeed, well established that these increases exceed the general rise in prices and they have, therefore, improved significantly the position of social welfare beneficiaries, the unemployed, the disabled, the old, the blind and the widows.  Since 1957 we have increased non-contributory old age pensions and widows' pensions from 24s a week to 65s a week and we have raised unemployment assistance from 19s to 51s 6d a week in urban areas and by similar amounts in rural areas.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have extended the scope of social services generally. Contributory old age pensions were introduced by us in 1961 and allowances are now paid for all dependent children of insurance and assistance recipients.  The social assistance means tests have been relaxed and the insurance contribution conditions have been greatly eased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" /> What is particularly important and worth special mention is that small-holders in the western areas derived particular benefit from the relaxation of the means test in 1966 for unemployment assistance and the abolition of the employment period in 1967.  I think it can be claimed that these improvements are nothing less than a boon to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Last year, the position of disabled persons was greatly improved under the Occupational Injuries scheme.  The unemployed also benefited by the extension of the duration of employment benefit from six to 12 months.  The free transport and electricity schemes for old age pensioners which were introduced in 1967 are supplemented this year by the free television and radio licences scheme so that we are anxious that no section of the community should be deprived of a share in the growing national prosperity.</P>
    <P>The level of investment in the public capital programme is of the highest national importance because it represents half of the total national investment and generates, perhaps, a further quarter as a result of its incentive effect.  It is our policy to maintain expenditure on the programme at the highest possible level.  The external reserve position is sound.  We continue to give a high priority to investment that is productive in the sense that it gives rise to continued production of goods and services and thus generates the resources necessary to finance further investment.</P>
    <P>At the same time, adequate provision will be made for social investment in line with the growing national production.  The public capital programme to which I have just referred has more than trebled during the past 11 years.  It has risen from £41.2 million in 1957-58 to £136.4 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>I should like, at this stage, to refer to housing in relation to which much comment is being made both inside and outside the House.  Expenditure on housing has been multiplied by three during this period; no fewer than 103,000 dwellings have been built with State aid.  On education, with which I have been dealing, increase in expenditure is eight-fold.  In 1957-58 the <Col N="2103" /> capital outlay on industry and tourism was insignificant.  This year, however, nearly £16 million is being provided for industry and £2 million for tourism and that £2 million refers only to capital investment not to the current revenue expenditure which is at least as much as or more again.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on transport fuel and power development has doubled in the same period.  There has been a spectacular increase from £1.2 million in 1957-58 to £7 million this year in capital for telephone development.  Capital expenditure on agriculture and agricultural credit is now running at close on £20 million as compared with £4½ million in 1957-58.  The Government have already decided that there will be a further increase in capital expenditure on housing, on health and on education during the next two years.  Provision will be made to meet an increased demand for capital for industry and tourism, for agricultural credit, for the assistance of electricity generating capacity and for telecommunications.</P>
    <P>There will be a substantial rise in capital expenditure for transport services but in this instance the use of foreign credit which we can get from corresponding revenue earnings will safeguard our external reserves from any substantial fall.</P>
    <P>There are many other achievements of this Government which I could cite but I do not wish to prolong this speech unduly.  I am now within the last couple of minutes of my allotted time but I wish to deal with internal policy matters. The public have no serious criticisms of our external policy.  I ask the Dáil to re-affirm its confidence in this Government and in so doing approve the financial proposals that I put forward earlier today.  Three have been approved and we will be voting on the remaining ones, which are in the nature of general proposals, later in the week. I ask for re-affirmation of confidence in the belief that the people would or could have little confidence in a Government which, because it feared the dangers of political unpopularity, shirked its clear duty to take the remedial action necessary to avoid such a disimprovement in the balance of payments as would give rise to a serious <Col N="2104" /> fall in employment.  I ask the Dáil for re-affirmation of confidence in the Government on the progress that has been made over the past ten years, steady, practical, well-planned progress.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for Deputy O'Higgins to come here this afternoon and say this Government does not know where it is going.  It knows well where it is going.  It is going on the road of economic progress.</P>

We have achieved a substantial measure of economic progress in the past decade and I do not think any fair-minded person can gainsay that fact.  It has been achieved through sound planning and good Government. It would be remiss to put that progress in jeopardy in any way.  It would be remiss on our part if we did not take the remedial action clearly necessary to consolidate what has been achieved and to make sure that the foundations are well laid for the future, foundations that even a third Coalition Government cannot rock.</P>

      <P>The people were asked to give the Government more power and they refused that request. Many of the Fianna Fáil old-time supporters were satisfied that they had gone far enough and they said: &ldquo;Thus far and no further.&rdquo;  Indeed, it is a heartening and consoling example of political sophistication that so many people were prepared to get above traditional Party politics and vote the way they did in the interests of broader national good.  What is important, however, is not to go over the issues of the referendum.  It is not necessary for me to dwell at length on it.  However reluctant those of us on this side of the House may be to retrace the ground, I know no matter how brief we are, we cannot be too brief in recounting it for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>It is, however, my responsibility as a Leader of the Party which offers the people a realistic alternative to the present Government to put before the people what the alternative is.  It is obvious that the realities of the present political situation and the attitude of public opinion is in sharp contrast with the attitude of the present Fianna Fáil Government.  The significant conclusion which must be drawn from the referendum vote is not the fact that the Fine Gael people opposed it, the fact that the Labour people opposed it, nor the fact that a variety of non-Party or smaller groups and interests in the community voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; against the proposals in the referendum, but the fact&mdash;and this is the significance and this is the thing that has shattered the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash;that Fianna Fáil supporters not merely abstained but, for the first time in the history of that organisation or of this State, changed sides and rejected Fianna Fáil in their arrogant attempt to grab the institutions of State in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had expressed a clear undertaking that, so far as we were concerned, this Party and the Labour Party were prepared to participate and <Col N="2106" /> to collaborate in a committee on constitutional reform, however doubtful some people may have been of the <i>bona fides</i> of those who established that committee.  Nevertheless, we were prepared to give it a try.  We were satisfied to participate in it and to work to improve the institutions, to alter the procedures and practices, if alterations were deemed desirable, and if necessary to amend the Constitution. But, irrespective of the conclusions of that Committee, in fact in conflict with the recommendations which were made by it, Fianna Fáil attempted to adopt an arrogant and dictatorial attitude. They had ample opportunity for re-thinking on this question and for re-examining the proposals which were put before the Dáil, for amending or altering them or modifying them in some way that would be generally accepted.  Of course, it is fashionable now to suggest that a small group were responsible for this arrogant manoeuvre. This was a Party decision.  This was a Government decision.  This was a decision imposed with collective responsibility which none can opt out of, or protest their innocence of or their lack of support or lack of enthusiasm for the proposals produced to the people.</P>
    <P>We have seen this evening, and the country will feel tomorrow and in the months ahead, the real failure of the Government to attend to the people's business when they were spending months, weeks, and hours of Parliamentary time, of Government time and above all, of the people's time and of the people's money in an attempt to manipulate the voting system and to rig the constituencies.  Maybe that attempt has not yet finished.  But that will be exposed as well.  They were doing this, not because of external influence, not because of problems&mdash;as we had to face and for which we produced remedies&mdash;created by war such as the Korean and other wars, but because of internal mismanagement. We have had a massive Supplementary Budget here tonight, within six months after the Minister for Finance said, when concluding the debate on the Budget last May, as reported at column 1177 of volume 234, No. 8, of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> ...I can assure the House that I have no intention whatever of introducing a second Budget or bringing in any new taxation this year, unless such a course is found to be clearly and absolutely unavoidable.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Indeed, I do not think that additional Budgets in any year are desirable. They are something to which recourse should be had only in the last resort.</P>

      <P>It is a Budget which the Taoiseach, acting as Minister for Finance, said this afternoon is running £7½ million over and above the estimate.  Despite that, we have this afternoon passed Supplementary Resolutions to provide an additional £4.2 million and, even after that, with a buoyancy of £7½ million, we are to have a deficit, according to the estimates, of £7.2 million.  Does anybody believe any Fianna Fáil Minister or any Fianna Fáil Government on any topic on any occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only section of a Government Department that is paying in this country is the Post Office.  The people who send letters, telephone users, telegram senders, have been producing&mdash; because of the money they spend and the charges they pay&mdash;a profit.  The Government are not satisfied.  They want to charge more.  They are going still further to increase the charges. That is the type of mismanagement, that is the type of miscalculation, that has been carried on in this country over the past six months by a government that has been spending its time attempting to rig and to manipulate the electoral machinery.  As the Minister for Education, Deputy B. Lenihan, said: &ldquo;The try-on was worthwhile&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="2108" /> at a cost of £100,000.  The Tacateers are convinced it was worthwhile but their money has gone down the drain. We saw the advertisements that were paid for liberally.  The most expensive advertisement campaign ever produced by any political Party or by any industrial or other organisation in this country was carried on from August in every single paper.  One of the most attractively-produced advertisements was that in which there was a picture of a young couple seeking a house&mdash;houses that the Minister for Local Government is paid to produce and which he has not produced&mdash;and that young couple were meeting the person whom the Tacateers said: &ldquo;We are anxious for you to meet very frequently&mdash;your TD.&rdquo;  Are they now prepared to face the electorate?  The electorate are prepared to meet the Fianna Fáil TDs and to give them their dismissal notices.  Why not meet them now and give an account of your stewardship?</P>

      <P>This transcends politics and political considerations. This referendum shows a breakdown of confidence in the whole institution of government, a breakdown dramatically exemplified.  The first person who expressed himself publicly on this was the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He expressed the concern that, he said, had been felt by young people at low standards in high places.  That was followed by a number of lesser lights in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Some of them had the courage to resign. Some of them said that the only claim or card of membership was not a <i>bona fide</i> acceding to Fianna Fáil policy or Fianna Fáil belief but a well-filled cheque book.  But these people had enough.  They said: &ldquo;You have gone too far&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last February, when the Bills were being discussed here, we are here as trustees for the nation.  I said then, as I say now, that we have no mandate or authority to try to manipulate for any Party or, worse still, for any individual, the institutions of this State.  Those who established the institutions <Col N="2109" /> established them for the benefit of and in order to safeguard and defend the interests of the Irish people and not to subvert them to Party or personal interest.</P>
    <P>One of the regrettable results of this ill-considered and ill-timed referendum has been the fact that certain Constitutional reforms have been discredited and perverted.  We agreed to participation in the Constitutional Committee because we recognised, as most Deputies on all sides of the House recognise, the need for reforms, improvements, modifications and amendments to existing practices and procedure. We have in this country a large number of State and semi-State companies which expend, on behalf of the people, vast sums of money and which employ large numbers of Irish people.  Most of them give a good return, are providing essential services or are providing for needs and interests that require to be serviced.  There is a recognition and a realisation in many quarters that the activities of State companies and the expenditure of vast sums of public money should be examined and considered and should be investigated on an annual basis by some Parliamentary Committee analogous to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have pressed for that.  We have advocated it.  The Government have continually rejected it.</P>
    <P>No attempt whatever has been made except to pawn off the Dáil with the suggestion that because the accounts are presented and because the balance sheets are made available to Deputies by being laid on the Table of the House, it is sufficient.  That is not sufficient in the light of expenditure of the magnitude which has been incurred and when we have seen, as this country has seen in recent months, very large sums of money literally lost because of the manner in which it was expended or because of the representations that were made to this House that the programme was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We had the Dundalk Engineering Company.  We had the Potez project at Baldonnel.  Many people are satisfied that this is only the tip of the iceberg. These examples are only a minor representation of the picture that would be unveiled if there was an adequate <Col N="2110" /> investigation of public expenditure, which we believe must be undertaken and which it is the responsibility and the duty of this House to safeguard and assure.  In addition to that, we are satisfied that many changes have occurred in the past 30 years, since the Constitution was originally drafted, which mean that what was reasonably satisfactory 30 years ago requires at least to be examined in the context of present conditions.</P>
    <P>One of these was our view that votes should now be allowed to people at 18 years of age.  This could be done even yet in conjunction with the coming general election.  It is recognised nowadays that young people are more advanced, better informed, better equipped, more anxious to play an active and a decisive role in national and local affairs; and that if it is logical to ask them to pay income tax and other taxes at 18, it is also logical that they should have an effective say in the selection of public representatives and in the election of a government.</P>
    <P>There is no advantage in the Government trying to obscure the emphatic conclusion to be drawn from the referendum either by introducing this evening the Supplementary Budget or by floating this evening the national loan or by having second thoughts, after days and even weeks have passed, and putting down a motion of confidence. No one expects the Fianna Fáil Party to do anything else but to vote for the resolution that is before the people.  They are afraid to face public opinion and they are determined if they will not hang separately at least they will hang together.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House and the country what I believe are the essential requirements at the present time, and what I believe are the real reasons why the people rejected the referendum. I think there are three reasons. First, they saw it as an attempt to grab power, an attempt to alter the value of the vote.  It certainly sounded unsympathetic and unrealistic to hear the Taoiseach talking about the principle of one man, one vote as an essential requirement in the Six Counties when Fianna Fáil tried to manipulate the vote here and to alter its value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not ring true. It did not sound sincere, nobody believed him.  The second reason why the people rejected this proposal was that they rejected the Tacateers.  They rejected, and rejected emphatically, the power and the influence and the arrogance of the Tacateers who have assumed responsibility in Fianna Fáil. I noticed shortly after the referendum there was a seminar in Cork, a Tacateer seminar.  They said that all this suggestion of £100 dinners was wrong, that all they were interested in was planned giving; and the suggestion was 30/- a week, a glorified tontine society. Does anyone believe that the men in the mohair suits, the men who turn up draped in mink and in high-powered cars are interested only in 30/- a week? Of course, nobody believed it.  They did not believe it themselves, and the last thing was that the ordinary Fianna Fáil voter said: &ldquo;You have gone far enough.  We do not trust you.&rdquo;  That was the real message.  &ldquo;We do not trust Fianna Fáil.  We believe you have gone too far away from the grass roots.&rdquo; Mind you, there was some justification for it.  Last week here one of the veteran Fianna Fáil Deputies had a question down on space research.  He wanted to know if the Minister for External Affairs could do something about facilities in Europe for space research. Deputy Aiken, the Minister, said he was doing the best he could.</P>

      <P>Remember this, the Minister for External Affairs went recently to Moscow and put his mark &mdash;I do not know whether he put one or two Xs on it&mdash;on a non-proliferation treaty, and the Fianna Fáil backwoods men nodded their assent and said it was a sign of progress.  Most of them thought it had something to do with a restriction on the use of the pill.  Over the last ten years the Minister for External Affairs could not be kept in this country and since the referendum started and finished the Taoiseach cannot get rid of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach to government is based on three fundamental principles: honesty, freedom and social justice. <Col N="2112" /> Those are the ideals which motivate those who fought to establish a free Irish nation.  Those principles are vital to the health of any democratic society. Without them the democratic system of government must soon be eroded and replaced by some form of dictatorship or control by cliques or special interests.  I am convinced that the vast majority of the Irish people, irrespective of traditional party loyalty, want a society firmly founded on honesty, freedom and social justice, that they are prepared, as they convincingly demonstrated in the referendum, to respond to leadership which recognises these principles and is prepared to govern in accordance with them.</P>
    <P>There have in the past been references, not merely by me but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by other less well-known supporters of Fianna Fáil, to the need for better standards in high places.  I am not in a position, nor do I think is any member of the Opposition, certainly no member of the Fine Gael Party, in a position to assess accurately the soundness of the many suspicions and allegations which have been whispered about in recent months.  Our responsibility and my duty as a public representative and, indeed, as a Christian is to require that such allegations and suspicions should not be accepted without incontrovertible evidence.  It is our experience that such evidence is seldom available to the Opposition Deputies. What we can and must do, however, is to examine closely the conditions which make it possible for such an atmosphere to develop.  I have repeatedly expressed the view that nothing can lead faster to the undermining of confidence in our whole public life and the institutions of the State generally than any suggestion that the standards of integrity in public life have been weakened or have degenerated in any way.  I know that view is shared generally by many people in every political party. It is time we made an effort to get this issue above party politics.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that we participated willingly and in good faith in the constitutional reform committee to examine and investigate in detail the weakness of our democratic system, to see what defects were in it, to plan <Col N="2113" /> together to try to improve the system and to operate it more efficiently and more effectively, and if there were deficiencies or defects in it to eradicate them.  There should be a standard of practices and procedures recognised and accepted by all irrespective of whether they are in government or in opposition.</P>
    <P>One of the most frequent matters of concern and anxiety so far as public opinion is concerned is that of planning decisions.  During the course of this referendum, Fianna Fáil claimed vigorously that they were establishing a commission to deal with the redistribution of constituencies, that irrespective of the views of Parties or Deputies on either side, a judge would be chairman of that committee or commission, judges being regarded as being impartial.  On this side of the House we produced and advocated a Bill to deal with one of the most potent areas for concern in this country, the question of planning appeals under the Planning Act.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of sub-postmasters or temporary postmen or rate collectors.  They are relatively minor appointments in which the only question at issue is the salary of the individual, irrespective of whether he is competing with other members of his own Party, as happened recently when there were two Fianna Fáil candidates for one vacancy in one county.  The Fine Gael representatives believed that the man who was Fianna Fáil by conviction was entitled to priority beside the man who was Fianna Fáil by birth.  He got the appointment but he was expelled because he did not accede to the attempts to dictate to him.</P>
    <P>However, they are not major decisions, but planning appeals constitute an area in which big companies&mdash;oil companies, petrol companies, industrial concerns&mdash;are concerned about the manner in which planning appeals can alter the value of sites from little or no value to possibly £50,000, £100,000 or £250,000.  That is where there is room for concern and anxiety and it is in respect of it that people are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> It was for that reason that Deputies Fitzpatrick, Clinton and others produced here a Bill to take this responsibility from an individual Minister.  I do not suggest that individual Ministers are doing something that is wrong or that they are acting in some way that is contrary to the public interest, but there is reason to believe that public anxiety could be caused because applicants who were known to be political supporters have had their applications decided in a particular way.  If this matter were handed over to an impartial tribunal with a judge as chairman, then the anxiety, the concern, the suspicion, the talk, much of it ill-founded but some of it founded in genuine concern, could be allayed because of the impartial examination by an independent tribunal who recognised statutory procedure, having as chairman a judge and having independent technical and other assessors.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the failure of the Government's economic and social policies, one of the reasons for the development of the situation here which has culminated in the introduction of a Supplementary Budget within six months, is that the Government have failed to take the advice of the National Industrial and Economic Council, that they have failed to accept the recommendations and the conclusions reached by that body who recommended the establishment of a prices and incomes policy.  The most notable example of the failure of Government policy has been produced in the recent reports of the Economic and Social Research Institute, referred to by the Taoiseach today.  They show that there has been a dramatic and continuous rise in the cost of living&mdash; that the assumption made concerning 1968 is that the consumer price index will reach 64 points by November, giving an increase in the annual average of 5¼ per cent over 1967.  With regard to 1969, it is assumed that if present policies remain in force the growth of monetary demand will force consumer prices up by 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Supplementary Budget to offset the rise in respect of pensioners, social welfare recipients, retired persons, the self-employed.  The <Col N="2115" /> only conclusion to be drawn from this Budget and the only effect of it is to raise still further the prices of essential commodities&mdash;the prices of commodities affected by the wholesale tax, the increased post office charges and the cost of every commodity the Government have interfered with or have failed to take action to deal with.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been making price control orders, most of them ineffective, many of them irritants because he has attempted to control prices which traders cannot do anything about because the goods come in at higher prices.  Now the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Government, through the Minister for Finance, are to raise prices still further.  But there is no price control on the Government raising their costs; there is no control on an ineffective and inefficient administration. The only control has been that which was expressed so emphatically in the referendum in which the Government were rejected and repudiated. That is the one control the Government are afraid of, the one which they will not face.  It is the one authority they are now running from.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some reforms are necessary.  Some of these might be desirable in the Seanad.  I have expressed the view already that the Seanad is composed of some worthy Members but they are mainly there by accident, despite the election system and not because of it.</P>
    <P>We believe in Government by good leadership.  This can be achieved only by sympathetic consideration with the interests concerned.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was vocal in a number of interjections across the House today.  He did not know about increased milk production this year or increased wheat production.  Would anyone who read the statistics not know there are more cows in calf and more heifers this year?  It is not rabbits we are talking about: it is cows we are talking about and it takes a cow nine months to produce a calf and a heifer has to be at least 15 months old before she starts.</P>
    <P>Would anyone not know that that situation was there?  But the Minister <Col N="2116" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries was not talking to the farmers.  He was not discussing problems with the farmers &mdash;he would not talk to either agricultural organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education would not talk to academics about the position of higher education in Dublin.  He adopted that same arrogant attitude, deciding to clamp down, to impose this, willy-nilly, without consultation with either institution of higher learning as to what should be done.  Then, as a sort of digression, a diversion to distract the minds of Fianna Fáil Deputies from what was happening, the Taoiseach said a few words recently about Partition.  Everybody realised his intervention was ham-fisted.</P>

      <P>It was contrary to what the Minister for Education said about the same problem, quoted in the 4th June issue of the <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> In this, he said, the only person who agreed with him was Captain O'Neill. He said that the granting of independence to Scotland and Wales would not in itself solve any problem.  The issue was whether they should sacrifice the material benefits of integration with Britain for the emotional attraction of independence.  He was in no doubt that the two countries would be ill-advised to break away from Britain. He said that in Southern Ireland we have learned the hard way and have now turned the corner.</P>
      <P>I do not know which corner that is because Fianna Fáil cannot even keep between the ditches.  They are round the bend.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that nobody accepts the Taoiseach's talk this week when Deputy Lenihan neither repudiated himself nor was repudiated by the Taoiseach or any other Minister?  It is no wonder that the Tory newspaper in its own leading article said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of what the Irish Minister of Education, Mr. Lenihan, has to say about nationalism in a report on another page makes sound sense, though most historians would quarrel with his opinion that Ireland might have been happier under a form of limited self-government.  By <Col N="2117" /> the turn of this century, after 200 years or more of oppression, aggravated by economic and land management policies, the fatuity of which was matched only by their ruthlessness, Ireland had come to hate British Governments.</P>
    <P>That was never repudiated.  It was never suggested that he was misreported. In fact, in the usual bluff way he tried to justify it.  I suppose, like the referendum, it was worth a try-on.</P>
    <P>We believe that we have to establish here a just society.  We do not pretend that that can be done without effort or without sacrifice, but we are convinced that the vast majority of our people are prepared to make the effort in order to deal with what we recognise as an avoidable social evil, the need for improved housing.  It is easy, of course, to say that we are spending more money each year on houses. Houses cost more each year.  To do the same amount of work one year after another costs more money with rising costs of production, with rising wages, with rising overheads, and so on.  To do the same amount of work next year as was done this year will inevitably cost more.  It is for that reason that we are spending substantially more money on education.  Yet, as a percentage of the Supply Estimates, we are spending less on education than we spent 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is our view that this problem should be tackled and must be tackled. It is not sufficient to attempt to deny, as the Minister for Local Government has, that the problem exists and to abuse those who criticise the Government's record.  That is reminiscent of what is happening in Derry.  On the one hand Unionists say there is no discrimination, and then they go out and attack those who criticise it.  We all know there is discrimination.  We all know there has been a failure to build houses.  We all know that there has been a failure in this city, in my constituency and in the environment of Dublin, either in the city itself or on the perimeter of it, to provide serviced land, to provide sewerage, to provide the services that are necessary.  But the Government have been spending their time and the Minister has been spending <Col N="2118" /> his time travelling the country trying to rig the constituencies and trying to impress people with the belief that they were doing something in the national interest and that that was priority number one.</P>
    <P>The social problems that exist here &mdash;the need for improved housing, the need for better hospitals, the need for improved health services, the need for wider social services based on a comprehensive system of insurance&mdash;these are what the Minister for Finance said were being examined in the Budget. These are the top priorities.  These are the problems that affect the people. These are the problems which the people want to see remedied and want to see solutions provided for.  We are satisfied Fine Gael have a policy for education and not merely our policy in respect of the Irish language, which has since been endorsed in the only referendum held on that subject, the referendum in Ballinasloe.  All this emphatically endorses the proposals we made.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have not the courage or else they are afraid and ashamed to accept responsibility for making the changes necessary.  Even the <i>Irish Press,</i> which up to now has been a rather obscurantist journal, has adopted an <i>avant garde</i> attitude, and its readers are a little distressed by it.  They realise that what was good in the past will not sell in the future.</P>
    <P>We realise there is a need for getting participation from farmers, educationalists and trade unions.  Fianna Fáil cannot now dominate and dictate. There is the suggestion that much has been done about redundancy.  The only redundancy fund I know of which is working effectively is the profiteers fund for displaced Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;if they can repatriate it.  I understand some of it is outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Closely associated with this policy of social help and other reforms is the need for a reform programme for youth, a programme that will realise the problems of the young people coming to maturity who need to be guided and assisted, young people prepared and anxious to accept their place in society and desirous of leadership and a chance to participate.  We <Col N="2119" /> advocated and recommended a programme that would provide assistance for emigrants.  It is not sufficient for the Department of External Affairs to provide a couple of ambulatory or itinerant representatives.  Everyone knows that the Department of External Affairs has its sights on New York or Moscow and never on reality, never on the problems that affect the people.</P>
    <P>We heard talk here today about surplus milk.  The one thing the people in Biafra and Nigeria needed was milk and the Minister for External Affairs could hardly get a can of skim milk into them over the last few years.  But we can put our mark on non-proliferation treaties and we can talk about national troops joining the United Nations.  These are irrelevant considerations when faced with the problems which Irish missionaries have had to face in Nigeria and Biafra, when faced with the real problems of the people who represented, worked and defended Christian principles and brought the light of culture and civilisation from this island for centuries to the darkest lands.  We could do nothing about them because we were immersed in the legalistic imperfections of an ideal that has now been repudiated by everybody and that is rejected and found difficult even by those who supported it in the past.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems affecting this country is the problem of the west. The west has realised that Fianna Fáil have offered nothing to it and the one thing that would not have solved the problem would have been more Fianna Fáil TDs.  We know the result of this vote.  This Government is fugitive from public opinion&mdash;maybe, indeed, fugitive from retributive justice&mdash;but it does not matter how long they postpone it, it must come next year.  When it comes we will accept responsibility. Whatever else this Party did, it never refused to face the electorate whether the result was good or bad.  We faced the people.  It has been said that a country gets the government it deserves.  I know our people deserve better than the present Government and I am confident that, with the help of God and the support of the people, we will provide better shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion will be taken.  The reason we put down the motion that is not now before the House was to provoke a political debate in the light of the referendum results.  I do not think we should, nor has there been any serious attempt to, talk about the merits of the two proposals that have been rejected by the people.  That is as it should be.  I do not think anybody can ignore the results of the referendum, a result which, by the tone of the Taoiseach's speech and the attitude of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, they would like to forget quickly.  The Taoiseach tried to help them in that in the tactics that have been employed today in order to put the referendum results aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone have we motions down and discussions with regard to the results but we also have a mini-Budget, a vote of confidence in himself by the Taoiseach and the announcement of a national loan.  These are all important matters in themselves.  We all go along with the national loan and from all sides of the House we exhort the public to support it.  We have also given our comments on the Budget. However, one is inclined to ask why, in the light of the speeches by the Taoiseach over the last month or two, Parliament was not assembled before this if the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Finance thought it so <Col N="2121" /> urgent to introduce the proposals announced this afternoon.</P>
    <P>However, I do not intend to allow the Taoiseach or members of the Fianna Fáil Party to get away from the result of the referendum held on the 16th October.  As I have said, a significant thing is the fact that the Government have proposed a vote of confidence in themselves.  I would like the Taoiseach or some member of his Party to explain what that means. Does it necessarily mean that behind their thinking there is an idea, even among the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, that this 233,000 votes defeat was an indication that there was no confidence in them?  It must be obvious to everybody that they have been shaken.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious from the attitude of the Front Bench and the backbenchers over the last two weeks. There was never a greater shock in the country than that suffered and felt by the Fianna Fáil Party on the 16th October.  Now we have them trying to retrieve their fortunes and I regard this Budget as a frantic effort to repair their political fences.  It has been described as courageous.  Nobody believes this.  At least, I and the members of my Party do not because it is merely a lead-up to a Budget after which it is expected that there will be a general election.  I think this is dishonest in that the people are now being asked to give, give, give to the extent of £11 million.  We can only accept the estimates that have been given by the Taoiseach.  But it is apparent to me that this Budget is merely a forerunner of a Budget before a general election that will enable the Minister for Finance to throw out some crumbs to people in the hope that they will get back the confidence of the people which they lost in the referendum proposals.</P>
    <P>However, I think there is a futility about these motions of confidence and no confidence in the Government.  It is all right as far as discussion is concerned, but everybody knows what the result will be because those 74 Deputies have absolute confidence in themselves. They are confident that they should stay in power for another while <Col N="2122" /> until they get back the confidence they lost on the 16th October.  What this referendum demonstrated in no uncertain manner, no matter what anybody might say&mdash;and I include everybody both inside and outside the House&mdash; is a lack of confidence by the people in the Government.  If nothing else, the people in the referendum have called for a general election.  They have said they have no confidence in the Government. Anybody can claim credit for the defeat of the Government&mdash;the newspapers, radio and television, the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Independents, the trade union movement.  The main thing is the Fianna Fáil Party suffered the greatest defeat of their career and, mark you, I think this was a political decision of the people.  The Government try to represent it as a non-political decision. This was a political decision on an issue fought by political Parties in which political speeches were made by every single Member who spoke from the Fianna Fáil Party and those who spoke from the Opposition.  It was demonstrated to me that this was a political decision by the fact that there was very little cross voting.  There was the very small amount of 700 cross votes, the majority in favour of the tolerance issue and this in a colossal vote of over one million people.</P>
    <P>Another significant thing was the rejection of the tolerance proposal in certain parts of the country.  The tolerance proposal was represented in particular areas as being a proposal that would ensure democratic representation there.  There must be a tremendous significance in that rejection, not alone for the Government but for those who voted in the constituencies of, say, Donegal, Clare, Mayo, Galway, West and East Limerick&mdash;what used to be strongholds of Fianna Fáil.  There must be a lesson to be learned from the fact that, despite the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture in Donegal, the proposals were nearly beaten there.  In the famed Fianna Fáil county of Clare the proposals were carried by a mere 66. Those who were offered so much as far as tolerance was concerned; those who were told that their TDs would be much closer to them; those who were <Col N="2123" /> told that they would have fair representation in the Dáil&mdash;they rejected the Fianna Fáil proposals.  Most of us who have been in the House for a long time knew that, no matter what the issue was, all these areas stood steadfastly by the Fianna Fáil Party.  When elections were held, even after vicious Budgets of the Fianna Fáil Government, these areas supported without question the Fianna Fáil Party.  No matter what the issue was&mdash;any sort of stringent financial proposal &mdash; the Fianna Fáil supporters held steadfast. Now we have this great breakthrough. It shows that the people recognise the hypocrisy of the Government and their alleged concern for them, because in effect they have said: &ldquo;We are not so much concerned about having more TDs in our areas as we are about having more people.&rdquo;  This is what Fianna Fáil have failed to do for them over their long period in office since 1932.</P>
    <P>I would describe this as the biggest defeat ever of the Fianna Fáil Party. I do not think anybody can write it off, least of all the Taoiseach.  In the 1965 election the Fianna Fáil Party gathered 597,000 votes.  In the referendum they got 423,000 votes for their proposals.  Therefore, there were 174,000 who did not vote for the Fianna Fáil Party proposals in the year 1968.  It is true that, as far as the Opposition were concerned, the votes were somewhat the same.  In the General Election of 1965 there were 656,000 who voted for the Opposition Parties.  In the referendum there were 656,800.  We have to have regard to the drop in the ballot and still ask ourselves what happened to this 174,000.  Why was there this huge switch of Fianna Fáil votes away from them?  In any case we must regard a majority against the Fianna Fáil proposals of 233,000 as being a vote of no confidence by a significant number of people.</P>
    <P>Many people have tried to analyse this result.  There are very many people now who are very clever after the event.  There were those who forecast outside Dáil Éireann a narrow win <Col N="2124" /> for the Government proposals and there were others who forecast a narrow loss.  If I were to give my opinion &mdash;and I think I did in public and in private&mdash;I would have said that there would be a majority of between 50,000 and 100,000 against the Government proposals.  Again I pose the question: who thought in Dáil Éireann, in the press, in radio or television, that there would be such a colossal defeat for the Government to the extent of 233,000? Perhaps we can explain away by the referendum proposals the 50,000 to 100,000 votes but there were some 134,000 to 184,000 people who voted against the proposals for some other reason.  It may be said in respect of the 50,000 to 100,000 that they were not prepared to trust Fianna Fáil motives in the proposed Constitutional changes which were vital in the life of the country in that they proposed changes in our electoral system.  These were rejected. I do not think it came as any surprise to anyone, therefore, when the Labour Party called for the resignation of the Government and asked them to go to the country.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say that this was a snap decision by the people, that these proposals were thrown out to the public who made a snap decision without realising the full implications of what was involved.  How did Fianna Fáil come to make such a mistake?  There has been criticism recently that the politicians are not near the grass roots.  My Party knew exactly&mdash;perhaps not in terms of the amount of the majority&mdash; what the people thought and knew the proposals would not be carried.  Therefore, we must ask ourselves and perhaps the Fianna Fáil organisation must ask itself, as it did on another occasion, what went wrong?  Were they not sufficiently close to the people to know there would be such a colossal defeat?  Were they so much out of touch with the people not to know they would be so severely trounced?  It was recognised as a very grave error of judgment.  I know the Taoiseach will plead there was Cabinet responsibility for the decision that was taken but there was also a great deal of wailing from some prominent members of the Cabinet, from the Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="2125" /> and from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It was obvious again from the attitude of the people in their decision that the people wanted and still want, if the Government are not prepared to resign, at least a change in personnel in the Cabinet because I know that even those who support Fianna Fáil in this House realise the damage that has been done to the Fianna Fáil image over the past three or four years by the attitude and behaviour of certain members of the Cabinet.  That may be a question for the Taoiseach himself to decide, but it is obvious that there are three or four Ministers who, if they should not resign, should be given minor posts.</P>
    <P>This could not be regarded as a snap decision by the people.  The proposals were debated over a long period of 12 months, a period which is now, and which was regarded by us as a waste of Parliamentary time, a period during which we should have been talking about the things that the Taoiseach mentioned today in his Budget speech, employment, social welfare, agriculture, agricultural production and all these vital things, but the great crime of the Government and those who were mainly responsible for these proposals was that they insisted that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann should debate our electoral system and the Government's proposals <i>ad nauseam</i> from the beginning of March up to the end of the session in July, and that the Government should allow the whole country and particularly certain Ministers to be preoccupied for the long time of two or three months trying to convince the people that they should change over to the system which they rejected in 1959.</P>
    <P>I believe that the decision of the people indicates their bitter disappointment and disillusionment with the Fianna Fáil Party and Government.  It also represents a new day in Irish politics.  It represents for the first time a massive swing of traditional support for various reasons which I shall not go into now from the Fianna Fáil Party to the Opposition whether it be Labour or Fine Gael.  Nobody has yet been able to give an accurate analysis of the vote against the Government in this particular issue.  It appears to me that <Col N="2126" /> there was demonstrated on 16th October a new attitude towards Parties and politicians.  I was heartened by finding on 17th October that so many people had voted because the cry from all Parties was that there appeared to be apathy among the people.  The press and political commentators on radio and television had forecast a very small poll and pointed to the lack of interest the people had in these proposals. On 17th October when everybody knew that over one million people had voted I was cheered by the fact that the people, even though they did not appear to be doing so, were thinking deeply about the implications of these proposals and the various political questions, national and international, affecting this country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not believe the Government have a mandate to carry on their present policy.  We had an election in April, 1965, and we have now served three and a half years in this eighteenth Dáil.  Might I ask this: has the Taoiseach the brazenness to carry on for the full period?  He may say that they got a mandate in the election of April, 1965, but in October, 1968, he was told in no uncertain fashion that not alone did the country not trust him and the proposals he put forward regarding changes in the Constitution but in my view and that of my Party also that he had no mandate to carry on the policies he had been pursuing since the Fianna Fáil Party formed a Government three and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>If this had happened in any other country in the world at least one member of the Cabinet would have resigned and that would be the man who brazenly put this proposal through the House, Deputy Boland, Minister for Local Government.  He was the man who cracked the whip on every single division whether on the Second, Third, Fourth or Fifth Stages and brought all Fianna Fáil members behind him into the Division Lobbies.  This was the man who insisted that every one of his amendments be carried, the man who was intolerant of criticism from the Opposition or of any suggestion they made, the man who appeared to stake his whole political life on the success of the referendum proposals.  This is the <Col N="2127" /> man who has sat there for the past two or three weeks and blandly sits there now without a &ldquo;gig&rdquo; out of him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I am entirely fair to the Minister because the Taoiseach said that whatever decision was made was made with the full&mdash;I do not know whether he said &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo;&mdash;consent of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Front Bench.  I do not think he was entirely correct when he said that the Fianna Fáil Party as such had made this decision in November of last year.  As far as my recollection goes they did not ask their Parliamentary Party or the Fianna Fáil Government to push the proposals that were before the people on 16th October.  As a matter of fact&mdash;and Deputy Cosgrave has referred to it; it is not for me to analyse the organisation of Fianna Fáil&mdash;I think there is disillusionment not alone among the people so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned but in the Fianna Fáil organisation itself.  It has been said by some political commentators that all political Parties seem to have got away from their organisations but it was abundantly clear to me in discussions I had with those in the Fianna Fáil Party organisation who were disillusioned that they believed a time had come when their resolutions were not accepted at all at the Ard-Fheis and when their representations to the Government or their TDs were not heeded and that Fianna Fáil had arrived at a situation where a certain moneyed class in this country could dictate or influence the policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to reconcile the two speeches the Taoiseach made today. In his Budget speech there is a suggestion that the country is not in a good position.  There is a suggestion, or should I say, there are proposals that the people, in order to right the economy, should give another £11.25 million.  I have made my comments on this already and said that I did not agree with it.  I said that if corrective measures had to be taken they should have been taken in April of this year <Col N="2128" /> because it was known then that anything that is happening now would happen in any case.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech, for about three-quarters of an hour, told us of the great shape the country was in.  As I said today, the Fianna Fáil Party seem to have a Budget for all seasons according to the political climate.  Now we go a step further when we get one speech in the afternoon saying, and this was the implication in the Budget, that the country is in a bad way, that the balance of payments has gone wrong, that the people are too well-off and that we have to take another £11¾ million from them, while today the Taoiseach boasts about what the Fianna Fáil Government have done in this, that and the other respect &mdash;health, education, social welfare, house building, industrial employment, and all that sort of thing.  The weakness of his argument was in looking back to 1956 and 1957.  I do not mind hearing about that.  I do not mind accepting my responsibility as a member of the Government of that time.  But there are people about whom the Taoiseach appeared to be concerned, young people, of 21 and 22 years of age, who are concerned about 1968, not about some of the periods that Deputy MacEntee talks about in his supplementary questions when he goes back to 1921, 1923 and 1927.  To be fair to the country, we have to think and act in terms of 1968 because there are people who voted in the recent referendum who did not know the prominent Members of Dáil Éireann in 1957 and who are not concerned as to who they were.  They want results in 1968 and what we did for good or evil five, 10 or 20 years ago is not going to satisfy them.</P>
    <P>I suppose I will be accused of repeating myself but in view of the fact that I believe what I say I have to repeat myself and to use this argument again and again in order to try to convince the Government and this House that as far as policy is concerned we are on the wrong track.  I could list a lot of failures of this Government.  The Taoiseach has listed a lot of achievements.  We would applaud the achievements, limited <Col N="2129" /> though they may be, and do not begrudge the Government any credit for them, say, in education and a few other things that just do not come to my mind at the present time&mdash;in social welfare, limited as it was.  All credit due to the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley for what he did.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Apropos of social welfare, any time the Fianna Fáil Government proposed taxation to increase social welfare, the Labour Party was with them.  The Taoiseach will find that as far as any progressive proposals are concerned, he will always have the Labour Party with him.  We did not believe that the proposals today were progressive.  We thought they were regressive and would not do the economy any good because they are the same type of measure as was taken in 1964 and we had the example of the result of that in 1965 and in 1966.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about employment&mdash;a very simple statement.  Fianna Fáil have not shown good results in this respect.  There is no use in analysing the figures for employment in respect of every sector.  It suffices for me to say, when the Taoiseach talks about the progress made in this country between 1957 and 1967, that in the last three years the number of people at work has fallen by 10,000.  I do not think anybody can question that.  I do not think that need be elaborated upon. The fact is that as far as agriculture is concerned there are too many leaving the land too rapidly.  There are approximately 10,000 per annum leaving the land.  There is an increase in the number employed in manufacturing industry but it is not sufficient.  There is no use in anybody consoling himself by saving that we did not expect this vast decrease in the numbers at work in agriculture.  We have known for years that this would happen.  We have been told this by various Ministers for Finance.  We have been told it <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Minister for Transport and Power who says it is not peculiar to Ireland.  We accept that to a large extent.  Adequate provision has not been made for the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" /> As far as unemployment is concerned, as I said today, even compared with last year, there are eight per cent more unemployed than there were at the corresponding period last year. Every Deputy, whether he is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, is concerned about people having jobs at good wages and with security.  There are many people who have not got such jobs.  This, plainly, is the responsibility of the Government and their failure in this respect is the greatest indictment one can make against them.</P>
    <P>We may have success regarding the balance of payments.  We may be able to tell ourselves next year that there is no deficit, that there is a plus or small minus of maybe £2 million to £5 million.  This will be no consolation to those who have no employment, to those who have to emigrate.  Again, let me pose the question to the Government: Who comes first?  Is it men?  Is it people who come first in the matter of employment and good jobs or is it the balance of payments and the external reserves?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach upbraided me today when I talked about the external reserves and said that I suggested that they should be run down.  I did not say that they should be run down indiscriminately but I did say, and this my Party believes, that if we were to run them down in order to give Irishmen employment in their own country, this we should do.  If we have £225 million in external reserves through the commercial banks in this country, is there any good reason why 15,000 or 20,000 persons should emigrate because they cannot get good jobs?  As long as we have these 58,000 to 60,000 unemployed is there any good reason in maintaining in Britain or some other place a sum of £225 million in external reserves?</P>
    <P>If somebody could tell me that £100 million was the minimum for safety purposes that we could have in Britain then we could talk about it in a plainer fashion but I do not know whether external reserves are related to this, that or the other thing, whether they are related to exports from a country or to imports to a country, national income or gross national product. <Col N="2131" /> I do not know and nobody has told me as yet.  The Taoiseach should ask some of his brilliant economic advisers to answer that question: at what level are our external reserves deemed to be safe?  If that is a certain figure over which we stand now, why cannot we ensure that our reserves would be run down to that figure in order to ensure that some of the restrictive measures that have been taken today would not be taken?  The Taoiseach on one occasion talked about the voluntary repatriation of our external assets.  Everybody applauded that sentiment.  I wonder has the Taoiseach followed it up in any concrete way by more direct advice to those who have external assets, whether they are banks or others, because, if there is one thing we lack more than another it is money for investment and we certainly would favour the redemption of some of these moneys in order to give people employment in this country.</P>
    <P>Related to the question of employment is the question of industrial employment because industrial employment is the only means by which we can create jobs.  Both of the programmes for economic expansion have been admitted by the Government to be failures.  One of the reasons submitted by Arthur D. Little in his excellent report was that the level of investment so far was not nearly enough in order to provide even the minimum number of jobs required.  We were told some years ago that the industrial growth centres would provide much more employment.  No effective action has been taken in this matter.  I do not see any great upsurge in employment in these centres where we were supposed to have industrial estates and where there was to be a dramatic increase in industrial growth.</P>
    <P>I do not know what plans the Government have in their Third Programme to attain even the minimum target as suggested by the NIEC <i>Report on Full Employment.</i> The Government admit that 236,000 jobs are needed every 15 years, that we must get 12,500 per annum.  We certainly <Col N="2132" /> have not got anything like this number.</P>
    <P>Again at the risk of being told that I engage in repetition, may I say that one of our failures is due to our absolute reliance on private enterprise? I remember the Fianna Fáil Party in 1932, when I was quite young.  It was the socialist party.  It was the revolutionary Republican party.  These were the people who were going to give us industry.  I do not think it can be denied that they have had sufficient time, even to go back to the first principles of 1932, to concern themselves much more than they have done with the State's role in the matter of providing jobs.  We believe in direct State investment in industry.  We believe in the expansion of State-owned industries by the setting up of new industries. We believe in the general development of the existing semi-State bodies.  Mark you, the Government have not yet even got around to thinking about these things.  It must be abundantly clear that over the past ten years, and since the First Programme for Economic Expansion was announced, we have not been getting sufficient from private enterprise, whether from home or outside, in order to provide the jobs we need. As a matter of fact, in that regard we have relied too much on outsiders. There was an influx up to about four years ago but I do not hear of any factories being established here now by those who would sink their money in this country.  I do not see great government activity in trying to induce these to come here apart from the incentives which were announced five or six years ago.</P>
    <P>Again, let us plead for an expansion of food-processing.  It is a scandal to see the vast majority of our cattle exports being exported on the hoof. There are some factories which have developed the food-processing industry, even though not in too large a way, and we can do with all this.  Whether or not we are prevented from doing this by some terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement I do not know. I believe also that Córas Tráchtála should be given far greater powers in order that they might assist to a greater extent in the selling of our products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> As it is, while they do give a certain amount of guidance and advice, small firms which could afford to export have not got the facilities themselves to seek markets and to sell abroad.</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach referred to the Third Programme.  It seems to me that it is going to be the same mixture as before, a range of incentives and inducements which people can take or leave.  So far as industry is concerned we have gone past the time when we can leave it merely to incentives and inducements.  We have failed badly by that method to the extent that we have not got the maximum employment which there should be in industry in view of the money we have invested. Despite their previous efforts in the early 1930's Fianna Fáil have not got a solution for industrial development. They can rightly boast about the number of new industries established over the last ten years or at any time they were in office but the fact is that we have not got enough.  It is not sufficient to say that we have increased them by this, that or the other percentage and that there are tens of thousands more in employment.</P>
    <P>The motion which I have down and which will be voted on refers to the Government's failure in various spheres and the failure of various ministries.  I will leave it to members of my Party to talk about these matters in greater detail.  Perhaps the Chair would assist me by letting me know how much longer I have to speak?</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with some other matters briefly.  I believe that when the people voted in the referendum they were also thinking about other matters such as the failure of the Government in regard to providing employment.  It is a talking point among tens of thousands of people that we still have not got a proper health scheme.  The failure to provide that is another thing which motivated some of them when they voted on the 16th October.  The late Deputy Donogh <Col N="2134" /> O'Malley when he was Minister for Health produced a White Paper about three or four years ago.  The White Paper included certain Government proposals to provide for an improvement in the present health scheme. They were not over-ambitious proposals but they were proposals the majority of which pleased the Labour Party although they did not go as far as the Labour Party wants to go.</P>
      <P>However, we saw in them a vast improvement on the present scheme.  This was about the spring of 1966 and now nearly three years afterwards there has been no improvement whatsoever in the health scheme which we have been operating for the past 15 years.  We had the Minister for Health of the day telling us that there would be legislation in this session.  We asked him whether he meant before Easter and he said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It never materialised.  We asked would it be before summer but it did not materialise.  Now we are promised it for this session.  The Minister said we would have the new proposals before Christmas.  I do not believe we will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there will be a scrambled effort by him to produce something before the general election which inevitably must be held in the near future. There is still the same dissatisfaction. I often wonder if Fianna Fáil torture the people deliberately with regard to health or taxation or in respect of other things over which they have control. Do they save up all these complaints, even aggravate them, then before an election provide a solution? Despite all the claims made for social welfare benefits everybody would readily agree that they are certainly below par.  They have been increased to a very great extent, in so far as the increase per week is concerned, compared with&mdash;perhaps somebody would say&mdash;when I was Minister for Social Welfare, or perhaps even before that. We are making up a lot of ground but the rate is too slow.  Those who talk about my performance as Minister for Social Welfare are not doing much service, and I do not think that I would be doing much service if I started to emphasise that between 1932 and 1948 the old age pension stayed at 10s per <Col N="2135" /> week.  For 16 years it was only 10s but, however, that does not arise in 1968.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for me to talk about agriculture or the lack of confidence the farmers have in the Government.  The most outrageous spectacle we saw in recent months was the attitude of the two Ministers for Agriculture towards the farming community.  First we had Deputy Haughey as he was Minister for Agriculture and then we had Deputy Blaney.  It was both pathetic and amusing to hear the Minister a month before the referendum asking the farmers &ldquo;for God's sake to see him&rdquo; when he had refused to see them for 14 months before that.  The evidence is there in the slow infinitesimal growth in production, in the thousands leaving the land every year and in the attitude of the various Ministers for Agriculture&mdash;and perhaps the Government, I do not know&mdash;towards the various farming organisations and in the farmers' falling incomes.  I am not an expert on milk production but it appears to me that when one takes the average dairy farmer the 1d per gallon will mean about 5/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether anybody should talk about the Minister for Local Government.  He has his troubles.  The plain fact is that he did not get the people to change the Constitution and neither did he succeed in getting houses for the people.  May I say one word about something which the Taoiseach mentioned?  It was in regard to the attitude of the Labour Party before and after the next election. Surely our stand is justified by the attitude both of the Taoiseach and some members of the Fine Gael Party. I do not think anybody will criticise us for being suspicious when some <Col N="2136" /> members of the Fine Gael Party want us to go into a coalition while the Taoiseach himself would be pleased for us to go into a coalition.  I do not think anybody would regard the Labour Party as political fools considering that the Labour Party are fully aware that the tactics of the other two Parties are to try to put the Labour Party in an embarrassing position.  I do not think either Party has an interest in the fortunes of the Labour Party as such.</P>
    <P>We have decided on our attitude. We are concerned to get the government of this country.  Some may say that will take a long time.  It may, but I do not believe the Labour Party should play second or third fiddle to any other Party at this particular point in our history.  We decided long ago to test every constituency with the maximum number of candidates in the next general election.  We will ask the people to judge us as individuals and as a Party on our performance in Dáil Éireann and on the policy statements we will put before them.  They will judge our sincerity, our aims and our attitudes.  Despite taunts from the Minister for External Affairs, and from other people who are not even in politics, we put our candidate before the electorate in Limerick and we increased our vote substantially.  We put our candidate before the electorate in Cork and we increased our vote substantially. We did the same in Wicklow. I would say the Labour Party were responsible for a big share of the votes cast against the Government's proposals in the referendum.  We do not intend to play second fiddle to any Party.  My Party and our organisation will strive to build Labour and make it a major Party.  It may be a long haul.  Maybe those in Fianna Fáil in 1925 and 1926 thought it would be a long haul then.</P>
    <P>There was a dramatic change in the attitude of the people on 16th October last.  The one thing clear and definite was the swing of 174,000 votes away from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I cannot say how many of those votes were due to the attitude of the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, or the trade union <Col N="2137" /> movement, but there was a definite swing towards Labour.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the next general election, which we now call upon the Taoiseach to declare&mdash;I do not believe he will call a general election&mdash;Labour will gain substantially.  The Taoiseach boasted that Fianna Fáil went before the country in seven by-elections and won six.  Wexford has two Fianna Fáil representatives, one Fine Gael and one Labour.  It is a county in which the Government could well be tested and, if the Taoiseach does not intend to hold a general election in view of the referendum result, I would ask him to test Fianna Fáil policy in the Wexford by-election.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Cosgrave describe the result of the referendum as a rejection of Fianna Fáil by the people.  That comment comes most strangely from him because, if he is correct in that, then the referendum result is also a rejection of Deputy Cosgrave by the people, just as the position in which he found himself meant he had been rejected as well by the majority of his own Party. The result of the referendum was, in fact, a victory for the natural conservation of our people and the result was rejoiced over for the most part by our two conservative parties, Fine Gael and Labour.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Leary wants &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; I shall go with him, but there is no question of liberty involved.  That is something which the people are sufficiently mature to begin to realise now.  In the minds of certain Labour Deputies, such as Deputy O'Leary, there is a complete lack of appreciation as to what is the guarantee of liberty in a democratic society.  He and some newspaper commentators seem to think there is greater liberty when there is weak government.  That is a complete illusion.  It is when there is weak government that strong pressure groups exploit the people.  It is the job of strong government to resist such small but powerful pressure groups. This is a matter which does not arise <Col N="2138" /> at the moment I am very glad to say. We had it with two Coalition Governments. We have emerged from that era.</P>

      <P>Having spoken to many people since the referendum, I am convinced that the majority voted by instinct and not by reason.  There was an instinctive reaction against change.  Voters were influenced also to some extent by the accusations against Fianna Fáil and the highly sinister motives alleged to be behind the Fianna Fáil proposals. Furthermore, the issue was extraordinarily complicated and very few voters took the trouble to study seriously the whole question because it was very, very difficult and the raising of every conceivable irrelevancy by Opposition speakers certainly did not help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that we were foolish and that we were clearly incompetent because of our failure to realise in advance that the people would not agree to the proposals.  The people who are so quick to say that gloss over the fact that all the political commentators and the political columnists were forecasting a very close result and nobody was more surprised at the result than Fine Gael and Labour who had obviously no idea that the result would be so decisive.  It was a big disappointment to us.  At the count in Dún Laoghaire a leading Fine Gael official came up to me and asked: &ldquo;Are you disappointed?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I am very disappointed.&rdquo;  He looked over his shoulder in both directions and then whispered to me: &ldquo;So am <Col N="2139" /> I.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Why did you not come with us?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;It was our fault.

      <P>There is a quotation which may not give the Deputies any great pleasure.  Let us take the editorial in today's <i>Independent.</i> I quote:</P>
      <P>The Opposition parties, so far, have taken a different and potentially most dangerous view.  Since the night of the results they have indulged in gorilla-like chest-thumping, laying claim to all the credit for the people's decision, interpreting the vote as a rejection of the Government root-and-branch and asserting variously that what the country desires without delay is a Fine Gael and/or Labour administration. It needs to be bluntly said that there is no title of evidence to sustain this extravagant conclusion, and both Opposition parties had better drop it fast for their own good.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should read the <i>Independent</i> when it is dealing with a point of wisdom rather than a point of pure prejudice.  There is no question of prejudice about that leading article which goes on to say:</P>
      <P>There were two questions at the referendum.  The people repudiated the Government's view on these two questions.  It is reasonable to suppose, in the particular circumstances, that they also repudiated the mentality within the Government which caused the questions to be put.  We know, and the people know, that this mentality belongs only to a segment of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I leave the quotation there to say I do not agree with that bit.  To go back to the quotation:</P>
      <P>That is all we can truly say was rejected.  To take it further would be to argue that many Fianna Fáil voters (in County Clare, for example) no longer want a Fianna Fáil Government, which is ludicrous.  It would also mean that the people want a general election.  They don't.</P>

Let us get this clear.  This decision at the referendum was the decision of the people to maintain the <i>status quo</i> simply because they were not sure what a change might entail. <Col N="2144" /> Every conceivable means was used to create doubts in people's minds as to what the result might be.  Only the future will show what the actual result of their decision will be but my experience so far has been that many people have spoken to me and have stated quite openly that they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  They have stated, however, that they are now beginning to wonder if they should have voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and that certainly they will vote Fianna Fáil in the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the introduction today of certain financial measures. The Budget was not a very mini, mini one but some financial measures were obviously necessary.  Neither do I, personally, nor does anyone, welcome increased taxation.  As Members undoubtedly know, I have declared a personal interest in regard to high-priced articles, subject to turn-over tax, in the motor trade.  This increase is certainly no gift to the motor trade, nor is it of any benefit to the motoring public.  Probably something like that was necessary but I would ask the Minister for Finance, through the Taoiseach who introduced the measures on his behalf, to temper the wind a little towards the motor industry and the motoring public.</P>
      <P>The selective wholesale tax will now go up from five to ten per cent.  On top of that we have the turnover tax which is heavy and, in addition, we have heavy import duty on material coming in for assembly of vehicles or on completed vehicles assembled in fully built-up condition.  Even the material coming in for assembly is liable to duty at 7½ per cent which, together with wholesale tax and turnover tax, totals about 14½ per cent.  While I feel that I may be prejudiced&mdash;in fact I undoubtedly am &mdash;it would not be right for me not to let the Minister know that I am of the opinion, as many others are also, that the time has come to have another look in future at increased taxation and not to go too heavily on the motor industry. This industry is a very big employer and it will suffer very seriously if taxes are raised too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> There is no question of a stop-go policy.  Even though these measures are necessary, there is no question of putting our economy back.  I agree with the Taoiseach that we are making progress. We have made progress and the only danger signal is that the rate of progress has been a little too fast and there is a very real danger of inflation. This is not a question of stop-go.  This is a question of real measures being taken to counteract the present rate of growth.  We will go on expanding, but we must go on expanding within some sort of control so that the whole system does not run riot.  If it does run riot, we are heading for disaster.</P>
    <P>We have been told by Deputy Corish that the Government should have taken some action to avoid this situation. How naïve can one become?  The root cause of this situation is the sudden rise in personal incomes which are well ahead of the increase in the growth of national production.  What were the Government supposed to do about that?  It ill behoves Deputy Corish, who claims to be the champion of the working man and a champion of the free collective bargaining system, to speak like this.  Would Deputy Corish and his Labour Party colleagues prefer a repudiation of free collective wage negotiations?</P>

      <P>Perhaps we can get back to the point at issue.  We have enjoyed in this country under Fianna Fáil Governments a steadily rising standard of living but we are not satisfied with what we have got so far.  In spite of what Deputy Corish has said, we do not get any joy from imposing taxation. We do not impose taxation just for the fun of it.  Nobody ever does.  No Government will introduce taxation unless it is absolutely necessary and in the public interest.  But here again, as the Taoiseach has said, when we find there is an absolute necessity we do not flinch from doing it.  Even at a time like this, we do not hesitate for a moment to take action which we know will be unpopular but which we know to be absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>Let the public remember there is a great difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition are always in the happy position of being able to advocate any sort of policy they like under the present régime because they know there is not the slightest danger they will be asked to carry it out.  That is the difference.  People will say why is the Government not more adventurous and why do they not produce more policies.  They can only produce policies from this side of the House when they can see their way to carrying them out.  It is fine for the Labour Party to say that the social welfare benefits should be higher and that education should be free and that everybody should have free entry to the university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amused by the trend of the debate in the past ten or 15 minutes and the discussion on directors' fees, remuneration, and so on.  Without wishing to be offensive about it.  I would say, being a company director myself, that the one place I like to be is away from the company and here in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I want now to discuss seriously all that has happened.  The mini-Budget today&mdash;which I call the maxi-culottes Budget&mdash;is the artifice by which the Government have succeeded in getting two motions of No Confidence discussed with it as well as the launching of a new national loan.  The practice of this House has always been that, for good productive purposes and the employment of our people, all Parties support a national loan.  I point to the artifice of the Government through which the Opposition representatives had no alternative but to agree to a situation in which the Taoiseach was in a position to take the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not agree to the loan being discussed or to the Budget being discussed with the Vote of No Confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an example of how the Government are prepared to use and abuse this House for their own purposes.  As Deputy Ryan has so well corrected me, the Government are prepared to use and abuse everything for their own purposes.  Therefore, it is not unlikely that they would use and abuse this House in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises as to whether or not it was possible to predict what has happened today in relation to the mini-Budget.  I would quote from the <Col N="2155" /><i>Irish Independent</i> of 1st May, 1968, and also from columns 516 and 517 of volume 234, No. 4, of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, 30th April, 1968.  For my purposes, it is necessary only to quote a few words from the <i>Irish Independent</i> and to give the reference in the Dáil debates.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan said that while the Budget was an easy Budget it was also a challenging one.  The Minister had not accepted that challenge.  This raised the question of whether it was an election Budget either for a referendum or for a general election.</P>
    <P>The headline on that occasion was quite sufficient&mdash;&ldquo;Balance of Payments will not be Rosy at the End of the Year, says TD.&rdquo;  I do not want to claim kudos for that.  I do not want to take any pleasure out of saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Government are ready to use and abuse everything in this State for their own purposes and included in that are the finances of the State.  They were prepared to produce a Budget which, on the information they had&mdash;and which we had not and could only, therefore, offer an opinion&mdash;was not a proper Budget, which did not face the challenge and in relation to which many people were in a position&mdash;I am not a financial expert&mdash;to predict what would happen, as has happened today. If it was possible to predict in this way then the degree of error that is here, the degree of discrepancy here between the estimates produced at Budget time both of expenditure and of revenue, is so great as to indicate that it was not a mistake and that these people were prepared to use and abuse this year's main Budget in April for their own purposes, namely, to try to get through the two referenda proposals that were intended to install Fianna Fáil in office for the next 20 years, without a means of getting them out.  The degree of error revealed today in the table furnished with the mini-Budget, which I refer to as a maxi-Budget, is £18¾ million in five months.</P>
    <P>Let us consider why it was necessary to have these Parliamentary artifices. Let us consider why it was necessary to introduce a national loan.  Let us <Col N="2156" /> consider why it was necessary to mix up the mini-Budget with the votes of no confidence.  These artifices by the Government were necessary because they had no answer.  Therefore, they would only try to find some bush behind which to hide.  The bush, of course, is Dáil Éireann.  They want to hide here rather than to go out and meet the people.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the people of this country and to the Members of Dáil Éireann that they should consider what sort of an uproar there would be in this House if we were sitting over there on the Government Benches and they were sitting over here on the Opposition benches and we were in the circumstances in which the Government are today, namely, that we had been defeated in a referendum by over three quarter of a million votes and refused to go to the country and, instead, proposed a new national loan, a mini-Budget and a motion from our Taoiseach all at the same time. Just imagine the howls there would be in Dáil Éireann today if that situation obtained, howls that would bring down this roof.  I have seen in different days particularly the present Minister for Agriculture howl and shout at Deputy John A. Costello; I have seen Deputy Seán Lemass interrupt him 49 times in one speech.  What would have happened today if we were over there and they were over here?  My friend, the Minister for Health, sitting across there knows exactly what happened in the past.  I want to ask how would Fianna Fáil have behaved today?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach claim every advancement since 1957?  Europe advanced since 1957.  Britain advanced since 1957.  They have had their difficulties, both of them.  The world advanced since 1957.  Is every move forward to be produced as a cold, fish-like statistic by the Taoiseach to-day? Does he claim that anything that happened since 1957 is due to Fianna Fáil and that nobody else in this country had anything to do with it?  Does he claim he is entitled in his entire speech&mdash;mark you, I christened him Honest John and the press changed it to Honest Jack; I think Honest John is more phonetic&mdash;if he is Honest John, to use &ldquo;value&rdquo; instead of <Col N="2157" />&ldquo;volume&rdquo; and to say so much was spent on housing in 1956 and so much in 1967 or 1968, while we all know the pound is worth only half as much as it was then?  Is he entitled not to mention the question of emigration? Is he entitled to allow his Ministers, for every one of whom he is responsible, to refuse to answer the questions of Deputy Oliver Flanagan on emigration and to leave us with the impression that he is not interested?</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that our educational system is the worst in Western Europe.  Let us remember that Fine Gael produced their policy on this a good few years ago and if it was not stolen it was certainly compulsorily acquired by the Government.  We have not got a situation whereby boys and girls, whose mothers and fathers cannot pay for their university education, can avail of such education if they are of the standard of intelligence and education to merit such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>Let us also face the fact that we have the worst health service in Europe.  I have the greatest pity for the Minister for Health in this instance.  Unless we can arrive at a situation in which no further health charges will be put on the rates but that they will be borne by the Central Exchequer, the Minister must keep coming back to the House to say we cannot afford to make proper provision for health services for our people.  That is the Minister's position. It is the policy of the Government.  It is our job here to state our point of view and to suggest to the people that perhaps they should change their allegiance from Fianna Fáil and give us an opportunity to move over where they are so that we can implement a better policy.</P>
    <P>In agriculture 10,000 people are leaving the land per year.  We have failed entirely in regard to any intensive type of agriculture, whether it be horticulture or anything else, that would keep more of our people on the land.  I agree the Government have provided grants for various aspects of agriculture but they are not adequate to deal with the situation.  I was shadow Minister for Agriculture for four or five years, and if I were to have a chat with Deputy Clinton, who now has <Col N="2158" /> that job to do, as to what would be necessary for agriculture, I think we would have to agree that it would take as long as three to five years to clear up the appalling mess that has been created by the Minister for Agriculture who set out to destroy the biggest farming organisation in this country, the National Farmers' Association.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who has this aura of being apart from the other boys, to use a very kindly term in regard to him, is responsible for this situation.  He has supported Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture, in his efforts to break the NFA.  If the gamble failed and if Deputy Blaney had to go to the bookie and pay the price he has only himself to blame.  Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach have similarly to go to the same bookie, the bookie being the people. They do not want to go to that bookie again because they have already gambled very heavily and lost on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Without going into detail on certain things, what were the reasons, for instance, for the great increase in the volume of milk produced and the increase in wheat production this year? The reasons were that the general overheads on the farm today had gone to the stage where a man who has to support his wife and children had to select some form of production which would give him a reasonable return rather than continue with other branches of farming which have been neglected and left derelict by Fianna Fáil.  Now Fianna Fáil are talking about the production of beef and the production of other things.  I have not heard them saying anything about self feed silage units in the last ten years. We must conserve our grass during the wintertime and feed it to our cattle all the year round.</P>
    <P>I listened today to the Taoiseach using this trickly statistic of value instead of volume.  I should be very pleased if, when he is replying to this debate, he would talk about housing and how much was being spent on houses.  Last night I came home from the town of Dundalk having interviewed people there from 9.45 until 12.30 a.m., having been in Drogheda from 7.30 on the same job.  I interviewed <Col N="2159" /> a young couple in Drogheda who had a baby of one year&mdash;they had to bring the child with them&mdash;who are living in a shed at the back of a house in Pearse Park.  Is that not a horrible situation in 1968, two young people living with their baby in a shed with the water running down the walls?  I went to Dundalk and I will resign from this House if anyone can prove this is not true: I interviewed a man who is living in a boarding house and whose three children are incarcerated in the Blessed Oliver Plunket Hospital, a hospital for old people, in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Taoiseach, whose Party has been in office for ten continuous years, has the gross impertinence to talk about housing and to create that aura of respectibility about himself that he is not associated with Deputy Boland and Deputy Blaney. Let us face the fact that we must get these people out if we are to do anything for the people.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position of Ministers. Can the Minister for Agriculture get any good voluntarily from the farmers? Will he be forever driving them along and must he continue to make violent attacks on them?  As regards the Minister for Local Government, will he get voluntary help from the people from whom he needs help in the building of houses and the provision of amenities?  Remember the arrogance of Fianna Fáil.  This is a man who never served a day as an ordinary Deputy of this House.  A man who arrived here today, because his father had been a Minister during 30 years was made a Minister tomorrow.  That is an example of arrogance if nothing else.</P>
    <P>Imagine the situation in which my colleague in Louth, the Minister for External Affairs, is burning the rubber from my constituency to Dáil Éireann as hard as he can making every effort to save his Party's skin.  Maureen Potter in a Gaiety Theatre pantomime was asked if Deputy Aiken was living in the past: &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that man is living in New York&rdquo;.  This Government have become rancid and they have got to be put out if there is any good to be done for Ireland.  They spoke about the <i>Irish Independent.</i> It is my opinion <Col N="2160" /> that that newspaper went a long way too far during the referendum and that they have to be nice now.  Perhaps, I am saying something for which I shall be sorry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us now take the Ministers one by one.  The Minister for Education is in open warfare with everybody on the academic staffs of the universities.  I seek a denial of that statement from him.  Read the newspapers. His merger, which should be to bring together, is dividing in diametrically opposite directions and all he can do is make a speech now and again. Can we get anything good from this man for the education of our children?</P>
      <P>The Minister sitting opposite at the moment is a personal friend of mine. He has not reached agreement with the Irish Medical Association or the Irish Medical Union.  Reconciliation was attempted many years ago.  We had a running battle between Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Health, and the IMA and the IMU which lasted for years.  We had a select committee on the health services on which I served.  There was a big &ldquo;do&rdquo; in Ivy House the likes of which was never heard or seen before.  Every surgeon, every paediatrician, every gynaecologist, everyone who had anything to do with medicine in this country, including members of the select committee, was at it and we had the Army band playing sweet music from the balcony.  A nicer night you could not have had.</P>
      <P>Then Deputy MacEntee moved out of the Department of Health and we had other Ministers for Health, including the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, the Lord rest his soul, and we are now back at square one: the doctors have not agreed and I suggest that a further change of personnel in the Department is needed.  Affiliation seems to be the only thing that might do some good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2161" /> Nevertheless, it would be quite wrong if this or any other Party were to move along in the old Annie-Get-Your-Gun fashion of saying: &ldquo;Anything you can do I can do better&rdquo;.  I do not think that is good enough.  If the people of Ireland wish to change their Government, they should be given the opportunity to do so.  They should be told what they are getting by way of government. I eschew the line Deputy Seán Lemass followed.  He had two slogans, one being &ldquo;Wives put your husbands to work,&rdquo; and the other, &ldquo;Let us get cracking&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Give us a blank cheque,&rdquo; they said.  &ldquo;Do not worry about policies, vote for Fianna Fáil. Was not that poor devil always a decent man&rdquo;.  Deputy Cosgrave today mentioned political sophistication.  The people are sophisticated enough now to vote in the referendum as they thought fit.  Now the challenge is here for the Opposition Parties to put their policies before the people to work like niggers from now until the next general election, which I hope is not long away, to try to let every person in their constituencies, in the country, know their policies, to let them be judged by these policies.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention a few of the things that matter in this respect, but, first of all, let us consider the suggestion of the Taoiseach&mdash;it was a rather sly suggestion&mdash;that there is no hope of any other Government as an alternative to Fianna Fáil&mdash;that there can be nothing but a Coalition Government or a Fianna Fáil Government. I should like to refer again to something I mentioned during the past six or nine months and which I hope I got across.</P>
      <P>On the count in the local elections last year, if there was a general election under PR the result would have been about 60 to 65 seats for Fianna Fáil, about 53 to 58 for Fine Gael and 20 to 25 for Labour&mdash;something of that order.  That was the first break.  It indicated that Fianna Fáil would be in a minority position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> Let us then go straight to the referendum. Deputy Booth suggested that a large number of the people who voted against Fianna Fáil on this occasion would revert and vote for Fianna Fáil again.  To my mind it is clear that Fianna Fáil cannot get an overall majority.  It is clear the challenge is there and let the best horse jump the ditch.  The position now is that Fine Gael can get an overall majority in the next election and if, perchance, they are not in an overall position, they probably will be the largest Party in this House and in that situation, as statements of intent have been announced, it is my opinion that Fine Gael will be the next Government.</P>
    <P>As that is so, we have a responsibility to enunciate policy.  The time is too short to do so here this evening but it will be done in the next weeks or months.  We will see to it that by our energy and effort everybody in the country will know Fine Gael's policy if they do not know it already. Let us mention that in agriculture it will be our job to salvage the Fianna Fáil wreck and it will be a very tough salvage operation.  In the Department of Industry and Commerce we have an extraordinary situation.  During the past three years, Fine Gael have been saying that existing industry was not getting its fair share, the only grant being given to it being for adaptation. Besides, an industry had to be an exporting concern before it got an adaptation grant.  Large spectrums of industry were disqualified being completely at a disadvantage in comparison with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Then, three years ago, Fine Gael produce their policy at their Ard-Fheis and after we had hammered it home we had a change of mind and now we are giving re-equipment grants to manufacturing industries.  The grant is 25 per cent for existing industry and there is a grant of 50 per cent for new industry.  In parts of the country, such as in the area of the Minister for Health, it is Fine Gael policy&mdash;I want to emphasise that&mdash;where existing industry's need for major re-equipment is of such magnitude in relation to the size of the industry as to constitute an entirely new departure to give existing <Col N="2163" /> industry the same treatment as industry from abroad.  We do not want to have a situation such as I had in my town where somebody came from Germany and got £60,000 and somebody else who employed 16 girls more got £16,000, notwithstanding the fact that they had to build not far away from the German industry.  Many of these people are members of Taca and many of them followers of Fianna Fáil but they can look to us to give them what they require.</P>
    <P>Let us look at health.  The Minister for Health is present and I do not want to offend him.  It is Fine Gael's policy to produce a health scheme based on insurance, to stop forever the horrible situation whereby, for instance, two old age pensioners living in a house with three or four children cannot get a green card even though every one of their children can apply and get medical cards on their own account.  This is an example of one of the extraordinary anomalies of the 1963 Health Act.  A health service based on insurance with coverage for those not insured is the policy of Fine Gael, a different policy from anything enunciated by the Minister or his predecessors. I am aware that both his predecessors, not forgetting the wonderful coming-together we had between Deputy MacEntee and the doctors, failed to reach agreement with the medical profession in this matter.  We worked it from 1953 to 1957 and they came along then and failed to work it.  It is time they moved over and gave it to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I dealt with local government last night.  Fine Gael policy is that if you build houses, industry, employment and everything else follows that.  In the inter-Party Government days, which are sneered at today, we built more houses than are built to-day.  Housebuilding has been reduced from 11,000 per year to 4,000 per year.  What was wrong with the Government when you had houses falling all over this city? You had women and children in Griffith Barracks and the husbands getting in for half an hour each evening to see the children.  If the Government gambled from 1957 to 1961 at not building houses it is time they paid the <Col N="2164" /> bookie and went to the people who will deal with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention something else&mdash;the disgraceful situation in relation to compulsory Irish.  That will cease under a Fine Gael Government. I just love to get publicity for that.  It is wrong to say that we have a small minority of people who are profiting by the language, who are profiting from what should be a cultural attribute and which is in Scotland and Wales a highly cultural attribute.  It is Fine Gael policy to end compulsory Irish in the Civil Service and other places There is benefit and advantage for those with some knowledge of the Irish language. I knew a dispensary doctor who was earning a very high salary as a specialist in England.  He was single and his mother was old and back he came to take on a lowly dispensary job.  He had spent a few years in England and was a specialist in his own right in a certain branch of medicine.  However, he had to study Irish for nine months before he could get his dispensary.</P>
    <P>There is another case to which I should like to refer.  On the first occasion that Ireland won the Triple Crown in Belfast after the match we sang the <i>Soldier's Song</i> in English and every Welshman there sang the Welsh national anthem in Welsh.  What is wrong with the language in this country is that Fianna Fáil have prostituted it for their own ends.  That goes under a Fine Gael Government.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to something else.  Under a Fine Gael Government we believe that social welfare payments should be increased.  They are too low.  Our policy for a just society is to increase social welfare benefits for the people who need them.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about doctrinaire capitalism, socialism and private enterprise and a lot of such cod.  If you want a different situation go to southern England and there you will find many people who did not make their money in the last five years, people with vast incomes.  There you will find a situation where there is a need for doctrinaire socialism.  We in Ireland have no such society.  There are few rich people here.  Most of the people who are doing anything are doing it on <Col N="2165" /> overdrafts.  In Ireland a private enterprise economy harnessed to social justice, harnessed to a just society will suit this country so long as the Government of the day will not flinch at going in and employing people in industry where private enterprise has failed or is not suitable.  This talk about doctrinaire capitalism and throwing out of cliches is of little consequence. A Fine Gael Government would have a just society, a Government that would encourage private enterprise and, at the same time, if private enterprise failed or was unsuitable we would inaugurate another Shannon Scheme.  That is commonsense. I do not think anyone would cavil at the definitions I have given, people in private enterprises, small proprietors, some large, very few wealthy, some wealthy and some who became wealthy in this generation or in the last.  Surely the people can see the need for a Party who can proceed towards a just society and use every opportunity for the advantage of every one of our people.</P>
    <P>Let me pass now to something that has not been mentioned in this debate today and which should have been mentioned.  When I came to look at the debate on last year's Budget in the library, I went through this issue of the Dáil debates and for every title on every cover that related to ordinary parliamentary business there were six, seven or eight titles relating to the two referenda.  Facing this Dáil or the next Dáil if this Dáil is dissolved there is at this moment a vast amount of parliamentary work that has been thrown aside by the Government.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has passed re-equipment grants months ago.  He has produced a press report which shows that he is going to amalgamate the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal. He has issued grants.  The company I am involved in has got one of them. The legislation still has to go through. We are still waiting for this legislation.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the Minister for Health?  How much legislation has he waiting in his Department?  What is the position of the Minister for Local Government?  How much legislation has he got in his Department?  What <Col N="2166" /> about the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Taoiseach himself? I want to prophesy to you that whatever government is formed from the nineteenth Dáil when the Cabinet sit down there will be more prospective legislation waiting to be passed, most of it non-political, than would paper the walls of the Cabinet room and that the whole work of the next Dáil is going to be rendered completely and absolutely ineffective for the first two years by the nefarious attempt of Fianna Fáil to take power for 20 years, when they were prepared to throw aside all the parliamentary work in which we should have been engaged. This I believe to be a serious criticism. This I believe to be something that will affect this country this year, next year and the following year.  I believe it to be evidence that the Government will cast aside everything no matter what it is for their own preservation. I believe in collective responsibility and because of the institution of parliamentary democracy that operates here and in England and various other places collective responsibility is vested in and the criticism of it is vested in the Taoiseach.  He is responsible for every Minister.  So far there have been no dismissals.</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that the selective wholesale tax has been doubled, that the selective wholesale tax is an extremely tough tax and that what the selective wholesale tax means, for instance, is that if you made a door for a new house on the site you would not pay selective wholesale tax but if you bought the door and the door-knob and everything else in a builder's providers or had it made off the site in a carpenter's shop you would pay five per cent and you are now going to pay ten per cent.  I do not want to go through the whole spectrum of selective wholesale tax but I want the House and people to know just how serious this is.</P>
    <P>I want to point to the fact that there is nothing for the social welfare recipients in this mini-maxi-Budget. They are being left in exactly the same position as they were.  They suffered the impositions of the Budget last April and they had to wait until 1st <Col N="2167" /> August for any little relief they were getting.  Now the Taoiseach at page 4 of the circulated version of his speech says that we were gathering speed too quickly in our economy and that the brake had to be put on.  The brake has been put on the social welfare recipients, the recipients of health benefits, just as it has been put on the company director or the monied man.</P>
    <P>Let us remember also that postage charges are something that strike everybody. It may take a little while.  Somebody may notice that the amount of money being spent in a business on postage charges has now gone up by 25 or 30 per cent and they will try to get their money back, otherwise they will go out of business.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that a penny a gallon on 7,000 gallons of milk proved one thing: the Government are completely out of touch with the people.  I went down for my <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning.  Being a politician and having heard the news the night before I rambled over to the boys on the milk stall.  I want to assure Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Taoiseach and the Government that this was their greatest political mistake of all recorded time.  A penny a gallon on 7,000 gallons is something less than £30 a year.  It has been taken by the farmers of Ireland as a studied insult and if one were to talk entirely in the political way in which the Fianna Fáil mind addresses itself to problems of this kind Fianna Fáil would, politically, have been far better off if they gave them nothing. Let us face the fact that the people who went in for milk and the people who went into wheat did so because their fixed, unavoidable, overheads had reached a stage at which they needed a large gross return.  They did not go for milk because they wanted to milk cows twice a day seven days a week.  Many a farmer finds that a very big burden, especially in later years.  They went in because their overheads were so large that they could not run their farms and feed their families any other way.  People did not go into wheat because they wanted to grow wheat and run the risk of a rejection <Col N="2168" /> at harvest time and this does apply to the growing of cereals in this country.  They went in for the same reason.  They went in and now the taxpayers have to pay £1½ million in this mini-Budget towards getting rid of losses on wheat.  There is the only reason why the Minister for Agriculture did not put a levy on wheat this year.  He looked over at me today and he said: &ldquo;Deputy Donegan knows&rdquo;.  I know I could not say it politically.  I thought about it since and I know that the only reason a 5/- levy did not go on this year was that the Government were heading for a referendum.  Let us face that situation and let me end as I began. Last April it could be foreseen. I said, and I am no pundit at all, that this was a Budget either for a referendum or a general election.  I have been proved correct.  We now have a mini-Budget and it is going to crush the poorer people of our country.  We have a list of Ministers whose names I have mentioned and whose hard work I have discussed.  I think the House and the people will agree that there is only one hope for Ireland now and that is to give them a change.  I am asking Fianna Fáil now to come out to the country and give them that change because that is what will happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I have to ask once more where is the Minister for Local Government because he has replaced surely in the Fianna Fáil lexicon the place that used to be taken by Britain as the never-ending source of all their evil.  He has not appeared in the House as far as I can see to support the Taoiseach in his very weak effort to justify the continued existence of this caucus as a Government of the Irish people.  Mind you he should appear because he had a big hand in bringing the worried frown to the brow of Deputy Dowling and others and placing on their shoulders the burden of concerning themselves with that disagreeable task, ascertaining the will of the people, in the very near future.  He should appear.  Let us hope he will be here at a later stage in the debate when we shall have some words to address through you, Sir, to him on the part he has played in attempting to defy the will of the Irish people and in attempting <Col N="2169" /> to suborn the democratic institutions which we have inherited.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 22 on today's Order Paper on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am compelled to raise the subject matter of Question No. 22 because of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply given by the Taoiseach today.  The question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a company (name supplied) engaged in the export of sheepskins were hindered in their work by an officer of his Department investigating export quotas; that during the course of this investigation an official of his Department travelled abroad for the purpose of interviewing and questioning customers of this company; and that such action resulted in serious damage to this company's prestige and trade; if he will state the results of this investigation; and if he is satisfied that such an investigation was warranted.</P>
      <P>In answering, the Taoiseach was evasive and did not give a satisfactory reply.</P>
      <P>This company has been operating for over 35 years in the export and trade of sheep skins.  The managing director is Mr. Patrick J. Guerin and his father before him built up this firm to the position that it holds today in the highest esteem with customers in Britain.  The main business is export and trade in sheepskins and hides. This company employs a staff of over 25 and at peak times over 50.  They built up goodwill and esteem abroad among the biggest customers in the business in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To export sheepskins quota licences are required under a statutory order enacted in 1956 and the procedure is that 20 per cent of domestic sheepskins may be exported.  This company has secured licences for the past number <Col N="2170" /> of years and when a licence is issued the Revenue Commissioners come into the matter and send up an official to check the number of sheepskins going on a truck.  He tallies them, identifies them and seals them.  Different officials of the Department have come to do this work.</P>
    <P>Out of the blue on 15th August an official of the Special Investigations Branch of the Revenue Commissioners called at this office and demanded private, confidential books of this company. The managing director and his brother who were not aware of the procedure or their legal rights in this matter handed over the books although they offered facilities for the officer in question to make copies of, or extracts from the contents of their books.</P>
    <P>Three days later, having consulted the company's solicitor they went to the office of the official, Mr. Cahalane, at 9.30 a.m.  He was not there but his colleague in the office showed them into Mr. Cahalane's office, provided chairs for them and asked them to await Mr. Cahalane's arrival.  He arrived at 9.55 and was very annoyed that they should be in his office.  Mr. Guerin asked if he could have his books returned as they were indispensable to the operation of the company's business and Mr. Cahalane refused.</P>
    <P>Mr. Guerin, the managing director explained that he had no right to take the books away without their permission and that he misled them into thinking that he had this right where-upon Mr. Cahalane opened up his press, took out the books, flung them at them and ordered them out of his office.  Mr. Guerin's brother explained that they were not there of their own accord, that a colleague of his had shown them in.</P>
    <P>Following this, the company which had been engaged in export business, found that a customer in the North of Ireland wanted no more to do with them and refused to consider any more sheepskins from them.  Another customer of theirs seemed to have heard the same story in the North of Ireland and said they were not interested in having any more dealings with this company.  As a result the managing director of the company fears that their <Col N="2171" /> prestige, goodwill and trade have suffered as a result of a Department official travelling to the North to interview a customer of the company.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is no question of any duties being evaded or any loss of revenue from the alleged misuse of licences by this company which fulfilled the requirements of the export licences as is proved by officials of the Department.  I wonder is it this company that is on trial or the officers of the Department because on each occasion a different officer of the Department inspected, identified, counted, tallied and sealed the load of sheepskins placed on trucks for export to Britain.  Is it suggested by the officers of the Department that this load of sheepskins is hijacked on the way because they are sealed when they leave the premises, after being checked by an official?  I should like to know if the various officials who did this work were investigated by the Department or is it suggested that the officer at the port of exit was guilty of some breach of the regulations?</P>
    <P>It is well known that this is a very competitive business and that a company has its rivals.  It would suit a rival to send in a complaint to try to disrupt the company's business and even if only for six months to destroy its export trade.  The Taoiseach, as acting Minister for Finance, must know this, must know who made the complaint and must know if this investigation was carried out for any particular reason. Was there justification for it or were the officials of the Department who checked, tallied and sealed these goods in question or on trial?  He must know if they are investigated.  I should like to know if a report on their integrity is available before any offices of the Department can disrupt a business such as this which has enjoyed prestige and goodwill over so many years and is now hindered in its working by the action of the officials.  I should like the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, to answer these questions.  I should also like to get an assurance in this House that there will be no question of victimisation of this company. I should like an assurance from <Col N="2172" /> the Taoiseach that there will be no question of the officials of the Department carrying on a campaign of revenge in an effort to ensure that they are right.  I should like this assurance from the Taoiseach.  I should also like an assurance that there will be no hindering of this company in its operations. They have suffered enough.  They have lost exports which are also a loss to the country.</P>
    <P>It is vital that a review of this statutory regulation should take place. It is anomalous that export licences should be required for sheepskins and not for hides.  It is a fact that there are fewer tanners and others employed than when the regulations were first made.  The existing regulations impose restrictions on companies who are trying to improve the export trade, thus adding to the revenue of the country.</P>
    <P>I would avail of this opportunity to say that a review of the statutory regulations of 1956 is called for.  Far from hindering them, every effort should be made to encourage companies who are trying to export.  In the case of meat factories who export sheepskins there are no restrictions with regard to the number they may export.  The restrictions that I have referred to are imposing great strain on companies and I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Taoiseach to call for a review of them because they are unrealistic in present day trading conditions.</P>
    <P>An apology is due and should be forthcoming to the company for the manner in which they have been treated, for the way in which they were intimidated and for the abusive behaviour of an official of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing to be established here is that there is a restriction on the export of sheepskins from this country and that restriction is not placed there just for the fun of it or to give the officers of the Revenue Commissioners an opportunity of examining the quantities of sheepskin exported by certain people.  The whole purpose of the restriction and of the licensing system is to ensure that sufficient sheepskins are retained in this country to supply the fellmongers and the tanneries <Col N="2173" /> who process these sheepskins for manufacture into various commodities like gloves, uppers of shoes and things like that.  So that, the main purpose of this restriction is to maintain employment in this country for Irish workers.  Therefore, that is the first fact to be established&mdash;the fact that the regulations are there&mdash;and as long as they exist they are bound to be obeyed by those dealing in these commodities.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners from time to time receive information about evasion of licensing restrictions and other matters.  It is not possible for them on all occasions to examine every load of these commodities and particularly of sheepskins leaving the country.  They can make spot checks, maybe one in three or one in four, as the case may be.  As Deputy O'Connell said, these sheepskins are often exported in containers and they are not a very agreeable commodity to handle because of the chemicals and other things used in order to preserve them.  In fact, I believe they are rather objectionable in many ways.  However, that does not deter the Revenue Commissioners' officers from examining them.  They do, according as opportunity offers.  Therefore, every load, whether it is an open load or in a container that leaves the country is not examined but spot checks are made of them and even when these checks are made it is not always possible to ensure that the amount of skins in the container or on the load conforms with the export documents concerning them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in this case information was received by the Revenue Commissioners during the month of August. I take it the information was to the effect that the company concerned was exporting more sheepskins than the licences they held warranted and when the officer called on the premises a couple of days later, on 12th August, and asked for the production of the books relating to the exports, he was informed that the books were not then available, that they were with the auditors.  He produced the notice of the Revenue Commissioners which requires such firms to produce the books and permits copies to be taken <Col N="2174" /> of them.  On this occasion the officer, having seen the books on 15th August, suggested that it would be more convenient for him and permit of a more thorough inspection of them, if he were permitted to take the books with him to his own office.  My information is that no objection was raised by the company to this course.</P>
    <P>In the course of his examination the officer noticed that certain documents were missing from the books that he had in his possession and he communicated with the company and pointed out this fact to them.  They made a search for them and, I think it was the next day, the firm phoned and said the documents were now available. The officer suggested that he might collect them on that day and this, too, was agreed.  So, he took the documents to his office&mdash;he had already taken the books.  Three days later representatives of the firm called to the office of the Revenue Commissioners' officer and demanded the return of the books. I do not know whether the officer concerned was there at the time. Deputy O'Connell says he was not, that somebody else was, and that they waited for his coming.  I will accept that.  But, when the officer did come and spoke to the representatives of the firm, he said he was not yet finished with the books and asked that the books be left with him for some hours in order to complete his examination. This was not agreed and the representatives of the firm insisted on taking the books with them.  The officer said that he might require them to return them to him again at a later stage.</P>
    <P>These are the facts of the transaction as I know them but, as I said in my reply to Deputy O'Connell today, the investigation was, in fact, warranted as a result of further examinations carried out by the officer concerned. He did, as Deputy O'Connell suggests, call to the firm in the North of Ireland to whom a consignment had been made but he called to no other firms who were customers of the Dublin exporters. Deputy O'Connell said that he had some other customers in the North of Ireland and some customers in Britain. The Revenue Commissioner's officer made no attempt whatever so far to <Col N="2175" /> contact any of these other customers. So, what happened in relation to the business of the Dublin firm with these other customers is no responsibility of the officer concerned.  I want to say that the officer's integrity, or the integrity of any other officer, is not in question on this occasion.  They were doing their duty according to the laws of this country.

      <P>In other words to maintain the due quantum of sheepskins in the country to ensure continuity of employment of our own people.  There can be no question of victimisation as far as victimisation might be interpreted in this context. Not only is there no question of victimisation but the Revenue Commissioners' officers informed the Department of Industry and Commerce, who are the licensing issuing authority, that as far as this firm was concerned they did not want this investigation to prejudice them while the investigation was going on.  Therefore, as far as the Revenue Commissioners were concerned, it was a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce to issue to this firm whatever licences they were entitled to.  I take it that that continued.  It does not matter whether there are fewer tanners now or fewer people employed in tanneries now than when the regulations first came in.  That may be explained, if it is so, by the change over to synthetic materials now used for the purposes for which sheepskins were formerly used.</P>

      <P>The tanneries who benefit by these restrictions naturally make their representations to the Department; the people who have skins to export make their representations, and from my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce I know there is always a conflict of interests in the case of a commodity like this for which high prices can be got on the export market.  The Department of Industry and Commerce's main concern, however, is to ensure the amount of employment that can be given by the retention of as many skins as possible in the country will in fact be given.  I do not know what kind of attitude the representatives of the firm took up when they went to the Revenue Commissioners' office or what kind of attitude the officer took up, but the facts are that the Revenue Commissioners' officer asked for the books and was given them.  There was no objection raised when ultimately the firm's representatives came to the Revenue Commissioners' office and asked for the books; they were given the books back.  In the meantime, the investigations are continuing and, as I said earlier, the investigations appear to have been warranted.  Now, if the officer concerned transgressed his functions in any way, this firm would have their remedy; but, on the other hand, if it is established with adequate proof that skins were exported in excess of the licensing provision then a prosecution would follow.  As I said earlier, the matter is under investigation and, therefore, I do not want to comment on the merits of the case any further.  These are the facts as I have been given them and as I believe to be true.</P>
