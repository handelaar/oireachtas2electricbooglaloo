    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that a reply dated 25th April which issued from the Attorney General's Office to a member of Dáil Éireann concerning a constituent (name supplied) was discourteous and abrupt in manner; and if any general instructions exist in relation to the framing of letters relating to constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both parts of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Taoiseach has actually seen the letter to which I refer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of that, does the Taoiseach not consider that in matters of this kind, which are of a delicate nature and in which a certain <Col N="2" /> degree of humanity is called for in conveying news to people who are innocent of any offence, relating to their relatives, it is surely no more than to be expected that the Attorney General's Office, or indeed any other organ of the State, should write that news in such a fashion as will endeavour to soften the blow for these innocent sufferers?  I am using these words because I do not want to identify the case.  Does the Taoiseach not consider that there is an obligation on all public servants to be civil at least and to try to appreciate the ordinary human feelings of the public when conveying news of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy contends, but I think there is some misunderstanding of what the communication in fact was.  The letter which the lady concerned got in respect of her son from the Attorney General's Office was, to my mind, not in discourteous terms, even if they were <Col N="3" /> strictly legal terms.  This lady implied from that terminology that it was a discourteous letter.  It was not a discourteous letter, nor was it intended to be.  The Deputy got a similar letter and I am sure he will agree that there was no discourtesy disclosed on the face of that letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he thinks it desirable that it should be made plain that quite apart from the question of deliberate discourtesy&mdash;and I do not suggest this was present in this case&mdash;there is an obligation to convey bad news in such a manner as will make the blow fall as lightly as possible on the recipient, particularly when the recipient is innocent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in existence a circular dating 20 years back calling on all civil servants to deal on all occasions with the public as courteously and as kindly as possible. I do not think that circular was departed from in this instance.  If I might elaborate slightly, the question was whether an extradition warrant should be executed or not after a certain sentence was served abroad. The words of the Attorney General's letter were that having looked into the case he had come to the conclusion that the warrant should be executed, but apparently the unfortunate lady concluded that the warrant would be killed; in other words, that it would not be effective and that may have caused the distress involved in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are public servants who do not deal with letters from the general public either courteously or discourteously, because they ignore them?</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a specific case and the Deputy may not raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not in the public interest generally to make it manifest&mdash; and knowing the Attorney General as we all do, it is unthinkable that from him there should come any letter <Col N="4" /> designed to hurt the feelings of an afflicted person&mdash;that if any offence were given, it arises from the common form which is issued and which certainly should never have proceeded from a person in that high office for the purpose of offending an afficted mother?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not intended as such.  There was no such intention whatever.  The Attorney General's Office is used to dealing with people who understand legal terminology, and legal terminology was used in the correspondence in this case and, unfortunately, by their interpretation of the words I have just mentioned, the lady in question got the wrong impression of what the decision was.  That decision was explained to her in subsequent correspondence.  I might say that at this stage and since, perhaps, Deputy Dunne took up the case, the man himself has written to the Attorney General indicating that there were facts surrounding the circumstances of his imprisonment which were not disclosed up to now, facts in which the probation officer in Britain has now become involved, and it has been suggested that there is a possibility of the rehabilitation of this man by contact with that probation officer.  The Attorney General has written to the man himself asking that the probation officer be put in touch with him and the case will be considered further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the fact that, owing to the inability of CIE and licensed hauliers to provide an adequate road transport for livestock, the members of the cattle trade have been obliged at enormous cost to themselves to provide this service themselves, he considers it to be in the best interest of this most important industry that road transport of livestock be liberalised, or, alternatively, that he should grant licences to those who have supplied this very vital service for the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the carryings of livestock by road by CIE have declined substantially from about 257,000 in 1957 to around 136,000 in 1966.  On the other hand, the carryings of livestock by licensed road hauliers have increased in the same period, from 659,000 to 1,210,000.  Since then, I have eased the restrictions on the carriage of livestock for reward and practically all licensed hauliers may now carry cattle throughout the State regardless of the limitations on the area of operation specified in their licences.  In addition, I announced recently that I am prepared to grant lorry weight increases to licensed hauliers.</P>
      <P>Unless and until these extensive measures can be seen to be inadequate I could not grant further licences but, as I told the House in reply to questions earlier this year, I will keep under constant review the effect of the extensions in the scope of operation of licences which I have granted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in all cases, only in the case of people carrying livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in fact, a very large proportion of the livestock carried is at present being carried by illegal hauliers and it is a question of legalising this haulage? Apparently, they are the only people who know what to do and where to be in order to carry livestock.  The cattle trade are very much in favour of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we have, in addition, arranged for the plating of lorries to remove odd lots of cattle at the end of fairs.  The Deputy is aware of that.  I have seen the Licensed Hauliers Association and the Livestock Traders Association&mdash;in the case of the Licensed Hauliers Association the date is April 23rd&mdash;and all the evidence we have got will be examined by officers of my Department and other Departments interested, in connection with the general study that <Col N="6" /> is being made of road transport as a whole, with a view to preserving CIE as a valuable transport carrier of other kinds of goods and of cattle in so far as it is possible and with a view to seeing what can be done to reduce costs of road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the anomaly that, although he has extended the area over which these plated lorries operate for the carriage of livestock, if the licences were provisionally granted to residents in a town with a ten mile circuit for merchandise delivery, they cannot be purchased by, or transferred to, anyone who does not live within the original merchandise area, although the potential purchaser does not wish to use them for merchandise but wishes to use them only for the transport of cattle, and would the Minister consider facilitating the transfer of such licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already gone a fair distance in that inasmuch as we used only to permit transfers of a licensed haulier's licence, if it was not an all-Ireland licence, to another person living within 12 miles.  We now transfer the licence to another person living in the total area for which the licence was given in the case of a haulier who wishes to sell his business. So we have made some progress in regard to liberalisation in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has stated, can we take it then that the activities of the Gestapo agents of CIE who frequent fairs and marts in order to catch these illegal hauliers will now cease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal with that question.  It might be a question of infraction of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that this question was put down by Deputy Gogan because of the many approaches made to him and to other Deputies in the Dublin area, both by the people in the cattle trade and by the people concerned in this type of haulage.  I wonder would the Minister be prepared to meet a deputation of both parties at the same time, <Col N="7" /> that is, the people in the cattle trade who want this type of haulage and who say it is the only suitable type, and the other people who are in this unfortunate position?</P>

A new trunk cable scheme from Castleblayney to Ballybay and Cootehill is scheduled for completion next year; as an interim relief measure some temporary circuits have recently been provided for Cootehill and additional temporary circuits will be provided for both Cootehill and Ballybay as soon as the Castleblayney-Monaghan cable is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Contract drawings and specification for contract No. 10 of the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme were received in my Department in April, 1966.  This contract consists of the distribution system, reservoirs and pumping stations to serve the western section of County Dublin, north of Finglas, including the districts of St. Margarets, Kilsallaghan, Rolestown, Palmerstown, Ballyboughal, Oldtown, Cottrelstown and Garristown.</P>
      <P>The pipes will be laid along the lines of the roads running from Six Mile House to Garristown in two lines, one running via St. Margarets, Kilsallaghan and Oldtown and the other via Palmerstown and Adamstown.</P>
      <P>The pipes will be cement asbestos or PVC in sizes ranging from eight inches down to three inches.</P>
      <P>The areas to be served by the contract will get their water supply mainly from the pipes being laid under contract No. 5 which was sanctioned by me on 31/5/1967 but was not started until the end of December 1967.  Contract No. 10 is one of a number of schemes which I have approved recently and formal clearance of the documentation will be issued to Dublin County Council very shortly with a recommendation that the work be synchronised with contract No. 5 on which it is dependent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no point in laying this part of the scheme until the water was available in the pipes being laid under contract No. 5.  I am sure Deputy Dunne could be very good on the subject of a £165,000 scheme with no water in the pipes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it outside the imagination of the Minister and his Department to lay the pipes for this scheme in anticipation of the arrival of the water on a certain date or does that put too great a tax on the ingenuity of his engineering staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I said, I do not think there would be much point in spending £165,000 on a water scheme for which there was no water available; but the decision is to synchronise contract No. 10 to conclude at the <Col N="11" /> same time as contract No. 5 so that the water will be available at the same time as the distribution system.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that the Loreto School, Enniscorthy will have to close down because of my Department's decision to phase it out of the free education scheme.</P>
      <P>The position is that following discussions among all the interested parties held with a view to rationalising the provision for secondary education for girls and providing educationally viable units, the Loreto Order agreed to withdraw from Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>I might mention that consequent on other rationalisation measures in Wexford, the Loreto Order will have much greater responsibilities there in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the <Col N="15" /> Minister not agree that the reason for the Loreto Convent withdrawing in the near future from Enniscorthy is the fact that they were denied State facilities made available to other convents in the area?  Would he not further agree that the withdrawal of this convent will cause serious overloading on the other convents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with either of those suggestions.  Firstly, the Loreto Order made the decision to withdraw; they were not forced to withdraw.  They attended a meeting at which the whole position was explained and, as I have said, a similar operation was carried out in Wexford town and has resulted in greater responsibilities being taken on by that Order and fewer by other Orders.  It is a question of rationalising the educational facilities. I do not agree that there will not be adequate provision in Enniscorthy. The whole object is to provide adequately for the secondary education need of girls in Enniscorthy and to provide it in viable units where very wide-ranging subjects can be provided. This is what is being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey carried out by the Medical Research Council of Ireland showed that about 53 children born in Ireland suffered deformities which might be attributable to the use of the drug thalidomide.  Deformities resulting from thalidomide are of a particular pattern; but not all deformities of this pattern can definitely be ascribed to thalidomide.</P>
      <P>My Department would have no standing in relation to civil claims in respect of deformity alleged to have been caused by this drug.</P>
      <P>Rehabilitation facilities are available at the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, which also provides a limb fitting service.  I understand that the Centre has dealt with 44 cases of congenital amputee in the relevant age group and of these, seven presented features particularly suggestive of thalidomide effects.  Of these 44 cases, 37 qualified for services under the Health Acts including six of the seven cases suggestive of thalidomide effects. Whether in the case of those eligible under the Health Acts, in-patient services are provided free or at a charge not exceeding 10/- a day would depend on the circumstances of the parents.</P>

The cost would not be prohibitive if they were made generally free.

      <P>So far there has been no change in the position about charges for outpatient specialist services provided under the Health Acts but, as foreshadowed in the White Paper on the Health Services, the abolition of these charges is to be provided for in forthcoming legislation.</P>
      <P>The present position is that these services are available free of charge for persons in the lower income group, for maternity patients in the middle income group and their infants up to six weeks of age, and for national school children who require treatment for defects discovered at school health examinations.  Other eligible persons are required to pay 2s 6d on attending for a consultation and 7s 6d for an X-ray examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this Money Resolution.  This is legislation to which no objection will be taken on any side of the House.  I want to direct the attention of the Minister to a matter which he might consider when dealing with legislation, Estimates and Money Resolutions arising <Col N="22" /> out of the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1964.  Owing to our particular circumstances, the administration of these Acts involves a not inconsiderable number of civil servants and a considerable establishment.  Anyone understanding our special circumstances fully realises that, of its nature, this is a diminishing charge and that there is no desire on any side of the House to approach it in a grudging or mean way.  However, our practice has been to consider the Estimates for which the Minister for Defence is responsible together when they have been presented to the House and this does give rise to some misunderstanding in the public mind.  On more than one occasion, I have heard the suggestion made that the civil staff required for the administration of affairs for which the Minister for Defence is responsible to the House seems to bear a disproportionate proportion to the actual Army personnel.  In fact, of course, we who are aware of procedure know that this Money Resolution does not relate to the active Army personnel at all but to a section of the Department of Defence which deals with the pension rights of retired soldiers from the existing Army, the civil war and the Anglo-Irish conflict which preceded it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the suggestion to the Minister in order to clarify the fact that he is responsible to the House not only for the actual Army expenses but for Army pensions and their administration and that the administration of the Army Pensions Acts, for which this Money Resolution is required, has no relation at all to the actual charge which comes in course of payment for maintenance of the Defence Forces.  I believe it is desirable that this matter should be directed to the attention of the Minister for Defence so that he may avail of some suitable occasion, if not this occasion then some other occasion, to differentiate very clearly to the public mind <Col N="23" /> between the Civil Service expenses involved in regard to the actual standing Army and the expenses raised by other services for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the allegation under the British Naval Estimates that when they had 100 Admirals, they had 1,000 civil servants and that when they had three Admirals, they had 2,000 civil servants.  That position does not exist here.  What it is necessary to direct to the attention of the public is the fact that the Minister for Defence is responsible not only for the Army and Naval Service but for the administration of pensions for which this Money Resolution is now being moved.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this?</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) of this section provides that the sole requirement for the grant of a further pension or a married pension shall be that the pensioner be a married man for the purposes of the Acts.  Subsection (2) defines the relevant provisions of the Acts.  These are the provisions of the various Acts under which the further pension or married pension is payable. A person is a married man for the purposes of the Acts from the date of his marriage until his own death, the death of his wife or the lawful dissolution of his marriage.  He continues to be a married man for the purposes of the Acts for so long after the death of his wife or the dissolution of his marriage as he has a qualified child.  A married pension is payable at present only where the marriage took place before a specified date, that is, the date of the wound or, in the case of a disease pensioner, the date of discharge or 5th August, 1953, in the case of pensioners who had pre-Truce military service.  Under this section, a marriage <Col N="25" /> contracted at any time will qualify for payment of a married pension.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) provides for the grant of allowances to the widow and children of a pensioner who died before the passing of the Act (a) whose degree of pensionable disablement was less than 50 per cent, (b) who would have been entitled to a married pension immediately before his death if the sole condition had been that he was at that time a married man for the purposes of the Acts, and (c) whose death is found to have been due solely to his pensionable disability. Subsection (2) provides a time limit for applications.</P>
      <P>The object of this section is to provide for the case of a married pensioner who had a disablement of less than 50 per cent, who died before the passing of the Act but who was not in receipt of a married pension because his mariage had taken place outside the specified date.</P>
      <P>This section will deem him to have been in receipt of a married pension, and if his death is found to have been due solely to his pensionable disability, allowances will be payable to his widow and children.

      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that subsection (2) of section 4, fixing the limit during which application <Col N="26" /> may be made, is too rigid?  My long experience of legislation of this kind has always shown that one odd case will turn up where the application, for some reason, was not made within the statutory period.  You are then left with a category of persons receiving a benefit which the Oireachtas intended them to have, with one excepted person and no discretion left to the Minister to admit a claim after the statutory limit provided for in the Act.  I suggest the Minister should provide for himself a discretion to admit a claim under subsection (2) where he is satisfied that there is reasonable ground for oversight on the part of the claimant in not making a claim within the statutory 12 month period.  This will avoid the possibility of anomalies arising which will inevitably make necessary amending legislation in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that where an established difficulty in the experience of the Dail grows up, the prudent thing to do is to provide a remedy on the first available occasion?  Everybody in the House wants the Minister to have dis-creation to admit a claim where he is satisfied that there is reasonable ground for delay in making the claim. The alternative to accepting that proposal is, if past experience is any guide, that you will get one or two cases of somebody living in the outback of Australia, or somebody who has gone to the Yukon, not receiving the letter which the Minister has sent out informing him of his statutory right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ultimately he hears of the new provision and makes application, the Minister is in a position in which nobody wants him to be, in which he is obliged to say: &ldquo;The section says that every application for an allowance under this section shall be made not later than 12 months after the passage of this Act.&rdquo;  He is obliged to admit that the person never got the letter and could not possibly have heard of the new provision made for him and that his or her application should be admitted but that by our own Act we have made it impossible to do so.  I do not mind whether the Minister submits this amendment on Report Stage or <Col N="28" /> not.  I think everybody will agree with it if he does so, or if he puts it down in the Seanad and brings it back, we will pass it in five minutes, but surely he should not tie himself up in a situation in which he cannot admit a claim which he knows the Oireachtas wants him to admit?  That is all I am asking and it seems to be a most reasonable and sensible provision.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with wound pensions and gratuities. For many years veterans of the British Army have received free hospitalisation and treatment but I understand we have no such thing in this country at present.  This matter may not be appropriate to the section but it is the only section I see that it would appear to have some relation to.  I understand that some years ago there was set up a liaison between what might be described as the Old IRA, the Veterans Association and the Department and that as a result there was a suggestion at the time that free hospitalisation should be provided for veterans who suffered from war wounds.  Unfortunately, that arrangement has fallen through and we now find some of our veterans, for the want of free hospitalisation, housed in county homes throughout the State. Perhaps the Minister, in view of the dwindling number of veterans of the Old IRA, could see his way to ensure that they will have free hospitalisation just as their friends and neighbours have who joined the British Forces.</P>

Some of them could possibly belong to some of the pre-Truce organisations, but I do not think that what Deputy O'Donnell is raising is relevant to this section at all.  I dealt already with this question of hospitalisation for ex-soldiers, pre-Truce personnel and ex-members of the National Army, 1922-1924, and I pointed out that the State was providing in the general health services fairly adequate hospital services for all citizens, including ex-soldiers. It would not be at all appropriate to have military hospitals catering for outside personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which enables increases in allowances to be made to pensioners without requiring special <i>ad hoc</i> legislation of the House.  I should like to suggest that this would be an appropriate time to fix a minimum allowance for ex-servicemen, particularly those of the pre-Truce period.  We all know there has been a very big increase in the cost of living and a very big depreciation in the pound sterling, and a minimum pension should be fixed for these persons of not less than the amount paid to a contributory old age pensioner.  The other day I was going through a list of recipients of pre-Truce IRA pensions in my constituency, and I was amazed <Col N="30" /> to find that some of them were paid allowances of £25 and £26 per year. That is not right, and there should be a minimum, say, of £150 per year paid to these veterans.  We welcome this section because, without coming before the House, whatever increases are decided on can be added.</P>
      <P>I think also that the Minister should use his good offices with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that all military service pension schemes are exempt from income tax.  Those in receipt of these military service pensions are no longer capable of earning their livelihood.  Most of them are advanced in years, and whatever pension is payable should be paid to them net, without any deduction for income tax.  Furthermore, where a military service pensioner dies, his widow should receive the amount of his pension instead of a widow's allowance.  I would also suggest that the special allowance should no longer be subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>Now that the disability allowance and the special allowance are payable to recipients of pre-Truce medals, I wonder would it be appropriate to suggest to the Minister at this stage that we are far enough from the Civil War to consider awarding medals to all those who were engaged in active service during the Civil War, irrespective of which side they were on.  Many men may not have joined the Defence Forces or the offence forces until after the Truce&mdash;it may have been that they were too young&mdash;but they may have played a very prominent and active part on one side or the other during the Civil War.  The Minister did suggest some time ago that he hoped a memorial would be erected over the graves of those who died during the Civil War, irrespective of which side they fought on.  Perhaps it would be possible to consider now the awarding of a medal to participants in the Civil War, irrespective of which side they fought on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I understand that many soldiers of long service who, on retirement, have entered the Civil Service and who are not established as such, receive no credit whatsoever for their service in the Defence Forces.  Perhaps <Col N="31" /> it would be possible for the Minister to ensure that their service would be recognised, whether they are established or not.</P>
    <P>Since we are dealing here with pensions, allowances and gratuities, would the Minister endeavour to give some gratuity to NCOs on their retirement? I understand that while commissioned officers, irrespective of the length of time they have served in the Defence Forces, receive a gratuity, none is given to NCOs.  Would the Minister have another look at that between now and Report Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be inclined to agree with Deputy O'Donnell that medals should be awarded to all and sundry.  All sorts of people would be applying for them and saying they were entitled to get them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Proof is something we can all talk about here, but the one thing about medals is that if too many of them are issued, they lose their value.  People treasure them because they are rare; those who did take part in the fight for freedom were rare enough.  Those who have these medals complain that they are too big.  They are like a wheel on a donkey cart.  I do not know whether or not the jeweller felt it was a great idea to sell these huge blobs of medals.  Would it not be better to issue a medal of a reasonable size that people could wear in comfort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the question of minimum pensions.  This has been brought to my notice, and presumably to the notice of Deputy O'Donnell and the Minister, by the Old IRA Federation.  They feel, and I think we must all agree with them, that if a pension is to be given, it should be of a reasonable amount.  To issue a miserly pension does not seem to be the thing to do.  It is unfair to say it, perhaps, but these people are a dying race.  Many of them have already gone, and in ten years time, whoever is here in this House will see very few of them <Col N="32" /> left.  We do not seem to be prepared &mdash;I am not blaming the Minister; he is only one&mdash;to face up to the fact that this is so, that money values have changed so much, that what we are giving these people now is only a fraction of what they should be getting, and in fact only a fraction of what was intended when military service pensions were introduced.  Nobody can suggest that anybody could live on what is given to these pensioners at present.</P>

      <P>It is sheer nonsense to call it a pension at all.  My second point is in relation to income tax.  People feel sore about this.  It is like the position of the old age pensioner who, if he has a small income and a small pension, it is taxed.  We brought a measure before this House to ensure that American pensioners would be free of income tax but yet we cannot do the same for our own pensioners. It is a ridiculous situation and should be altered.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the question of the special allowance.  Can we ever get down to the stage where we will stop this snooping on the unfortunates who are depending on special allowances? Social welfare officers are still doing this.  They had some unkind things to say recently about me in one of their documents.  Anybody who goes to the house of an unfortunate old age pensioner and tries to trick him into saying that he has more money or property than he has is no credit to his profession.  I can prove that this is being done.</P>

      <P>Would the Department of Defence not consider that it would be a good job if they divorced themselves from the Department of Social Welfare and had a small number of people themselves who would do the job in a humanitarian way?  We have the position that somebody goes to an old man and asks him if it is true that he gets a meal <Col N="33" /> from somebody else for patching clothes and then decides that this is an income and takes away the special allowance.  That is ridiculous.  The Minister is aware of the case I have in mind because we have had correspondence about it and he himself, before he became Minister, made representations to get this poor old fellow a fair deal.  As far as my information goes, this old man is now slowly starving to death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle was very lenient with his fellow Donegalman on the Fine Gael benches. I have dealt with all these things before and they are more appropriate to the Estimates.  Even though this Bill is called an Army Pensions Bill it deals with disability pensions and has nothing to do with military service pensions. The question of entitlement to a military service pension and the amount are governed by the two main Acts, the 1924 Act and the 1934 Act. The assessment of service was made by a board of assessors under the 1924 Act and by a referee and a committee under the 1934 Act.  The length of service was set out in the certificate, as well as the rank or notional rank and the pension was calculated accordingly. I have no authority to pay any higher pensions than those provided in the Acts and it would mean amending the Military Service Pensions Acts to meet the point raised by Deputy O'Donnell. As far as medals are concerned, I presume that if we issued medals we would also have to face up to the consequential benefits that would be sought.</P>

I would not wish to see my own military service pension taken out of the income tax net.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this paragraph which it is proposed to insert, for many reasons it may not be <Col N="35" /> possible for a serving soldier to make a voluntary allotment to a relative or friend.  The relative or friend may not require it at the time, but later on it may become patent to everybody that the means of that particular relative or friend have deteriorated to such an extent that a pension would be most essential to his economy.  Why ensure that a soldier must make a voluntary allotment to his relative before that relative can qualify for a pension after the death of the soldier?  Many of us know soldiers who financially are less well off than their relatives but circumstances may change and an unfortunate relative may find herself in very poor circumstances.  Why should she be debarred from the pension merely because of the fact that her soldier relative did not make a voluntary allotment to her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I find myself at variance with Deputy O'Donnell because I can visualise the person who would not want to say that she had a relative a soldier, but if the soldier died, then perhaps the memory should be kept green.  The Minister might be able to insert a section which would allow a soldier to make an allotment to a dependent relative.  If that could be done, and I do not know how it could be done, it would be preferable to the suggestion that everybody who applied and claimed he or she was a relative should, in fact, get a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy O'Donnell is advocating is a change in principle from that already applicable in the case of a soldier who is killed or dies from wounds.  This applies to a man who dies from disease and it generally concerns unmarried soldiers. Such a soldier, when he enters the Army, has the right to make an allotment to his mother, or to some other relative; some deliberately refrain from doing so.  When such a man dies from disease, it is very difficult to establish dependency.  Dependency is the cardinal principle in this connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But single men may contribute without making an <Col N="36" /> allotment.  It may be that a soldier contributes each week, or each month, and possibly makes a generous contribution, without making an allotment. It is for these, who do not make allotments but who contribute, that I would ask the Minister to legislate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the provision which we were proposing to put into the Constitution&mdash;that regard will be had to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and the need for securing convenient areas of representation.  I have not much more to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contention by the Fine Gael <Col N="39" /> Party apparently is that this is not required and that there is no likelihood of there being a constituency in which the question of extent and accessibility would impose any difficulty on a Deputy in adequately representing the people of that constituency.  I am not for a moment suggesting that there are any possible constituencies in which there would be large extents of tractless wastelands to be covered.  At the same time, I think that if anybody here would take the trouble to examine what must happen if the changes we propose are not made, he will see that there are bound to be certain constituencies which will be unwieldy in extent and which will impose considerable difficulty on the elected Deputies for the constituencies in adequately covering them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte is on record as saying that in so far as he is concerned it is quite clear that the county of Donegal should be one constituency only and that there would be no difficulty whatever, again in so far as he is concerned, in adequately representing the whole of the county of Donegal.  That is one viewpoint.  I am suggesting that there would be difficulty in one Deputy adequately representing the whole of the county of Donegal.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the size, the shape and the other physical features of a constituency such as that would make it impossible for any one individual adequately to represent the whole of that county.  Of course, under the system of representation we have here, each Deputy is elected to represent the whole of the constituency.  Perhaps other Opposition Deputies would like to give us their opinion about the adequate representation of the new areas with which they will be involved and which they will have to represent, if this amendment is not passed, because I am quite sure that, with all the information available to them, Deputies have considered this matter&mdash; that they have not just decided to oppose this proposition that we are making because it has been introduced by Fianna Fáil, but that they have examined what must happen if some such scope as we are asking for in this <Col N="40" /> proposed amendment of the Constitution is not given in the delineation of constituencies.</P>
    <P>We have on record from one of the Deputies from Donegal the suggestion that the ideal thing for that part of the country is that there should be one five-seat constituency of the whole county of Donegal.  It might have been interesting to hear also, let us say, from Deputies from County Kerry as to whether the size, shape and accessibility of the county of Kerry would make it difficult for them adequately to represent that whole county, because if what we are proposing is not accepted, it is quite on the cards that, like Donegal, County Kerry may have to become one single constituency and I should like to hear the Opposition Deputies for that constituency giving us their opinion as to the feasibility of adequately representing that likely constituency.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to hear from these Deputies whether the physical features of the area would interfere with them, would make it difficult for the people to have the type of representation that they have come to expect; whether the existence of mountain ranges and peninsulas in that area would affect the adequate representation of the people and also whether the possible addition of portion of the present constituency of West Cork, separated from County Kerry by a mountain range and accessible in so far as some parts of it are concerned only by means of the Healy Pass, would be a type of solution to the problems that exist&mdash;whether it would be preferable to what we are proposing here, that is, that it should be permissible to take these things into consideration in deciding on constituencies.</P>
    <P>Again, as Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, the likelihood is that if what we are proposing is not accepted, if we are not given some scope in avoiding anomalies, one of the things that is likely to happen is that the counties of Cavan and Monaghan will be combined to form one constituency.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, the chief Opposition spokesman, knows from figures and so on, that this is probably the most likely thing to happen in that part of the country.  I should like him to go on record as saying whether he thinks that the same services can be given to the people by a Deputy who has to cover the whole of those two counties from Castleblayney to Arva and from Virginia to Emyvale.  There is, I think, no point in considering this question except in the context of the type of situation that must arise if this amendment we are proposing to the Constitution is not carried.  I think it is necessary to have these guidelines that we put down here so that it will be definetely permissible to take those very relevant practical matters into consideration in revising constituencies in future.</P>

      <P>Of the many disservices which the Fianna Fáil Party have rendered to the people of Ireland, one of the greatest is the conviction which they have spread abroad and which they wish to continue to create that a right, a service, an opportunity, is not available unless the application for it is processed through a TD.  It is because of that disservice, because of that idea which they have implanted in the minds of the Irish people, that they now wish to base representation in this Parliament upon acreage and not upon the minds of independent, sturdy, disciplined, self-respecting people.  The Fianna Fáil Party do not wish the Irish people to be self-respecting and independent. They wish the people of Ireland to be beholden to some political person.  They wish the people to feel that anything in this world will be denied to them unless they go hat-in-hand to some politician, preferably of the Fianna Fáil Party, to get what is theirs as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because that situation has been built up over the years by the Fianna Fáil Party who want the people to be subservient to them that we are now asked to base our whole parliamentary representation upon the paths that are to be worn by public representatives going to see their constituents or the paths that are to be worn by <Col N="42" /> constituents going to see their public representatives.  This is contemptible. This is folly.  This is an effort to crystallise one of the most destructive forces in this land, the force which is destroying the self-respecting dignity of our people.</P>
    <P>In an effort to justify this, which is to facilitate the operation of this demoralising practice, the Minister has suggested that some constituencies, as we know them, would be abolished and that some counties would be amalgamated with other counties in order to create convenient constituencies, or in order to create constituencies which the law now requires should exist because the law now says that there should be equality in the ratio between population and Deputy. What is interesting to recall, Sir, is that the then Minister for Local Government of the Fianna Fáil Party gave evidence on oath in the High Court seven years ago that it would be necessary to amalgamate some 16 constituencies or some 16 counties, some 16 administrative areas, if the court interpreted the Constitution in the way in which it was argued by the plaintiff it should be interpreted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The court allowed no such thing, and typical of the utterly false propaganda being advanced in support of this despicable proposal is the one that the courts have allowed a 5 per cent divergence.  The courts have allowed no divergence from equality in so far as equality is practicable.  The courts have said, because our Constitution says and because the people of Ireland said, equality should operate in the ratio between population and Deputy as far as it was practicable. In relation to the 1961 revision equality as far as it was practicable was operated.  The courts have not said <Col N="43" /> that a 5 per cent divergence is permissible. That is not what the courts said.  That is not what the Constitution says.  That is not what the law at the moment says and that is why I queried last week the ruling out of order of an amendment when the reason for ruling it out of order was supposed to be that the law at the moment allowed a 5 per cent divergence.  The law allows no divergence whatsoever.  It says it shall be equal as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>It is open to this House and to the Seanad now under our existing law to make a re-arrangement of constituencies but there is an obligation on this House and on the other House to make the ratio between the population and Deputies equal as far as practicable. This House and the Seanad have no right to assume, and nobody has any right to assume, that the courts would allow a 5 per cent differential in the year 1968, because if it were possible to arrange the constituencies with equality without any differential, that is the obligation which would lie on us to achieve and it is that equality which the Minister and the Government are now seeking to depart from.  They are now saying that no longer will there be an obligation to achieve that equality.  We are to allow a divergence which is going to disfranchise almost one-third of the people living in the urban areas compared with their politically more powerful cousins down the country.</P>

      <P>The section we are dealing with, I understand, is on page 6, the sixth amendment.  I think, Sir, with all respects, and I am going to accept the restrictions you are imposing on me, that you cannot consider it in a vacuum and that you must bear in mind the departure from the fundamental principle which at present applies, that is, the principle of one man, one vote and to every man an equal vote, an equal say and an equal interest in the destiny of the nation.  I think that is a worthy and desirable objective.  We in the Fine Gael Party do not believe that we are justified in destroying that principle by all kinds of fatuous excuses about extent and accessibility of constituencies.</P>
      <P>What is to be the test of accessibility? Will it depend on rainfall, on frequency of air transport, on location of airports?  Is it fair, in determining accessibility of constituencies, to say that there are regions in Dublin where during many hours of the day, because of traffic jams and such, it takes the better part of an hour to travel three miles?  Is any allowance to be made for the inaccessibility of some areas in Dublin?</P>

      <P>The Minister's colleague, the former Minister for Lands, said that civil servants should not complain if they had to go to Castlebar or Athlone because they could get to their place of work quicker than from the homes they had in Dublin.  The Parliamentary Secretary, if he is condemning me, and I would be pleased to think he was, because if he and I were to agree it would be a very sorry situation, with regard to what I am saying in relation to traffic jams in Dublin, is condemning his own Minister <Col N="45" /> and his own Government who put forward as a justification for putting people down the country that they would be able to travel 20 miles in Connemara or the Midlands faster than they could travel three miles through the centre of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that is a wrong test. I say it is a fair one, but if that is to be the test, then 60 miles in rural Ireland should be equivalent to nine miles in urban areas of Dublin.  I know that Dublin Deputies on the opposite side listening to me could not entirely disagree with what I am saying. There are difficulties in travelling through one's constituency in Dublin during the normal working day which I am sure are greater than travelling miles and miles of open land in rural constituencies.</P>

The truth of the matter is&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister by their own remarks confirm me in my awareness of this&mdash;that you people over there have no understanding of the difficulty of traversing an urban area and do not consider the problems of getting through Dublin, where the problems of accessibility are such that it would take many people in Dublin much longer to reach their TD than it would take others in rural constituencies who might have to travel 40, 50 or 60 miles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that people in Dublin who want to consult their TDs can spend much longer trying to get to them than many others in rural areas who have to travel much longer distances.  Those unfortunate people in Dublin who have to pay bus fares of up to 4/- find it very hard to get in touch with their TDs.  The Minister knows darn well that this is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You said it is only Fianna Fáil people who go to their TDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a serious burden placed on the people in Dublin, the many thousands of people who have to pay high bus fares and spend a long time getting from one area to another.  I am also aware that the problem of accessibility to TDs was not what was in the mind of the Government when they wrote the word &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; into their abnoxious proposal.  The extent of <Col N="47" /> a constituency can be due to many factors, such as inland lakes, mountain ranges, large agricultural pastures and so forth.  It is apparent that those will now be the determining factors in the representation of the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I think we have reached a sorry state of affairs when we are going to determine the structure of this House by the bricks, stones and acres of this country.  There is no parallel like it in the world.  It is because we in the Fine Gael Party believe that these are unworthy things to have in mind when setting up constituencies that we have proposed our amendment to the Government amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make this remark.  Some 70 per cent of the Members of this House who can be members of local authorities are in fact members of local authorities.  In other countries it is a rare event for members of Parliament to be members of local authorities.  If the Government genuinely feel that there are insufficient public representatives for the people of this country, there is a very easy way of increasing the pool of public representatives available to our people, that is, by prohibiting Members of either House of the Oireachtas from being members of local authorities.  You would, in so doing, make available to the Irish people, without any additional numbers whatsoever, some 100 or more additional public representatives because you would have county councillors, urban councillors, town councillors who would not be Members of the Dáil or the Seanad.  Those people would be scattered across the trackless wastes, to which reference has been made by Government speakers.  They would be there seven days a week and we would get away from the present system where some 70 per cent of us are members of local authorities and, on account of being Members of the Dáil or Seanad, are not accessible to the people for three or four days of a week during the parts of the year we are in this House.  These are the kinds of thing which could give better representation to the people of <Col N="48" /> this country without any additional problem. These are the kinds of things which could be brought into operation, which would avoid doing violence to the Constitution, which would avoid interfering with the fundamentals which one would have thought sacred and accepted principles&mdash;one man, one vote and to every man an equal vote, an equal say in the destinies of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start of his remarks, Deputy Ryan criticised Fianna Fáil as being responsible for the present feeling amongst Irish people that they must always contact their local TD in order to get anything.  I contradict that absolutely, but I am very much in favour of taking every possible action to keep constituents very closely in touch with their TD at all times.  For that reason the Government have put in this provision in the Schedule to the Bill which has my complete support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan says that to take into account in determining constituencies the extent and accessibility of these constituencies would need that we secure convenient areas of representation. I would not agree with this for a moment and I think it is only someone who has failed to read the papers or look at television in the past couple of weeks who would put forward the suggestion that we do not need as close as possible contact between the ordinary representative and the public.  What Frenchmen call a revolution which is taking place in France at the moment is simply because the French people do not want to be ruled by faceless men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak as a Frenchman.  Deputies believe that troubles of the moment are due to a lack of representation between Governments and the ordinary man in the street.  We are sometimes criticised as being over-represented, having too high a rate of representation.  I do not agree. I think we must do everything we can to ensure that every man in the street knows who his TD is, knows where to get him, and is constantly in touch with him.  It is not a question of arguing <Col N="49" /> about old age pensions, drainage, roads, resurfacing of boreens, or whatever it may be.  It involves a steady line of communication between Government and people so that the people will know what the Government are doing, when a measure is significant when it comes before the House, and so on.</P>
      <P>It is because in other countries this line of communication is broken that people who do not know who are governing them have no confidence in the people in the National Assembly. We must make certain that we will not become faceless men, cut off from the community.  We must keep ourselves closely in touch with our constituents at all times.</P>
      <P>A country constituency has particular difficulties in that there are physical features, which Deputy Ryan mentions, like mountains, rivers, road systems, which make it difficult for a parliamentary representative adequately to represent his area.  To my mind, the main difference between the rural and urban areas is that in the urban areas you have frequent meetings of groups of people together where a TD can meet 50 or 200 people at a time.  In an ordinary rural area, it is hard enough to get groups of 15 or 20 together and the average country TD has to do most of his work by personal calls, by receiving people at his own house, or his clinic, or whatever it may be.  I think present events make this provision in the Bill more relevant and more necessary than ever and to a dispassionate observer, it will be clear how vital it is to proper development of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have large country constituencies where a large majority of the people rarely, if ever, see their TD and even more rarely have a chance of talking to him about legislation and what is going on, we are in danger of the disruption of society which is already taking place in so many European countries.  We must learn from them, and even if it does mean a slightly increased representation here in one constituency over another, what difference.  We have Deputy Ryan talking about one man, one vote, and so on.  He has only to look at the <Col N="50" /> situation of this day to see where the situation is wildly in excess of what we are providing, how the constituencies will be revised, what loading will be given to extent and accessibility.  He quite forgets of course that these constituencies will be determined by a commission representative of the Government and the Opposition in equal numbers and presided over by a High Court judge.  In his more rational moments, Deputy Ryan approves of High Court judges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing could be fairer than that.  There is nothing here to say that these provisions shall be applicable to rural areas only.  If there is any validity in Deputy Ryan's comments about city traffic jams, and so on, there is nothing to prevent the commission taking action on that and making allowances accordingly.  Therefore, a properly dispassionate and properly balanced commission will do that.  If they feel there is no real value in what Deputy Ryan contends, they will not take action along these lines.  Where are we to give priority?  Deputy Ryan says that this refers only to rural constituencies. I hope the Opposition will think again about this amendment.  It is a useful exercise in determining what sort of parliamentary democracy we need.  I am the last one to suggest <Col N="51" /> we should encourage constituents to come to their TDs to investigate their statutory rights.  I am positive we must keep our parliamentary representatives closely in touch with their constituents, much more closely than they are at the moment.  If we do not do this, we will face a disaster similar to that which has happened in France and other countries.</P>
      <P>There is no question of anything arbitrary.  If we ignore mountains, lakes, and so on, we are just fooling ourselves.  We have to take into account how easy it is to get from one place to another, and also the density of population and whether a TD will have to meet his constituents singly or will have an opportunity of meeting them in groups of ten, 15, 20 or more. These are matters which have to be taken into consideration and which should be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law and we get smaller, more manageable, constituencies, that will enable every TD to do a far better job of public relations between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the ordinary voter. That is the essential feature of parliamentary democracy, as I see it.  If we tamper with that or make it more difficult to have that close link at all times, we are taking a very dangerous course.</P>

The Taoiseach made that case for the Fourth Amendment.  The Minister now seems to me to be making the opposite case, that it is necessary that people should be running with hat in hand to TDs for everything, that they should be led to believe that unless they do that, they will not get what they are clearly entitled to get.</P>
      <P>In an effort to justify this measure, Deputy Booth spoke of the situation in France.  It is very far-fetched to compare the situation or circumstances in France with the position here.  There is no comparison, geographically, demographically or in any other way. Deputy Booth spoke about TDs becoming faceless men.  In my experience of rural Ireland, every constituent of every constituency knows who his TD is and knows where to get him and how to get him.  Under the present system of multi-seat constituencies, every TD keeps in close touch with his constituents if he wants to remain in Dáil Éireann.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The provision in the Bill the discussion of which we are now engaged in is to allot thousands and thousands more constituents to Dublin Deputies.  As I have said, in rural Ireland, under the present system, the people know their constituency, know their Deputies and how to get at them and where to get them.  The Deputies make very sure to keep in close touch with their constituents. Maybe the Minister thinks that this will not be necessary if he succeeds in introducing single-seat constituencies with, perhaps, huge majorities in some, which in turn will lend itself to lazy, inactive TDs sitting on large majorities as happens in Northern Ireland and England.  If that is what the Minister has in mind, he <Col N="55" /> need not worry his head about it because we are not going to have single-member constituencies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth, in his effort to justify this dangerous provision of this Bill, told the House solemnly that we need not have any fears because the constituencies would be arranged by a tribunal consisting of six Members of this House, presided over by an independent member of the judiciary.  I want to tell Deputy Booth that in the Third Amendment of the Constitution, there is not one thing about a commission.</P>

But he does not want the commission.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite true, and I am glad the Deputy mentioned that point. It is essential that there should be redistribution. We approach that on the basis of principle rather than expediency.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of argument in this House on the whole question being discussed here on this Bill which is determined by the interests of the individual Deputy, and not by the interests of the whole country, or the national good as it is often referred to, or by what is good policy for the country as a whole.  It would suit several Deputies to have single-member constituencies, but that is not the point.  The point is that they must address themselves to what is good for the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this provision is written into the Bill for a purpose, the purpose being, as I say, to shroud the main activities to which I have referred and to which apparently I am not permitted by the Chair to refer at any length. The provision implies a departure from the principle of one man, one vote, and that where it is convenient for representation, the commission may by this <Col N="59" /> enactment be empowered to disregard the question of population.  That is wrong.  That is fundamentally wrong. If we are to have a democratic country, we must relate representation to people. If we depart from that principle, we depart from democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy went on to what was obviously to me a head-line-hunting ploy and talked about France, what was happening in France and the possibility of its happening here.  It could not happen here.  It could not happen here for the simple reason that Deputies of Dáil Éireann, to my knowledge over the period I have been a Member of the House, have been accessible to everyone who wished to see them.  They are not faceless men in the sense that they might be in a country with a population of many millions.  So the comparison is not only odious but it is ridiculous and impossible&mdash;the comparison of saying that a Deputy of Dáil Éireann could get so out of touch with his constituents as to be compared with, say, a Deputy of the French National Assembly.</P>
      <P>There is a corrective for that.  Particularly in the times in which we live, unlike days gone by when a Party tag was sufficient to usher a person in here, any Deputy who does not do his work properly, or make a fairly good stab at it, is for the road.  There are many others on his heels to take up the task if he is not willing to do it.  Indeed, there is a competitiveness about polities which, as we know, does not always produce the most desirable results, but it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is a danger I feel, <Col N="60" /> and represents a possible infringement of the democratic principle which is vital in so far as the Labour Party are concerned, and one on which we intend to stand.  We agree that before the next election there must be a redistribution of seats to correspond with the location of population and other changes that have occurred since the last redistribution. That must take place, but it must be determined on the basis of the number of people who will be casting votes, and not upon the number of cattle or sheep, or the shape of the country.  The voter must be considered not inanimate objects or animals.</P>
    <P>It is on that score only that I would quarrel with this provision.  It contains the danger of tampering with the idea of popular representation as we know it.  Certain proposals by the Minister which apparently he bulldozed through the Cabinet and which, in a moment of political somnolence, Fianna Fáil accepted in conclave, will be completely and utterly rejected by the people, and any honest man knows that.  I have not heard one person sincerely advocating the abolition of PR. This applies to many people who I know are supporters of the Government in normal circumstances, but they will not vote for the abolition of PR.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people have said that one of the effects of these proposals might be to perform something of a rescue operation on the Fine Gael Party.  I admit that there is nothing farther from our intentions <Col N="70" /> in introducing these proposed amendments to the Constitution than that but, at the same time, the fact that they continue to be so confused about this whole issue, although we have leaned over backwards in trying to make matters clear to them, seems to indicate at least that such a rescue operation is pretty urgently required in their case.</P>
      <P>This question that has been raised of one-man, one-vote is, I agree, relevant to the proposals we are making. and if the proposals had come before the House in the form we originally intended, that is, as one proposition, then I could understand there being quite an amount of discussion on the principle of one-man, one-vote on the joint proposal.  It is not this Bill that deals with that proposition; it is in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution that we are proposing to the people that they should establish for the first time in this country the principle of one-man, one-vote, and that for the first time they should establish a system here in which every voter will be treated in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in this Bill we are dealing with a completely different thing, and the question of one-man, one-vote does not arise.  The provision in the Constitution requires that the representation of a constituency will be related to population, not to voters, and the proportion of population to voters is not by any means a constant factor throughout the country as a whole.  I demonstrated by the figures here already that the proportion of population to voters in the constituency of Dublin North-West, for instance, is something under 51 per cent, whereas in Donegal South-West the proportion of voters to population is over 67 per cent.  Therefore, if we continue with the present requirements of the Constitution, and if the revision of constituencies that Deputy Dunne in particular has been demanding is to be carried out, the result must be that a vote in South-West Donegal will be around 33 per cent less effective in electing a Deputy than in Dublin North-West.  It is the maintenance of that position that Opposition Parties are trying to ensure.  As I said, it is to the Fourth Amendment of the <Col N="71" /> Constitution that this principle is applicable.</P>
    <P>We agreed to separate our proposals with regard to the electoral system into two distinct provisions in response to the demands of the Opposition who claimed that to have to consider this whole complicated matter in one Bill was confusing to them, although, in fact, in the referendum of 1959 there was a provision making it clear that regard should be had to these factors in drawing up a scheme of constituencies, and the only essential difference at that time was that there was not a definite maximum percentage deviation from the national average specified then.  The Opposition did not find it confusing at that time, but they apparently found it confusing this time, and so we agreed to bring these two proposals forward separately.</P>
    <P>It becomes more and more difficult for me to understand exactly why the Opposition wanted these proposals separately.  Apparently they intend to oppose both of them, and that being so, it appears that any confusion that may arise in the minds of their own supporters will be created by themselves. Naturally I took it that when they wanted these things separated, they intended to support this amendment, and I will show from quotations from speeches made by members of the Opposition Parties in the debate on the revision of constituencies in 1961 that that is a very reasonable assumption for anybody to make with regard to both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  I certainly could see no other reason for the desire to have separate proposals than the intention of the Opposition Parties to support at least this one.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the debate on the 1961 revision of constituencies that this proposal, the Third Amendment of the Constitution, is in direct response to the demands of the two Opposition Parties.  In dealing with the revision of constituencies that was before the House in 1961 and resulted from the finding of the High Court that the revision of constituencies made in 1959 was in contravention of the Constitution, <Col N="72" /> Deputy Corish, who is now the Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;he was not at that time&mdash;said at column 213, Volume 188 of the Official Report of 12th April, 1961:</P>
    <P>We have a peculiar situation in one county, in Kildare, which under the present proposal embodies three county council areas&mdash;and the Minister and Deputies know that as far as Parliamentary members are concerned, not alone do Deputies have to make representations in respect of the work of the Government but to a very large extent the work of local authorities also&mdash;and it seems that in these constituencies that have to deal with two or three or four local authorities, the work of the Deputies will be very difficult indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish obviously considered that the difficulty that was placed on Deputies, and presumably also on their constituents, by taking portions of one county and adding them to another county in order to achieve mathematical accuracy in regard to the proportion of population, was a matter of some importance in 1961.  Now, as Deputy Dunne says, the situation disclosed by the census obviously indicates that the present scheme of constituencies is not in accordance with the constitutional requirements and, therefore, in order to conform with the Constitution, a further revision must be made.  Deputy Corish and every other Deputy has had made available to him all the information which is necessary in order to form a rough opinion, certainly, as to what must happen to each constituency throughout the country if this revision of constituencies is made now in accordance with the present requirements of the Constitution as interpreted by the High Court.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to anybody who has had sufficient interest in this matter to investigate what must happen, that this type of thing that happened in County Kildare, to which Deputy Corish took exception in 1961, must be repeated on a much wider scale throughout the length and breadth of the country on this occasion unless the change which we propose is made.  Indeed, it will be quite obvious to anybody who makes such an investigation that the change <Col N="73" /> we are proposing will not be sufficient to avoid quite an amount of this, at any rate.  However, it will be quite clear to anybody who makes that kind of examination of the position that what happened in this way in 1961 will be as nothing compared with what must happen now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish in 1961 was followed by Deputy Donnellan, and at column 214, he said:</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this Bill had to be introduced because of a decision of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Later on, in the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>I do not welcome this Bill; I believe it is the death-knell of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Further down again he said.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop along that line&mdash;I believe we are; as Deputy Dillon said and I may repeat it, it is nothing personal to me&mdash;representation in the near future will belong to the few cities we have and, quoting the words of a gentleman I heard speaking last Saturday night, &ldquo;to a dwindling population&rdquo;.  If that happens, it will be a bad day for the country and we are actually heading in that direction now.</P>
    <P>At column 215 Deputy Donnellan continued:</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister cannot help this situation.  I want to be fair to him and I must say I believe that the 1959 Act that was challenged in the High Court was fairer.  I supported it.  I believed it was the right thing. Some people thought otherwise.  The solicitors and the lawyers came into it.  The courts reached a decision much to the disadvantage of rural Ireland and its people.  Of course, with Fianna Fáil, the Constitution is almighty.  According to them, it is the Gospel.  They have an opportunity now of seeing what their Constitution is costing the people of rural Ireland.  The Taoiseach was not man enough to submit the matter to a referendum so that the people might be given an opportunity <Col N="74" /> of changing the relevant Article in the Constitution and getting a fair crack of the whip.  There is no credit due to those who brought the action in the High Court.  If the day comes that Dáil Éireann will be influenced by a completely city mentality, it will be a bad day for Ireland and for her people.</P>
    <P>I suppose this is the best Bill the Government can bring in in the circumstances. It is as near as possible to representation for every 20,000. What will be the position if this wrong is permitted to continue? What will be the fate of the people living in the rural areas?  Will the majority here be Deputies from Dublin city and Cork city and the other cities?  I regret the Taoiseach did not put this by way of referendum to the people.</P>
    <P>To rectify what was described as a wrong the position now is that we are attempting to rectify that wrong.  I do not know how anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Others expressed their views too and I will put them on record for the benefit of members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  How can it be possible for anybody to try to interpret the minds of the Opposition? When we do what was demanded in 1961, we did not do it immediately after that general election, we did not do it after the next general election, but we propose to do it now because when the census returns for 1966 were published, Deputy Dunne was quick to see that a revision was called for and demanded it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We acceded to the demand to rectify what was described as this wrong or this injustice to the people.  Now we find that the Opposition are actuated by a different principle, by the simple principle of opposition, that the duty of an Opposition is to oppose everything brought forward by a Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="75" /> The fact that they are already on record as having demanded it is something of no concern.  Deputy Donnellan concluded by saying:</P>
      <P>My remarks have nothing personal in them.  I protest as a public representative.  I think this Bill is a step in the wrong direction.  It will deprive the people in the rural areas of adequate representation.  Remember, it is only a start; day after day and year after year, worse will probably come.  The precedent has been established.  It will be impossible to undo what is being done here.  Another Government tomorrow would probably do the same thing.</P>
      <P>Now another Government is faced with a requirement to do something infinitely worse than what had to be done in 1961 and they are proposing, as was demanded by the Opposition, to ask the people to amend the Constitution to give a very small amount of scope to the Government, or the commission, in drawing up constituencies to avoid perpetrating this type of injustice on the people and on their public representatives.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, who was then Leader of the Labour Party, also spoke in this debate and at column 226 of the same volume he said:</P>
      <P>The courts have decided that the last Electoral Bill was <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution; consequently some other Bill had to be introduced and this is the Bill we got.  It is worth the time of the House to dwell for a few moments on the situation in which we have been landed by the Constitution, by the courts and by all the legal people who advised the Government.  The courts' decision is that the last Bill which gave a seat in constituencies with fewer than 20,000 of a population per seat was <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  That has been the position in many constituencies since the Constitution was passed over 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton might have added also that it also was the position prior to the passing of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> At the end of the same column Deputy Norton said:</P>
    <P>...our legislation in the past has been based upon the assumption that if we did not get the 20,000 in each constituency, it was good enough to get it in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>That was the assumption on which the legislation was based.  At column 230, Deputy Norton said:</P>
    <P>I think it is crazy to do what is being done with some constituencies. I represent the constituency of Kildare which is known everywhere as a clearly defined territorial area.  In order to box the compass in connection with the results at the next election, Kildare has a chunk of south Meath clamped on to it at one end, and an extreme corner of Westmeath at another end.  Now to the constituency which consists of the County of Kildare, a chunk of south Meath and a chunk of Westmeath are being added, and it will be all grouped under the heading of Kildare, although that substantial portion will not in fact be Kildare, but portion of two other counties.  The only effect of that is effectively to disfranchise people who live in south Meath and people who live in Long-ford and Westmeath, because of the fact that those areas are not big enough, or not numerically strong enough, to ensure representation for the counties of which they are a natural part.  They will be, as it were, just small lungs of Kildare.  I think that is a most undesirable way of trying to create constituencies.</P>
    <P>This was the then Leader of the Labour Party.  Anybody trying to interpret the mind of the Labour Party with regard to this requirement would have been justified in assuming that that opinion&mdash;which was not contradicted by any other member of the Labour Party, but was in fact reinforced by other members who spoke&mdash;to the effect that this requirement of transferring people from one county to another in order to achieve mathematical accuracy of population per Deputy, but not voters to Deputies, was to the effect that this was disfranchising <Col N="77" /> the people concerned.  How could anybody be expected to think that, when a much more widespread operation is required in 1968, the Labour Party would look upon what they held to be disfranchising the people concerned in 1961 as now vindicating the democratic rights of the people in 1968.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how anybody could be expected to assume that the minds of Opposition Deputies had changed so much in the meantime&mdash;it is quite clear that Deputy Norton in 1961 was speaking with a sense of outrage at the injustice that had, in fact, been perpetrated on these people&mdash;and that now the Opposition's approach based purely and simply on the principle that opposition means that one opposes and that, therefore, their task is to oppose everything put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>At the end of column 230, Deputy Norton said:</P>
    <P>...It is obviously desirable that we should endeavour to get parliamentary representation to run side by side with local representation. Deputies know that in the course of their duties they have, inevitably, to make representations to local authorities when the business of their constituents requires them to do so. That is not such a difficult job if you have to make representations to the local authority for the area you represent, but if two or three other local authorities are added to the main local authority, a situation will arise which will become unmanageable, and especially unmanageable with regard to the virtues we were told 12 or 18 months ago the small single-member constituency had.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for introducing a Bill to deal with this situation.  A Bill had to be introduced. That was inevitable after the decision of the High Court, but it is quite clear that the Constitution which imposes upon us the responsibilities now clearly defined by the Court, is a Constitution which should be amended...</P>
    <P>That statement by the Leader of the Labour Party at the time could reasonably <Col N="78" /> be taken as being the authoritative opinion of the Labour Party in 1961 in relation to the comparatively small amount of mutilation of county boundaries that had to take place then. Now, when it is quite clear that the amount of mutilation that will have to take place will be much more widespread and much more extensive, we suddenly find that what was disfranchising the people in 1961 is, in 1968, a vindication of their democratic rights.  We are not proposing to go nearly as far as was suggested.  We are not asking the Dáil or the people to agree to allowing either the Government or a commission to avoid the breaching of administrative boundaries, as is the position in most other democracies of which I know.  We are not even asking that.  We are suggesting simply that there should be a very small amount of scope given to avoid doing these anomalous and unjust things, where possible.  We are asking for a very small amount of scope as compared with what is the position in other democracies.</P>
    <P>Further on, at column 231, Deputy Norton said:</P>
    <P>...I think the decision of the judge compelling us to butcher these constituencies in this way is not a satisfactory solution to the whole question of the delineation of constituencies.</P>
    <P>Someone ought to have a new look at the situation created by the legal decision, created by the necessity of making Parliament work, making the constituencies work and making them sufficiently homogeneous to ensure that the system of Parliamentary representation so reached will continue to give satisfactory results locally to the electorate and satisfactory results from the standpoint of having the constituencies adequately represented in Parliament to ensure that their viewpoint will be put adequately and without impairment on the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>The only criticism we could reasonably, I think, have expected of this proposal was that we were not going nearly far enough and that what we <Col N="79" /> were asking the people to write into the Constitution would not be sufficient to safeguard the democratic rights of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton concluded:</P>
    <P>...If we pass this Bill in this most unsatisfactory position we shall leave large portions of the population virtually disfranchised.  Some effort should be made to get out the dead timber in the Constitution in that respect and to give us, at least for the subsequent general election, a method of parliamentary general election which will conform to modern conditions of Parliamentary representation and independent thinking.</P>
    <P>We were told on that occasion that the result of complying with the decision of the High Court was to leave large portions of the population virtually disfranchised.  Now the Opposition want us to continue that position and have this virtual disfranchisement carried out on a much wider scale. Instead of what Deputy Norton described as conforming to modern conditions of Parliamentary representation and independent thinking, this new proposition is put forward by the Opposition that strict mathematical accuracy of the proportion of population per Deputy is the only consideration that matters&mdash;population per Deputy, mark you, not voters per Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also spoke at great length in respect of the situation in another part of the country.  At column 250 he said:</P>
    <P>Where do the people in West Waterford stand now?  To whom will they send their inquiries?  Is it to a person representing them who may live in Tipperary?  Will they expect him to contact the local authority office in Waterford in order to get fair play for them?</P>
    <P>Now, when this must happen on a much wider scale, it is considered of no importance.</P>
    <P>At column 251 Deputy Desmond said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> It was amazing this evening to listen to some Fianna Fáil members bemoaning the terrible position of rural Ireland because of the decision of the High Court.  I had hoped that in view of the decision of the High Court, the Taoiseach would move for an amendment of the Constitution, where necessary, to give protection to rural Ireland.  Apparently, neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister was prepared to do that.  There is no use in the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil now complaining that the people of rural Ireland are being robbed of their rights when, in actual fact, the only people who could restore those rights to them and improve on them, if they wished, were the Taoiseach, the Minister for Local Government, the Fianna Fáil Government and Party.  They refused to do so.</P>
    <P>Surely there is a clear demand from the Labour Party for something more than we are asking the people to do here?  Surely there is a clear indication of the mind of the Labour Party that what was required by the Constitution, as interpreted by the High Court&mdash;I do not dispute the correctness of that interpretation&mdash;was an injustice on the people and a clear demand that the people should be given an opportunity of remedying a situation which allows such an injustice to be perpetrated on them?  This must happen on a much wider scale now.  We did not respond to the appeals to have a referendum to amend the Constitution immediately after the general election of 1961 because the scheme of constituencies had been established; the general election had been held on those constituencies and we were prepared to allow that situation to continue in the belief that it would continue for 12 years.</P>
    <P>It did not seem urgent to change it because the situation had been established and presumably would continue for 12 years; and another general election, since then, was fought on the same scheme of constituencies.  However, since then we have had published the census returns of 1966 and Deputy Dunne and other Deputies have drawn our attention to the fact <Col N="81" /> that the scheme of constituencies at present does not comply with the requirements of the Constitution and that therefore there is a requirement on the Government to revise the constituencies again.</P>
    <P>In face of the fact that what happened in 1961 will be something of no account compared with what must happen now, we have decided to respond to the demands of the Opposition and give the people an opportunity of amending the provision in the Constitution that requires this injustice to be carried on.  Deputy T. Lynch also spoke on this matter in April, 1961.</P>

      <P>I am glad I voted against the Constitution.  I never thought it was any good and the High Court has proved that it was no good.  It was obvious to the Government what they could have done and they would not do it.  They could have attempted to amend the Constitution. They attempted to amend it with their referendum in order to keep themselves in office.</P>
      <P>He went on:</P>
      <P>In Waterford, we have three members representing this butchered constituency. There is the whole of the Nire valley and that part of the west of Waterford, Ballyduff and down the Blackwater valley to Lismore, Cappoquin and Tallow, traditional Waterford places which have been turned over to County Tipperary.  It is a scandalous state of affairs that this enormous slice of a constituency has been taken away.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne also spoke on the same aspect of the 1961 revision of the constituencies.  At column 269 he is reported:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Lismore, Cappoquin, Tallow, Four-Mile-Water, Ballymacarbury, Villierstown, Aglish and Templemichael are as rural as the people in Donegal and they are to be deprived of their right to a Waterford Deputy.  They are to be transferred to South Tipperary. <Col N="82" /> Deputy Loughman or any other Deputy from South Tipperary will never be able to represent them. The natural alignment is with their own county.</P>
    <P>Further on he said:</P>
    <P>What will happen when these people from Tallow to within six miles of my own town, a distance of 30 miles, are transferred into South Tipperary?  If a South Tipperary representative, whether he be Labour, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, wants to raise some matter in connection with county affairs or the health services, he will have to write to the County Manager in Dungarvan.  If he wants to raise matters in connection with, say, the free milk scheme or the assisted footwear scheme, the South Tipperary Deputy will have no right to interfere.  All he can do is write a letter.  He is not likely to come down from Cashel, Clonmel or wherever he may be in Tipperary to attend a meeting of the county council in Dungarvan in order to help them out.  I know the fate of isolated areas like that: they get a visit just prior to the election.  But when these people were within the confines of their natural constituency of Waterford, they were taken care of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley also spoke on that revision of the constituencies.  At column 311, he is reported:</P>
    <P>There is one particularly regrettable feature in the chopping up of some counties.  We cannot complain on that score in Cork, but some counties have been ruthlessly chopped in order to get the necessary proportion.  The county is the administrative unit so far as local authority goes.  There is invariably a certain rivalry between counties. There is a certain clanishness in counties, to the extent very often that people in one county will not vote for someone from a neighbouring county or another county.  That is a grave danger in this Bill.  I would much prefer to cut down representation and leave the county as the unit.  I would regard that as more practicable in the long run.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> I think it can be said that this Bill is going some of the way to meeting the point of view expressed by all those Deputies.  Therefore, the only criticism we might reasonably have expected was that we were not going nearly far enough to give reasonable scope to avoid perpetuating this type of injustice.</P>
    <P>On that occasion also, Deputy Coburn is reported at column 313:</P>
    <P>Coming from County Louth, I should like to assure the Minister that, whilst I sympathise with his position to a certain extent, the people in County Louth area affected, an area which will be put into County Monaghan, are very resentful of the intentions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very resentful,&rdquo; mind you, of what the present Opposition describe as vindicating their democratic rights. Deputy Coburn at that time interpreted the feeling of his constituents as a feeling of resentment because the Constitution required something like 3.3 Deputies to represent County Louth and there was not any way of providing 0.3 of a Deputy.  County Monaghan was entitled to 2.7 Deputies and the only way it could be achieved was that people should be transferred from Louth to Monaghan.  I think Deputy Coburn was accurate when he described the people of that part of Louth as being very resentful of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>Various opinions were expressed by both Fianna Fáil supporters and Fine Gael supporters.  They all resent being put into a separate county, being detached from their existing native county of Louth and put into Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening, Deputy Faulkner pointed out that County Louth was a constituency which had enjoyed all down the years since the foundation of this State its own natural boundaries.  Admittedly, there were years ago two constituencies in that small county, North and South Louth, but, as a county, its boundaries <Col N="84" /> were always respected.  I think it is a very retrograde step for the Minister at this stage to tamper with our boundaries.</P>
    <P>I do not know how there was a gain for democracy in what had to happen in Louth and Monaghan in 1961 because prior to that there were three Deputies elected for Monaghan and three for Louth.  All that was achieved by this exercise in theoretical democracy was that the people in that area of Louth had to be taken out of the Louth constituency and had to be compelled to be represented by Deputies who were concerned with County Monaghan rather than&mdash;as I believe they desired themselves&mdash;to continue to vote for Deputies and be represented by Deputies who were concerned with the County of Louth.</P>
    <P>Now, what Deputy Donegan wants is that this position should continue. This requirement in the Constitution will probably require, or may probably result in this area of County Louth being no longer required to top up the constituency of Monaghan or the joint constituency of Cavan-Monaghan as will probably be the ultimate result. They may be returned to Louth and the position will be that from which we started in 1961&mdash;that there will be sufficient people in Louth to be represented by more than three Deputies: that now there will be 3.4 Deputies required instead of 3.3 Deputies, and I do not know whether any Deputy opposite can put forward a way in which 0.4 of a Deputy extra can be allocated to Louth.</P>
    <P>We cannot discover any way of doing that so that what will be required is that the people who were transferred to County Monaghan in 1961 and who were, as Deputy Coburn and Deputy Faulkner agreed, resentful of that transfer but who have, I suppose, in the meantime become to a certain extent acclimatised to the transfer must now come back.  Possibly they will welcome the change back to their own county of Louth but that must be compensated for, and another block of County Louth people must be expelled from the county in order to make up for that.  Otherwise they would be deprived <Col N="85" /> of their democratic right.  It would take fractionally more people in County Louth to be represented by a Deputy than it would take in some other constituencies, and in order to vindicate those people's democratic right, Deputy Donegan is demanding that these people should be expelled from Louth and transferred to County Meath or some other place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fraught with great <Col N="86" /> danger in so far as there will be much confusion.  More serious still is the danger that most people may not vote in future elections to the same extent when they discover that they will not have the chance to vote for a county man.  They will be expected to vote for a man who is not one of their own.</P>
    <P>These were the opinions that were expressed by Opposition Deputies on the occasion of the revision of constituencies that had to be carried out in 1961 to take cognisance of the fact that the High Court had decided that the revision of constituencies of 1959, which was unanimously accepted by this House, was in contravention of the constitutional requirements.  It was only when it became obvious that this must happen on a much wider scale, affecting practically every county and every constituency in the country, when we found that this was imminent that the Government decided to comply with the request of the two Opposition Parties and moved to have the Constitution amended in a very slight way in order to give some scope to avoid this type of anomaly and this type of injustice, to avoid what was described as butchery and as savage dismemberment by members of the Opposition in 1961.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only possible criticism we could have expected was that our proposals in this regard were far too modest and that they would not be sufficient to avoid this type of injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what is the position in other countries has been raised here.  In the United Kingdom, there was a tolerance provided for for a number of years of 25 per cent above or 25 per cent below the national average per member, but this was abandoned as being too restrictive, as not giving sufficient scope for the avoidance of the type of injustice we have been discussing here.  I think that, in view of the fact that the Opposition are complaining about this terrible injustice of allowing a maximum deviation of one-sixth in clearly <Col N="87" /> defined circumstances, it is desirable to give some examples of the position in Britain.  I propose to compare like with like, not to compare a constituency in the Highlands of Scotland with a constituency in the city of London.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to give an example of the difference between two London boroughs.  In the constituency of Wandsworth-Putney, the electorate is 69,870, whereas in Bermondsey it is 33,811, that is, a difference of 207 per cent between one London borough and another.  In other boroughs outside of the city of London, we have Ports-mouth-Langstone with 96,166 and Birmingham-Ladywood with 25,294, a difference of 380 per cent.  In regard to English counties the constituency of Billericay (Essex) had an electorate of 102,198, whereas in Leominster (Herefordshire) the figure is 38,880, which is a difference of 263 per cent. With regard to Welsh boroughs, the figure for Newport is 68,131 and the figure for Rhonnda West is 31,189, a difference of 218 per cent.  With regard to Welsh counties, in Monmouth, the figure is 64,356 and in Merioneth, the figure is 25,395 which is a difference of 253 per cent.  With regard to Scottish burghs, the constituency of Glasgow Cathcart has a figure of 66,266 while Kelvingrove has 24,483, a difference of 271 per cent.  In Scottish counties, Dunbartonshire East has 79,031 while the Western Isles have 22,940, a difference of 345 per cent.</P>
    <P>In Australia, a tolerance of 20 per cent above or below the number of electors per member is allowed in elections to the House of Representatives, that is, electors, not population as it is here.  In Western Germany, the tolerance allowed is 33? per cent of the number of electors.  In Canada, a tolerance of 25 per cent above or below their population per member in each province is allowed in determining constituencies for the purpose of elections to the House of Commons. In France, there are deviations from minus 60 per cent to plus 46 per cent of the national average.  Compared with all these countries, we are only asking for a maximum deviation of <Col N="88" /> one-sixth, a maximum which can only be exercised in the circumstances specified in the Bill and which would obviously not be possible to apply to the country as a whole, even if the Government desired to do so.</P>
    <P>Now, I think it is obvious from the debate that Opposition Deputies have not, in fact, considered the implications of what must happen if this amendment to the Constitution we are proposing is not adopted.  I think that is quite obvious.  Despite the fact that they had all-night sessions and despite the fact that apparently it caused a considerable amount of wrangling to arrive at the decision, the decision appears to have been quite clearly based on the fact that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil proposed this; we are the Opposition and we must oppose it.&rdquo;</P>

I would like to point out that the demand of the Opposition Parties at the time, and particularly the Labour Party, was not for an appeal to the Supreme Court but for an appeal to the people.  The demand was that the Constitution should be amended and that the Government were lacking in their duty to justice and to the people of the country in not going for an amendment of the Constitution straight away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are in fact complying with the demand of the two Opposition Parties that was made here in 1961.  We are only partially doing so, I agree, because we have proposed this rather severe restriction of maximum deviation of one-sixth.  That will <Col N="91" /> not allow us as a Government or will not allow the commission, if it is a commission that will be doing it, to avoid this type of injustice that so enraged members of the Opposition in 1961.  I fully agree that those things which had to happen were substantial injustices to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>I agree there was an injustice on the people of Louth to transfer them to Monaghan, that there was an injustice on the people of Waterford to transfer them to South Tipperary, that there was an injustice on the people of Meath and Westmeath to transfer them to Kildare, on the people of Wexford to transfer them to Carlow-Kilkenny, on Roscommon to transfer them to Mayo and the dismemberment of County Leitrim was a substantial injustice.  It is because this will have to be done all over the country on this occasion that we are now complying with the request of the Opposition in 1961 in giving the people an opportunity to amend the Constitution so as to ensure that this injustice will not have to be done, at least there will be a certain amount of scope in avoiding carrying out injustice such as this in the future.</P>
      <P>As I said, I think I should make the Opposition aware of the type of thing that will have to be done if this proposal is not adopted.  I do not think there is any better place to start than that part of the country towards which this is alleged to be directed, that is, the west of Ireland.  First of all, I think I should deal with the situation in Donegal.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that Deputy Ryan says this is a wrong interpretation, I think the fact that constituencies based on that interpretation have been found to be constitutional makes that a reasonable assessment. On that basis the minimum population that can justify three seats is 57,084 and North-East Donegal has a population, as I said, of 55,649, so that on the basis of the present Constitution that constituency must be revised.  The Opposition have been <Col N="93" /> maintaining that their opposition to this proposed amendment to the Constitution is based on their concern to ensure that a vote in every part of the country will have exactly the same effect if it is cast only in electing a Deputy as a vote cast in any other part of the country When we examine the position with regard to North-East Donegal, we find that the national average of voters per Deputy is 11,899 and that on the basis of the same percentage deviation from the national average, a voting strength of 33,912 would justify the retention of the three seats.  In this constituency of North-East Donegal, there is more than that number of voters.  There are 34,781, so that if the principle is to be that a vote should have the same value in all parts of the country, there is no need to interfere with the constituency of North-East Donegal. It is purely on the basis of equating new-born babies, whether they belong to the particular constituency or not, with adult voters that the requirement of changing that constituency arises.</P>
      <P>In regard to South-West Donegal, the population in accordance with the 1966 Census is 52,900, which is substantially below the minimum of 57,084 which is required for three seats, but the number of voters on the register in 1967-68 is 35,837.  That is substantially above the minimum number required for three seats which should be 33,912. According to the interpretation of the Constitution established by the High Court, South-West Donegal is 4,184 short of the population for three seats but it is almost 2,000 in excess of the number of voters required for three seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If representation is to be based on the theory that, irrespective of considerations such as administrative boundaries and physical features, a vote should have the same effect in electing a Deputy in any part of the country, there is no change required in Donegal.  In the county the population is 108,549 and the number of voters on the register is 70,618. The minimum population required for six seats is 114,168.  The number of voters required is 67,824 so that <Col N="94" /> obviously based on voters per Deputy the county of Dongal is entitled to six seats.  In the present position, County Donegal is 5,619 short of the population required for six seats and is 3,409 in excess of the maximum population for five seats.  To comply with the present constitutional requirements, the county of Donegal as a whole must be adjusted by transferring at least 5,619 people from Leitrim and possibly Sligo to County Donegal, and leaving it a six-seat constituency or two three-seat constituencies.  Otherwise, 3,409 of the population of Donegal must be transferred out of the county to another constituency which would then be a constituency comprising three counties, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal and the remainder of Donegal would be left as a single five-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte is apparently one of the Opposition Deputies who did make some kind of superficial study in his area.  I quote from the Dáil Debates of 3rd April, 1968, volume 233, column No.1722.  He said:</P>
    <P>We have at the present time two constituencies, each sending three Deputies to the House, and if common sense is to be observed and if the Constitution is to be honoured, it should be one constituency sending back five Deputies.  This will be conceded by anybody with limited intelligence who devotes any time to the political scene in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have shown that on the basis of the number of voters in Donegal the position is that there is an excess of voters in the county over and above what is required to maintain its present representation, and Deputy Harte who has apparently looked into the figures demands that County Donegal should be a single constituency returning five Deputies to the Dáil instead of the present six, although, if he had examined the figures in any way closely, he would have appreciated that even that cannot be done; that it is also necessary, in order that that can be done, to transfer at least 3,409 of Deputy O'Donnell's constituents out of Donegal and into the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and this, of course, is not required by any democratic principle, either real or imaginary, because the number of voters per Deputy in <Col N="95" /> Donegal as it exists at present is not out of line with the national average of voters per Deputy.</P>
    <P>I cannot help wondering why it is that Deputy Harte is so anxious, first of all, to deprive Donegal of one of its representatives and, secondly, to maintain a situation which, as he says, &ldquo;if common sense is to be observed&rdquo;, requires the transference of a substantial number of his colleague Deputy O'Donnell's constituents out of the constituency and into another constituency. I wonder is it that there are actually more candidates in the Fine Gael Party for transference to Dublin constituencies than those we know of already.  It is fairly widely accepted, I think, that Deputy Lindsay has decided to contest a constituency in the Dublin area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and also the two Deputies O'Higgins.  I wonder if Deputy O'Donnell is also thinking of embarking on this trek to Dublin.  However, there is no reason why this change should have to be made.  County Donegal, on the basis of voters, is fully entitled to its present representation.</P>
      <P>As you can see, this unnecessary mutilation of Donegal, if this amendment is not carried, will affect the position in the constituency of Sligo/ Leitrim and the consequential changes in Sligo/Leitrim will affect other Connacht counties right down to Clare.  Obviously, the situation in Clare itself will affect the situation in Galway.</P>
      <P>It might be more appropriate for me to go to the other extremity of that area in order to demonstrate exactly what must happen now if the Opposition have their way and if this position is to continue and also to demonstrate that a lot of what must happen is not required even by this theory that, irrespective of such considerations as natural features and administrative boundaries, you must have mathematical accuracy of representation in every constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Clare, the position is that <Col N="96" /> the population, according to the 1966 Census, is 73,597.  The minimum number of population required for four seats in accordance with the present requirements of the Constitution is 76,112.  The number of voters, according to the Register of 1967-68, is 48,182 and the minimum number of voters required for four seats is 45,216. So that, on the basis of voters, the position in Clare is that the proportion of voters per Deputy is actually above the national average but the present Constitution requires that Clare cannot retain its present representation because it is short on the grounds of population.</P>
    <P>I must say that I can understand the Fine Gael Party's desire to deprive County Clare of its due representation. I can understand that all right.  It is not based on any democratic principle.  It is based on the fact that this happens to be an area that gives Fianna Fáil a substantial majority.  The result of this is that either there must be a substantial transfer of population from County Clare, probably to Galway, and the county's representation reduced to three or else there must be a substantial transfer of population from County Galway and the representation left at four; but this is not necessitated by the requirement that a vote in that area should have the same power with regard to electing a Deputy as a vote has in other parts of the country because the number of voters per Deputy in Clare is, in fact, over the national average.</P>
    <P>These two adjustments that would be required at the northern and southern ends of the Province of Connacht are unjustifiable because of the fact that both Donegal and Clare are fully entitled to their present representation on the basis of the number of voters in these constituencies; but, because of these adjustments that must take place at the southern and northern ends of the Province of Connacht, the situation in the actual Province of Connacht itself will be made even worse than it would otherwise be, and as I have said, unjustifiably so.</P>
    <P>Take the present constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  The population, according <Col N="97" /> to the 1966 Census, is 67,892 and the number of voters, according to the 1967-68 Register, is 42,863.  That means that that constituency as it stands, in accordance with the present requirements of the Constitution, is 8,220 short of the minimum population required for its present four seats and, as I have shown, if this amendment is not made, Sligo-Leitrim must be involved in an adjustment with Donegal. One possibility is&mdash;and it may be a probability&mdash;that some of the population of this constituency will have to be transferred to Donegal and the number must be at least 5,619.  Even if it was possible to transfer just the exact number that would be required, this would leave Sligo-Leitrim requiring at least 13,839.  The population of the part of Leitrim that is at present attached to Roscommon is 13,943, but in fact, it would not be possible to deal with the situation by transferring all of those people from the present constituency of Roscommon to the new constituency of Sligo-Leitrim because Roscommon would still require some Leitrim population in order to retain three seats.  Therefore, it seems to me that the more likely thing to happen would be that Sligo-Leitrim would be reduced to three seats and, of course, it would be a completely different constituency from what it is at present because portion of it would probably have gone into Donegal.</P>
    <P>The resulting position as far as County Leitrim is concerned is fairly obvious: that the county as a county, as far as Dáil representation is concerned, would completely disappear because now part of it would be with Donegal, part with Sligo and part with Roscommon and possibly there might have to be another part of it tacked on to Cavan.  When this happened on a much smaller scale in 1961 the Opposition, as far as I could see, were unanimous in describing it as &ldquo;butchery.&rdquo; as a &ldquo;savage dismemberment&rdquo; and as disfranchising the people concerned and certainly as an injustice to the people and to their public representatives and as an infringement of democracy.  It is because we in the Government accept that view that we have decided to give the people the <Col N="98" /> opportunity of allowing a reasonable amount of scope in avoiding that kind of injustice.</P>
    <P>The next county is the county of Roscommon which, as I said already, has part of County Leitrim tacked on to it.  In addition to that, the ridiculous things that have to be done to comply with the present requirements necessitated in 1961 that part of Roscommon had to be added on to Mayo in order to comply with this requirement.  The population of the present constituency of Roscommon is 67,605.  It has four seats.  At present the minimum population required for four seats is 76,112. Obviously, as I said, this part of the present county of Leitrim tacked on to Roscommon must be returned to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, even to retain three seats in that constituency.</P>
    <P>There are at present 2,566 Roscommon people attached to Mayo and 3,943 Leitrim people attached to Roscommon.  It is obvious if the proposed change is not made, the biggest part of this Leitrim population must be returned to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. Roscommon county itself has a population of 56,228 and, as the minimum required for three seats is 57,084, Roscommon county even if it gets back the population at present attached to Mayo will still require some area of County Leitrim to justify three seats.</P>
    <P>With regard to the County Mayo, the total population of the county is 115,547.  The number of voters on the 1967-68 register is 71,316.  It is obvious if this proposed change is not made, Mayo must lose a seat.  In fact, I think it is probably likely it will have to lose a seat whether the change is made or not.  Because of the situation arising unnecessarily in Donegal, it may well be that the only way of dealing with the Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon situation will be that some of the population in Mayo will have to be transferred to one of those constituencies.  If we were to try to arrange that the whole of the Province of Connacht would retain its maximum entitlement under the present Constitution of 20 seats as against the present 23 seats, it would be necessary to deal in a very detailed way with the division of population <Col N="99" /> per constituency.  In fact, Mayo would also very probably have to be adjusted at the other end of the county with County Galway.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that Galway would also be affected by the situation that unnecessarily arises in Clare.  The county of Galway as a whole at present has eight seats.  If the proposed change in the Constitution is not made, it is short of the minimum population for this number of seats.  The total population of County Galway is 148,340 while the minimum population required for eight seats is 152,224. Obviously, if this change is not made, there will have to be this adjustment between Galway and Clare and probably between Galway and Mayo as well.</P>
    <P>All this type of thing was found to be very objectionable by the Opposition Parties in 1961.  But now, when it must happen on a much wider scale, apparently it is found not to be objectionable at all.  It has been alleged that in putting forward this proposed amendment of the Constitution the Government are interested in retaining for the west of Ireland representation to which it is not entitled on the basis of equality of the effect of a vote in different parts of the country.  I think it would be appropriate to examine the position in this western area as a whole&mdash;Donegal, Clare and the province of Connacht&mdash;and to compare it with the situation in the area which it is being alleged is being victimised by this proposal, that is, the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The total population of the province of Connacht is 401,950.  As I said the population of Donegal is 108,549 and the population of Clare is 73,597, so that the total population of this area is 584,096.  In accordance with the present requirements of the Constitution the maximum representation that could be accorded for this area, which has 33 seats at present, is 30 seats, that is, a reduction of three.  But the number of voters in this area is 365,740 and on the basis of the national average of voters per Deputy instead of this artificial and meaningless requirement of the average of population per Deputy, this area would <Col N="100" /> be entitled to 32 seats and not 30.  So that the most that even the most rigid application of this alleged principle would require would be a reduction of one seat in that area rather than three seats.</P>
    <P>The Opposition campaign against this amendment of the Constitution means in fact that they are insisting on this area losing three seats instead of the maximum of one that is required even on the basis of the most rigid application of this so-called democratic principle which in fact, as the Opposition Deputies pointed out so forcefully in 1961, is the negation of democracy rather than what it is represented to be. As I pointed out, on this fairer basis, Donegal and Clare need not lose a seat at all and there would be a total reduction of one seat in the Province of Connacht.  It would not be necessary at least to breach the provincial boundaries at the northern and southern extremity of the province.  It must be quite clear that that is probably just exactly what would happen if the amendment we propose were carried.  Obviously by adhering to the guidelines laid down in the Bill, it would not be possible to exercise a maximum deviation below the national average in all rural parts of the country and a maximum deviation above the national average in the urban areas as is being alleged.  That could be challenged in the courts and such an attempt would be held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>So the most that will result from what is proposed in this Bill is that a vote in the western areas will have the same effect in electing a Deputy as it would have in urban areas.  What we propose will do no more than enable this amount of justice to be done to the people in the western areas.  As I say, that would be much nearer to this alleged principle of one man, one vote. For some reason or another the Opposition have apparently deliberately decided to try to deprive the west of Ireland of representation to which it is entitled even on the basis of the most rigid interpretation of any democratic principle.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that for some reason the Government artificially want to maintain the representation of the western <Col N="101" /> areas.  Opposition Deputies have been putting forward the allegation that this is because it is there that Fianna Fáil get their majority, and that an attempt is being made to victimise the Dublin areas because we have a minority there.  In fact, that is not the position at all.  In the province of Connacht, we have a majority of only one, whereas in the Dublin city and county area, we have a majority of two.  It is alleged that this proposal will victimise the people of Dublin city and county, so I think the next most appropriate area for us to examine would be the Dublin area and compare it with the western area which must lose three seats if the Opposition succeed in their attempt to retain the present position.</P>
    <P>According to the 1966 census, Dublin city and county have a population of 795,047 people.  The number of voters is 446,781.  On the basis of the present Constitution this area must get at least 38 seats instead of the present 34 seats.  As I have shown, the western area must be reduced from 33 seats to 30.  This means that if the proposed change is not made there must be an increase of at least four seats in the Dublin area, but on the basis of the national average of voters as distinct from the total population, which includes children, whether at home, in institutions or hospitals or otherwise, the minimum number of seats is 36, not 38.  So, the present constitutional provision requires that there should be two more seats than are justified by even the most rigid interpretation of this alleged principle of one man, one vote in this area, and it requires that there be a reduction of two more in the western area than would be required by the same rigid interpretation of this so-called principle.</P>
    <P>Even if it were possible to exercise the maximum deviation of one-sixth of the national average of the population over the whole of the Dublin area there would have to be at least 35 seats allocated to the area.  Even if this were possible it would be at least nearer to the number of 36 which would be based on the strict application of the principle of equality of the effect of a vote in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, because of <Col N="102" /> the lines laid down to guide the exercise of this deviation of one-sixth above or below the national average, obviously it would not be possible to operate that uniformly throughout the country as a whole.  It is extremely unlikely that it would be possible to apply that maximum figure over the whole of the Dublin area.  With at least eight or nine different constituencies in the Dublin area as a whole it would not be practicable to arrange them in such a way as to have the maximum number per Deputy in each.  Even if it were possible to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be necessary to have a minimum population per Deputy in practically every constituency in the rural parts of the country, so that this cannot happen.  If this amendment which we propose is passed it will certainly do no more than reduce the increase in the number of Deputies to be elected in the Dublin area to two instead of four.  That would be the case and if the amendment is not passed this is exactly what would be required if the representation were to be based on voters rather than on total population.  In other words, both as regards the western area which it is alleged we are attempting to favour, and which the Opposition obviously are trying to deprive of its due representation, and as regards the Dublin area which it is being alleged that we are attempting to victimise, it is obvious that this amendment would in fact result at most in doing bare justice to both of those areas.</P>
      <P>There is no reason whatever for the deliberate and cold-blooded attempt made by the Opposition Parties&mdash;both of them&mdash;to divide the people on the basis of the urban population versus the rural population.  What we propose will, in fact, result in a much closer approximation to equating the value of votes in various parts of the country than the present position.  There must be some reason why the Opposition Parties have departed from the stand they took in 1961 and decided instead to try to maintain a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He pointed to the fact that the constituency he represents would be entitled, in accordance with the present Constitutional requirements, to seven seats instead of five.  He pointed to the provision of the Constitution which requires that the proportion of population per Deputy shall at any time be the same, as far as it is practical, in every constituency.  He has pointed to the fact that that is not the position at present and deduced from that that there is now a legal requirement on the Government to revise the constituencies so as to bring them into conformity with the present requirements of the Constitution.  I am not a Constitutional lawyer but I cannot dispute the figures Deputy Dunne has produced from the Census of Population. It is a fact that only 14 of the 38 constituencies at present conform to the requirements of the Constitution as interpreted by the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly hesitate to say that Deputy Dunne's statements are infallible.  I do not think anybody could ever accuse me of saying that.  However, I say that the figures on which you are required by the Constitution to base the scheme of constituencies are the figures produced by the preceding Census of Population and that Deputy Dunne has accurately read the figures for his constituency from the Census of Population.  That is all I said.</P>
      <P>I have admitted that, in present circumstances, there are only 14 constituencies that do conform to the constitutional requirements, that is, on the basis of the interpretation we put on the decision of the Judge of the High Court which, according to the Opposition, is far too liberal an interpretation. If we take Deputy Ryan's interpretation, there is probably no constituency at all in the whole country that complies with the requirements of the Constitution and a full revision would be required.  In fact, as we know, the carrying-out of a revision, involving, as it does, transfers of population from one constituency to another, means that the 14 constituencies, within the most liberal interpretation of the High Court's decision, could not be left undisturbed either.</P>
      <P>The next constituency I should like to deal with is that of Cavan.  According to the 1966 census, the population of Cavan is 54,022.  The minimum population required for three seats, in accordance with the most liberal interpretation of the High Court's decision, is 57,084.  According to the 1967-68 Register, the number of voters in Cavan is 34,301.  The minimum number of voters, applying the same standard, required for three seats is 33,912.  Therefore, in accordance with the High Court's decision, the population of Cavan is too low for three seats and therefore Cavan must be dealt with in a manner similar to the way other constituencies and other counties had to be dealt with in 1961.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister is misquoting the judgment. The judgment said that 17 per cent was too high.  It said absolutely nothing between 17 and four per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge indicated that a deviation of 1,000 above or below would be acceptable.  The revision of constituencies, arising out of that 1961 decision, was based on the interpretation that a deviation of 1,000, which is five per cent, was acceptable and was held to be constitutional.  It is on that that I am basing it.  If we apply the same standards to voters then the county and constituency of Cavan&mdash; which coincide but which will not, if Deputy Fitzpatrick has his way, coincide in future&mdash;has sufficient voters for three seats because there are 34,000 odd voters whereas the minimum required is 33,912.  I have shown then that this rigid application of their interpretation of the principle of &ldquo;one-man one-vote&rdquo;&mdash;which is something completely different from what the Opposition pretend&mdash;does not require the integrity of Cavan to be breached in any way.  It does not require any mutilation of the boundaries of the constituency.  It does not require butchering or savage dismemberment. It does not require the disfranchisement or dismemberment of part of the population of Cavan or part of the population of Leitrim or Monaghan in order to do this.</P>
      <P>But Deputy Fitzpatrick, because he interprets it to be his duty, as a member of the Opposition, to oppose everything put forward by Fianna Fáil, is insisting on having the constituency of Cavan unnecessarily disrupted purely and simply because Fianna Fáil are proposing that there should be a certain minimum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have pointed out that the amount of scope we are seeking is much less than is already available in every other democracy that I know of.</P>
      <P>In dealing with Cavan I referred to the situation in Monaghan.  In the constituency of Monaghan there are at present 53,325 people according to the 1966 census but 7,593 of them are resident in the County of Louth.  The minimum population requirement, in accordance with our interpretation of the High Court decision for three seats, is, as I said, 57,084.  Obviously, then there must be an adjustment in the County of Monaghan.  The population of the county, as distinct from the constituency, is 45,732.  It will be immediately apparent to Deputy Fitzpatrick that if the population of Cavan and Monaghan are added together there will be sufficient for a five-seat constituency and therefore there will be no longer any justification for the retention of the 7,593 people from County Louth in a different province.</P>

The Judge of the High Court made this decision to the effect that the proportion of the population per Deputy must be the same throughout the country.  It was this interpretation of the Constitution that required that part of the population of County Louth had to be transferred to the constituency of Monaghan, because the number of people in County Louth, in accordance with the census figures then available, divided by the number of Deputies in County Louth was in excess of the national average of population per Deputy in the country as a whole.  This meant, in accordance with this constitutional requirement, that the people of Louth were being deprived of their democratic rights by having only three Deputies; in fact, they were entitled to 3.3 Deputies.  As I have said, the Government at the time did not know of any way in which the people of Louth could elect .3 of a Deputy, and therefore it was necessary to shift some of the population out of Louth. Deputies for County Louth at that time complained about it.  They said the people were resentful, and I think they interpreted the people's feelings fairly well.  As I have pointed out, now there is a probability that the rectifying &mdash;if I can use the word, though I do not consider it rectifying&mdash;of the situation in Monaghan, in other words, complying with the Constitution in regard to Monaghan, will give rise to a situation in which this addition of population from County Louth will no longer be necessary to maintain the representation of Monaghan.  Therefore, it seems obvious that since there is nowhere else that these people can go except to Louth, unless we utilise them to top up West Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now Deputy Donegan may think that this will be welcomed with open arms by the people at the other end of the county who will have to be transferred out of it, but his former colleague Deputy Coburn, described this kind of thing in a different kind of way completely.  It would appear that these people would have to be transferred to the County Meath and personally I do not believe that these 6,435 people at least would consider that they had gained in any way in their democratic rights by being transferred from County Louth to County Meath.  Maybe they would or maybe they would not be resentful as Deputy Coburn said they were in 1961, but somehow I think they would not be in any way upset if they were left in Louth and left with their three representatives and they would not feel in any way deprived of their democratic rights because it would take marginally more people in Louth to elect a Deputy than in some other constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own belief is they would prefer that situation rather than that they should be changed into another county in which they may only be in temporary residence as in the case of those who had to be transferred to Monaghan on the last occasion. Another way in which the situation in Louth could be dealt with would be by transferring population to the County Louth and making it a four-seat constituency instead of a three-seat constituency.  The minimum population required for four seats would require a transfer of at least 6,593 people <Col N="115" /> to County Louth.  These would naturally come from the county of Meath so that unless the amendment we propose is accepted it is obvious that we must have this adjustment carried out between Louth and Meath in exchange for the return of the population who were so unjustly transferred from Louth to Monaghan in 1961.  I believe that the people in Louth would prefer to wait with their present representation until such time as the population in the county itself justified an extra seat.  The people who were transferred to Monaghan felt they were victimised and now that they have presumably become partly acclimatised to that position they find they must come back but there must be a corresponding adjustment made with Meath.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Meath, the constituency of Meath, which is not the County of Meath, because portion of the county is attached to Kildare.  The constituency has, according to the 1966 census, a population of 60,830&mdash;and the minimum population that is required for three seats is 57,084, in accordance with the present constitutional requirement, so that if it were possible to deal with the constituency in isolation Meath need not be touched.  It is one of these 14 constituencies that still comply with the requirements of the Constitutional interpretation by the High Court.  But, as I have shown, because of the situation in Louth, which arises because of the situation in Monaghan and which in turn arises partly because of the situation in Cavan, because of this chain of events, the constituency of Meath, which is within the constitutional requirements at present, must be disturbed and I use the mild word &ldquo;disturbed&rdquo; rather than the more lurid words used by the Opposition to describe this type of operation.  It must be disturbed either by receiving these 6,435 people from Louth or by donating 6,593 people to Louth in order to make Louth a four-seat constituency. I do not know which of these solutions would be adopted but whatever solution is adopted it would leave the County Meath requiring further adjustment either to retain the <Col N="116" /> three seats in one event or to justify four seats in the other event.  Of course, the number of ways in which the County Meath could be so adjusted are very numerous.  It borders on a number of different counties and the problem could conceivably be involved in some kind of re-arrangement with Cavan, or it could be involved in an adjustment with North County Dublin, or it might be more appropriate to take cognisance of the fact that already a substantial portion of the population of Meath is attached to the constituency of Kildare.</P>
    <P>The further you go from the origin of all this unnecessary mutilation of constituencies the more possible solutions to the problem there are.  As I say, there are many ways in which the situation in Meath could be dealt with. If Louth is dealt with by transferring 6,435 people to Meath, then Meath would have too high a population for three seats and too low a population for four seats.  Even if the population of Meath which is at present attached to Kildare was returned that would still be the position and there would have to be some further adjustment with Dublin, Westmeath or Cavan in order to justify a four-seat constituency. Alternatively there could be a further transfer of population from Meath to leave it a three-seat constituency. On the other hand, if Louth was dealt with by transferring population from Meath and becoming a four-seat constituency then the return of the population in Meath at present attached to Kildare would be sufficient to leave Meath as a three-seat constituency.  However, as in the case of all these artificial arrangements which would be required if the proposed change in the Constitution is not made, the solution is likely to require a further change with every census and with resulting frustration both for the population of the county concerned, for the public representatives and the political Party organisations, that is those which have them.  I suppose as far as the public representatives are concerned I should qualify it by saying those who do their job.  Now, as we have seen the situation that unnecessarily arises in the <Col N="117" /> constituency of Meath is likely to affect the present constituency of Kildare, and the population of the present constituency of Kildare, according to the 1966 Census, is 79,998.  Here, again, this is another constituency which is one of the 14 that complies with the present requirements of the Constitution but, because of events elsewhere, it must be disturbed.  Of that population, there are 6,493 located in the administrative county of Meath and 7,106 located within the administrative county of Westmeath. Although the constituency of Kildare itself does not require any change, being within the permitted range of population for four seats, it must be changed because of this rigid requirement in the Constitution which the Opposition Parties want to retain.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are a number of ways in which this change could be made. First of all, the county of Kildare itself has too high a population for three seats and too low a population for four seats.  That is why it had to be dealt with in 1961 by adding these portions of Meath and Westmeath to form a four-seat constituency. The problem could have been dealt with by transferring this artificial excess population from Kildare and leaving it a three-seat constituency. Another way in which it could have been dealt with, as an alternative to this adjustment with Meath and Westmeath, was that it could have been adjusted with, say, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The necessity to change the present constituency arises from two different circumstances: I have dealt with the Cavan-Monaghan situation and shown how that affects Kildare through Louth and Meath.  In addition to that, the constituency of Longford-Westmeath is now too low in population for four Deputies.  This could be dealt with by the return of some, or all, of the Westmeath population from Kildare so that if, as seems likely, both the Meath and Westmeath additions to County Kildare have to go, one to make Meath a four-seat constituency and the other to justify the retention of four seats in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, then the position in the county of Kildare would have to be dealt with <Col N="118" /> by transferring the excess population for three seats in Kildare to some constituency in County Dublin or else by transferring the requisite numbers to make up a four-seat constituency in Kildare from some parts of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>It could conceivably be dealt with also by joining Kildare with Carlow to form a five-seat constituency.  This would be quite feasible because the county of Kilkenny on its own could conceivably become a three-seat constituency. That is another possibility with regard to Kildare.  Of course, it could also be dealt with in various different ways by additions from Dublin, Wicklow, Carlow and any other county that happens to touch on it.</P>
    <P>As I said, it appears any adjustment will be effective only until the next census and this proposed Third Amendment of the Constitution will, among other things, make this type of chopping and changing after each census unnecessary.  It will, too, make it possible for the people who vote, the Party organisations and Deputies to get a reasonable chance to know one another and to know their constituencies as against the chaotic position that obtains at present because of the too frequent changes inevitable under present Constitutional requirements.</P>
    <P>All these adjustments in the part of the province of Leinster that I have so far dealt with are completely unnecessary.  The total number of Deputies that would be elected in the area would be the same as at present, but there would be marginal differences in the number of voters electing Deputies in the different constituencies and, as I said, I do not think these voters would consider themselves in any way victimised by the fact that it took marginally more votes in, say, County Louth to elect a Deputy than in County Monaghan or in the adjoining counties of Longford-Westmeath. I do not think there is any reason whatsoever to insist on this rigid re-alignment of constituencies after each census, as is required by the present interpretation of the Constitution and I agree with the views expressed by the Opposition Deputies <Col N="119" /> in their discussion of the revision of constituencies in 1961.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should really deal with Dublin now, because we have travelled all around it, but the number of permutations and combinations that could be exercised in the Dublin area are so numerous that I would not inflict them on Deputy Fitzpatrick, who has waited here so long and, in doing so, absorbed so much information that he could have collated himself if he had been sufficiently interested to investigate what opposition to this proposal implies.  Dublin could be dealt with in so many different ways that it is better to leave it to the imagination.  Obviously it could be utilised in remedying the situation that will result in Meath and Kildare, in addition to re-arrangements within the county and city of Dublin itself.  I will, therefore, skip over the Dublin area and go on to Carlow-Kilkenny because, as I have pointed out, one of the possible solutions to the unnecessary problem which the present Constitutional requirement creates in Kildare would be that Carlow and Kildare could be combined to form a five-seat constituency.  The population would just be sufficient and this might, in fact, prove to be the most feasible thing to do.  That could involve Kilkenny in becoming a three-seat constituency and that, in turn, could involve the return of the population of Wexford, which is at present associated with Carlow-Kilkenny, to the county of Wexford; but, if it did, it would again create in Wexford the problem that had to be solved in this way in 1961.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Carlow-Kilkenny, with a population of 98,454, of whom 4,398 live in the administrative county of Wexford, is another one of the 14 out of the 38 constituencies which comply with the present requirements of the Constitution and there is no need whatever to disturb it in any way but for the fact that the unnecessary situation that Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to insist on arises as far up as County Cavan and County Monaghan.  This, then, is another constituency that would have to be disturbed; <Col N="120" /> five more Deputies would find themselves contesting a different constituency from the one they contested on the last occasion.  This is another area in which Party organisation would have to re-align themselves and another area in which the people would have to adjust themselves to being represented by different Deputies from those to whom they have become accustomed.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. According to the 1966 census, the population there is 74,788.  There are four seats at present in that constituency but in accordance with the judge's decision the minimum population required for the retention of four seats is 76,112.  Therefore, that constituency requires an addition of population in order to retain its present representation. As I pointed out, there is at present portion of County Westmeath attached to County Kildare and this problem would most likely and most appropriately be dealt with by returning the 7,106 people in Kildare, but how long it would be possible to leave them there is another matter.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the constituency of Wexford is all right as it is.  It has a population of 79,039 which is within the Constitutional requirements, but the constituency may be affected by what may have to happen to Kildare which may involve Carlow-Kilkenny and this may require the return of the population of Wexford which is at present in Carlow-Kilkenny, and Wexford, to bring it within the requirements, may have to be then adjusted and this unnecessary disruption may have to take place there.</P>
    <P>The most appropriate place to start in the remaining province, Munster, might be the county in which we have all been engaged quite recently&mdash; County Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so do I, though it is a discussion I should very much like to enter.  However, I agree it is thoroughly out of order.  The county of Limerick, as we all know, is divided into two constituencies, West Limerick and East Limerick, and the constituency of West Limerick, according to the 1966 census, has a population of 54,335, which is too small to meet the requirements of the Constitution for three seats.  East Limerick has, as some of us know, a population of 83,022.  If we do not know the population we certainly know that the number of voters there is 46,493.  East Limerick comes within the present Constitutional requirements and need not be touched if it could be considered in isolation. However, because of the present position of the Constitution, it cannot be considered in isolation.  Therefore, East Limerick must be adjusted if this <Col N="122" /> proposal is not passed, because it is affected not only by the position in West Limerick but possibly also by the position in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>If East Limerick is involved in an adjustment of its boundary with West Limerick, the possible result will still be just barely within the Constitutional requirements and the revised boundary is unlikely to last longer than the next census, particularly if the situation in Kerry is dealt with by an adjustment with County Limerick which, from one point of view, would appear to be the more desirable thing to do because the barrier between the two counties is hardly as prominent as it is between Counties Kerry and Cork.</P>
      <P>However, other consideration might make it more desirable to adjust Kerry with Cork.  If, in addition to East Limerick and West Limerick being adjusted, there is also an adjustment between West Limerick and Kerry, obviously the situation in each of the four constituencies that would be involved would be so barely in compliance with the Constitution that that situation would be unlikely to last longer than the next census.</P>
      <P>However, it is a fact that the situation in the two Limerick constituencies could conceivably be dealt with within the boundaries of the county itself because the population of the whole county, including the county borough, is 137,357 and the minimum population required for seven seats is 133,196.  As we know, there are seven seats in that area&mdash;four in East Limerick and three in West Limerick &mdash;so that County Limerick could be dealt with in that way if it could be treated alone.  However, as I have said, Limerick is quite likely to be affected by the position in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The population in the South Kerry constituency is 56,628 which is too low for its present three seats.  In North Kerry, the population of 56,157, is also marginally too low from the point of view of the population required for three seats.  The county as a whole has a population of 112,785 so that the county would need an addition of population from somewhere in order to retain its present six seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be possible to deal with <Col N="123" /> Limerick and Kerry as a unit because the total population of the two counties is 250,142 which would be sufficient on the basis of the High Court's interpretation of the Constitution for the retention of the present 13 seats but in order that this could be done not alone would there have to be adjustments between the two constituencies in Kerry and the two constituencies in Limerick but there would also have to be a transference of population from County Limerick to North Kerry.  Here again I do not think that there is any democratic principle that requires this &ldquo;butchery&rdquo; of Limerick and Kerry to take place.  I am just using the words that were used by the Opposition speakers on the last occasion.  I do not think there is, and I hope that during the progress of the Referendum campaign the Opposition Deputies for Limerick&mdash;I think there are still some of them left&mdash;will explain why they insist that some part of County Limerick must be transferred to County Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the ways in which the situation could be dealt with.  The total number of Deputies in the whole area would still be the same but we would have near mathematical accuracy in the number of population per Deputy in the whole area.  I find it hard to believe that the people of County Limerick who would have to vote for a Kerry Deputy instead of a Limerick Deputy would feel that their democratic rights had been vindicated by this unnecessary operation.  I do not think that they would feel in any way underprivileged because of the fact <Col N="124" /> that if they were left in their own county it would take a marginally greater number of votes to elect a Deputy in Limerick than it would in Kerry.  I think they would prefer to stay where they are.  However, this would be still a very close situation that would just barely comply with the Constitutional requirements and it would be so obviously one that would be purely temporary that it might be more appropriate to leave Limerick County intact within its own borders and deal with the situation in Kerry by adjustment with another county rather than County Limerick.</P>
      <P>Of course the only other county that it would be in any way feasible to adjust with County Kerry would be the County of Cork.  From the point of view of the figures this would be a feasible thing to do.  The population could be taken from County Cork as a whole without depriving Cork of any representatives and of course it is only figures that are relevant in accordance with the present position of the Constitution. People do not count.  The fact that the people from County Cork would be required by this adjustment to vote for Deputies in the County of Kerry, the fact that they would be separated from this constituency by the physical barrier of a mountain range which is traversed in one part only by the Healy Pass and the fact that they would also be separated from the County of Kerry by the traditional rivalry between the two counties is something which is irrelevant in present circumstances, which we are not allowed to take into consideration, but it is something which I think all practical politicians would think very relevant indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that we can confidently ask the people of the country to get rid of this requirement, this completely unjustified requirement, that compels the Government or compels the commission to ignore the interests of the people concerned, to ignore the convenience of the public representatives and to ignore the convenience and interests of the voluntary workers in all political Parties.  They will be asked to get rid of this requirement which necessitates continuous chopping and <Col N="125" /> changing of constituencies, continuous transferring of people from one county to another with the result that in the chaos that ensues the people do not know from election to election who is their public representative or to what constituency they belong.  We are asking for a very very small amount of scope indeed to avoid that type of thing.  I do not think we are going as far as we were requested to go by Opposition speakers on the last occasion.  As I said the only criticism that we could possibly have expected of this proposal, particularly when the Opposition asked to have this separated from the other proposal, was that this did not give anything like sufficient scope to avoid this kind of thing and that it did not give anything like the scope that is available in every other democratic country in the world.  The only amendment that we might have expected would be either to remove the definite percentage which is embodied in the Bill as a maximum percentage of deviation or to increase it to a more realistic level. If the Opposition made the criticism that this scope which we were looking for was too low I would certainly be compelled to agree with them just as I find myself compelled to agree with the views that were expressed by Labour and Fine Gael Deputies when the review of constituencies made in 1961 to comply with the decision of the High Court was being discussed here in this House.</P>
    <P>The next county I would like to deal with is the County of Waterford or the constituency of Waterford.  I do not know whether to start with the County or the constituency.  The constituency of Waterford has a population, according to the 1966 census, of 62,331 and this is within the present requirements of the Constitution.  The County of Waterford has a population of 73,080.  As Deputies can see to comply with the requirements of the Constitution as interpreted by the High Court this required the transfer of a substantial number of the people of Waterford to another county and another constituency or else the transfer of a substantial portion of the population of some other county to County Waterford. <Col N="126" /> I admit that this could have been done in a number of different ways on the last occasion.  I think it was an undesirable thing that Waterford had to be dealt with in the way in which it was dealt with.  I can quite understand the feelings of the people there which were very well described by Deputy Kyne and the late Deputy Desmond and the late Deputy Lynch.  I am quite sure that they did not in any way exaggerate the feeling of the people in that area.  We are asking, as I said, for a minimum amount of scope to avoid doing this kind of thing in the future.</P>
    <P>The situation in Waterford combined with the situation in Tipperary was dealt with on the last occasion by transferring some of the population from Waterford to South Tipperary. The situation which exists in the two Tipperary constituencies now is that the population of North Tipperary, according to the 1966 Census, is 56,440.  The minimum population required for three seats in accordance with the High Court decision is 57,084.  The boundary between North Tipperary and South Tipperary which originally was a boundary between the two separate administrative areas of North Tipperary and South Tipperary must now be further adjusted at least.  That is, the least that must now happen is that those boundaries must be further adjusted by a transference to North Tipperary from South Tipperary in order that they may retain the present three seats to comply with this decision.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of South Tipperary the population in accordance with the 1966 Census is 77,121.  Now this constituency is another one of the 14 existing constituencies which are within the limits prescribed by the High Court decision, as we interpret it.  As I said, North Tipperary is not and this means that the boundary between the two constituencies must be altered.  The situation could just be dealt with within the present bounds of those two constituencies but the resulting situation would approximate so closely to the minimum number of population per Deputy that it would obviously be only a very temporary solution so that the adjustment made would only be temporary and those <Col N="127" /> constituencies would have to look forward to a further adjustment in the near future.</P>
    <P>In Cork County and city again the situation there is that it could be dealt with in a number of different ways. It is not quite as involved a situation as in the county and city of Dublin but it is, I think, something which would not be very practical to go into in any great detail here.</P>

      <P>I dealt with it as a whole but not on an individual basis. I demonstrated that if the present constitutional requirements are complied with that area must receive a minimum increase of four seats.  I also dealt with that area must receive a mini-number of voters in the area and showed that the number of voters required an increase of only two seats, rather than four seats.  I contrasted that with the situation in the West of Ireland where, taking the West of Ireland as an area from Donegal to Clare, including the province of Connacht, the present requirements were for a reduction of three seats and whereas based on voters rather than on population there was only need for a reduction of one seat.</P>

    <P>I pointed out that situation to the Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour benches and showed that what they were insisting on was that there should be this uncalled for reduction in the representation of that area from Donegal <Col N="128" /> to Clare of two Deputies and that there should be this unjustified increase to 38 seats in Dublin whereas only 36 are required even on the most rigid interpretation of the so-called democratic principle which Deputies opposite have been talking about but that for some reason the Fine Gael and Labour Parties had decided it was desirable to unnecessarily reduce the representation of rural Ireland and that it was desirable to unjustifiably increase the representation of the urban areas.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that they were for reasons that are known only to themselves embarking on a deliberate campaign of dividing this country on the basis of urban population versus rural population but that in fact there is no need for this.  In fact, the proposal we are making is a proposal which we can put forward with confidence in all parts of the country, both urban and rural areas because it is based on justice.  I do not want to speculate as to why it is that the Fine Gael Party have decided that it is desirable that the rural areas of the country generally should have less representation than the number of voters in the area would entitle them to.  You might get some clue to it from Deputy J.A. Costello's contribution to the Second Reading of the two Bills when he contemptuously referred to the rural vote as the cow vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to a number that will be able to maintain a cow population of a minimum of 400 per farm.  I think possibly we may get a clue as to why it is the Fine Gael Party, whose spokesman here is Deputy Fitzpatrick, from the rural constituency of Cavan, have decided to make this all-out effort to ensure that the present position <Col N="129" /> which deprives the rural population in general of their due representation in the Dáil continues rather than that this slight adjustment in the Constitution we are asking for should be made which would have no more effect than to equate the value of a vote in rural areas generally with the value of a vote in urban areas generally.  It would certainly do no more than that if it would even succeed in doing it.</P>
      <P>As I said, the only criticism that could reasonably have been expected of this proposition would be that it was far too restrictive and that it would not succeed in ensuring justice for the people.  The position even after this amendment is passed would still be that these injustices will have to be perpetrated on large sections of the population in different parts of the country, but the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are determined that this situation will continue, and I hope that they will be able to explain that to their constituents.  We intend to ensure that the constituents will be aware of what they are doing and I think they will require to justify their actions.</P>
      <P>I do not think the present position is required by the principles of democracy. I am inclined to agree with the views expressed by the Opposition Parties in 1961, that this, in fact, is the opposite to democracy.  I do not think it is necessary and I cannot understand why the Opposition want to hang on to this position since it obtains in this country and in this country only, why we must be different from everyone else and why we must be compelled to change people from constituency to constituency, to change people around like shuttlecocks from constituency to constituency, in order to &ldquo;vindicate their democratic rights&rdquo;.  I do not feel this is a vindication of their democratic rights, but for some reason or another the Opposition want it to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to understand why, if they consider the matter from the point of view of one of their own constituents, who at the time of the general election, let us say, in the County Cavan, voted for the panel of candidates including Deputy Fitzpatrick and who finds himself, as a result of the <Col N="130" /> application of this principle, in the situation after the next census, which may be in a year or two, that he is located in a constituency of Meath.  I suppose Deputy Fitzpatrick, being the type of Deputy he is, would continue to devote the same attention to the part of Cavan that had been moved from the rest of the county as if it had been a part that was left there.  I think all Deputies are not the same and there might be a Deputy who, finding that part of the constituency he was elected to represent was now transferred to another constituency and that some part of another constituency was added on, might decide: &ldquo;I am not interested in the part gone from me and I will concentrate now on the new area which I will be contesting in the next election.&rdquo; The people who voted for a Deputy in the original constituency will be bewildered by the change of events. They would find themselves not knowing who their representatives were, whether it was Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> whom they voted for or whether it was Deputy Farrelly whom they would have to vote for the next time.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is necessary.  I do not think it is demanded by any democratic principle.  I do not think it desirable to say what Deputy Harte wants to say to some of Deputy P. O'Donnell's constituents in Donegal: &ldquo;We cannot leave you to continue voting in Donegal because if we did, your vote would only be 94 per cent as effective as the average vote in the country as a whole, so, in order to vindicate your democratic rights, we will transfer you to county Leitrim and there you will be in a constituency where your vote will be 95 per cent as effective as the average vote in the country as a whole, rather than 94 per cent as effective, and by doing that, we will ensure that you have the same democratic rights as everybody else.&rdquo; The 3,500 odd voters at least of the southern part of Donegal, who, if Deputy Harte has his way, will have to be transferred, may possibly think&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this is a vindication of their democratic rights.  I do not think that they will.  Even if it will involve their votes being only 94 per cent as effective as the average vote, they would prefer to vote in Donegal and have the opportunity of continuing to vote for Deputy P. O'Donnell, rather than for Deputy McLaughlin or Deputy Gilhawley or Deputy Reynolds, because the three of them, if this amendment is not passed, would obviously find themselves contesting the same three-seat constituency. They would have the task of competing among themselves for the votes not only of people in County Sligo and County Leitrim but of persons in County Donegal who are displaced purely and simply because of this ridiculous requirement, that the proportion of population per Deputy must be the same in each constituency throughout the country as a whole, regardless of the fact, as I have shown, that in the county of Donegal, the number of voters per Deputy is sufficient fully to entitle that county to retain its present six seats without any mutilation of its boundaries, and without the addition of part of Leitrim or Sligo, or by transferring part of the county to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how that type of thing adds anything to democracy in this country and I do not think the people will see it either.  I hope Deputy Harte will be able to explain to the people of Donegal why he wants this to happen and that Deputy P. O'Donnell will explain during the next referendum campaign why he wants to export part of the people who vote for him to another constituency where admittedly they will have the choice of choosing between three Fine Gael Deputies rather than the one they have already.  He will have to explain to them whether the reason for this is that he intends to join the trek to Dublin that has been started by three Deputies&mdash;the two Deputies O'Higgins and Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a ridiculous requirement and the guidelines we have laid down in the Bill will ensure that this maximum deviation of one-sixth of the national <Col N="132" /> average will not operate generally over the whole country.  It can only be used in the circumstances laid down in the Bill, to avoid the breaching of county boundaries or take account of the extent and accessibility of constituencies. If a revision of constituencies is made and a deviation of one-sixth utilised, and if it is not possible to show that it was for these reasons it was done, then such a revision can be challenged in the High Court.  Then, obviously, it would not be possible, even if anybody desired to do it, to arrange that every rural constituency would be formed on the basis of one-sixth less than the national average population per Deputy and that every urban constituency would be formed on the basis of one-sixth more than the national average population per Deputy.</P>
    <P>If you take the Dublin area as a whole, that is, the Dublin county area plus the Dublin city area, and the other major city of Cork, you will find that in those two areas combined the electors comprise 52 per cent of the total population and if you take the rest of the country as a whole the position is that electors comprise 61 per cent of the total population.  So that the present position is that if you revised constituencies on the basis of strict mathematical accuracy of population per Deputy, a vote in the Dublin area and in the Cork city area would, on average, be nine per cent more effective in electing a Deputy than a vote in the rest of Ireland as a whole. Therefore, it must be quite obvious that the ultimate position resulting from the amendment we are proposing will do no more than redress this imbalance in regard to the effectiveness of a vote in a reasonable way.</P>

      <P>I think it does.  That is what it is intended to say and I think that is what it does say.  This proposition that we are making is one that is completely justifiable.  It has been justified in advance by the Opposition Parties.  It is one that will do no more than justice to the people of the country, that will do no injustice to anybody but will help in a small way to avoid the necessity of perpetrating on people in different parts of the country an injustice that nobody wants to perpetrate on them&mdash;certainly, nobody on this side of the House.  The only possible interpretation to place on the attitude of the Opposition is that they now want the situation that resulted in 1961 to be repeated on a <Col N="134" /> much wider scale on this occasion because, as I have shown, it is inevitable that that will happen now before the next general election and that every part of the country will be affected. It is also quite likely that whatever results from this redrawing of constituencies on this occasion will be only of a very temporary nature and will require further revision probably after the next census.  So that the effect of this proposal, so far from breaching any democratic principle, will result in the value of individual votes throughout the country as a whole becoming more nearly equal and its purpose is so clearly to avoid injustice and to safeguard people's democratic rights as to expose the Opposition Parties as being completely insincere in their attitude to the proposal.  The Opposition's real views were those that were expressed in 1961 and it is only because they allowed themselves to be panicked into opposing it because it is proposed by Fianna Fáil that they now find themselves in the position of opposing this very desirable proposal.</P>

The usual outcome in much smaller cases than this, particularly in cases where private individuals have to bear the cost, is that if a judge's decision, in the opinion of a particular Party, particularly a Party who have the funds to proceed further, is open to question, then they take it to the Supreme Court.

      <P>I assume this electoral revision in 1959 was approved by the Attorney General of the time. He must have agreed that this 1959 revision was in accordance with the Constitution. That was challenged by a private individual and it was determined by a single judge sitting in the High Court that changes should be made.  The natural thing for the Government to do, if they believe in their own Attorney General and the advice submitted to them the previous year, would be to take the matter to the Supreme Court where they would have a much larger body to determine the particular issue.  But that was not done because at that time it possibly suited Fianna Fáil to leave things as they were.  They had a second go at revising the constituencies.</P>
      <P>I may say at this stage that it is not the intention of this Party to delay the House for an extended period on this measure because it has been discussed over and over.

      <P>If I may recall some of his statements, he mentioned the &ldquo;butchery&rdquo; of Waterford.  Who butchered Waterford, and why?  It was butchered because, having regard to the returns of the elections prior to 1961, it was evident to Fianna Fáil, or so they thought, that if Waterford were reduced from a four-seat to a three-seat constituency, Fianna Fáil would still hold the two seats they held and that by doing so, they would take a seat from the Opposition and give that advantage to their own Party.  So they butchered Waterford, to use the Minister's phrase, but unfortunately things did not go their way.  They had hoped to remove my colleague on this bench, Deputy Kyne, from this House when they reduced the representation from four to three seats in the revision of 1960, but what happened?  The people of Waterford sent Deputy Kyne back here with the largest vote he ever got in any election.  That was the answer given.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us about statements by the late Deputy Norton and what happened in Kildare.  Big chunks of Westmeath and Meath were thrown into Kildare to do something that proved to be sound so far as the Minister's Party are concerned. That something, of course, was to get two out of four seats.  Fianna Fáil could not do better than one out of three when Kildare was a constituency on its own.  I will give the Minister the credit that his view was correct.  So far as Kildare was concerned he said: &ldquo;Look here, if we get extra chunks of Meath and Westmeath and make Kildare a four-seat constituency we will get two out of the four.&rdquo;  Was that not one of the main reasons why Kildare was transformed from a three-seat constituency to a four-seat constituency?</P>
      <P>I am a believer in tolerance but I am not a believer in the Minister.  I have not the slightest doubt that he is completely insincere and that his main aim in this provision&mdash;if I have the permission of the Parliamentary Secretary to repeat myself&mdash;is to sugar-coat this Fourth Amendment Bill in which he is so vitally interested.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Amendment Bill is the one the Minister has at the back of his head, and judging from what happened in Limerick, it is going to stay there.  If I may digress for a moment, I was down at some of the meetings on the Sunday before the election at Murroe and outside church gates and the Parliamentary Secretary was saying: &ldquo;If you do not give O'Malley No. 1 and if you give your No. 1 to one of the other <Col N="140" /> candidates, give our fellow No. 2 and even No. 3.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To bolster up a bad case, the Minister talked about the county boundaries and said they might be crossed. Even under the present Constitution you cannot keep within the county limits.  No matter what system we have, single, double, treble or whatever number of seats, it is not unlikely that in rare cases county boundaries may have to be crossed.  I do not like that to happen, but Fianna Fáil have done it before to suit themselves.  I remember when they put Youghal into Waterford in order to defeat a former chairman of the Cork County Council. He resided in Youghal, and, by transferring Youghal town to the constituency of Waterford, they thought they would knock him out, but the people thought differently.  If Deputy O'Connor looks up the records, he will find there are umpteen cases of that kind.</P>

      <P>It could make a recommendation which would be acceptable to all Parties and could then be put before the people.  That was not done because the Minister and his Party were not interested in doing it at the time.  The Attorney General advised the Government that a general election on the present basis would be contrary to the Constitution.  How do we know that the decision of the Attorney General is correct?  A decision by the Attorney General in 1959 was revoked by a High Court judge.  Is the Minister asserting that the Attorney General is infallible?  He did not set down whether the variation or the tolerance should be 1,000 or 2,000.  The Minister is misinterpreting his lordship's remarks for the purpose of deceiving the general public.  If the viewpoint of the Attorney General is correct, I want to pose a question to the Minister: is the composition of the present Dáil unconstitutional?  We were elected in 1965 and some were elected from constituencies which were below the normal tolerance allowed, according to the Minister's interpretation of the judge's remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I do not want to hold up the House for too long but I do not believe that the Minister's case is in any way sincere.  If I thought for a moment that there was any sincerity attaching to the Minister's statement, I would be the first to agree to join in any Committee or group of Members of the House to ensure that the rural areas were properly and adequately represented, but I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister is not interested in rural representation.  The Minister is interested in improving the position of <Col N="142" /> his own political Party and keeping himself and his friends in office for longer than the people want them. That is his sole aim.  The Government have been in office for too long. Possibly the same could apply to other Governments.  The Government are stale and arrogant.  The Minister for Local Government is most arrogant. They feel they are declining, and naturally the results in Wicklow and the results in Limerick East bear out that feeling.  Limerick was their strongest, or their second strongest, constituency in the country.  Everything favoured them.  I do not want to go into details but they got in by less than they expected.</P>

I could also say that the Fine Gael vote declined by 2,500.  I do not want to inflict that on the House at 9.30 this evening.  The Minister is supposed to be the computer of the Fianna Fáil Party that gets in the figures.  He said he had taken into account the probable outcome of all the constituencies.  The Minister has proposals before him so that in the likely event of his single-seat reform proposal turning out as we expect it to turn out, he will ask himself: &ldquo;How will we move now?  Will we make this <Col N="143" /> place four or five?&rdquo;  The Minister mentioned that here this evening.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister is getting petty and sore and small.  He does that with the clergy, with the returning officers, with television, and so on.  In any event, the Minister seems to think that the one-sixth tolerance is regulated by things such as accessiblity, rivers, mountains, and so on.  If the Minister reads the Bill or consults his advisers, he will find that that just is not so.  If there never were a county boundary, the Minister can provide that 16,667 people will be represented by one Teachta Dála in one constituency but in another constituency, one Teachta Dála will represent 23,333 people if there never were a river and never were a mountain.</P>
      <P>I want to get back to the commission. I challenge the Minister to agree to put into this measure the commission provisions of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill&mdash;to make them applicable to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  There is no difficulty about doing it.  It can be done. The only reason the Minister is not doing it is that he wants to retain to himself and to his majority in this House the right to draw up the constituencies, the right to rig the constituencies, the right to gerrymander the constituencies and to arrange them to his best political advantage.  If that is not his intention I ask, and I repeat, why will he not include the commission provisions of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and why they were left out of it in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that county boundaries are sacred and that the counties and constituencies should coincide identically.  I do not think there is anything sacred about county boundaries.  For example, for years back, we have had county managers <Col N="146" /> managing two counties.  We have had joint county managers in a number of counties.  Practically every police district in this State consists of two counties joined together.  Almost invariably, two counties have been joined together in this country over the years for mental health purposes. We have had a number of joint constituencies. I think I am safe in saying that there are some counties in this State which, from its foundation, have never been a single constituency but have always been joined with another. It we are to accept as genuine the thinking of the Government at present, they are thinking away from counties and thinking in terms of regions.  We have a commission sitting at present &mdash;their report is overdue&mdash;advising on regional hospitals.  The day of the old county hospital is done.  A hospital now caters for three or four counties. Therefore, there is nothing sacred about county boundaries&mdash;there never has been&mdash;but if I understand the case the Minister is making correctly, he seems to be saying that constituencies should coincide with county boundaries and that each county should be a constituency. But did it occur to the Minister to consider for a moment what he is doing in the Fourth Amendment Bill?  To use his own familiar words, he is butchering up every single county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You will then have Deputies representing, say, the eastern part of a county in the Dáil: on the county council they may be representing another area of the county.  They will be pulling against their county council interests and their interests will be divided.  I should like the Minister to explain how, if he thinks counties are so sacred, he can justify butchering or dividing up&mdash;if he thinks it is a better word&mdash;each county into two or three constituencies because that is what he is doing.  You will then have the people of East Cavan, Mid-Cavan and West Cavan all with different interests.  Deputies representing West <Col N="147" /> Cavan will not have the same interests as those representing East Cavan and Deputies representing Mid-Cavan will not have an interest either in East Cavan or West Cavan.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to close on this note that I believe that the Minister has got the message.  I believe his speech for four hours here tonight was an attempt to drag out this debate into the financial business when he will have an excuse for putting the Third Amendment and the Fourth Amendment Bills at the bottom of the Order Paper.  He will then have an opportunity of avoiding the referendum until the end of this year or perhaps next year.  So far as I and my Party are concerned, we will just not co-operate with him.  If he wants to talk on and on for hours he can do so, but it will be to a quorum of his own Deputies.  We want this <Col N="149" /> measure and the next measure, the Fourth Amendment, to go to the people at once and we want to get any uncertainty there may be about electoral change out of the way and let Parliament get on with the business for which it was elected, to pass laws for the people and not to be considering ways and means of keeping itself or portion of it in office.  That is what is being done.  I repeat that I am not going to co-operate, nor is this Party, in any of the Minister's delaying tactics to drag out this debate.  The referendum must be held, I think, within 30 days of the passing of this measure by Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>Opposition speakers are accusing the Minister of delaying tactics and have said that he has spoken for four hours.  I heard only some of the things he said but there is one point that I think is worth elaborating. It struck me very forcibly.  Taking the 20,000 people per Deputy as the base then, according to the Minister's statement that in rural areas the voters consist of 61 per cent of the population and in urban areas the electors make up 52 per cent of the population &mdash;if you work it out it means that in, say, Donegal it will take 12,200 electors to return a Deputy whereas in Dublin it will require only 10,400 electors to return a TD.  Is this the kind of tolerance <Col N="150" /> that Fine Gael and Labour want? Is this what they want to impose on the rural population of this country?  Is this what they want to see happen in the rural constituencies from Donegal to Cork and from Galway to the boundaries of Dublin?  I do not think that this is justice.  I do not think Fine Gael or Labour should advocate that on this Bill&mdash;I presume when it comes to the referendum, they will advocate the same policy&mdash;because frankly, any Deputy, and especially rural Deputies like Deputy Murphy from Cork and Deputy Fitzpatrick, does not want this although this is what they are fighting for in this House and will be fighting for on the occasion of the referendum. They want to uphold the system which in the case of Donegal, in the case of Cavan and in the case of West Cork, will require the large number of 12,200 people as the number who will elect a TD, whereas in the city they want to see, and will see, a TD elected by 10,400 people.  This is what will happen if the percentage which the Minister has given is correct, and I am sure these are the official figures.</P>

      <P>There again is another point I hope the Minister will highlight, because I think it is a very important one for the people, especially the people of rural Ireland whose interests all Parties seem to have at heart, although it is difficult to understand how any Party can have the interests of rural Ireland at heart when <Col N="151" /> it is trying to preserve the present position.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also complained that the Minister read out a litany of constituencies and spoke of what might happen if the referendum were defeated.  Only one of two things can happen, either the referendum will succeed or it will be defeated.  It is only right to put across to this House and through this House to the people the situation that will obtain in either event.  Why tell them what will happen if the referendum succeeds and not tell them what will happen if it does not succeed?  Eventually it is the people who will decide, and if they decide against, then what the Minister has been telling the House and the country this evening is what will happen, or something along those lines&mdash;the breaching of boundaries, the crossing from one county to another.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has said that if the single-seat constituency is adopted, he could represent only one-third of Cavan.  I think he would be better able to represent one-third than the whole county; in other words, the area he would represent would be better represented because he would be able to devote more time to it.</P>

      <P>I am fairly familiar with this breaching of constituencies.  Before 1945, part of my own county&mdash;indeed, part of my present constituency&mdash;was attached to County Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was so rudely interrupted by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I was referring to the breaching of county boundaries and to the fact that some <Col N="152" /> years ago part of my present constituency was attached to County Clare from quite near my own town to Woodford, which is practically on the Clare boundary, and over again to Gort and into Oranmore, which is very near Galway city.  It was impossible in those days to get people interested in voting at general or by-elections, because the people in the county of Galway had to vote for candidates of all Parties who were naturally chosen from County Clare.  This was mainly due to the fact that at local level, in the county council, they were represented by councillors from Galway and in national affairs they were represented by Dáil Deputies from County Clare.  The boundaries were not coterminous with county boundaries for Dáil representation and consequently people in Galway showed very little inclination to vote in Dáil elections, despite the fact that there was always a good turn out at local elections.  For Deputy Fitzpatrick to say that breaching the boundaries does not mean a thing is nonsense. We could not get 25 per cent of the people to vote at Dáil elections.</P>

      <P>I am correcting the Deputy on matters of fact.  Deputy Ryan made the point that TDs should <Col N="153" /> not have to meet their constituents and that constituents should get their rights or their imagined rights without having to have recourse to their Deputy or county councillor.  In the next breath, he said that it was as easy in rural Ireland to contact a Deputy as it was in the city of Dublin.  Fine Gael speak with many voices but apparently they are not heard and these voices are becoming muted in parts of the country.  If he knew the extent of a five-seat constituency, which my constituency is, in rural Ireland, as compared with a three or four seat constituency in the City of Dublin, he would not make a statement like that. My constituency extends from the Mayo border to the Clare border, from north to south, a distance of about 70 miles, and from Tipperary and Offaly a distance of about 40 or 45 miles.  Surely nobody could say that a sixpenny bus ticket, which I am sure is all it would cost to visit Deputy Ryan, although from what he says I believe he does not encourage visitors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A statement of that kind will certainly not be believed in rural Ireland.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency and I had occasion to be there some time ago and I know what distances are involved there.  If we are to believe Deputy Ryan that it is easier to travel from Abbeyfeale, where Deputy Jones, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle lives, than to travel in Dublin South-West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick accused the Minister of spending four hours on the rural constituencies but I am now asking the Minister to spend four hours on the urban constituencies, to tell us and our constituents what exactly these changes will mean, what the issues are.  Despite what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, the whole country should know, rural and urban, what the effects of these amendments would mean to them.  I urge the Minister to discuss urban constituencies as he has done so thoroughly with the rural areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also mentioned the question of television and challenged a discussion on television about proportional representation and its proposed abolition.  I would indeed be happy to take up this challenge and I invite Deputy Fitzpatrick to measure up the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Dockrell with myself and Deputy Booth on television.  I can appreciate that it would be a little difficult for the respected Leader of the Opposition to take up this challenge because it is a well-known fact that he is against the retention of PR.  I do not know quite what Deputy Dockrell is against but I am sure we will find out all his views in the course of this debate. Until we do hear what his views are, I am assuming that he is <i>ad idem</i> with his leader.  So much for the television challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to my own constituency, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, it is a vast constituency and one which I respectfully submit requires five Deputies. At present it is impossible to look after the whole area.  From the point of view of most urban Deputies or rural Deputies, the splitting up of the various constituencies into manageable areas is the important thing.  As I said already, when I got up to speak it was to speak about this television challenge.  To date Fianna Fáil have not given their views on this matter. We have heard the whole argument from Fine Gael and the Labour Party and we must wait to go to the people in the autumn but if Deputy <Col N="155" /> Fitzpatrick would influence Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dockrell I am sure that I can speak on behalf of Deputy Booth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was at a time when we, in order to sort out the confusion of the Opposition, had put the Bills together again, having first separated them in order to avoid confusing the Opposition.  Now, in that debate on Second Reading, I instanced a number of occasions on which Deputies put down Parliamentary Questions to me asking when I intended to comply with the constitutional requirement to revise constituencies and, as I said on that occasion, the ink on the census return was hardly dry when my colleague Deputy Dunne apparently being aware of the fact that the constituency of County Dublin was no longer conforming to constitutional requirements, had a question down asking when I was going to <Col N="157" /> revise the constituencies to bring them within the requirements of the Constitution. On Second Reading, I instanced two more occasions on which Deputy Dunne had a similar question down and on at least one of these occasions, he pursued the matter by way of supplementary questions.</P>

      <P>And the Supreme Court ruled that the revision of constituencies made to conform with that High Court decision was within the terms of the Constitution, but Deputy Dunne was quick to notice that at the present time the ratio between the number of members to be elected for his constituency, and my constituency, and Deputy Burke's constituency, is not the same as for every other constituency &ldquo;as ascertained at the last preceding <Col N="158" /> census&rdquo; and, therefore, the present scheme of constituencies does not, in fact, comply with the Constitution. Now, whether or not that makes it necessary for the Government to revise the constituencies is, of course, something I do not know, but I do know that it is an incontrovertible fact that there are only 14 out of the present 38 constituencies which are within the constitutional provisions, as I have interpreted them, as laid down by the High Court, and I think I have interpreted them correctly.  I cannot see any other way in which they could be interpreted.</P>
      <P>I have here a copy of <i>Irish Reports</i>, 1961, and at the bottom of page 143 in <i>re O'Donovan v. the Attorney General</i>, there is the following statement:</P>
      <P>Another suggestion was to divide Galway into two constituencies, West Galway with three seats, and East Galway with five seats.  It was submitted that this could be done fairly simply by transferring the nine electoral divisions of Carmore, Claregalway, Annaghdown, Ballinduff, Donaghpatrick, Headford, Kilcoone, Killeany and Kilursa, with a joint population of 5,166 to West Galway and consolidating the remainder of the other two existing constituencies.  For clarity I set out the result:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Suggested constituency, West Galway, three seats, population 60,269, ratio of population 1 to 20,089; East Galway, five seats, population 95,284, ratio of population 1 to 19,057;</P>
      <P>That is, I think, 1,070 below the national average at the particular time. The learned judge went on to say:</P>
      <P>Both suggestions would constitute constituencies with a ratio of members to population reasonably close to the national average.  These illustrations show what is practicable in these instances and may be compared with what in fact has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reasonable person would, I think, interpret that as indicating that a deviation of approximately 1,000 above <Col N="159" /> or below the national average, which was in the region of 20,000, was permissible, and that is five per cent.</P>

      <P>The figure of 1,000 is not set down in any statement by the judge and it does not appear in any enactment.  The figure the Minister mentions of 1,000 is not set down anywhere.  It was the Minister himself who thought up that figure.</P>

      <P>I would not ask Deputy Murphy to do a sum of <Col N="160" /> division or subtraction but, if he gets someone to do it for him, he will find that the figure of 19,057 is 1,070 below the national average at that particular time.</P>
