      <P>I am aware that there is fairly heavy delay at times on calls through Ballina exchange, but normally there is little or no delay on calls through the other main exchanges in the county.  The number of trunk circuits serving Ballina is inadequate for the volume of traffic offering at peak periods and in addition the main route to Sligo is subject to frequent interruptions.  This situation will be rectified when the laying of a co-axial trunk cable from Athlone to Claremorris, Castlebar and Ballina, which is now in progress, is completed next year.  In the meantime, every effort will be made to maintain a satisfactory service on the existing circuits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the serious concern among dairy farmers at the increase in the milk levy by An Bord Bainne; and if he will take urgent steps to provide a special grant for An Bord Bainne before 1st July in order to keep the milk levy at its former level and thus avoid a reduction in the income of dairy farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the fact that An Bord Bainne have decided to raise the levy on milk supplied to creameries to 2d per gallon, he has any proposals to offset the effect of this increase on dairy farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Order increasing the rate of milk levy to 2d per gallon as from 1st July was made by An Bord Bainne in exercise of their functions under section 36 of the Dairy Produce Marketing Act, 1961.  I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Board have informed me that the increase was made to enable them to secure the additional revenue required to cover producers' share of losses on the export of dairy produce. These losses are expected to be considerably increased this year because of the greater quantity of milk being delivered to creameries and the sharp decline in the prices obtainable for dairy produce in foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of State assistance to dairy farmers is a matter for consideration by the Government in the light of the need determined for such assistance, the financial resources available and the legitimate claims of other interests. That the State has been mindful of the interests of dairy farmers and the dairying industry is clear from the fact that in the current year's Estimates a sum of £21 million is provided by way of Exchequer support for the creamery milk price, as compared with £19.3 million in 1967-68 and £3.2 million in 1962-63.  Indeed, with the likely <Col N="753" /> increase in milk deliveries to creameries this year, coupled with the prospect of lower prices for dairy produce in foreign markets, it is possible that State expenditure on milk support this year at existing rates could be a few million pounds higher than the Estimate provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that no increase was given in the Budget this year, despite the fact that for dairy farmers the cost of production has increased, and they are faced with increases in wages, in fertilisers and a higher cost of living, and due to the fact the levy has been increased by .625d, would the Minister not consider increasing the subsidy, and not place this extra burden on the dairy farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much I need add to what I have already said in reply to the two questions, other than to suggest that what the Deputy quotes as facts do not necessarily come out as such, and even if they did to some degree emerge as the Deputy suggests they will, there is, I think, the other aspect that the additional money that will be earned on existing prices this year will probably result in an overall take by the dairy farming community of a figure of not less than £7 million as against the take last year by the same group of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will admit that there is grave unrest in regard to the future of the dairying industry?  Would he not consider that he should increase this subsidy and try to stabilise the position of the people engaged in milk production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there is grave unrest in the dairying industry and I would like it to go from here that this is not the case, and that the future of the dairying industry today is as good as and better in so far as total value and worth of the industry is concerned, than at any other time in the history of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to admit that skim milk is being thrown down the drain in many areas <Col N="754" /> because dairy farmers are receiving 5d per gallon less for their skim milk due to the fact that there is no market for skim milk, which in turn is due to the fact that there was no planning over the past six or eight months or the past year?  Can the Minister do anything to alleviate that position?  While that position exists surely the Minister will have to admit that there is grave unrest and uncertainty as regards the future of the dairying industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is scarcely coming into this House to champion the views of people who would throw skim milk down the drain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;considering the fact that skim milk has been assessed as being worth anything from 4½d to 6½d in animal feeding value.  Surely that is not a line any responsible Deputy should take.  Furthermore, talking about planning, perhaps Fine Gael are somewhat confused in so far as their own outlook on planning for the dairying industry is concerned in that they may be having nightmares as to what they are to do with the skim milk on the 400-cow dairy farm in the future that they envisage for this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that we are not confused.  The Minister may misrepresent statements but we are certainly not confused.  We know where we stand.  We always stood by the dairying industry and will in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister is aware of the actual facts and realities of the situation, that an average of 50 per cent of the skim milk is being returned to the farmers, and that the average price in most areas is as low as 3d a gallon. In view of the fact that this means a substantial financial loss to the dairy farmers, would the Minister not consider that the imposition of an increased levy will lead to very serious problems?  In view of the importance of the dairying industry, would he consider the granting of an increased subsidy to tide Bord Bainne over this present difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>A new Garda station, with four Garda houses, is at present being built at Droichead Nua.  It is expected that the station will be ready for occupation in August and the houses in November.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the unsuitability of the Garda station at Newport and a site has been acquired for a new station.  As regards future policing arrangements at Newport, and also at Clane and Dungloe, the position is, as stated in my reply to a Parliamentary Question on 30th May, that I am having an examination in depth made in relation to the distribution of the Force throughout the country.  It has become apparent that the present distribution is uneven, having regard to population, incidence of crime and traffic problems.</P>
      <P>I want to see the police distributed properly in relation to their primary duty of preventing and detecting crime. It is inevitable that in any redistribution of manpower some rural stations will be closed or reduced.  Pending completion of the general examination, I cannot at this stage give a firm indication as to what the future arrangements will be at the centres mentioned by the Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not receive many requests for the concession suggested by the Deputy.  There are various difficulties in the way of the adoption of the course which he requests.  Payments of the pensions and allowances for which my Department is responsible have now been computerised, for reasons of economy as well as efficiency.  A computer system does not lend itself readily to exceptions. Furthermore, if a departure from the present system was made in individual cases, there would inevitably be pressure for a wider extension of the concession. My Department has more than 23,000 pensions and allowances on pay, so that staff costs would increase considerably as a result of a general change from monthly to weekly payments. In the circumstances, I regret that I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The earliest age at which most established civil servants may retire on grounds other than those of health and qualify for a superannuation award is 60.</P>
      <P>Pensions for civil servants are calculated at the rate of 1/80th of salary for each year of pensionable service subject to a maximum of 40/80ths. The lump sum is calculated at the rate of 1/30th of salary for each year of pensionable service subject to a maximum of 45/30ths.  Thus 45 years pensionable service is necessary to qualify for maximum superannuation award.  The age at which a civil servant would become eligible for maximum award depends on the date on which his pensionable service commences.</P>
      <P>For certain grades in the prison service and in the Central Mental Hospital, retirement with superannuation on grounds other than illhealth is permitted at age 55.  In these cases the 21st and each subsequent year of pensionable service reckons as two years for superannuation purposes so that a maximum award calculated on the same basis as for civil servants may be paid after 33 years actual service, subject to the officer being at least 55 years of age on date of retirement.</P>

      <P>The secondary teachers' superannuation scheme does not provide for the contribution of a fixed percentage to the secondary teachers pension fund from State sources.  The fund was established in 1929 under the scheme and State contributions amounting to a total of £21,349 have been made to the fund from time to time to help to meet liabilities.  An actuarial assessment has disclosed that an overall contribution of about 15 per cent would be necessary to meet secondary teachers' pensions and gratuities.  Hence the State's contribution is in the region of 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Minister for Labour that the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, confers entitlement to holidays with pay on workers employed under a contract of service or a contract of apprenticeship.  If the agents referred to are not now so employed, the provisions of the Act would not apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms and conditions of any employment are proper for negotiation between the employers and the employees concerned, and neither the Minister for Labour nor I have any statutory function in the matter.  In dealing with questions of the insurability of any employment, the officers <Col N="768" /> of my Department can only have regard to the facts as they find them.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 700 dentists registered with the Dental Board and it is assumed that the vast majority of these are actively engaged in the practice of dentistry in this country.  This gives a ratio of one dentist to every 4,100 of the population which, while not as good as one might wish, compares favourably with some other European countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scotland. In England and Wales the ratio of dentists to population is 1 to 3,900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our dental colleges produce about 60 new dental graduates each year but it has been the experience up to this that more than half of them emigrate to practice dentistry abroad, mainly in Britain.  My main concern is to ensure that adequate dental staff is available to provide treatment for those eligible for such treatment under the Health Acts.  As I indicated in a reply to Deputy Ryan on 6th February last I have improved the conditions attaching to dental posts in the health authority service.  A competition for <Col N="769" /> 40 such posts, under the improved conditions, is at present being held by the Local Appointments Commissioners and I am hopeful that the competition will be successful.</P>
    <P>The shortage of dental staff, particularly in so far as the service for children is concerned, will become a less pressing problem when the full benefits of fluoridated water supplies become available.</P>

There are several counties, particularly the county from which the Minister and I come, where there is a serious shortage of dentists and where it is not possible for people to have teeth extracted in time to save their health.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last week, I had demonstrated to the House the motives which prompted me to table this amendment and the <Col N="775" /> advantages which my amendment offered both to the Government and to the country.  I had shown that my amendment was not contrary to the primary purpose of the legislation.  I mentioned the main points of the Taoiseach's speech to demonstrate that his primary concern was the problem to which the multi-seat constituency gave rise.  I recalled that the Minister himself had said that he was mainly concerned to obtain the single-seat constituency and was less concerned as to the actual method of voting.  I did this to demonstrate that there was no departure in principle involved in accepting this amendment and that therefore there was no substantial reason why the Minister should refuse to accept it.</P>
      <P>I explained to the House that I personally was in complete agreement with the view that we should have single-seat constituencies and the straight vote, that I believed in the superiority of such an arrangement, that I believed this would remove much of the humbug and pretence and the futile competition among Deputies regarding matters of administration over which they have no real control or influence.  I pointed out that it would lead to greater parliamentary and administrative efficiency and to greater political stability as distinct from our present political stagnation.  It was my view that it would encourage a better type of candidate to enter public life and that as a result a two-Party system would eventually evolve, that it would bring new life and purpose to national politics by removing many of the mediocre personalities and forcing the Opposition to think constructively and to transform themselves from a collection of disgruntled Deputies into a coherent and forceful Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that and made my position clear, I then explained that I did not believe that at the moment the people would be prepared to accept the straight vote.  From my communication with persons in all walks of life and of all shades of political and non-political opinion, I believe that the public are unhappy about the way in <Col N="776" /> which our public affairs are conducted, that they are of the opinion that debate in this House is mere political manoeuvring, that it is futile and often insultingly insincere.</P>
    <P>I believe the majority of the people are anxious for constitutional and parliamentary reform, that the Members of this House should be imbued with a new sense of responsibility and a sense of purpose.  However, I do not believe that at the moment the electorate are prepared to accept the straight vote.  I believe they are prepared to go halfway in this reform and accept the single seat, but if the Government persist in trying to go the whole way and force the issue on both the single seat and the straight vote, defeat is inevitable for them.  Those who urge the Minister and the Government to continue this folly are those who, for their own reasons, would have the Government defeated.  Then all hope of reform in the foreseeable future would be lost.  Reform must come eventually, but it would be wiser to make this change now while the country is enjoying peace and prosperity and the people are calm and rational, rather than in the uncertain future when we may well have lost our political stability and the heat of our tempers may have replaced the light of our reason.  At a time like this we learn the wisdom of the proverb that prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <P>If this amendment of mine is rejected, then I believe the amendment to the Constitution will be defeated. Then the Minister and, indeed, the Government will have to explain to the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party at the next Ard Fheis why they rejected this amendment, why they refused to compromise, why they persisted in their headstrong policy and to what purpose.  I have reason to believe that there are some Members of the Government who would be prepared to listen to reason, and compromise, and those other Members who are not prepared to do so might well consider that they will be held responsible for the inevitable defeat of Fianna Fáil.  They might also consider that nobody is irreplaceable.  The <Col N="777" /> Minister himself well knows that there is no substitute for success, especially at the polls.</P>
    <P>Shakespeare has said that there is a tide in the affairs which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.  By ignoring the advice of their Leader and deciding to opt for the retention of PR, Fine Gael have lost their last chance of catching the political tide.  Under PR they can never hope to win an election on their own.  The most they can hope for is a coalition with the Labour Party, and that, I think, is a humiliating prospect.  Those who saw last week's &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme and heard the ex-vice-chairman of the Labour Party, Dr. Noel Browne, talk of the new extreme socialism and of the list of industries and firms which it was proposed to nationalise, of the complete absence of loyalty to Cabinet colleagues, and of the need to spring the trap on those same colleagues when the time was opportune, must wonder if Fine Gael are now bereft of all dignity and shame.  There are more honourable ways of committing suicide.</P>
    <P>During the remainder of this debate, I hope Deputy Cosgrave will avail of the opportunity of making known his views on PR.  If he now accepts the Fine Gael Party's view and believes in retaining PR, then he should say so loud and clear.  If, on the other hand, he has doubts, his silence in this regard is not reassuring.  But if he has doubts about PR, I do not think he should try to conceal these doubts and mislead the public by his silence.  After all, he is the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  He should not be as mute as a mouse but should speak out and lead his Party on this most critical issue; otherwise some tomcat masquerading as a tiger will eat him up.  This is being said more and more openly by the Fine Gael Party's national newspaper, by its political correspondent, and, indeed, by Fine Gael public representatives on television, not to mention the penetrating analysis of the situation by our old friend &ldquo;Backbencher&rdquo; last weekend.  Indeed, we would be sorry to see him replaced.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are the only Party that  hope to benefit by the retention of PR.  They will most probably hold the balance of power after the <Col N="778" /> next general election and in that position will be able to exert power out of all proportion to their strength.  The temptation to indulge in political blackmail will be very strong.  I will say no more than that.  If this highly unsatisfactory position comes about, then the Fine Gael Party must accept the blame for their present shortsighted refusal to accept a compromise.  Unless the Government change their minds and accept this amendment, I forecast that we will be condemned to political instability and ultimate chaos.  We might well reflect on the situation in France today&mdash;and also in Italy and Belgium&mdash;and unless we are prepared to put our house in order by reforming our Constitution so that elections can produce a strong stable Government, which can govern effectively, and a viable Opposition, then the tragedy of France today may well be ours tomorrow. It is for this reason that I move this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that, as I have already said, the most important thing in this proposal is to get rid of the present system of multi-member constituencies with all its disadvantages, with all the evils inherent in it, the dangers that are inherent in the present system, dangers in regard to stability of government and, indeed, in regard to the prospects of forming a government at all, and to substitute for that system a system of single-seat constituencies thereby gaining for the people substantial advantages both from the point of view of their adequate representation in the House and of having a more efficient legislature, thereby also, eliminating the undesirable effects of multi-member constituencies on the morale of the people and also on the morale of political Parties and establishing circumstances in which the people will have a better opportunity of choosing their Government, of having the benefit of stable and coherent government, and being able in the next election to hold the Government responsible for their actions.  The proposal that we have before the House in this Bill is to do something more than that as well. <Col N="779" /> One of the principal things that this proposal will do is that it will establish for the first time here equal treatment of all in regard to the exercise of the franchise.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes, first of all, to obtain for the people the advantages of single-member constituencies and, secondly, to establish for the first time here the principle of one man one vote by abolishing the present discriminatory system which confers a multiple-voting power on some of our citizens, the extent of the multiple voting being in inverse proportion to the responsibility of the views of the individuals selected for this favoured treatment, that is assuming that the degree of responsibility is measured by the volume of support for these particular views which exist in the particular constituency. I think that is the fundamental concept of democracy.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, Deputy Norton has made the case that the obtaining of the advantages of single-member constituencies and getting rid of the disadvantages of multi-member constituencies is so important that other wrong things may be accepted.  This may be so but it has not been shown that we are any less likely to get the advantages of single-member constituencies without imposing these other undesirable features on the public.  Subsection (1) of Parts I and II which we have passed is the subsection which gets rid of the disadvantages of multi-member constituencies and obtains for the people the substantial advantages of single-member constituencies. As I say, I agree that this is the most important part of the proposal from the point of view of the public as a whole.  The subsection to which this amendment is proposed, (subsection 2), gets rid of the discrimination which is inherent in the present system, which discriminates in an arbitrary, completely unjustified, unfair and undemocratic way between voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton's amendment, in fact, proposes to retain this unjustified and unfair system of voting in the context of single-member constituencies. The theory of the system, if it can even be dignified by describing it as a <Col N="780" /> theory, cannot be justified in multi-member constituencies.  The only possible justification is that it is an artificial way of arranging representation for minorities.  The basis on which this is done is the absurd one of equating a preference vote of any order with an actual vote for a candidate, this, of course, being done in the case of some individuals only.  For people who see something desirable in this fragmentation of the people's representation, who see something desirable in the people considering narrow sectional interests rather than those of the community as a whole, it has at least got that amount of justification, that it does make this fragmentation possible. But there is even less justification for this system of voting in single-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, Deputy Norton believes that the system which we propose, the straight vote is in fact the best.  The only possible argument&mdash;and I think that it would be fair to say the only argument&mdash;that Deputy Norton advanced in favour of this amendment is the suggestion of expediency but, in fact, no evidence has been produced to show that it would be more expedient to adopt it.  Deputy Norton says that he believes the people are not ready to accept our proposal.  This is merely his own opinion; it is an opinion that cannot be substantiated.  There is only one way of finding out and that is by letting the people vote.</P>

They know that we have succeeded over the years in making our case known and getting it accepted against this same propaganda and this same paper wall.  As this debate continues they see how effective the arguments are for the proposed change and it is obvious the Opposition Parties are in dread of these arguments being made known to the people.  As each day passes they see more and more clearly the prospect of the people becoming aware of the arguments in favour of the proposals we are making.</P>

      <P>The Opposition's only hope is to create sufficient confusion in the public mind to prevent the public knowing the full facts.  On the other hand, we believe we can make these things known to the people.  We believe the people will see the advantages that will accrue to the country as a result of what we propose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposed electoral reform will, in fact, be effected by the people.  I suggest Deputy Norton has done no more than express his opinion.  He has not shown that the people will not accept what we are asking them to accept.  In fact, there does not seem to be any way of discovering this except by means of the referendum. Neither has Deputy Norton shown that <Col N="782" /> the acceptance of his amendment, which involves the retention of discrimination in regard to voting power with even less justification than in present circumstances, will in any way lessen the opposition to the fundamental change from multi-member constituencies to single-member constituencies. I confess I do not see any way in which he could show this and it appears to me, therefore, that there has been no substantial reason advanced as to why this proposed amendment should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton admits that the system we propose is more desirable, but he believes that the system he proposes would be more expedient, though he has failed to establish his argument in that regard.  I said on the Second Reading debate that since neither our own Ard Fheis nor the Committee on the Constitution nor any other body recommended any other system of voting in single-member constituencies, we naturally put forward what we considered to be the best and only justifiable system.  Since this alternative system has been proposed, even if it is only on the basis of expediency, it is necessary, I think, to show just how unjustifiable is this ridiculous system of considering some people's preferences to the nth degree as votes for different candidates while ignoring all but the first preference votes of others.  There is no way of dealing equitably and democratically with all voters other than the way we propose.</P>
    <P>The transferable vote, fraudulently and cynically misnamed the single transferable vote, since so far from being a single vote it is essentially a system of discriminatory multiple voting, discriminates arbitrarily between voters.  I go further; I say that the basis on which this discrimination is exercised is opposed to the fundamental concept of democracy.  The whole theory of democracy is based on the principle that the majority is right.  It assumes that all the people over a certain age are qualified to vote, that their votes are entitled to equal consideration and the views of the majority should prevail.  If that is so, and if the majority view is the correct democratic view, then it follows surely that <Col N="783" /> the views of the smallest minority are least worthy of consideration.  As I said, the fundamental point is that all views be given the same consideration but, even if the proposition that there should be differential voting for some were to be accepted, surely it would be to the largest group that this differential voting should be accorded rather than to the smallest group.</P>
    <P>The transferable vote works in the exact opposite way.  It is devised to arrange the maximum possible consideration of the views of the smallest minority down to the point of treating an expression of opinion that a particular candidate is the second worst of the total number on offer as equivalent to the majority opinion that a particular candidate is the best while, at the same time, arranging that the minimum amount of consideration will be accorded to the views of those who find a reasonable number of their fellow-constituents to agree with their views.  The system arranges that in a close result the decision as to who is to represent the constituency and therefore ultimately what Party is to form the Government of the country will be made, not as is inherent in democracy, by the majority, but by the smallest minority group in the constituency.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that this proposition for the retention of the present system of multiple voting for those who are most out of tune with the majority view needs some explanation.  Under the system of the transferable vote, the number of votes given to the individual voter is, in general, proportional to the smallness of the number of voters who share the voter's particular view.  In other words, the more out of tune a voter is with a political view shared with a reasonable number of the electorate, the greater the number of actual votes that are given to him, that is to say, that the smaller the number of people who share a person's view the more votes he gets and these are all treated as full votes, the same as the single vote of the majority group.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to give one vote to some people and an indefinite number to others, the total number given being <Col N="784" /> controlled only by the number of candidates in the field, but it is worse to give the multiple votes to those who can find the least to agree with them and can therefore be described in the immortal words of Deputy Dillon as &ldquo;cranks and crackpots&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, the transferable vote system is a fraud.  It purports to establish that there is a majority in favour of one candidate after the people in the ballot box have said that there is not.  The transferable vote system manipulates votes after they have been cast, in accordance with a set of illogical, inconsistent and unjustifiable rules and, as a result, allocates votes that were cast for a number of different candidates eventually to two of the candidates and the absurd claim is then made that this post-election manipulation of the people's votes establishes that an absolute majority favour whichever candidate winds up with a majority, consisting of votes that were cast for himself and a number of votes that were cast for other people but which were allocated to him by virtue of the machinations of the returning officer and his staff.</P>
    <P>This is nonsense.  It is a fraudulent claim even if you accept the basis of the absurd principle of all these preference votes being of equal value to actual votes and it can only be arrived at as a result of the most blatant and undemocratic discrimination between voters.  What is claimed as the &ldquo;result&rdquo; arrived at in this way can be easily proved to be unsustainable if the principle of equal treatment for all voters is conceded, that is, if it is agreed that the principle of one man one vote is a proper principle to adhere to.  Both on Second Reading a couple of weeks ago and in the debate in 1959 I gave an example which showed that this is so, which showed that this system does not do what it claims to do, even on the basis of this ridiculous assumption of equating preference votes of any degree to actual votes, and this has not been controverted nor has any attempt been made to controvert it because it clearly shows the fraudulence of the claims <Col N="785" /> made and the absurdity of the whole basis of the system.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to give an example again although I fully appreciate that, once again, the answer will be silence.  I quoted an example of three candidates contesting a single-member constituency or contesting a by-election under the present circumstances or contesting the concluding stages of the count in a multi-member constituency.  One candidate, candidate A, has 4,000 votes; candidate B has 3,500 votes and candidate C has 3,000 votes.  The operation of this system of transferable votes is to take the 3,000 votes cast for the candidate who is in the smallest minority&mdash;candidate C&mdash;and distribute them among the other two remaining candidates on the basis of equating second preference, or whatever other preferences there may be, to actual votes and this could result in 1,000 of these being allocated to candidate A, giving him 5,000, and 3,000 to candidate B, giving him 5,500 votes.</P>
    <P>The proponents of this so-called theory of the transferable vote say that this is grand; that it has now been established that a majority of the people in that constituency want candidate B to be elected.  That is a ridiculous claim.  It is obviously not true because no such thing has, in fact, been established.  What has happened is that of the 10,500 people here, 3,000 of them who voted for candidate C have been given two votes and those who voted for the other candidate have been given one vote only.  For what reason?  How were they selected for this favoured treatment?  Just because they failed to elect their candidate? But, now, as a result of giving this smallest group this specially favoured treatment, we arrive at a situation where the major group in the constituency have also failed to elect their candidate.  Why should the 4,000 who voted for candidate A not get the same consideration allocated to their views, not get the same voting power as the 3,000 who voted for candidate C?</P>
    <P>What I should like some member of the Opposition Parties who want to retain this system to explain is, how do people disqualify themselves from getting <Col N="786" /> the same treatment with regard to their votes merely because of the fact that they find more people to agree with their views than do these other people who found themselves in the smallest minority?  I say that there is no reason whatever why the 4,000 who have been put in the position of voting for a candidate who is not successful should not get the same treatment as the 3,000 who voted for candidate C in this instance, and it is obvious that if we decide to treat all these voters equally, as is inherent in the principle of one man one vote, the 4,000 votes distributed in the same way, on the same basis as the 3,000 were, could go, 1,500 to candidate B, giving him 5,000, and 2,500 to candidate C, giving him 5,500, and now as a result of giving the 4,000 the same treatment as the 3,000, we have the result of establishing that a majority in the constituency are in favour of candidate B and candidate C.  It might be said that what has been established is that more people wanted B than A and more people wanted C than B and that therefore the second result would be the proper one.  But this has not been established either, because we now have the position where the 3,500 who voted for candidate B have been treated in a discriminatory way and they have not had the same consideration accorded to their views as was given to the views of the other voters.  I submit there is no way in which they either have disqualified themselves or have proved themselves to deserve to be treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is obviously possible if those votes were distributed they could give us yet another result&mdash;that 1,500 could be allocated to A and the remaining 2,000 to C, giving us yet another result of 5,500 in favour of A and 5,000 in favour of C.  So that it is quite possible that if every voter were treated the same, we would arrive at the conclusion that there is a majority in the constituency in favour of each of the three candidates.  That, of course, is nonsense.  But you get a nonsensical result because the whole operation is based on the nonsensical assumption that a preference vote, no <Col N="787" /> matter how low the preference it indicates, is the same thing and is worthy of the same treatment as a No. 1 vote.</P>
    <P>This is the basic fallacy involved in the system.  It may be said the first result would be the result if there were only two candidates, A and B, in the constituency and that the second would be the position if there were only B and C and the third if there were only A and C.  But in fact that was not the position.  There were three candidates in the constituency.  Each was entitled to stand.  People were asked to choose between them and they did and this is a system of trying to disprove what the people said in the ballot boxes.  The result showed that there was not an absolute majority in favour of any of the three and it is futile to try to establish that there was.</P>
    <P>I claim it is a fundamental thing that all voters should be treated the same, that the principle should be: one man, one vote.  Everybody gets one vote.  If some people are to get two votes, everybody should get two.  If some are to get three, everybody should get three.  If all are treated in the same way on the basis of this nonsensical assumption of the nth preference vote being equivalent to a No. 1 vote, we are likely to get a nonsensical result.  There is only the one way of treating everybody's vote the same, that is, count the votes and accept the result as the people expressed it.</P>
    <P>It might be suggested that everybody should get equal treatment by allocating a notional value to preference votes, totalling these up for every candidate and allocating the seat to the highest scorer.  Any such national value would of course be purely arbitrary and the people would soon see that the most effective way of supporting their candidate would be just to vote for that candidate and for that candidate only. It is quite clear the only feasible and democratic thing to do at an election is to ask the people to indicate the candidate and policy they prefer and to count the votes.  It is certainly the only equitable way of choosing between a number of candidates.  Numbers 2, 3, 4, and second last preferences all mean <Col N="788" /> different things.  In fact, they mean different things to different people.  I do not know whether the Deputies opposite would like to maintain that a No. 1 vote for Fine Gael and a No. 2 vote for Labour means &ldquo;I believe in private enterprise&rdquo; and &ldquo;I also advocate the taking over of Guinness's, Jacob's, Pierce's of Wexford and Waterford Glass&rdquo;, as the vice-chairman of the Labour Party recently announced on television as Labour Party policy.</P>
    <P>In the example I have quoted, all we know is that 4,000 people voted for A, 3,500 for B and 3,000 for C.  It is not possible to establish that the position is different from that.  If there is an absolute majority in favour of one in a constituency, the people will say so as they did in West Limerick and Clare.  If the people have already said there is not an absolute majority, there is no way of establishing that there is.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about by-elections, and as the winners of six out of seven by-elections this is a subject naturally very dear to our hearts.  I admit I would like to go into them all in detail.  There is a certain satisfaction in contemplating pleasant things, such as six victories out of seven.  But although by-elections under the present system have particular relevance to the proposal of the transferable vote in single-member constituencies I do not propose to discuss the whole seven.</P>
    <P>There has been particular reference by the Opposition Parties to the Wicklow and East Limerick by-elections, which are two out of the three which have been contested since the re-crystallisation of the Coalition brought about by our proposal to amend the Constitution in regard to the electoral system.  This appears to have had one good effect already in exposing the continued existence of the Coalition and bringing it into the open inasmuch as these by-elections since then have consisted of a full-scale Coalition effort to direct the voters on how to transfer their votes.  One of these all-out Coalition campaigns resulted in a seat for Fianna Fáil, despite the combined efforts of the Party machines of the two Opposition Parties, while the other produced the <Col N="789" /> one swallow that makes the Opposition's summer.  The result of these by-elections and the manipulations of the people's votes in the elections on these two occasions in themselves showed the absurdities, the discrimination and indeed the blatant fraud of the transferable vote system.</P>
    <P>In order to demonstrate that and to demonstrate the lack of justification for this whole theory of the transferring of votes, I would like to consider the Wicklow by-election results first.  As Deputies know, in this constituency the Coalition strategy was a five against one line-up.  The result of the first count was that a Sinn Féin candidate received 2,009 votes, a Labour candidate 5,761, a Liberal candidate 509, a Fianna Fáil candidate 9,788, an Independent 191 and a Fine Gael candidate 8,035.  The result of the application of the transferable vote rules was that the candidate who was supported by 8,035 of the voters was deemed to be elected, and &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; is the right word as he certainly was not elected by the people.  There were 8,035 of the voters who voted for this candidate who was &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected and there were 18,258 who voted for candidates who were not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected.  Of those 18,258, 8,470 had their preference votes treated as No. 1's. There is no way of knowing how many second preferences were treated as No. 1's or how many third, fourth or fifth but, in fact, we do know that some people had all these preferences in turn being treated as actual votes for candidates other than the candidates for whom the voters actually voted&mdash; 8,470 of the 18,258 who voted for candidates who were not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected.</P>
    <P>The 9,788 who found most people in the constituency to agree with their views did not get this consideration. What I want somebody to explain to me is why were they deemed as having disqualified themselves from getting the same treatment, the same consideration paid to their views, as, for instance, the 191 who voted for the Independent candidate and all those others who voted for other candidates who were not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected? What in fact, distinguished the <Col N="790" /> 9,788 from the 8,470 who were given the special consideration?  The only thing that distinguished them was that they found more people to agree with their views in the constituency than any of those other 8,470.  They obviously should get the same treatment.  If we are to pay any attention whatever to the principles of democracy, it is, if anything these people's views who are most entitled to consideration.  Why were some of these 191, for instance, given two votes, some given three votes, some given four votes and some actually given five votes while some of the 509 who voted for the Liberal candidate were given two, three and some four.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the 2,009 who voted for the Sinn Féin candidate and the 5,761 who voted for the Labour candidate.  The last group only got two votes but we do not know how many of these votes which were allocated to other candidates were second, third or fourth or fifth preferences.  I maintain that there is no reason why the 9,788 should be treated as second-class citizens and should be given only one vote as against multiple votes given to the other smaller groups.  I maintain they did not demonstrate themselves in any way as being less entitled to consideration than anybody else in the constituency, and the only thing that marked them out was that they had views that were acceptable to more of their fellow citizens than any of these other groups.</P>
    <P>The result of this practice of discrimination in accordance with arbitrary and undemocratic rules was that the candidate who came second in the actual voting was &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected and this came about on the basis of treating a total of 4,561 preference votes, including an unknown number of fifth, fourth, third and second preference votes, as actual votes for this candidate whom they were not cast for.  The theory is that failure to elect a candidate requires the voters' preferences to be taken into account but this result shows how these arbitrary rules discriminate against the majority group.  It was not possible within this system to arrange that the candidate who got 191 votes or the <Col N="791" /> candidate who got 509 or 2,009 or 5,761 votes would be elected.</P>
    <P>After going through five operations, however, it was found possible to arrange for the defeat of the candidate who got the biggest number of voters to support him&mdash;9,788.  I would say that even having arrived at that stage there was still, even based on the theory of this system, a democratic requirement to arrange that these people who voted for the candidate getting the major support in the constituency should have the same consideration paid to their votes as was paid to others whose selected candidates were &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; not to be elected.  After all, some of these other voters had five, some had four, some had three and some had two votes.  The least the majority group should expect is that they would be given a second chance at least.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the people who are trying to hang on to this theory to explain what sin against democracy these voters committed.  The discrimination was not only against this majority group but also even against the supporters of the minority groups who were so misguided that even on their second or third attempt they chose the same candidate as the majority.  For example, of the 191 who voted for the candidate getting the smallest support, those who chose as their second candidate the man who got 509 votes, got another vote, and if their third choice went to the third last candidate, they got another and if their fourth choice went to the fourth last candidate placed they got a fifth vote. If at any stage in this manipulation of the voting any of these people transferred their vote to the candidate getting the majority of votes in the constituency they were disqualified from further consideration the same as those who supported this candidate in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The system is based on the peculiar assumption that the major consideration in down-grading the voting power of an individual is to be in agreement with a substantial number of his fellow citizens.  We disagree with this.  We maintain that it is implicit in democracy <Col N="792" /> that every voter should get the same treatment and that it is unjust and undemocratic&mdash;if these terms are not synonymous&mdash;to refuse the same consideration to the 9,788 as was given to the 8,470 since both of these groups had under the system voted for candidates other than the one who was eventually &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected. Fair play could only be given by going back to the position that existed after the fourth count in this particular election.  At that stage the position was that the Labour candidate had &ldquo;credited&rdquo; to him 6,797 votes, the Fianna Fáil candidate 10,343 votes, and the Fine Gael candidate 8,728 votes.  In other words, 1,036 votes cast for other candidates had been given to the Labour candidate, 639 to the Fine Gael candidate and 555 to the Fianna Fáil candidate.  It is quite obvious that if the votes were dealt with in a non-discriminatory manner, the 10,343 which were at this stage &ldquo;credited&rdquo; to the Fianna Fáil candidate could have and almost certainly would have put the Labour candidate above the Fine Gael candidate.  Therefore it is clear that if the votes were dealt with in a non-discriminatory way it would have been established there was a majority for at least two of the candidates.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, of course, the votes which were now credited to the Fine Gael candidate would be entitled to the same treatment and that might well have resulted in the same situation as that created in East Limerick. It is absolutely certain that if in the case of the Wicklow by-election, the application even of this principle of the transferable vote, which equates preference votes to acutal votes were applied in a non-discriminatory way and a fair way, it would have shown a majority for at least two and possibly three of the candidates and this, as I have said, is of course absurd and it arises because the original assumption is an absurd one.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the only thing known about the wishes of the Wicklow voters is what they themselves said in the ballot boxes&mdash;that 1,753 more of them were in favour of the Fianna Fáil candidate than of any of the others.  Similarly in relation to East Limerick, <Col N="793" /> where, despite all the efforts of the Coalition leaders and the canvassers, the voters refused to do as they were instructed to do by the Fine Gael and Labour schemers, and this discriminatory and unfair transferable vote system failed to encompass the defeat of the Fianna Fáil candidate and thereby circumvent the will of the people.</P>
    <P>In East Limerick there were 6,487&mdash; almost 6½ thousand&mdash;more voters who wanted the Fianna Fáil candidate elected, and despite the loaded counting system it was not possible to change the result.  Here again there is evidence of the discrimination that is involved in this system of the transferable vote.  There were 21,399 voters who did not vote for the successful candidate and of these 11,248 got a second vote, some of them got a third vote and 10,151 got one vote only. Again I ask the Opposition to tell me why this was done, why had these 10,151 not got as much right to a second chance as those to whom the second chance was given?  I draw attention again to the pattern&mdash;the biggest group in the constituency getting one vote, the next biggest getting two votes and the smallest getting three votes.</P>
    <P>In fact, since that by-election the Labour Party have been stoutly maintaining that their coalition effort was better and more effective than Fine Gael's, that their canvassing for their Coalition partners was more effective. We do not know, of course.  We do know they made an all-out effort, which makes a mockery of their reply to the recent Fine Gael pleas to form a Coalition openly.  Now, we say they should have the same rights and that it is unfair that merely because there were 112 more people supporting the Labour candidate than the Fine Gael candidate, that those voters should get one vote only whereas Fine Gael supporters got two votes.</P>
    <P>Here again, in East Limerick, the only thing known from the result is that there were almost 6½ thousand more voters who wanted the Fianna Fáil candidate elected than any other and there is no way of establishing that that is not the position.  I am satisfied <Col N="794" /> beyond all doubt, then, that there is no possible justification for the transferable vote system and that this is particularly so in regard to single-member constituencies.  I am also satisfied that there is no other justifiable system of voting but the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>Against this, Deputy Norton suggests that there is a poor chance of the admitted advantages of the single-member constituency being obtained with the straight vote incorporated in the proposal, and that the adoption of this discriminatory system of the transferable vote would make it more certain that this important electoral reform would be obtained.  I suggest that in view of the overwhelming case against the transferable vote it is necessary for him to show even that expediency does in fact demand the adoption of this system of voting, and I do not think he can do this.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I have confidence in the people of the country doing the sensible thing providing we succeed in putting the arguments before them, and with the assistance of the knowledge that a substantial percentage of the Opposition Parties appreciate that what we are doing is what is required in the interests of the people of the country, we expect to be able to put the arguments before the people.</P>
    <P>It is quite true as Deputy Norton says that this proposal was defeated narrowly some nine years ago, but the people have had more experience of the system since.  They have seen the discreditable and disedifying long counts in two constituencies in the last General Election.  They have seen the fact that each count could produce a different result and it has been demonstrated to them that in a tight situation it is purely a matter of chance which bundle of votes is selected for further distribution and that even on the basis of the theory of the system there is no finality with regard to the result.</P>
    <P>As well, as Deputy Norton said himself, there are a substantial number of new voters who will be voting on this occasion who have not had the opportunity of ridding themselves of the present unsuitable system.  I am satisfied <Col N="795" /> the Opposition Parties cannot counter the arguments against the transferable vote.  They cannot show any reason why one voter should be discriminated against in this way. Their attitude here, as in other things, is opposition because this proposal has been put forward by Fianna Fáil. It is an attitude based, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has admitted, on suspicion, on their inherent dread of Fianna Fáil, rather than on a reasoned case.</P>
    <P>What we propose here is the best system and we can see no reason to abandon it.  I fully agree that the main objective is to get rid of all the disadvantages of the multi-member constituency and to obtain the advantages of the single member constituency.  I have shown that the system of the transferable vote is unjustifiable but in so far as we in Fianna Fáil are concerned, we have no reason to be afraid of this system of voting or any other system of voting.  We have confidence in the people and the Wicklow and East Limerick by-elections obviously represent the maximum Coalition effort and we obviously have nothing to fear from the all-out efforts of the Fine Gael and Labour Party leaders to direct the people who support their policies to transfer their votes in accordance with the wishes of the Party leaders.  I am satisfied that even those who are misguided enough to vote for the other Parties cannot in fact be directed to dispose of their votes in any particular way.  We are quite confident of our future in any circumstances, whether it is in the present circumstances or not, and it is not for any reason connected with the maintenance of Fianna Fáil as either the majority Party or as the Government that these proposals are being made, but in order to obtain for the country the benefits of a more rational system of election and representation and to obtain the benefits of better representation and a better Parliament for the people.  It is for that reason that these proposals are put forward.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have no reason to fear any particular system of counting the votes, or indeed of manipulating the votes after they have been <Col N="796" /> cast and counted, but there is no justification for the transferable vote.  We believe that the people will accept the proposition we are putting to them. The only argument I can see that was put forward in favour of Deputy Norton's amendment is his personal belief that to accept this system of voting would make it more likely that the main advantage to the country of single-member constituencies would be obtained.  I think that has not been demonstrated and that there is no reason to believe that the people who concede the advantages of single-member constituencies would desire to retain the present system of voting, which discriminates in a completely unjustifiable way in giving multiple votes to certain members of the community and only single votes to others.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to have a detailed discussion on anything that has been discussed before but I think if I were to accept the amendment now before the House I would be accepting the single-seat constituencies in which proportional representation cannot work. That is the point I am making and that is the point I want to make clearly. That is the reason and the grounds on which I oppose this amendment.  I oppose it because as I say the system we have now has worked fairly and adequately down the years.  The other arguments put forward by the Minister in dealing with Deputy Norton's amendment can be more properly dealt with by me on the section when this amendment is being discussed.  I propose to deal with them then.  Suffice it for me to say that on the grounds I have given we in this Party are against this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>My first criticism of this amendment is that the words &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo; are included in it.  Like other speakers, I am not so greatly concerned about the actual form of election as with the size of the constituencies and the number of Deputies who represent them.  I have always felt that there is a contradiction in referring to the transferable vote in the single-member constituency as having anything to do with proportional representation. You cannot have a proportion of a single member.  A single member can represent only one Party, or himself, if he is an Independent.  On that ground initially, I feel that this amendment is badly phrased.  If we were to accept it in its present form, we could justifiably be accused of trying to mislead the electorate into believing we are retaining PR while, in fact, we are not doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would feel very much happier with the straight vote, the relative majority vote, because this is the system used in every other form of election we have in our society today.  No other body of people goes to such lengths to calculate surplus and transferable votes, to calculate quotas, and so on.  It is a complete illusion.  The whole illusion springs <Col N="803" /> from the general thinking which was regarded as being very liberal in the earlier years of this century and the later years of the previous one.  People felt very deeply that there was something to be said for a proportional system.  Subsequent history has shown that this theory, however excellent as a theory, completely disregarded the basic facts of human nature and human behaviour.</P>
    <P>There was one point which I was surprised the Minister did not refer to, that is, that so long as you retain the transferable vote, you put undue value on the order of names on the ballot paper.  Alphabetical order gives a very unfair but a very real advantage to those whose names begin with the earlier letters of the alphabet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That point has not escaped me.  I did not have to change my name.  There was one man, I understand, with the name of Walsh who was unable to secure election but who was very much more successful under the name of Breathnach.  The real trouble is that when we are reading documents, we read them from the top to the bottom, and not from the bottom to the top&mdash;nor do we start in the middle.</P>
      <P>I had personal experience of that in the election of 1957 when my name was second on the ballot paper.  The first name on the ballot paper was that of Mr. Begley, who was a Clann na Poblachta candidate.  They were viciously opposed to us, as we were to them.  Certainly there was no love lost between us.  The electorate displayed no enthusiasm for Mr. Begley and consequently he was the first man eliminated. Mr. Brady and I divided the great proportion of Mr. Begley's votes between us and I was promptly elected on the transfer of Clann na Poblachta votes which I am absolutely positive no one intended I should ever get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was devoutly thankful. <Col N="804" /> I had nearly enough on the first count and that brought me over the quota.  No one can say that was a reasonable result of the count.  I do not honestly believe that the voters who gave me or Mr. Brady their second preference votes did so deliberately out of love for us and our bright blue eyes. They were going down the ballot paper. They gave their No. 1 to the person they wanted and then said: &ldquo;To hell, 2, 5, 4, 5&rdquo; and went straight down the ballot paper.  I know that was irresponsible from the point of view of Clann na Poblachta and most regrettable, but we have to face the facts of human behaviour.  People will not pay attention to their subsequent votes.  They vote No. 1.  If there is a Party ticket, they may vote 1 and 2, or 1, 2 and 3, and then they throw their numbers around quite irresponsibly.</P>
      <P>One has only to look at how the average person reacts to filling out a form.  We have all had experience of this.  People bring in forms and say: &ldquo;Please will you help me to fill it in? How do I start?&rdquo;  You say: &ldquo;At the top of the form you see the word `name'.  Put your name there.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;Do I put my surname or my Christian name first?&rdquo;  You say that it probably does not matter so long as they make it perfectly clear.  You then tell them that in the next line they see the word &ldquo;address&rdquo; and you tell them to fill in their address.  You have to nurse people through perfectly ordinary forms.  I am perfectly sure everyone of us has done it.  The average person's mind seems to become a complete blank when faced with forms to fill in. If you ask them to do it in a hurry, they make a thundering mess of it.  On that ground alone, I cannot display any enthusiasm for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of undue preference is still given to alphabetical order.  It has been suggested in certain cases that the order on the ballot paper should be selected by lot.  This would bring in the element of chance.  There is a certain attraction to our nature about this element of chance.  I do not think it is reasonable.  The only way to get over the question of the order of the names on the ballot paper is to say that you <Col N="805" /> will have the relative majority vote, the straight vote, that each voter will have one vote&mdash;one man, one vote&mdash; that he goes down the ballot paper and sees the man he wants and puts a cross or a 1&mdash;the actual method of marking the paper can probably be fixed up when it comes to an election. He has only one name to select and the order on the ballot paper is then entirely irrelevant.  On that ground I would be delighted to see an end to the transferable vote.</P>
    <P>So far as a difference in the overall result is concerned, I cannot see that there would be any great difference at all.  It is just possible that the swing of public opinion would not be shown so vividly if we retained the single transferable vote as if we were to adopt the straight vote.  That difference would be marginal only.  The whole thing would be so different if we were looking back on a number of by-elections where the Government Party had been unsuccessful, these people would undoubtedly say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil are trying to rig the system to make sure they will get in the next time&rdquo;&mdash;actually, they say that, anyway.  Nobody can deny that proportional representation has served Fianna Fáil remarkably well.  Even after the last referendum, when our proposal was not accepted, we still went on, under proportional representation, and won the next and subsequent general elections.  The by-election results show that, as a Party, we have nothing to fear from the single transferable vote in the single-member constituency.</P>
    <P>I do think that our people generally rather like this element of chance in elections.  They tend to regard elections rather like racing and other sports where there is a large element of chance.  There is a sort of sporting element about an election.  You can see the favourite perhaps being overtaken, and all that, and there is tremendous excitement as the counts go on.  I think there are some people who feel they would hate to see an end to that.  They rather like this swinging of the electoral pendulum as a count proceeds.  I cannot see any value in it.  I think it only confuses the whole issue.  There again, I would hope we could get some <Col N="806" /> indication from someone, preferably Deputy Norton, I suppose, as to whether he knows of any firm grounds on which people would honestly prefer to have this single transferable vote retained.  My researches so far have been rewarded by a reception of complete apathy.  To my mind, I am appalled by this because I believe it is an extraordinarily important issue.</P>
    <P>My mind goes back to 1959 when there was a real fight on and when meetings were being held all over the country, night after night, debates on the radio&mdash;television was not in operation&mdash;and tremendous activity and tremendous life about the whole campaign.  I am rather alarmed because there is so little life this time. I do not know if it is because of the division of opinion, particularly within Fine Gael, but I can see no enthusiasm one way or another amongst ordinary members of the public.  Certainly, so far as the ultimate result of a general election with single-member constituencies is concerned, I do not believe there will be any noticeable difference whether the voting is by single transferable vote or by the relative majority vote, or a straight vote, as we normally call it.</P>
    <P>I do know that quite a number of people seem to like this business of putting in preferences but, at the same time, an enormous number of people do not.  The result in Limerick, where 20 per cent of the Fine Gael votes were &ldquo;plumpers&rdquo; is something which needs some explanation.  How many of the Labour votes were &ldquo;plumpers&rdquo; we shall never know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that, to all intents and purposes, 20 per cent of the Fine Gael votes were &ldquo;plumpers&rdquo;.  If that was the result, after all the propaganda against Fianna Fáil, all the effort to keep Fianna Fáil out at all costs, I cannot believe that the Labour supporters were any more prepared to use their preference votes than Fine Gael were.  Of course, if there are blanks on the paper people will tend to fill them in.  I still have got no explanation from anybody as to why there should be this very high proportion of non-transferable Fine Gael votes.</P>
      <P>One of the points always made in favour of the single transferable vote is that if you do not have it you will have wasted votes, people will have cast their votes and wasted them.  That, to my mind, is just about as reasonable as saying: &ldquo;If you go out to play a match and you lose, you have wasted your time; you might just as well never have played at all.&rdquo;  That is not a fact and nobody would ever have believed it for a moment.  An election is a serious operation.  People cast their votes for one Party or another, one individual or another.  Every vote is valuable, whether or not it gets the desired result.  I do not accept for a moment this idea that you have to go around with the transferring of second, third, fourth and fifth preferences in order to prevent the wasting of votes. A vote is never wasted so long as it is cast.  It is an indication of the will of the man who cast it and, as such, it has a value.  It is wasted only if it is not cast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, we are discussing an amendment to a Bill which, of course, is unusual in itself.  Normally speaking, we are dealing with legislation but this Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not, in itself, legislation at all.  It is only the framing of questions which <Col N="808" /> will be put to the people for decision. In ordinary routine Bills, the decision rests with the Houses of the Oireachtas and their decision is final.  In this case, the Houses of the Oireachtas have not the final decision and, so, we are not legislating at all.  We are simply framing the questions to be put to the people for their decision&mdash;and the framing of the question is very important. You can frame it in such a way that it is a very loaded question or you can phrase it in such a way that it will give no lead or guidance whatsoever&mdash; and, in a very highly-technical matter such as this, I think it is essential that the Government which proposes this referendum should give some lead, some indication, as to what its own view is as to the wisest decision.</P>
    <P>It is no use just to go up to a man in the street and to ask: &ldquo;Do you like the single-member constituency?&rdquo;  You might as well ask: &ldquo;Are you in favour of decimal currency?&rdquo;  That is a highly-technical matter.  He may say: &ldquo;Yes, I think I rather like it because it is easier to add and to multiply.&rdquo; However, there is more to it than that and, so, in this particular Bill before us, we are dealing with a very complex political issue, one which could easily affect the whole structure of our political system for very many years.

      <P>Some have suggested it would be preferable if we could have on the ballot paper alternatives such as: &ldquo;Are you in favour of single-member constituencies?  Are you in favour of the straight vote?  Are you in favour of the single transferable vote?&rdquo;  Unfortunately that is not possible because we could get such an amount of cross-voting that it would be impossible to get a decision in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still think, as I have said, that the small single-member constituency is <Col N="809" /> the vital part of this Amendment but we should indicate to the people that, in our view, the straight vote is the proper system to adopt in such constituencies. If I could get any indication that people are happy with the single-seat small constituency but for reasons, whether they know it or not, would still prefer the single transferable vote, then there might be something to be said for this amendment because we must phrase this question in some way that the electorate can use it intelligently and wisely without coming back afterwards and saying: &ldquo;We only wish you had put it some other way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We can have quite a lot of useful discussion on this amendment, particularly if we can get some indication as to how the public mind is going.  If we frame the question wrongly, we shall get the wrong answer.  In France at present there is a general election which in fact is being conducted rather in the form of a referendum and the issues are being over-simplified, so far as we can see, as if the issue really were: &ldquo;Are you a good Frenchman or a bad Frenchman?&rdquo;  You can never get an issue as clear as that.  In this particular case, we are asking the electorate for a decision which has to be an overall decision on single-member constituencies and on the form of voting to be adopted in these constituencies.  We should give the lead in this and encourage people not to dither by trying to cling to a system to which I admit they have become accustomed but a system which means virtually nothing, which has far too much of the element of chance in it and which can discredit the whole electoral system.</P>
    <P>The danger is much less in a single-member constituency but it is there, and rather than put up a smokescreen, if you like, by saying that we are to some extent retaining proportional representation, I think it is well to say single-member seats, single-member constituencies and the straight vote and have done with it.  I believe the people can be led in that way and can accept it.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall have further discussion <Col N="810" /> about this but if any Deputy can give any indication from his own experience as to what the public view is, not just what is in the newspapers but the ordinary public view that people would feel happier by continuing to vote 1, 2 and 3.  I might have another look at the matter but I shall take a great deal of convincing.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Booth, I felt he was rather like the man who went out in the middle of the field beating the air and found he was beating nothing because I do not know what Deputy Booth was saying.  Does anybody else?  He has been rambling around here on this amendment, saying that he hopes there will be much more discussion about it and asking would everybody kindly tell him what their soundings of public opinion may be, and if they do, that he will very kindly consider the matter,</P>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy that his freedom of choice is gone?  Big brother has spoken.  The Government have declared that they are against Deputy Norton's amendment, and no matter what further information Deputy Booth may get here, he will walk when he is told to walk and in the direction in which he is told to walk.  This is not a free discussion.  The political Party opposite is not a free Party to discuss these things.  We know their record well; we know that a Constitution Committee was established, a consultative Committee, upon which Deputies from all Parties served and gave a considerable amount of time helping to formulate or consider amendments of the Constitution.  We know well that in the work of that Committee this whole question of our electoral system was considered from beginning to end and nobody suggested at any stage that we should introduce, or endeavour to change our system to the British system of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that was discussed was the proposal enshrined in Deputy Norton's amendment and it was agreed that no decision would be taken in the Committee, that the arguments for and against should be stated by those who wished to put arguments for and against.  Nevertheless, Deputy Booth's <Col N="811" /> leaders, when the Committee's report was published, proceeded to put forward something that was never considered in that Committee.  That is indicative of a decision by hard-boiled men not concerned with responsible thought even inside their own Party but out to get as effectively as possible control of this Parliament and our institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think many people have already made up their minds on this matter even though Deputy Booth finds in his meanderings around his constituency no enthusiasm. Of course there is not.  Supporters of Deputy Booth's Party step to the other side of the road when he tries to buttonhole them about this proposal. They know well what they are going to decide and know that this referendum proposal is a dead duck, that it has not a chance to get off the ground, that it is a waste of public time to discuss it here and a waste of public money to put it before the people.  It will not succeed.  The Government were told it would not succeed.  I am certain that view was strongly expressed at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting before this was announced in the early part of the year.  Whatever doubts anyone may have had then should certainly have been resolved since.  There is a firm public commitment in this country to support proportional representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know well the dithering, thumb-sucking and nailbiting that have gone on in Government circles over the past eight weeks or so.  They tied a tin can to their tails and their trouble has been to get it off. They expected Deputy Norton to get it off but that has not succeeded.  The Government were faced with Hobson's choice: either they could somersault and accept Deputy Norton's amendment which would make it perfectly clear that their credibility had disappeared, or they could stay where the impetuous members had got them at the beginning of the year by sticking to the original proposal, knowing, as I am sure they know now, that it is bound to be defeated.</P>
      <P>This is a bad situation for the country. We accused the majority of the Fianna Fáil Party, or whoever were responsible for bringing about this proposal in the beginning of this year, of endeavouring to change the electoral system in order to perpetuate their control of our political institutions.  That charge was made.  That charge we here and now repeat.  There is nothing wrong, I suppose, about ambitious men seeking perpetual power, but there is, I believe, enough concern amongst the ordinary people to resent such a move any time it is made.  We can now repeat that accusation with greater force because what is referred to in subsection 2º of Part II of the Schedule we are discussing is a proposal that: &ldquo;The members shall be elected on the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote&rdquo;&mdash;a collection of words got together after research and deep thought in order to conceal the fact that what is proposed is that members shall be elected on the British system of election.</P>

      <P>The question is whether the first past the post system is democratic or not.  Simple it is; with single seats, more simple still, but democratic&mdash;certainly Arthur Griffith did not think so.  Certainly the framers of the Constitution of 1922 did not think so.  President de Valera as Taoiseach did not think so, and the people of Ireland did not think so when they adopted PR twice in the past 45 years.  It is not democratic for this simple reason, that it may result in the election to Parliament of a member who has not the support of the majority of his constituents.  There is no way in which you can disguise that fact; the British system of election may result, and frequently does result, in the election of a member whose politics do not reflect the view of the majority of his constituents.</P>

Where is the nationalism of Fianna Fáil?  We have the Minister for Education doling out bromides to the people of Wales and Scotland telling them they should not have gone the road we went.

      <P>I would advise the Minister to read the wise and carefully put together phrases of the Minister for Education and perhaps he will think again about it.  We shall deal with it on another occasion.  I am saying that any system which can result, in any constituency, in the election of a person who has not the support of the majority of his constituents is a system which is undemocratic.  It may work all right; it may in fact be regarded as democratic by countries that wish to retain it.  Here in this country when we started off to form our own Parliament, to establish our own institutions and to give our own concept of what Irish freedom should mean, it was a free decision to adopt PR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am utterly fed up with the kind of cant that has been used in place of arguments by the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Local Government, in particular, who suggest that PR was just another one of the wrongs that Britain did this country. That is rubbish.  Proportional representation was first demanded by the Sinn Féin Party and the Sinn Féin organisation. I would have hoped there would be enough of the traditions of Sinn Féin still left in Fianna Fáil to recognise that, and enough respect for the Leader of Sinn Féin, the late President Arthur Griffith, to recognise that his views in this regard at least had the merit of <Col N="815" /> sincerity.  Proportional representation was our decision taken at different times by different generations of people interested in Irish affairs.  It was not foisted or forced on us by anybody. We freely adopted it in 1922 in the Constitution of that year.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation, while it was inserted in the Constitution, was deliberately left flexible.  The provision in the 1922 Constitution was merely that election to Oireachtas Éireann should take place with the system of PR.  At that time PR had only been known to this country; we had only had a very limited experience of it in one part of the country, and it was not known sufficiently well for general election purposes.  Therefore the framers of the 1922 Constitution deliberately left the details of the system flexible, providing that the system should be there because it was one of the principles of Sinn Féin; it represented part of the bond of faith which they entered into on the formation of the State.</P>
    <P>We know that after 1922, in the story of Ireland in the ten years after that, there were general elections, and difficulties of one kind or another were overcome, but there was a growing respect for the institutions established in 1922 and a growing concern for the preservation of law and of order. When in due course in 1936 another Government and another Leader invited the people to alter the Constitution and to adopt a new Constitution, the question of proportional representation was again considered.  Speaking at that time, at the time of the Constitution debates in this House, the then Leader of Fianna Fáil, the present President, said: &ldquo;The system we have we know.  The people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country.&rdquo;  That was a reflective speech by the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was reflecting on the actual experience of the previous 15 or 16 years, reflecting on it at a time when a new Constitution was being debated here.</P>

      <P>The quotation which I have read was not merely an aside: it was a considered statement. He went on to say: &ldquo;We have to be very grateful that we have had the system of proportional representation here.&rdquo;  Further on he said: &ldquo;It gives a certain amount of stability and from the system of the single transferable vote we have fair representation of all Parties.&rdquo;  The point I want to make is that that opinion was expressed in the calm of a discussion which could have been a formative discussion, at a time when everything was being reformed and looked at and when a new Constitution, a new fundamental law, was being suggested and put forward and <Col N="817" /> that opinion was not coerced and was not a forced opinion.  Nobody compelled that expression of view.  It came, I assume, from a responsible Leader of Government to a House that after all was sitting almost as a constituent assembly.</P>
      <P>The President having expressed that opinion, the Article with which we are concerned here was solemnly put forward to the effect that:</P>
      <P>The members shall be elected on the system of proportional representation by the means of the single transferable vote.  No law shall be enacted whereby the number of members to be returned for any constituency shall be less than three.</P>
      <P>Where the old Constitution had been flexible, where it stated merely that the system of election shall be proportional representation, now after the period of test, after 17 years have rolled by, after the institutions of this State have withstood assault and battery and denigration, after all these things had been put behind us in his day the then Taoiseach having praised proportional representation, put it in a more rigid form in the new Constitution and specifically provided that the system shall not merely be the system of proportional representation but spelled out that it shall be by means of the single transferable vote, with the minimum number of seats of three.</P>
      <P>It is no good Deputies on the opposite side becoming irritated at being asked to reflect on that.  There is no point in it.  We must remember that that was a decision; it may have been wrong at the time, but at least it was a decision made without heat, made without rancour, without anyone being able to suggest that there was a bad motive behind it.  It was made at a time when the entire affairs and institutions of this State were possibly coming through a profound change.  So it was that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In any event, the Constitution containing this proposal went to the people and it was approved by the people in 1937.  For the second time, PR was adopted and accepted by the people.  I want to know where in 1937 was British power or British force forcing the then Taoiseach to say this and to put it into the Constitution?  Who then was suggesting that the British made him do it?  Did they?  You find the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for External Affairs talking nonsense of that kind.  It was a free decision, made freely by the Leader of Fianna Fáil in 1937 and subsequently supported by the people when the Constitution was enacted and so having tested proportional representation, we continued with it.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go over subsequent affairs.  Times march on and circumstances change; people who hold one opinion at one time are quite entitled to change their view and hold another opinion at another time.  But coincidental with the imminent departure of the then Leader of Fianna Fáil from active parliamentary politics, the proposal was put forward in 1959 to do away with PR and to adopt the British system of election. That was defeated.  It is a matter for debate as to whether the majority was large or not.  Fifty per cent of the people voted and that was not a very high proportion.  It did not indicate a very healthy intelligent participation in the dialogue going on about our electoral system.  The majority was 30,000 and the proposal was defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying&mdash;whether I said it or not, it would make no difference&mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party are not entitled to try this again.  Of course, they are, if they want to be irresponsible and if they want to waste time and money, which they are certainly doing. They are bringing forward now precisely the same proposal as was rejected <Col N="819" /> by the people nine years ago. They are bringing forward a proposal that was not even considered by the Committee on the Constitution.  They are bringing it forward, and this is the accusation we make against them, because they see this as the surest and most certain way of maintaining themselves in office.  What Deputy Norton proposes does, at least, necessitate for the election of a member to this House that the member, in order to get elected, must have a majority of all effective votes.  Any member who is elected as a result of a by-election to this House under our system can say, at least, that he has been sent here by a majority of the votes effective at the time.  At least, under Deputy Norton's amendment, there is a searching round to get a majority for the election of a member, but Fianna Fáil will not have that.</P>

      <P>We are not in Government and this is not our Bill. Our position is quite clear.  We stand for proportional representation in every detail.  Why will Fianna Fáil not have it?  The motive are now quite clear.  They will not have it because it is too chancy.  They would have to get a majority in the majority of constituencies in order to remain in office. There is too big a gamble.  It is much simpler to have the first past the post system and democracy does not count. I do not know what trouble may be going on in the Fianna Fáil Party. Obviously Deputy Booth was fishing; he used the phrase that he thinks the Government should give a lead, that they should not dither, and so on and so on.</P>

      <P>Some statements made by the two Opposition speakers call for some reply.  I noticed that neither attempted to controvert any of the arguments I put forward about the un-justifiableness of the transferable vote. Deputy Fitzpatrick claimed that Fine Gael always accepted proportional representation as the best system.  I do not know whether or not he means since they became the Fine Gael Party. I have not got the exact date on which that transformation took place, but certainly on 25th May, 1937, Deputy McGilligan was not in favour of the system.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always held with regard to <Col N="821" /> proportional representation, which this country adopted, that we had adopted the worst possible system.</P>
    <P>Again, in 1947&mdash;I am not quite sure if this was one of the periods during which Deputy Dillon was outside the fold of the Fine Gael Party, but I think he is in it now&mdash;at column 1714 of Volume 108 of the Official Report, Deputy Dillon stated:</P>
    <P>I believe that the evil in this Bill is the evil that it is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  If you are going to have proportional representation, it is perfectly obvious that you should have five- or seven-seat constituencies.  Personally, I think proportional representation is a fraud and a cod, and that it ought to be abolished.</P>

      <P>Again, as column 1715, Deputy Dillon had this to say:</P>
      <P>Proportional representation is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation.  So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog.  I doubt if any other sane democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament.  It may have in regard to its corporations or county councils.  The single transferable vote is quite another story.  I think it is true to say that the kind of proportional representation that we have operating in this country has not been adopted in any other country.</P>
      <P>There are many other prominent Fine Gael speakers on record as having similar opinions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick says proportional representation was always accepted by Fine Gael as the best system.  The fact is Fine Gael have always operated in accordance with one principle, being against anything proposed by Fianna Fáil.  Both Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Higgins tried to make some capital out of the fact that the draft Constitution of 1937 retained the system of proportional representation which they had accepted in the Irish Free State Constitution of 1922.  Obviously these Deputies think the people do not remember what the 1937 Constitution set out to do; it set out to get rid of the Irish Free State Constitution and to get rid of the dominion status they sought to saddle on this country for all time.</P>

    <P>SECTION 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, line 1, to delete &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;An Chomhairle&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment because I feel that it is important when setting up such a board as An Chomhairle Olla to give it some power and authority.  Section 11 deals with the making of regulations relating to the purchase of wool, to premises, plant and machinery and to the register.  I <Col N="823" /> cannot see why the Minister should regard it as a matter of importance to retain these functions unto himself.  I do not understand why he does not allow An Chomhairle Olla to prescribe the standards of buildings and equipment, the various grades of wool and the price increases and reductions to be attached to the various grades of wool.  Surely, if An Chomhairle Olla has any function at all, this is where it should come in?</P>
    <P>The great mistake the Minister is making throughout the Bill is that he is setting up a board to do a job and is leaving them without the power or authority to be respected or regarded as a group that has any authority directly to insist on standards or to decide when certain new grades and certain new performances should be prescribed.  It is only the Wool Board that can be sufficiently close to this whole operation to be in a position to make these decisions if the scheme is to be a success.  Still, the Minister insists that it is he who has to make all these regulations and do everything that is required to be done.  As far as I can see, so much can be done by regulation made by the Minister as to make a farce of the Bill.  The Minister appears to tie himself partly and then in a few sweeping lines provides that the Minister can, by regulation, do practically anything.</P>
    <P>In subclause (b) of subsection (2) of section 11 it is provided:</P>
    <P>in relation to every sale of wool by a producer, provide for the supply to the producer by the relevant registered buyer of a statement by such buyer containing such particulars as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister give some explanation of the type of particulars he might have in mind?  It is not good enough to bring legislation into the House and not be able to spell out in advance what is intended under the various subsections.  No explanatory memorandum has been issued with the Bill.  It is not good enough to pass these sections as they stand, knowing so very little about their contents. <Col N="824" /> The whole thing is so vague that anything can be prescribed by regulation. We do not get examples as to what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>In all fairness to the House, the Minister might give some idea of what he has in mind and he should also tell the House why he feels he should retain all these powers rather than that they should be given to this board, the members of which he has insisted he must select.  I do not think he should select them and I have said so already. I assume the Minister must have confidence in the people whom he himself selects.  Why not give them direct power and authority to get on with the job, without the necessity to have recourse to the Minister on every occasion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Answering the case made for the amendment, I should like to draw the attention of Deputy Clinton and of the House to the Report of the Wool Improvements Committee, page 34, article 138, where it is stated:</P>
      <P>The Committee considers it is a matter of convenience to arrange whether the registration of wool buyers, licensing of exporters and the employment of supervisory staff should be undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the Council.  On balance, the Committee saw merit in their being undertaken by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These, again, are a body of people who sat on this Committee who are of standing, knowledge and experience, and one might very readily answer Deputy Clinton's arguments by saying that we recognise their knowledge and experience and the worth of them to the degree that in this regard we have taken their recommendations.  But, perhaps, that in itself is not sufficient to answer Deputy Clinton.  I might say in this regard that in so far as the regulations are concerned&mdash;before going on to deal with them in so far as the amendment is concerned&mdash;Deputy Clinton had already asked what they are going to be.  I might again answer that by asking, if his amendment were <Col N="825" /> accepted, what did he envisage they were going to be.  Since the Wool Board is not yet established and could not possibly be asked to come into the House to elaborate in detail and give every line of what they would propose to do by way of regulation if the amendment were accepted, it is rather unreasonable to expect the Minister at this juncture, on the emergence of this Bill, in its passage through the House, to do something which, if the Deputy had his way, the board could not be asked to do until after the measure has become law, if it ever does become law.</P>
    <P>So far as grading regulations, registration and licensing are concerned, I do not think it is an exercise one can go into at this juncture in a detailed way because I would hope that the legislation we are putting through the House at the moment will stand the test of time.  Indeed, what might be thought of as regulations and standards of today would be capable of change and, indeed, may be changed according to circumstances developing in future.  Overall, I cannot see how the Deputy can expect at this juncture to get details of the regulations in advance of the power to make these regulations.  I should imagine that the Deputy does agree that some regulation and statement of standards is necessary.  Indeed, one of the prime reasons for part of this Bill is that this necessity is recognised.</P>
    <P>The Wool Improvements Committee recognised this as part of the job to be done in order to have more orderly and better marketing, with a better return to the wool producers.  The need for it is recognised, therefore.  The detailing of how it will be done must await the legislation which we are now working on in the House.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that we are not going to bring in needless or useless regulations when the whole purpose of the effort is the improvement of the wool trade as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not timely that we should in this amendment spell out what might be done either in the immediate future or the distant future.  I hope this Bill, if passed, will be the basis on which our <Col N="826" /> wool marketing will progress in the years ahead.  Undoubtedly changes will be made in the light of changing circumstances. The Wool Improvement Committee see merit in these matters being left in the hands of the Minister, and in this particular instance, I agree with them that this is the way it should be.  If one were to ask what was the basic reason why they think so and I think so, for my part I certainly feel that the making of these regulations and the laying down of these standards is part of the job to be done.  The board will be part of the paraphernalia to make it possible to have the law carried out&mdash;all in the interests of the producer.  Since the Minister for Agriculture will be the person charged with the organisation of wool marketing under this Bill, it is only proper that he and his Department should lay down the standards, look after the registrations and licences and all that has to be done.  They should have the laying down of the guidelines for the job.  The board will be part of the operational personnel who will carry out the intentions of the Bill to improve our wool marketing position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says in this instance he agrees with the Committee that the power to make these regulations and to do all the things to be done under section 11 should be retained by the Minister and his Department.  I think the Minister would agree, not only in this instance but in any instance, that it would be suggested that he should retain control and power.  I just want to have it on record that I disagree with the view that this sort of dual responsibility and dual control is ever a satisfactory instrument.  Where you have two bodies responsible for the same job, it never works well.  What is everybody's business is nobody's business.  I like something direct.  If the Minister sets up a board to do a job, he should give them the power and responsibility to do it. In this case he is not doing it.  He is retaining the principal power and authority himself.  He is just having a board to work under him.  I do not see where a board can be of any assistance if the Minister is going to do the job himself.  It appears to me he is going <Col N="827" /> to appoint the officers who are actually going to do the work.  The whole operation will be directed from the Department of Agriculture.  You will have a good deal of pull and drag between this board and the Department of Agriculture in relation to the carrying out of the regulations laid down here.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked me am I not satisfied that such regulations are necessary. Of course I am satisfied that the regulations specified here are necessary, if we are to improve the standards in the presentation and marketing of wool.  All these things will have to be tightened up.  It is just a question of who should actually do it and who in the last analysis should be responsible. I have made the case that I propose to make for An Chomhairle Olla having this power and responsibility.  Obviously, the Minister does not intend to accept it.  He has indicated his attitude already in relation to giving power and responsibility to this board.  He does not intend to give it.  He has maintained that and has been consistent in that attitude throughout.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already commented at some length on other parts of the Bill on the setting up of this Comhairle Olla.  We have had a long discussion as to the number of people to be appointed and the method of their appointment or selection.  The Minister explained that he saw great difficulty in setting up a board otherwise than by his own direct selection. Again, we on this side of the House hold that this is the wrong way to get the co-operation in particular of the producers.  If a scheme of this kind is to be satisfactory, you must have the wholehearted co-operation of the producers in particular.  In fact, you must have the co-operation of all the people at the various stages between the production <Col N="828" /> of the wool and the production of the final product in whatever form it takes.  I disagree entirely with the Minister's view that it is not possible to set up a good and effective board by having people nominated by the various interests concerned in the wool business generally.</P>
      <P>I have made a strong case for this already.  I gave the Minister the example of the methods used in the setting up of the Board of An Foras Talúntais.  I see no reason why this board could not be set up in a similar manner.  The Minister made a statement on the last evening we were discussing this which has caused serious concern to some of the existing boards.  At column 264 of Volume 235 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
      <P>It is also true to say that some of our existing boards which have enjoyed almost complete autonomy are now seen to be breeding dictatorship which Government Ministers are accused of but never indulge in.</P>
      <P>This statement has caused very serious concern.  If the Minister feels that this type of board has in fact turned out to be a dictatorship, some of the boards will be extremely anxious that he should immediately set about having a sworn inquiry into the operation of the board.  They are prepared for that; in fact, they are anxious for it.  This is a statement with which I entirely disagree and we are very upset that the Minister should make it.  In all fairness to these boards, the Minister appears to be breeding dictatorship.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in so far as they are relevant to the section.  In this section the Minister has set out to select whatever the number of members he decides.  It must not be less than six. He tells the House that it will consist of three from the producers and three <Col N="829" /> from the trade.  This is the type of balance that is indicated. The Minister has not said that he will insist that it should have this sort of balance but this is open in the legislation before the House.  He need only select six people.  This is a dangerous board.  The Minister is responsible for everything that happens in the production and the marketing of wool. Later on he provides for a levy to be paid by producers.  He will set up the board and he will hand-pick these people.  He will give the board no authority.  This is a serious situation and I think the Minister should look very hard at it before he insists on going ahead with another board of this description where the producers have no guarantee of proper representation, where no safeguards are provided, and where the Minister can through a selected body do everything he likes in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had dealt with this the other evening but Deputy Clinton is still not convinced.  I put it to Deputy Clinton that if what he has said is reasonable&mdash;I would not for a moment suggest that the Deputy would ever be in the position I am in but if it ever should come to pass&mdash;I would not in the slightest degree object to Deputy Clinton setting up this board in the way I propose to set it up, nor would I object to his having the freedom we have, in a way being tied as we are, by having not less than six, not less than three for the producers and three for the trade.  If wool is selling well the Opposition almost claim they are responsible.  If it is selling badly the Opposition keep hammering away at the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Now we come along with legislation in the hope, through the experience and knowledge put at our disposal by this committee, that we will produce a Bill with the intention of trying to make wool always a better commodity, better handled and better sold.  Instead of there being an all-out welcome for this from Deputy Clinton, who has great interest in this matter, we find him carping and criticising in a way that does not make much sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last analysis the Minister for Agriculture takes the raps.  He proposes <Col N="830" /> to set up the board.  He proposes to have it set up by him and nobody else. A good instance to cite would be that a few years ago butter was being sold and An Bord Bainne was selling it. Now there is a semi-autonomous board being set up and if it is not going well it is the Minister for Agriculture who is not doing his job.  Deputy Clinton would like to have it both ways.  I believe in taking the raps and I also believe in ensuring that if there are credits to come to the Minister for a good thing, as the man responsible for bringing it about he is entitled to some merit.  There is nobody in public life, in Government or in politics who is entitled to carry the can, and at the same time when there is credit due or any merit that it should be given to somebody else.  That is not the way of life and we are not being realistic in talking this way.</P>
    <P>This is a Fine Gael approach that is well known.  I have no doubt when a job is to be done under the aegis of this Department that the Minister for the Department and the Department should be the people who actually set about setting up and controlling the paraphernalia provided in order to do a better job.  If we are setting up any mechanism or machinery to do the job, no doubt the man who is responsible for driving the coach should also be responsible for selecting the kind of coach he proposes to drive.  This is what I propose to do and I have no doubt it is the right thing and if Deputy Clinton were ever equipped I would not take exception to his adopting the same approach.  Were he to have the same ideas I have, I must say I would agree with him.  If it should ever come to pass I think he would find that that would be my outlook in this regard, not only in regard to a wool board but to any other board as well.</P>
    <P>On the matter of other autonomous boards he has mentioned and on something I said at a particular time, what he got was that I suggested that they were breeding dictatorship.  Until the birth takes place I do not think there is any sense in christening the child.  I propose we leave it at that for the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I opposed section 12 because the Minister openly admits that he is not setting up An Chomhairle Olla.  He is providing himself with a coach he can drive and this is the way I saw it.  He is providing a coach he can drive and nothing else and he says he can accept responsibility for it.  That is poor consolation to the principal people concerned in this whole operation.  The people I am concerned about are not the middlemen who are making money out of the primary producer.  Everybody has to live and if the people in between provide a service I like to see them reasonably remunerated for that service. I would weight this whole legislation in favour of the producer and, as I see it, it is not so weighted.  The Minister has not commented on that. I am opposing this section for the reasons I have given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 set out the functions of An Chomhairle.  Already in the debate on this Bill I have objected to the fact that An Chomhairle will be really without power and without responsibility.  They will be only an advisory body.  They are to advise the Minister in relation to grades, prices, <i>et cetera</i>, all of the things about which it is intended they should give advice to the Minister.  I submit that instead of giving advice to the Minister they should be carrying out these functions themselves directly. They should be able to go directly to the producers, purchasers, the exporters and say: &ldquo;This is what we feel will get results and we want it done in this way because it is only in this way we will get results.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the manner in which we are doing it will ever get results and I should prefer to see the Minister setting out to provide that this would be operated directly by the Department, because then we could pin the entire responsibility and the Minister could not come back and say: &ldquo;We <Col N="832" /> have a board and they have obviously failed to achieve this.  There are a lot of experienced people on the board&rdquo;, and all the rest of it.  I should prefer that we on this side of the House could say that the Minister or the officers of his Department had either succeeded or failed.</P>
    <P>I should like to say now that I want to see this succeed because this has been a neglected industry for a long time and it is time something was done about it.  In setting out the functions of An Chomhairle, a provision that has been left out altogether, and it is a pity it has been left out, is the lack of any reference whatever to the fact that one of the functions of An Chomhairle should be to promote co-operation in every aspect of the wool industry because if there ever was an industry that needs co-operation, where co-operation and co-operative effort would be effective, it is in the wool industry, and somewhere in these functions reference should have been made specifically to the place which co-operation should have in this whole scheme of things&mdash; that it should be one of the functions of this board to promote co-operation at every level of the industry.</P>

      <P>All I am afraid of is that Deputy Clinton, in his over-enthusiasm to oppose the Bill, is endangering the likelihood of its doing the good I believe it can do&mdash;that he is eroding by his opposition for opposition sake the goodwill he knows, as I know, exists for such a measure as this. It is something he should be careful about because he can carry it to the point where he could have the Bill passed into law and then arrive at the stage where it will not have done any good but where he, as the opposer of the Bill, will be capable of saying outside and coming in here and saying: &ldquo;I told you this Bill would not work. You wanted co-operation for it but you will not get it.  I told you so when it was going through the House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he hammers here long enough to the effect that this is not the sort of Bill anybody should co-operate with, it would be much simpler that we should scrap the idea of discussing this <Col N="833" /> section by section on Committee Stage and that we should let it go to its final stages and then let him oppose it altogether.  That would be a much better method than to kill a measure like this, to prevent its becoming effective if and when it comes into operation.  As a matter of interest, surely Deputy Clinton must have noticed in the section now under discussion that of the six matters named as functions of An Chomhairle the first two are in relation to advising the Minister to do certain things and that the last four are matters An Chomhairle themselves will have as functions not in an advisory capacity but in a positive sense.</P>
    <P>It is well worth bringing to the Deputy's notice that of the six functions so named, four are related to the competence and the jurisdiction of the board when they have been set up and that only two out of the six so named relate to advising the Minister &mdash;that the total overall description of the body being only an advisory board is not quite fair to the board or to the members thereof when the board ultimately become appointed.  It is right that at this stage Deputy Clinton should have it spelled out for him that this is not, as he seems to think it should be, a wool marketing board as such in the fullest context of the description.  That is not what it was intended to be and that is not what it will be.  If that is what he really seeks, plus the suggestion of the autonomy he thinks is necessary for any board of any worth at all, I want to disillusion him at this stage by telling him it is not that sort of board, that it is not only an advisory board, as will be seen from the functions set out in this section.  There are other matters of an onerous nature, too, which the board will have to perform and the success or failure of An Chomhairle and of the whole concept of An Chomhairle Olla as enshrined in the Bill will depend on the successful performance of these functions.</P>
    <P>Though I agree that by all means we should give as detailed a criticism as possible of the Bill at this stage, I ask Deputy Clinton not to condemn the Bill in such a way that, even though it has gone through, his token <Col N="834" /> resistance and opposition to the sections will mean that the Bill will be undermined and eroded after it leaves the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I wish to put it on the record of the House that from the outset of the debate on the Bill I have set out to try to persuade the Minister to improve it in such a way that it would be a better measure.  My opposition has been for that reason only and I should like the Minister to appreciate that it is not token opposition. I am opposing the section because I have failed to get the Minister in any way to move in the slightest.  He sees this as a perfect measure that cannot be improved.  Unfortunately, that is the Minister's attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stay with it and I hope the Minister does so in the future.  On the functions of An Chomhairle, the Minister said that only in paragraphs (a) and (b) is it indicated that this is to be an advisory body.  If he goes to the next page he will see that there is provision for consultation with the Minister but that the consultation must take place first. The Minister did not explain why it is right in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) to give direct responsibility and why he could not give direct responsibility in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand, and this is not opposition for opposition's sake.  I want to see this legislation succeeding in doing what it set out to <Col N="835" /> do and for that reason I feel that this body, An Chomhairle Olla, should get some real responsibility and some real power in its functions.  The only thing it gets real power and responsibility to do here is contained in subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f).  Subparagraph (d) is &ldquo;to provide or secure the provision of courses for the training of persons in the grading of wool&rdquo;; (e) is &ldquo;to consider, devise or implement methods to increase exports of wool&rdquo;; and (f) is &ldquo;to consider methods of securing the maximum use of home produced wool by manufacturers in the State.&rdquo;  These are all very important matters and I am glad that it has been given, as part of its functions, these three direct responsibilities.  My only objection is that it is not getting more responsibility. If this is opposition for opposition's sake, I do not see it as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I really love the way Deputy Clinton goes about this: will I explain why I leave (d) (e) and (f) in section 13 to the board and why I will not leave them (a), (b) and (c)?  Deputy Clinton did not tell us why I should leave them (a), (b) and (c).  It was very easy to say why should I not give them (a), (b) and (c) because I have already given them (d), (e) and (f).  In fact I thought at least he would have come in on the middle section there, which is (c).  This is a function which says: &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister, to fix a code of practice to be observed by wool exporters.&rdquo;  After consultation with the Minister, they fix this code of practice, and yet that is lumped in with the two advisory subsections, as it were, as three things for the purpose of arguing by Deputy Clinton and he asks why I do not give those three to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House will fully appreciate that in fact there can be three elements taken in this.  There is the advisory element covered by (a) and (b), the consultative element but nevertheless giving the power and authority after consultation to the board contained in (c) and in (d), (e) and (f) three remaining functions entirely within the competence and jurisdiction of the board.  Personally I do not know, <Col N="836" /> but if the Deputy has a view, surely he must accept that (c) really does not belong to the same category as (a) and (b).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing section 19 because I think it is quite wrong to make provision here for a levy.  Again, I have to draw attention to the fact that we are setting up a body and we have not guaranteed, in the setting up of this body, that the primary producers will have fair representation on it.  As I see it, any levy that is to be imposed here at any level will eventually have to be paid by the producer because it will work back to him.  This is so in all lines of business. The primary producer is the person who has to stand the knock.  I should like, before going very far on this, to hear how the Minister can make a case for a levy in relation to the operations of this Wool Board that he is setting up himself and that the producers have no say whatever in setting up.  It is entirely his responsibility and he is retaining that responsibility for himself. He wants in addition to that to get the producers to pay the piper and he will call the tune.  This is a very unusual piece of legislation.  I hope the Minister will see that there is no place for a levy in this particular piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one of the matters we should keep in mind here is that this Comhairle is being set up <Col N="839" /> for the purpose of improving and assisting or supporting our wool trade as a whole&mdash;in other words, to make it a better trade in whatever circumstance we may find ourselves.  As time goes on there will and, indeed, there could be expenses that were incurred solely and simply in the extra duties of the board in the long-term interests of the producers of wool and all those concerned in the wool business, whether producers or traders.  If this Comhairle is to work on that basis and make a fairly good job of it and at the same time it is a fairly costly operation, what is wrong with the idea and the principle that some of those who are gaining from the activities of this Comhairle contribute something towards its actual expenses?  This is a fair and sound principle.  It is one which has been enshrined in other legislation to do with boards and one which I think in the last analysis is a good, sound proposition in principle. As to the danger of its being unduly applied, applied in an unfair way or applied to a greater degree, this surely is a matter in which, as the Minister will undoubtedly be seen to carry the can, he will be answerable in this House and will be called to answer if any such levy should be introduced.</P>
      <P>This is where you can tie up both ideas that it is a good principle to have those who benefit from the activities of the Comhairle, the persons we propose, to carry some of the costs, if, in fact, business is in a good, sound condition.  At the same time, its imposition can be visited on the Minister, namely, the Minister for Agriculture in this case.  And undoubtedly it will be visited on him, whether, in fact, it is justified or not.  But for any Minister to come in here at any stage in future years and be answerable for a levy that was either too severe or was imposed by him when the trade generally was unable to carry the risk, any Minister for Agriculture who would wittingly put himself in that position and know Deputies could check it would in my estimation be sufficient to get rid of any feelings he may have in that matter on behalf of the producers or the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister argues that this body is being set up to improve conditions in the wool industry, and in the long run, although he may not have used those words, to improve the income of the producers and, therefore, the producers should pay for the co-operation of those manufacturers. After all, if this Comhairle does a good job and succeeds it is reasonable to expect it should get costs.  I look at it the other way and say that if this Comhairle set up by the Minister turns out to be a damn bad business and does not succeed in its aims, the Minister can still insist that they pay the piper even though the goods were not delivered, so to speak.  Then he goes on to say that this is normal enough.</P>
      <P>Nobody can say that the sheep industry is over-subsidised by the State at the moment.  In fact, if this is regarded as a subsidy, as an additional subsidy, it is well deserved.  We have sheep numbers dropping pretty rapidly at present.  If we are going to keep the industry going at all we should be inclined to give it more rather than less assistance.  If we are going on the one hand to set up machinery designed to improve it we should not be taking it back on the other hand and making those people pay for this.</P>

I hope it is not to be so but that is the way it appears up to now.  If it is different from that I would be glad to know it. Apart from that, as I was saying when I was interrupted, about this matter that the levy need not be applied to producers as such; it can be applied, and will be applied, on sales by traders and it may well be that this might not be inequitable at all if it was related to the actual volume of sales rather than as a fixed sum, as it might well be on the different registered buyers at a different level.  Those are things which will only arise if the levy comes to be considered to be applied, which is not yet.  I am sure that if and when that time comes the Minister for Agriculture of the day will be responsible clearly and will be answerable in this <Col N="842" /> House as he would be entitled to be and he will not have an opportunity, which is very often put forward by Opposition members, of saying that he has no function when, in fact, he will have a function.

      <P>That is the situation in regard to this matter of the levy.  If a business is going well and if it costs a great deal of money, there is nothing wrong in this provision being put in the Bill and enacted as law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is tied in with section 19 in so far as it sets up an appeals tribunal.  If anyone wants to appeal against this levy there will be an appeals tribunal, but the Minister does not tell us what sort of a tribunal will be set up.  Section 20 provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister shall make regulations providing for the establishment of a tribunal to determine appeals by persons assessed to any levy imposed under this Act and such regulations may include&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  provision as to the procedure to be followed on such an appeal...</P>
      <P>Why is the procedure not written into the Bill?  That is one objection.  Surely we know what we have in mind in setting up a tribunal?  I am asking the Minister why he has not spelled out the procedure and why he has not said what sort of a tribunal it will be.  It is very hard to have any confidence in a tribunal set up in this way.  Although we do not know what type of tribunal it will be, we are expected to pass legislation that will be binding afterwards, and the Minister can set up any sort of outfit to get any sort of result he wants.  This is legislation which should not be passed in this or any other House.</P>

I was not threatened that if I did not bring it in certain things would befall me. This is brought voluntarily before the House and I think that establishes the <i>bona fides</i> of our intention that it is for the benefit of the people who produce and handle wool.  Deputy Clinton's suspicious approach is entirely at variance with the circumstances obtaining.  Deputy Clinton is suspicious of everything we bring in here.  He is suspicious of every line of this Bill as being some sort of a trap to take something away from the farmers. I think that is basically what is wrong.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Clinton realises that my interest in the farming community and the sheep breeders is as great as that of any of his colleagues or anyone else&mdash;and that is the way it should be &mdash;he will appreciate that these things do not have the interpretation which he would put on them, that they are designed to help not to hinder, that they are designed to aid the sheep breeders and wool producers and not to put them out of business, and that there is no line in this Bill designed to have &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at these people rather than help them.  If Deputy Clinton appreciated this, as on the face of it he now must, he would probably welcome the Bill in a way which would warm my heart.  I have been long awaiting some welcome from Deputy Clinton for anything I brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to discuss the whole Bill.  No amount of palaver from the Minister&mdash;which does not come very well from him; we are not used to it&mdash;will convince me and the sheep farmers that the Bill in its present form will do what he says it will.  He is not prepared to give any more details than that a tribunal will be set up and that it will achieve what he claims it will achieve.  The biggest trouble is that it is quite possible that, even if the Minister has the idea that everything will be grand, those who may come after him from his own Party may have the idea that in setting up a tribunal there could be a way of doing something for the boys.  I am sure the Minister would never have hand, act or part in anything like that, but it has been known to happen.  I am not satisfied that the present wording guarantees it will be done in the proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister substituted &ldquo;sheep in a <Col N="846" /> bag&rdquo; for &ldquo;pig in a poke&rdquo;, but I still stick to it that it is a pig in a poke which the Minister is trying to sell to us.  In other words, the Minister wants a blind act of faith on the part of the Opposition in relation to this whole Bill.  He went to the trouble of putting 28 sections into it.  From the opinion he has just expressed, I do not know why he did not stop when he had finished the Title of the Bill as that would be far enough if we were to accept everything after that in good faith.  The intentions of the Minister are more or less explained in the Title. We know the intentions of the legislation. If there is any purpose at all in providing us with 28 sections in a Bill, I think it should be detailed and should indicate what will happen.</P>
    <P>Having criticised the Opposition all the time, the Minister then sat down without telling us about the provision for procedure.  He does not tell us what the procedure will be.  It should be simple to indicate what it will be in cases of appeal to this tribunal.  The Minister does not tell us the types of people who will constitute this tribunal. He does not tell us how it will be set up.  He does not tell us how it will carry out its functions.  The Minister says, in effect: &ldquo;I shall establish an appeal tribunal by regulation; I shall fix the procedure afterwards.&rdquo;  It could be anything.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we must trust him and have complete faith in him.  He may be sitting on this side of the House sooner than he imagines and somebody else may be sitting over there and have to deal with this matter.  In fact, somebody else in his own Party may have to deal with it. I think it is all wrong to expect that the House should make a complete act of faith in the Minister with regard to all the sections of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that should be appreciated is that, unless and until a levy order has been made, the need for this tribunal cannot possibly arise.  If and when a levy order comes to be made, then the detailing of the system of tribunal, the hearing and its procedure, would, at that juncture, be appropriate to be made known and <Col N="847" /> circulated so that those who would come under the levy would know where to go if they are not satisfied. What is here is a provision enabling this sort of thing to be set up subsequent to a levy order being made, if it ever comes to be made.  It is fairly obvious, in that light, that the setting-out of anything further by way of detail in this section would be superfluous and might never be used.  When and if the levy order comes to be made, it is only subsequent to that that this tribunal to hear the case would come into being or would be necessary to be brought into being.  The time of the making of the levy order would be the time when this sort of procedural detail as to the tribunal, what they would do and how to do it, would be available and known.  I think this House would feel that probably, in that light, it is less mysterious than was made out by Opposition speakers here.  The complete acceptance by the Opposition, both Labour and Fine Gael&mdash;in one way amazes me and possibly in another way saddens me &mdash;their clamour for detail and for handing over of authority to govern to people who never will have to be elected, their complete acceptance by these devices and these statements that they will never be a government themselves, either collectively or individually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister did not say that when the time came for settling the procedure and for setting up the tribunal he would come back here for the power and authority for the machinery he will set up under this section.  He wants it to be delightfully vague and to be so open as to mean nothing so that when he comes to use it he can do so in any or every way he feels it is to his advantage to use it.  I think it is correct to say that it is not legislation at all and that the Minister could have stopped at the end of the Title and put in no more sections than the Title and say his intentions are good after that and would have to be accepted blindly by the people and the House.

I am sure he sees the wisdom of including it.

      <P>An officer of the Minister authorised in writing by the Minister to exercise the powers conferred on an officer of the Minister by this section may do all or any of the following things, namely:</P>
      <P>(a) enter, inspect and examine at all reasonable times by day any premises in which wool is weighed.</P>
      <P>Surely the members of An Chomhairle should have the right to do this thing if they are to do their job, if they are to be intimately in touch with what is happening in the wool trade?  Surely they should not be impeded in their efforts or endeavours to find out and to know what way the trade is going generally?  I fail to see why the Minister thinks that they should be debarred from giving this power, this authorisation to walk in and look at the premises and so on.  I doubt now if they can go in at all if he does not give them this power, if the people object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not serious?  He talks about this as if it were some sort of God-given right that was there for the taking and that by not agreeing to do this, we were denying something that would be highly desirable for the future wellbeing of those concerned.  That is not the case at all.  As I said earlier, on page 34 the Report of the Committee on Wool Improvements at paragraph 138 said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee considers that it is a matter of convenience to arrange whether the registration of wool buyers, the licensing of exporters and the employment of supervisory staff should be undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the Council.  On balance, the Committee saw merit in their <Col N="850" /> being undertaken by the Department.</P>
    <P>These are the officers whom it is suggested that I should be empowered to authorise to enter the premises of people.  They would be covered by &ldquo;supervisory staff&rdquo; in this paragraph of the Committee's Report.  On balance, they believe this task would be better left to the Department than that the board should do it.  This surely implies that if that is their view, the board members as such should scarcely be put in the position of doing it themselves by virtue of an authorisation under powers that might be put in here by amendment as suggested by Deputy Clinton.  I do not see the relevance; perhaps the Deputy has some further angle on it that I do not yet understand and that may make a difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite serious about this.  I see a situation arising under this legislation in which if I am a wool buyer and have to have premises of a certain standard and so on, surely in educating themselves, the Comhairle will want to visit these premises and see what is happening? But, as a wool buyer or exporter, I can tell them to get out and stay out unless there is some power like this contained in the Bill, unless they have the right in law to enter.</P>
      <P>This is not opposition for opposition's sake, but can the Minister tell me where in the Bill they have a legal right to see for themselves at firsthand what is happening in these establishments? It is very necessary that they should go to see what is going on.  I know it is most unlikely that they will be stopped by the various people concerned because they would naturally feel they were dealing with people who should be their friends but you could get the case where somebody would decide that it was better to keep them out, that they knew enough.  I am not trying to force this amendment but only trying to help the legislation, and I cannot see what the Minister will achieve in opposing it.  I do not think that paragraph 138 of the Report of the Committee on Wool Improvements is really relevant.</P>

      <P>The first thing that needs to be said is that you must look at the other side of the story.  We can see, in the very charitable way we have of looking at things here, that there will be members of the board who will be traders, who will be producers and those who will be neither one nor the other, but, taking traders and producers, can the Deputy see any merit in giving to those members of the board who are traders the right, even as members of the board, to enter, inspect and examine at all reasonable times the premises concerned?  It could be said by those who were so entered and inspected that they would have reluctance towards these inspections because some of the members would, in fact, be trade competitors.  This is a reason one might first think of.  Secondly, can the Deputy see any objection to these people, as a Comhairle, collectively particularly, or requesting a visit to any of these premises and being refused, being told to stay out, that they are not wanted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>That is right, but these are the supervisory personnel dealt with in the Committee's Report and that supervisory personnel, according to the Committee, which was a fair cross-section of the people in the business, recommended after full consideration that, on balance, the supervisory work had better be left to the Department's control.  It is really because, in their wisdom, knowledge and experience, they thought it best that this arrangement has been devised.  They must have had good reason for leaving this supervisory work to the personnel of the Department and authorising the Minister to do it in this Bill is only giving voice to what was recommended in that paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without doubt, because of the natural tendency of people in the trade, there possibly might be fear of the right of a member of the trade, a competitor to come in and look over the premises and poke around, as and when he likes, while it would not be expected that a member of the <Col N="852" /> Comhairle would be doing that for any ulterior purpose.  What I am saying is that the other members who would not be on the Comhairle could well feel this was not something to which they should be expected to submit and therefore they might develop some antagonism to the members of the Comhairle or the Comhairle itself. That is something I am sure the Deputy would not consider desirable.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported, I was dealing with this allegation made by the two Opposition speakers that the fact that advantage was not taken of the replacement by the people of the 1922 Irish Free State Constitution by the new Constitution in 1937 to amend the electoral system indicated an acceptance by the Fianna Fáil Party of this system of election as being the best, and that the enactment of this Constitution indicated a decision by the people in favour of this system of election which, as Deputies have pointed out, exists nowhere in the civilised world but here.</P>
      <P>I find it necessary to remind them of what exactly was the main purpose of the new Constitution that was drafted in 1937, that this was the culminating point of the initial stage of Fianna Fáil government which was mainly concerned with getting rid of the dominion status that had been accepted for this part of the country by the preceding Government.  As Deputies on the opposite benches will probably remember, each of the steps taken by the Fianna Fáil Government to get rid of these limitations on our sovereignty and these trappings of Dominion status was opposed violently by the Opposition Parties, that according as these things were frittered away, we got nearer and nearer to the position that Fianna Fáil was set up to establish, and that by 1937, it was feasible to move eventually for the replacement of this foreign-imposed Constitution by a Constitution under which the power of the Government stemmed from the Irish people and not from any foreign parliament or monarch.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite will probably remember that, great as was their opposition to the other steps that were taken to remove the limitations on our sovereignty, they made an all-out effort to ensure that at least the Constitution which set up the Irish Free State would be retained, and that they decided to leave no stone unturned to ensure that this status of a dominion and all the trappings of being part of the British Empire would be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will remember also they went so far as to organise a fascist movement in this county, clothed their <Col N="855" /> followers in Fascist uniforms and employed all the tactics that were responsible for the elimination of the system of democracy in other countries. They will recall that they used every possible argument and appealed to the sectional interests of different sections of the community to try to mobilise all possible opposition to that new Constitution.  On the basis of opposition to particular proposals in it, they may remember that they went so far as to try and organise the women's vote against us, alleging that it was the intention to confine women to the home and preclude them from taking any part in extra-mural activities.</P>
    <P>The important thing as far as the Government at that time were concerned was to get rid of the Irish Free State Constitution which was imposed with the Treaty under threat of war, was established in this country by the Opposition and has resulted to this day in the dismemberment of the country.  In an effort to ensure that the people would not reject this opportunity of giving themselves sovereign, independent status in this part of the country, the Government were naturally disposed to give the Opposition as few arguments as possible to use to cloud the issue, because at that time they were intent on confusing the issue, just as they are now. Obviously, to attempt at that time to deal with this question of electoral reform would have given the Opposition of the day another argument to use against the enactment of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I was not too young to see the knuckledusters and police batons of the Blueshirts in action.  I was not too young to see the efforts of the Blueshirts that Fine Gael employed to try to retain this status of a British dominion.  To attempt to deal with electoral reform at that time would, of course, have given the Opposition another argument to use in their determined effort to hang on to their position in the British Empire. This was all explained before to Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Higgins, but they insist on pretending that it was not, that the thing that was being done in 1937 was so important in itself that other things that were desirable had to be postponed. The Government would have been foolish to attempt to change the electoral system at that time, because the possible result would have been that we would also have retained the Irish Free State which it was desirable to get rid of.  I remember that we were described as Treaty breakers and so on and every effort was made to misrepresent what was being done so as to get every sectional group to vote against us.  The main objective was achieved at that time and it was at a later date that we moved to amend the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick again got up and advanced as an argument in favour of the retention of the present system of PR in multi-member constituencies&mdash; which both himself and Deputy O'Higgins insisted on discussing because they decided to avoid discussing the relevant point at this moment&mdash; the fact that as of this date it has not in fact resulted in a multiplicity of Parties, ignoring the fact that in previous times we have had a certain degree of multiplicity of Parties.  Even at this time we have a number of Parties who have not yet succeeded in getting representation here but who aspire to get such representation eventually. Now, when we see the forthcoming disintegration of the Fine Gael Party there is no reason to believe that we may not once again have this multiplicity of Parties represented here.  On the one hand, Deputy Fitzpatrick puts forward the fact that <Col N="857" /> we have not got a multiplicity of Parties as a recommendation in favour of the system while at the same time the main point on which he bases his argument is that the system is designed to secure representation for small sectional minority Parties.  Again, two contradictory arguments, but of course that is no obstacle to the Fine Gael Party.  They are quite hardboiled in putting forward two contradictory arguments on the same subject.</P>
    <P>Again we had the suggestion from Deputy Fitzpatrick that this system would result in the creation of safe seats.  I dealt with that adequately already on the subsection on which it was relevant.  I showed that it is the present system of multi-member constituencies that makes for the creation of safe seats on the basis of candidates scraping up votes here, there and everywhere over large widespread constituencies and being required only to get a fraction of the votes of the constituency in order to be elected and also as Deputy Fitzpatrick's colleague who spoke knows, on the basis of surplus votes gathered by another candidate who happens to command some considerable support in the constituency. In any case under any system of voting it is only the people who can create safe seats.  If the people want to continue electing a particular Deputy or to give representation to a political Party then they can do it under any system of voting.</P>
    <P>It was noticeable that neither Deputy Fitzpatrick nor Deputy O'Higgins made any effort to controvert the arguments that I put forward against the proposition of the transferable vote either in multi-member constituencies or, in particular, in single-member constituencies. They did not make any effort to explain why it should be that certain voters should get multiple voting powers and other voters should get one vote only.  They did not explain why for instance in Wicklow in the recent by-election the voters who voted for four candidates who were not elected should have had their preference votes treated as actual votes for other candidates, in some cases their seconds, thirds, fourths and fifths; in other cases their seconds, thirds and fourths, or in <Col N="858" /> others their seconds and thirds, and so on.  They did not explain why in some cases it was just their fifth votes which were taken into account and so on and why at the same time the larger number of 9,788 who voted for the candidate deemed, in accordance with the rules of the system not to be elected, should not get the same choice as was accorded to the 8,470 who got this favoured treatment.  The same applies to the East Limerick by-election.  They did not explain why the 10,151 who voted for the candidate who came second did not get a second choice while those who voted for others did. They did not explain what sin against democracy these people committed that their voting power should be downgraded with regard to other members of the community.  They did not attempt to do this because it cannot be done.  There is no democratic reason why one voter should get as many as five votes and others should get only one.</P>
    <P>Here again of course the Fine Gael Party just do not know where they stand.  The position so far as this Committee Stage is concerned is that subsection (1) which is establishing the position of single-member constituencies has been passed and the question we are dealing with now is the system of voting in the single-member constituencies.  Of course Fine Gael are incapable of considering this and that is why they insisted on dealing with this as if it was the Second Reading Stage rather than the Stage it is and because all they know is that Fianna Fáil have made a proposition and therefore they being the Opposition Party&mdash;they call themselves the principal Opposition Party&mdash;they have to oppose it.  In regard to Deputy O'Higgins's contribution which, as usual, consisted mainly of the type of personal abuse which is his main stock in trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I would like to deal with his proposition that the system we propose is a British system and that the system we propose to ask the people to get rid of is an Irish system.  It is a fact that the system we are proposing the people should adopt is the system the British people have for themselves.  I agree with that. Most other democracies have this system too, certainly most democracies in which democracy works with any kind of consistency, but the system we have here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;operates nowhere else but other systems almost as bad are to be found in other countries, in Belgium for example, where for over a period of six months they have found it impossible to form any Government. The Opposition Parties rely mainly on the creation of confusion and frustration and I can quite understand that they would like to see something similar developing here.  The system we have here, the system we are asking the people to get rid of, is a British-devised system.  It is a system invented in Great Britain by, as Deputy Dillon said, half lunatics, cranks and crackpots and so on.  It was not invented for themselves but for people like us who were shaking off the chains of British domination and invented to try to make government impossible for them. It was imposed with the 1922 Constitution which was ultimately responsible also, in combination with the 1925 Agreement, for the establishment of the Border.  It is sponsored mainly by an organisation, British-based, which apparently conducts its activities here and which is dedicated to trying to make sure that we do not get rid of the system imposed on us in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how this organisation is financed, but they make no effort, as far as one can see, to confer the benefits of the same system on their own country; at least, if they do, they do not make any impact on public opinion, certainly not enough impact to merit any mention in the newspapers. <Col N="860" /> They seem to operate here as a kind of adjunct of the Fine Gael Party.  For instance, in the two recent by-elections, they campaigned on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  This British organisation came over here and campaigned side by side with the anti-language organisation on behalf of the two Opposition Parties in the recent by-elections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins once more puts forward the ridiculous argument that the system we propose must result in the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil government.  There is an abject admission of the ineffectiveness of Fine Gael. In the circumstances which will exist when this system is adopted, in which there will be clear confrontation in 144 constituencies between Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour and whatever other small Parties may decide to contest the elections, the only result will be the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil. That is a clear admission that it is inconceivable now or in the future that Fine Gael or Labour, or any other Party that may contest elections, can ever hope to obtain greater support than Fianna Fáil in a majority of these 144 constituencies.  What is that but an admission that Fianna Fáil's policy is the best policy?  Despite all the efforts made by Fine Gael after practically every election to draft new policies, they have not yet succeeded in evolving something that could conceivably command more support than Fianna Fáil's <Col N="861" /> policy; and, what is more, they do not see any prospect of doing so in the future.  Either that or they contend that the people are not capable of choosing what is good for them; in other words, the people are not fit to operate the democratic system.</P>
    <P>Neither this system of election nor any other system can ensure the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil in government. The only thing that can ensure that is if we continue to retain the major support of the people, and the system we propose here will give the people a more effective way of getting rid of us, if they ever want to get rid of us.  We do not pretend to see as far into the future as Fine Gael Deputies pretend they can see, but we have sufficient confidence to believe that our Party is so soundly based that we will continue to retain the majority support and we have no fear of the more effective system of election we propose here or, indeed, of the system Deputy Norton proposes.  We are prepared to contest elections under any system.  If we were thinking only of maintaining the position of the Fianna Fáil Party, there is no reason why we should depart from the present system because the clearest indications that any Government could ever get of their favourable prospects for the future have been obtained by Fianna Fáil since the last general election.  We have done the impossible; we have won six by-elections out of seven.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, of course, knows more than I do about the potential calibre of Fine Gael candidates in single-seat constituencies and he may know that they would be incapable of putting up any kind of opposition to Fianna Fáil candidates on the basis of a clear confrontation in individual constituencies.  But Deputy O'Higgins should not despair of the future.  He should try to gain some of the confidence of his leader, Deputy Cosgrave, who believes apparently in the possibility that at some time in the future Fine Gael may become a Party with some little bit of backbone and they may have people then capable of competing on reasonable terms with Fianna Fáil candidates in the clear-cut circumstances we propose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This system of election cannot perpetuate Fianna Fáil.  The only thing that can perpetuate Fianna Fáil is if we continue to retain the support of the people.  We have confidence we will.  Apparently Fine Gael and Labour also have confidence that we will.  For that reason, the only thing they can <Col N="863" /> hope for is a continuation of a system that is designed to create indeterminate results.  It is admitted by Deputy Fitzpatrick to be designed with that object in view, with the hope, therefore, that these indeterminate results will eventuate occasionally and they will be able, when the election is over, to form some kind of coalition in which the different components of the coalition will be watching as the Vice-Chairman of the Labour Party said, for the opportunity to spring the trap on their colleagues.</P>
    <P>The proposal in subsection 1º, then, is to obtain for the people the benefits of the single-member constituencies and to get rid of the evils of multi-member constituencies.  The proposal that we are supposed to be discussing here is the establishment in this country, for the first time, of the democratic principle of one man one vote; to ensure, for the first time here, that every voter will be treated the same.  That is the fundamental principle of democratic government, that the voting power of every individual should be the same and that there should not be any attempt to allocate a differential voting power to some sections or some individuals in the community.  As I have said, even if there was to be such an attempt, to base, as the transferable vote does, the extent of the multiple voting power given on the smallness of the number of people who agreed with the particular view is the very opposite to the whole principle of democracy.</P>
    <P>I think this principle of establishing one man one vote is important also, while I fully agree with Deputy Norton that, important though it is, the importance of getting rid of the evils of multi-member constituencies and getting the advantages of single-seat constituencies is greater.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we in Fianna Fáil know from our experience in by-elections that we have nothing to fear from this system that Deputy Norton proposes but it is a wrong system; it is discriminatory; it discriminates between voters and it cannot be justified. The only argument that has been put forward for it is that it would be expedient <Col N="864" /> to accept it in the same way as it was expedient not to move for a changing of the electoral system in 1937 and it has not been shown that that is, in fact, the position.  We have no reason to believe that it is not possible to bring the arguments in favour of our proposal before the people.  We know that every effort will be made to prevent this.  We know that the arguments in favour will be hidden from the people by a lot of people who are in control of media of communications.</P>

We have every reason to believe that the people will accept the proposal that we are putting before them and, as I have said, it is only Deputy Norton's opinion that there would be a better chance, that the people would be more certain to get the advantages of single-seat constituencies, by accepting, even for the time being, this undemocratic system of counting the votes.  That may be but we have no reason, as yet as I have said, to believe that that is the position.</P>
      <P>In so far as I am concerned, as I have said before, the main thing is to get single-seat constituencies and the only justifiable system of voting is the straight vote.  We have no reason to be in any way apprehensive of either this system of voting that is proposed or any other system because it is what the people decide that will eventually decide who are to be elected representatives here and what Party is to be the Government.</P>

      <P>I believe that there is not a Deputy who does not agree that we should have single-seat areas because any Deputy who works&mdash;and the vast majority do work&mdash;is aware of the drawbacks of trying to serve the people in a multi-seat area.  It is bad enough for a city Deputy but I am sure it is even worse for a rural Deputy. I appreciate the fact that Deputy Norton tried to express a different opinion in the House but I am sure that all Deputies do want the single-seat area in order to keep in touch with constituents and to serve them, which is what we are sent in here for. One must have some means of keeping in close touch.  I suggest this is not easy in a multi-seat area.  I represent a three-seat constituency.  I am sure the other two Deputies in the area share my belief that they could serve the people much better, were that constituency divided into three areas, with a single Deputy representing each area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I understood what I was saying was actually relevant to the amendment.  It has been said by Deputy O'Higgins that the Government's idea is to perpetuate themselves in office.  As the Minister has rightly remarked, it is the people who decide this, and not we.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the fact that Mr. de Valera stressed the merits of the PR system, but that was in 1936 and to make a comparison with the present day is not quite fair.  In 1936 we were but a mere 14 years after the Civil War.  We had minorities in this country who were justified in thinking that their welfare would be ignored.  Therefore, Mr. de Valera decided to include in the Constitution this system of election. Since then, the actions of all Governments have assured minorities that they will not be penalised and we can progress to a more effective electoral system.</P>
      <P>What we now seek is a better system which will give us more stable government. It has been pointed out repeatedly this evening that we have stable government.  Like Deputy MacEntee, I believe that this was in spite of PR and not because of it.  All over the world today there is a cry for change.  While we all know it must come, I believe the time has arrived when we should let the winds of change blow through our electoral system so that we may have a system more in keeping with modern democracy.  The suggestion that there will be any injustice done under the Government's proposal is played out.  If the people study the proposal, they will have no doubt about what to do in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a grass-roots politician, I believe the changes we suggest would serve the country better than the present system.  A man standing for election would have to win his spurs by serving the people and not because he bore a famous name.  He would perhaps have to serve the people on a local council before coming here.  Whether there was a big money machine against him or <Col N="868" /> not, he could win the people's support. We feel that under our proposals the poorer man will have a better chance of election.  In the present system, we have the Party machines on all sides and an individual may suffer unless he is a very attractive candidate.  Under this system the common people can be represented and the grass-roots politician may take his place, despite the bigger interests.  In fairness, we have to give the people the opportunity of deciding this for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember 32 years ago when the Constitution, including PR, was before the people. The Fianna Fáil Party had to fight very hard at that time to overcome misrepresentation which sought to deprive the people of that Constitution. Fortunately, the people listened to us and decided to enact it.  Nobody who believes in democracy would today challenge the right of the people to make such a decision.  I hope when the referendum is held and the people have examined the arguments put forward by the Government and the Opposition, they will see that what we are trying to do is not to perpetuate Fianna Fáil in office but to give them a better system of choosing a more effective Government.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the state of some of the countries of Europe today&mdash;one country has had no Government for the past four months&mdash;one must see that a change is necessary, if the same position is not to obtain here.  The Fianna Fáil Government owe it to the people to give them the chance of saying: &ldquo;We believe that if you change other things in this modern age, you must also change the electoral system so we can have the best representation in the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  This may be the last chance any Government may have to give the people that opportunity.  I hope the people will seize it in their own interests and in the interests of democracy and go out and vote in favour of the Government's proposal.  I do not want to sound alarmist but I suggest that if some European countries a few months ago had decided to change their system of election, they would not be in the chaotic state they are in today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> The Government were right in 1936, despite the fierce opposition to the Constitution at the time.  We have since been proved right.  Even the Opposition agree we have a good Constitution, even though they fought against it bitterly then.  We are now giving the people a chance to perfect the electoral system and not to perpetuate Fianna Fáil in office.  The ironic fact is that if PR does not go, Fianna Fáil may be in office forever.  I want to thank Deputy Norton for putting his amendment.  At least it gave us a further opportunity of discussing the merits and demerits of the present system.  I conclude by again asking the people to come out and support this change.  It is not in our own interests we do it but simply in the interests of the people.</P>

      <P>I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that we deplore the utter waste of precious parliamentary time on this measure.  In a country so utterly underdeveloped, with a large number of people utterly underprivileged, it is an absolute disgrace that there should be so much precious parliamentary time taken up on this issue of PR, unwanted by the people and unannounced before the last general election.  Indeed, the self-same issue was arbitrated upon and decided upon by the Irish people only nine short years ago.  We deplore then this act of the Minister for Local Government in his power-crazy designs that he should for the past few months have utilised the major portion of the time of this Parliament to the utter disregard of the pressing needs of our people.  We say that this Minister, whose particular responsibility is in respect of housing, would be far better occupied in seeking to eliminate the slums and hovels of this country than in seeking to impose this measure on our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to point out that the Minister has embarked for a long time on filibustering, showing a contempt for parliamentary procedure. The position of the Labour Party in this matter is clear.  We have deliberately refrained from taking up the time of Parliament on this measure. We made our position crystal-clear in our speeches on the Second Stage.  On that occasion I spoke for three hours. I have no intention of repeating what I said, except to say that our views are as contained in the remarks and speeches of our leaders on the initial proposals in this House and again in 1958 an 1959.</P>
      <P>We are defending PR.  We see the designs of the Minister and his Government as an intention to copperfasten themselves in power for an indefinite period of time.  We sense in Fianna Fáil and its Ministers a weakening of morale.  They see obviously the writing on the wall for them as a political Party and they are availing of this opportunity, as they availed of the opportunity before Éamon de Valera left the leadership and went to the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>They have now resorted to this device of abolishing PR and creating the single-seat constituency for the ulterior motive of copper-fastening themselves in power and imposing <Col N="871" /> their tyrannical views on the Irish people.  Feelings abroad show that people are alert to this intention.  The feelings of our people are that they want this issue finalised quickly.  We want it decided and we have no doubt as to that decision.  Time is wasted in this House, and we say that the Minister, his Party and his Government should have the courage of their convictions and not dilly-dally any longer but take this issue speedily to the referendum and let it be decided on by the people.  We have no doubt that the decision will be that of nine years ago, but even more telling.  PR will be retained.  No one in this country wants a petty tyranny imposed on them and they know full well that Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin and his Cabinet will have his way in this matter.</P>

It was quite evident there was heart-searching in the Party and there were grave doubts as to the wisdom of abolishing PR.  There was a leaning towards Deputy Norton's amendment and he was hopeful that the Government would yield on this issue but the Minister hogged the time of Parliament in the most puerile way last week, awaiting the response to the cut and thrust of his argument, awaiting his colleagues views as to whether they would compromise and save their faces so that the Minister would have his way.

This is absurd.  On the contrary, it was the system adopted by Griffith and the founding fathers of our State.  That is essentially the Irish system of election and the Minister has forgotten that the system which he seeks to impose, the system of the single-seat constituency is gerrymandering by Fianna Fáil vikings.  That system is the essential British system, the Unionist system of election.</P>

They are there copperfastened in power, riveted for all time by reason of gerrymandering and by reason of the tyranny they have imposed on our Nationalist people there.  This is the system we are asked to have imposed on us.  But there is one significant thing about that system in North-East Ulster which has brought about a dictatorship for so long: outside of Russia and its satellites, outside Spain and Portugal, there is no legislation that has lasted so long as the legislation of the Craigavon and the Brookeborough regimes of North-East Ulster.  The denial of fundamental rights in North-East Ulster has shocked the conscience of all right-thinking people all over the world.</P>

It gives a certain amount of stability and in the system of the single transferable vote you have a fair representation of Parties.</P>

      <P>I would not trust Fianna Fáil or any Party with unbridled power of this kind.  We have good reason to mistrust these intentions. We believe they are for selfish motives by Fianna Fáil to maintain themselves in power.  By the support possibly of Fine Gael in the initial stages, or some element of that Party, the real intentions of Fianna Fáil were, as has been said by others, to seek to annihilate the Labour Party and minority groups in this House.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that their designs in this respect will not succeed and that Labour, industrially and politically, will fight this attempt every inch of the way, and by the grace of God, the Irish people will do as they did in 1959&mdash;give back the answer in a telling fashion that they will not have from Fianna Fáil or anyone else, that they will not allow them or anyone else, this attempt to set up here a dictatorship for an indefinite period. Indeed a dictatorship, as some Deputies have said, which would exclude from this House large minorities of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will force them to the barricades, and in this design Fianna Fáil might well be the sowers of dragons' teeth which will rise up as armed men and thereby tear down the pillars of our society and the very basis of our democratic system of government. They ought to see the signs in Europe's unrest, instability, violence and the revolutionary tendency and hold fast to a system of government which, in <Col N="876" /> the words of their esteemed leader, Éamon de Valera, has given us the best method of election which is best suited to the needs of our people.  The greatest truth of that is that, unfortunately, under this system of election Fianna Fáil have been in power during almost 30 years.  However, that obviously is not sufficient for them because they feel they have a mandate from God to rule indefinitely and, at the slightest sign of being shifted, they resort to the most unscrupulous method of copperfastening themselves to power.  This is the whole reason for their further attempt in nine years to abolish PR and substitute the straight vote and the single-seat constituency, which we are opposing in its entirety.  For us in this issue there is no compromise, no compromise between tyranny and the democratic rights of men to which we in this Party hold fast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend that I shall be able to address myself to the House in the eloquent terms of the Deputy who has just preceded me. Indeed, I am reluctant to intervene because I am only now in my fiftieth year as a Member of Dáil Éireann and I have not asked Deputy Fitzpatrick's permission to speak.  On the occasions upon which I have ventured to put in a word or two, I have had the rough edge of his tongue.  He seems, as a comparatively new boy, to think that he may rule the roost.  However, I timidly address myself to the issue as to whether the transferable vote is a good and effective instrument for securing a Government in a democratic state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he looks at the Continent of Europe as it is today, I think that the answer will be readily forthcoming. There parliaments are almost universally elected by some such method as that which we have here in operation and looking at the conditions as they are there, one cannot but have reservations in regard to this method.  We look to Belgium with a parliament <Col N="878" /> elected by the transferable vote in multi-seat constituencies.  It is still without a Government in the fifth month after its last general election. Belgium as a state, as a political entity in Europe is in danger of breaking up because they have a parliament elected according to a principle which tends to fragment Parties.  Some months ago the Netherlands was in the same position, and so also was Finland.  To-day we have Italy also convulsed in a crisis.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are entitled to ask one another, and the people, I think, are asking one another what about Ireland in the days to come if we persist in electing parliaments and the governments which are responsible for those parliaments upon this basis, according to this machinery.  The answer to that question which we have heard here in the House by those who do not think is: &ldquo;Ireland has not done so badly, has it, under PR?&rdquo;  Well, one can assent to that and say: &ldquo;No, not so badly, not so badly as it might have done&rdquo;, and then, of course, we are entitled also to ask the person who gives us that answer, &ldquo;Why not?  Why is it that here in Ireland we have had a degree of stability in government which has not been experienced elsewhere?&rdquo; The fact that we have had this reasonable stability has been due, not, I suggest, to the system of election, not to PR, but to the presence on the political stage of one great Party.  It is the existence of Fianna Fáil that has given some degree of stability to political life in this State and it has given it to us not because of PR but in spite of it.</P>
    <P>When one contrasts the situation which existed here from February, 1948, to June, 1951, and again from June, 1954, to February, 1957, with that which existed from 1932 to 1948 and from 1951 to 1954 and from 1959 until the present day, it clearly emerges what was the stabilising factor in our system.  It was this great Party, its policies and its leadership.  Again, let me emphasise that if we have reasonable stability in the administration and continuity of policy, development and progress in our social and industrial affairs as well, we have had it because <Col N="879" /> of Fianna Fáil.  It is not that the people have been supine under our leadership. It is not that they have not been able to thrust us aside if they were dissatisfied with our administration.  When they were dissatisfied with us, they turned us out and tried to find a substitute for us, first, in the multiParty Coalition in 1948 and then in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in 1954, but the people quickly found that the cure was worse than the disease. Neither of these coalitions lasted even three years.  Their inherent tensions destroyed them and they blew up, to be replaced again by Fianna Fáil&mdash;to be replaced by Fianna Fáil, let me repeat, in spite of PR.</P>
    <P>It has been urged by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Higgins that we have all the benefits and advantages of stable government here since 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat: we have had stability of government here for some 36 years, since 1932, of which Fianna Fáil has been in office for over 31.  If Fianna Fáil has been in office and the stability thus manifested has been due to PR, will those who urge us to retain that system tell us why were the Coalition governments driven from office if PR is a good system for electing a government. Why were the Coalition unable to maintain themselves in office?  Why, when they constituted the government of this country, did they lose every general election they fought as a government?  The only answer they can give to that question without incriminating themselves is that they lost office because of the system of election.  That is the only answer they can give, unless they are prepared to say: &ldquo;We lost office because we were a bad government&rdquo;, <Col N="880" /> and with that I would be disposed to agree.</P>
      <P>A Party with a strong national tradition, bound together by a common policy, might withstand the divisive influences of PR.  It would not fragment under the strain which the system imposes on its unity.  But a Party less cohesive, less firm in its convictions than is Fianna Fáil would succumb under PR as the Coalitions did.  But PR is bad not only because it tends to foster and encourage fragmentation of political opinion and of political activity.  It is bad also because it weakens the association, the communication between the people's representatives and the people themselves.</P>
      <P>The system of election by transferable vote is a weak system mainly because it is based on an inherent contradiction, that is to say, in certain circumstances a person's second choice is as valid as his first.  Not so long as the world is finite can this be.  A person's first choice in the opinion of him who makes it must always be superior to his second.  So, election by transferable vote is a system in which the result is based on the triumph of the second best and must always tend to produce an inferior parliament.  But this detrimental tendency, however, is aggravated when the transferable vote is combined with a multi-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the weaknesses of the transferable vote are aggravated when it operates in a multi-seat constituency, but the statement in converse would more accurately describe what I have in mind, that the evil, the great evil, the primary evil arising from the multi-seat constituency is heightened by the transferable vote.  Both of them tend to weaken democracy but the multi-seat constituency tends to do so in greater measure.  It may well be that we cannot get rid of both but if I had to choose between one or the other I would unhesitatingly opt to get rid of the multi-seat constituency. I would give to each constituency, to the electors and the people of each constituency, its own member.  I would give them a firmer voice in the election of their Deputy.  I would place on their Deputy an immediate and direct responsibility <Col N="881" /> that it is impossible to attach to one individual in the system we have today.</P>
    <P>I should like to say here a word about the primary duty of people in a democracy.  What is the fundamental obligation that rests on parliament?  It is the same in both cases.  It is to provide the community&mdash;whether the fundamental obligation rests on parliament or the electorate, it is the same in both cases&mdash;with a government that has the willingness, the steadfastness and the authority to rule.  Those are obligations that are being hardly fulfilled in these days.  They are certainly not being fulfilled in Belgium, Italy, Germany or France.</P>
    <P>Why is this?  It is because in all those countries responsibility is not firmly fixed on the representatives of the people and because of this the governments cannot rely on parliament to support them and, accordingly, they are unwilling to take up the gauntlet when lawless elements in society defy them.  The thoughtful members of our community look at those evils as they develop abroad.  They see them associated with one common factor, electoral systems which destroy civic and political cohesion so that authority is not firmly based and governments cannot withstand the mob.</P>
    <P>Our people want a change in the electoral system.  The figures for by-elections which have taken place in recent years indicate this.  It was strikingly manifested in East Limerick the other day but no less so in the by-elections which preceded that one. In each of them the number of electors who are refusing to operate proportional representation has been increasing. I have gone through the figures for five of the by-elections, the five in which transfers of votes actually took place.  In those elections there were 38,600 odd votes to be transferred. Of those 14,400 odd went to Fine Gael, 8,300 odd went to Fianna Fáil and 6,760 went to Labour but 9,090 votes were non-transferable, that is to say, almost 25 per cent of the voters did not exercise their right to express a second preference.  This, having regard to the strenuousness with which by-elections are fought, is a remarkable and <Col N="882" /> significant figure.  In a by-election as much energy and persuasiveness is devoted to obtaining second preference for one's preferred candidate as in endeavouring to secure firsts for them. Notwithstanding this, as I said, about 25 per cent of those people refrained from exercising their rights.  This indicates so far as they were concerned they had no use whatsoever and no regard for the virtues or merits of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>Four out of five of the by-elections I have referred to were won by the Fianna Fáil candidate.  Those were elections in which the Fianna Fáil candidates were not elected on the first count.  In the final results, however, there had been 78,794 votes cast for them in these five constituencies as against 7,649 for their opponents. Those 78,000-odd voters can be taken roughly as against proportional representation. We may add to that figure 9,090 who refused to state any second preference, repudiating, in fact, proportional representation in the most forceful way.  This makes in all almost 89,000 voters who were against proportional representation and roughly 70,000-odd voters who were more or less in favour of it.  In those circumstances why not give the people a chance to pronounce on the question?  Why not allow the people to express their views on this?  That is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced those Bills to amend the Constitution.  They cannot become law until they have been submitted to the people.  All we are doing is giving the people a chance, if they wish to affirm what their votes in the by-elections seem to indicate, that they really are not in favour of proportional representation. Of course, there is some difficulty here because the position is that there is no association between the Deputy and the people who have elected him under the present system.  As I said, we are in favour of single-seat constituencies. I cannot see any merits in the existing system and I have worked with it all my life.  I can see great merit from the people's point of view in everybody being able to say: &ldquo;John So-and-So represents my <Col N="883" /> constituency.  It does not matter what Party he belongs to.  My interests will be safeguarded with him.  He is my representative and if I am not getting what I am entitled to he will try to obtain it for me&rdquo;.  That is what will happen in a single-seat constituency. The people in the particular constituency will know that their representative will look after their interests. That can only be done in a single-seat constituency.  If I had a choice, as I said already, I would be prepared to opt for that rather than risk if I thought I was going to do it, losing both proposals, the abolition of the transferable vote, which I think is bad in itself for the reasons I have indicated, and the institution of the single-seat constituency.  Of course we are not in fact the final judges in this matter.  There may be differences of opinion about the transferable vote but I do not think there will be any difference of opinion amongst the vast majority of the people about the single-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The only question arising at the moment is whether we cannot allow the people, first of all, to determine for themselves whether they want the single-seat constituency or whether they want the present system of multi-seat constituencies to continue, or whether they want to replace them by the single-seat constituencies.  That is one question to which it is easy for them to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other question we are putting to them according to the Bill now before the House is: do they want not merely the single-seat constituencies but also the non-transferable vote?  That is a more difficult question for them to answer one way or another.  They are likely to be confused by it.  I wish we could discover some way whereby we could allow the people a full range of choice in this matter of whether they want to have the multi-seat constituencies with the transferable vote as we have it or the single-seat constituencies with the straight vote, which I certainly would like, or whether they would prefer, having regard to all the <Col N="884" /> circumstances, to accept the single-seat constituencies with the transferable vote.  I wish it were possible to put that issue to the people.  We should see if we can, because in relation to amendments of the Constitution, just as in relation to the enactment of the Constitution, it is the people's vote which makes the determination.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of praise about the 1937 Constitution.  What joy it gives my heart to hear the Constitution being praised from the Fine Gael benches.  We carried it in spite of Fine Gael, and indeed in spite of Labour&mdash; rather disappointingly in spite of Labour, having regard to their fidelity to James Connolly.  I would have hoped they would be on our side in relation to the Constitution but unfortunately for some reason or another they did not happen to be.  However, that is water under the bridge and there is no use in reminding them of it.</P>
    <P>It gives joy to my heart, and makes me really proud, that I had a hand in the drafting of the Constitution and, yes, advocating it before the House, to hear our friends on the Fine Gael benches laud it to the skies in the terms they have used.  We have heard them praising Mr. de Valera.  It is like water from the rock to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick and the rest of them praising Mr. de Valera.  He was an old man in 1966!  In the 50th year of the Rising in which he was such a distinguished figure, he was an old man whom they attempted to traduce from one town to another throughout the length and breadth of this island. It is grand to hear them quoting him as an authority.</P>
    <P>Dev never believed he was infallible. He was prepared on conviction and on argument to change his mind.  He did change his mind in 1959.  It does not matter in 1968 what Dev said in 1937 any more than it matters what the late Mr. W. T. Cosgrave said in 1927 about PR or what Mr. J.A. Costello, or more recently, Mr. Dillon or Mr. McGilligan said about it.  All these things do not matter.  What matters is what the people are thinking and saying today. What we are asking the Dáil to do is <Col N="885" /> to give the people the opportunity of answering that question and can anything be done to allow them to have the question presented in a form which will enable them to have a full range of choice.  If that cannot be done, we will either stand or fall on the questions as presented in the Bill.  The question is whether we are going to abolish not merely the multi-seat constituencies but also the transferable vote.  The abolition of the multi-seat constituencies and the creation of the single-seat constituencies would be one safeguard to democracy which we do not possess today.</P>

I would be less than sincere if I allowed that statement to pass without putting on the records of the House, even in 1968, that we had stability here from 1922 to 1932, in spite of the Fianna Fáil Party, and notwithstanding the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party in those days refused to recognise this State and were robbing the banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In 1966, all the Parties, the three political Parties represented in Dáil Éireann, agreed that an informal committee should be set up to review the constitutional, legislative and institutional basis of government.  That committee duly sat and was composed of a number of Members of this House including Deputies David Andrews, Don Davern who was subsequently replaced by Deputy Seán Lemass, Seán Dunne, Denis Jones, Robert Molloy, Thomas F. O'Higgins, Gerard Sweet-man and James Tully, and Senators James Dooge, Michael O'Kennedy and Eoin Ryan.  It was presided over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley.</P>

      <Col N="888" /> Now, as I have said, part of the function of that committee was to consider the constitutional position and to make recommendations.

However, there is one thing it did not consider and there is one thing that was not proposed at that committee and that is that we should have, as a system of election to this House, the relative majority system or the non-transferable vote in a multi-member constituency because at page 22&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the debate goes on, we are having speeches like Deputy MacEntee's and Deputy Booth's and we are getting to know, bit by bit, that we have not unanimity on this matter within Fianna Fáil.  What I want to know is why it was not discussed then.  But we do know, from page 22, paragraph 61 of the report of that Committee, that the question of adopting a different electoral system for Dáil Éireann elections was considered by the Committee.</P>
      <P>The substitution of the present system of proportional representation by the Alternative Vote was proposed and the arguments adduced for and against are set out hereunder.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party and, as far as I know, the Labour Party, opposed that proposal to change the system.  Therefore, I think it is not unreasonable for me to assume that the arguments put forward in favour of a change were put forward by the Fianna Fáil Members, including Deputy Seán Lemass and the others in that Committee. These proposals contained statements such as this which appears in sub-paragraph (k) on page 24 of the Report of the Committee on the Constitution, December 1967:</P>
      <P>The one most likely to find favour with the public is the Alternative Vote.</P>
      <P>We do not agree with the alternative vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At sub-paragraph (m), on the same page, the argument put up by the Fianna Fáil Members reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The elector would have the consolation of knowing that, as under the present system, in the event of his vote being ineffective in respect of one candidate it could then be transferred to another candidate who was one of his subsidiary choices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will accept that.  Fianna Fáil had every opportunity of making their attitude on PR known in this document, the Report of the Committee on the Constitution, and there is not one word of the proposal contained in these Bills in this document.  Not until after this Report came out and was circulated did the Fianna Fáil Party announce <Col N="894" /> their intention of abolishing PR.  We have said, and I want to repeat, that the Fianna Fáil Party hope for an immediate windfall from the election following the abolition of PR, if they succeed in abolishing it, and also as a result of that windfall, they hope to stifle political activity and in that way establish themselves as a one-Party dictatorship.</P>
      <P>Under the straight vote, Fianna Fáil on the pattern of the last local elections would secure 65 per cent of the seats in this House with less than 40 per cent of the votes.  That is a fact that cannot be denied.  Under PR Fianna Fáil, or any Party with their strength in the country, secure a share of the seats in Dáil Éireann slightly greater than their share of the votes but not completely out of line with their share of votes.  I shall give some examples. In 1954 Fianna Fáil got 43 per cent of the votes and 44 per cent of the seats.  In 1957 they got 48 per cent of the votes and 53 per cent of the seats.  In 1961 they got 43 per cent of the votes and 48 per cent of the seats.  In 1965 they got 47 per cent of the votes approximately and 50 per cent of the seats.  We see that the larger Party, even under PR, get what might be described as a bonus of seats but it is not altogether out of proportion to the percentage of the votes they get. But the Minister for Local Government and the view of his Party whom he is able to pressurise into agreeing with him are not content with that.  They want to get a far greater share of the seats than the votes justify.  Under the system which they propose, they want to obtain a share of the seats up to three-fifths greater than the share of the votes&mdash;65 per cent of the seats for 40 per cent of the votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting it to the House that that is unreasonable and unfair and calculated to stifle political talk and activity.  The first past the post system can be unstable.  A shift of one per cent in the vote can mean a shift of six per cent.  An increase of one per cent in a vote for a Party can mean an increase of from six to seven per cent in the seats, and a decrease of one per cent in the vote can mean a decrease of six to <Col N="895" /> seven per cent in the seats.  Of course, I do not have to tell the Minister for Local Government that if he puts this through, he will get 65 per cent of the seats with 40 per cent of the votes, because he knows it perfectly well. That is the very reason he is making this proposal and that is the very reason he is trying to put it to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a long argument here today about the transferable vote being in contravention of one man one vote.  I have already pointed out that not one of his colleagues on the Constitution Committee put forward that argument.  As a matter of fact, while the Minister for Local Government here seems to see something inherently wrong, something unfair and inequitable in the transferable vote, his colleagues on the Constitution Committee were putting forward that argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The proposal of the Government to institute this first-past-the-post system of election is repugnant to the Irish sense of fairplay.  I often wonder if the Minister and the Government believe as passionately as they say that PR should be got rid of, why they did not experiment with it in the local elections since 1959, when apparently they first dedicated themselves to the abolition of PR.  It would not take a <Col N="897" /> referendum to get rid of the PR system in local government.  They could have done that by a simple Act of Parliament.</P>

They did not dare to do that, because they knew that if they did the shortcomings of the proposal would be quite apparent.</P>
      <P>I repeat that there is only one idea behind this proposal of the Fianna Fáil Party to abolish PR and introduce single-member constituencies and that is to rig the constituencies, to gerrymander the constituencies, to get 65 per cent of the seats for 40 per cent of the votes, to stifle political thought in the country, and to set up a one-Party dictatorship.</P>

      <P>I have to extend to him the courtesy of a reply to the few points he did make.  My opinion that it was really an attempt to delay is reinforced by the fact that he sought to widen the debate by discussing such questions as the housing situation and postal voting.  I do not propose to cooperate with him to the extent of discussing these things, although I would be prepared to discuss them with him at any time when they would be relevant. The peculiar thing was that although his own contribution was largely on the subject of irrelevancies such as that, he started off by deploring what he described as the waste of time on this Committee Stage of the Bill. Anybody who looks through the debates will see that so far as contributions from this side of the House are concerned, they have all been made in reply to points made from the opposite side of the House.  If a question of a waste of time arises, Deputies would need to look at the debate on Second Reading when, as I pointed out, of the 19 members of Deputy Treacy's Party 15 of them spoke, practically the full representation and as Deputy Treacy pointed out he himself spoke for three hours. Fifteen out of the 19 repeating the same arguments was not a bad effort on the part of a Party of 19 Deputies to take up a considerable amount of the time of the House on this subject.  Again, as I pointed out, 21 of the Fine Gael Party spoke and that of course is almost the full number of Fine Gael Deputies who supported the proposition to oppose this proposal for electoral reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the Fine Gael all-night meeting.  Deputy Treacy again went back to the argument which other Deputies have been using that because a referendum held nine years ago did not succeed, because it was defeated by a very small margin, by a number of votes which in fact was less than the number of spoiled votes, there is something undemocratic in the Government suggesting that the people should have another opportunity of ridding themselves of this system, ridding themselves of its disadvantages, evils and dangers and getting for themselves the advantages of single-seat representation.  In view of the fact that numbers of new voters have come onto the register since 1959 and numbers of voters who voted at that time for the retention of the system have gone off the register, how he can suggest that there is something undemocratic in the Government responding now to the unanimous demands of their own Ard Fheis to give the people a further opportunity of avoiding the dangers inherent in this system is something I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There cannot be anything undemocratic about it because it is only the people who vote in the Referendum who can decide.  It cannot be done by the Dáil.  We are merely asking the people to rid themselves of the dangers inherent in this system.  Again we had the suggestion that this was an action taken by the Minister for Local Government. I want to assure Deputy Treacy that it is only in the type of government that his Party favours, in Coalition Governments, that Ministers act as individuals.  In Fianna Fáil Governments, decisions are taken by the Government.  I can quite appreciate that a Party, having the views that were expressed on television by the vice-chairman of the Labour Party last week, cannot conceive of a Government acting as a unit, but the Fianna Fáil Government always act as a unit, and that is why they have been able to remain in office for such a long period. The position in Fianna Fáil Governments is not the position outlined by <Col N="900" /> the vice-chairman of the Labour Party, of individual Ministers watching for the opportunity to spring the trap on their colleagues.</P>
    <P>We again had the allegation that the answering of points made by the Opposition, the giving of information that was requested, constituted a filibuster and Deputy Treacy also repeated the case made by his colleagues in Coalition, the Fine Gael speakers, that the intention of this Bill was to copperfasten the Fianna Fáil Party in power indefinitely.  I have already asked the Opposition Parties to explain how in the circumstances that would be established when the people make this electoral reform, Fianna Fáil must remain in power indefinitely.  How can they, claiming to have better proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs, maintain that in these circumstances, where each Party will go before the people in a clear confrontation in 144 separate constituencies and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Fine Gael and Labour will each not be able to convince more people in the majority of these constituencies than we can that their proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs are better?  This can only mean an admission by them that not alone have they not got better proposals now but that they see no prospect whatever&mdash;despite the full time policy drafting committee that Fine Gael have in operation&mdash;at any time in the future of evolving such a policy. If that is so, if they cannot put forward or hope to put forward a better policy than Fianna Fáil's policy that would command more support from the people, then is there not every reason why the people should continue to have Fianna Fáil in Government? It is well known to the Opposition that if the people ever want to get rid of Fianna Fáil as the Government this system will give them a better opportunity of doing so.  It must be well known to them also that there is absolute proof available that under <Col N="901" /> the present system of election Fianna Fáil will be the Government after the next general election.  That is as far into the future as anybody can reasonably pretend to be able to foresee but the fact that even with this system of election, which is loaded against majority Parties, we have succeeded as a Government in winning six out of seven by-elections is proof that in the next general election, if it is held under this system, we will once again be the Government.  However, there is no proof of what will happen if the system we propose is established.</P>
      <P>We again had the allegation that the system we propose is the British system.  I dealt with that allegation before today.  I do not propose to deal in detail with it again.  I admit the system we are proposing is the system the British have chosen for themselves; the system we have is the system the British chose for us and, on their own admission, for a purpose.  The purpose was put on record here by Deputy Dowling in volume 233, column 1615 of the Official Report.  Proportional representation was first brought in for the local elections and it was extended to parliamentary elections under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. Deputy Dowling quoted the British Attorney General, Mr. Samuels:</P>
      <P>At the general election on the parliamentary franchise, 75 per cent of the representatives has gone over to the Sinn Féin Party.  What is the declared object of that Party?  It is to make local government in Ireland absolutely impossible and to break down the British reign and rule in Ireland by capturing local bodies...</P>
      <P>Who are you going to trust the administration of these things to? Are you going to trust them to bodies elected on the present franchise and under the present machinery&mdash;bodies which have been absolutely captured by people who call the rest of the United Kingdom &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo;, and whose object is to break down the rule of the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; and make the whole administration in Ireland impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was to frustrate this effort by the Irish people that the British Government introduced this system of election <Col N="902" /> and they insisted on its being retained in the constitution they imposed on the country, with the Treaty, in 1922. Both systems then can be described as British, one being the system they adopted for themselves and the other the system they imposed on rebel dominions like ours.  Obviously this was done for the purpose of frustrating the newly emerging state governing itself effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputies have admitted that the purpose of the system is to provide for the representation of every small minority; in other words, it is designed to promote fragmentation.  It is designed to make it impossible for the people, because of the diversity of narrow sectional interests, to choose a government.  It is designed to bring about the situation Deputy MacEntee has demonstrated exists in so many Continental countries which operate systems almost as bad as ours.  The only thing that has saved the situation here is the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party has been so solid and has so well interpreted the wishes of the people, thereby retaining the major support in the country.  It is only because of that that fragmentation, the primary purpose of the system, has not, in fact, resulted so far in this country.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the system we propose exists in Britain.  It exists in a large number of other countries as well.  It exists in most of the stable democracies, but the system we have does not exist anywhere else and it would not exist here were it not for the fact that the British Government, as shown by the Attorney General, Mr. Samuels, imposed it here for the purpose of frustrating the attempt by the Irish people to overthrow British rule.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy alleged that it was the system of election we propose that established the situation that exists in the North-Eastern part of the country. That situation was established by Deputy Treacy's colleagues on his left who, in 1925, endorsed the Boundary Agreement which drew a boundary designed to include the maximum possible area which could be held from control by the Irish people because the majority, controlled by the Orange <Col N="903" /> Order, were convinced they should remain part of the United Kingdom rather than throw in their lot with their fellow countrymen.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Treacy, too, revealing the acceptance by his Party of the position of the Labour Party as a minority group in Parliament.  If that is all the Labour Party aspire to be, that is their business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The present system ensures the continuance of the Labour Party as a minority group.  The proposals by the Government that the people should be given this opportunity of giving themselves a more rational electoral system was described by Deputy Treacy as unscrupulous.  It is the people who will decide whether or not they will continue with the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made some further points, though not in regard to Deputy Norton's amendment proper. He dealt, first of all, with stability of government from 1922.  The only point I should like to make is that during all that time the Government was, in fact, a minority government.  In 1923 the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had 39.2 per cent of the votes and 41 per cent of the seats.  In June, 1927, they got 27.4 per cent of the votes and 30 per cent of the seats and, in September, 1927, they got 38.4 per cent of the votes and 40 per cent of the seats. Throughout all that time there was a Government in office with a minority of votes and a minority of seats. Deputy Fitzpatrick then went on, allegedly, to quote from the report of the informal Committee set up to study the Constitution and purported to read certain of the viewpoints in that report as having emanated from the Fianna Fáil representatives on that Committee, although these are arguments that we <Col N="904" /> are familiar with from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that there was a gentlemen's agreement between Committee members not to disclose expressions of opinion by fellow-members of the Committee.  If this is to be abandoned, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has purported to abandon it, it is quite on the cards that the expression of opinion by some of the Fine Gael members to the effect that they were in agreement with single-seat constituencies and the straight vote will be quoted here. Deputy Fitzpatrick invited various members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were on that Committee to come in here and discuss what was discussed between the members of the Committee and I should like to remind Deputy Fitzpatrick that if that proposition is to be accepted, certain members of the Fine Gael Party who were on that Committee will find themselves being quoted as being not alone in favour of single-seat constituencies but also of the straight vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick still refused to discuss the main argument against this proposal of the transferable vote in single-seat constituencies.  He refused to state just why it is, on what democratic grounds, some of those voters who fail under this system to elect the candidate they voted for are given a second chance; why some are given a second and third vote; why some are given a second, third, fourth, fifth, all equal votes, and why others who under this system fail to elect their candidate are given one vote only. I invite Deputy Fitzpatrick to tell me in what way the 9,788 voters who voted for the Fianna Fáil candidate in Wicklow disqualified themselves from having the same attention paid to their votes as was paid to the votes of the 191 who voted for the Independent candidate and the others who voted for other candidates who were not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be elected in accordance with the peculiar and undemocratic principles of this system of the transferable vote.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that if the post-election manipulation of the votes in the Wicklow by-election had been carried out in a non-discriminatory way, it was beyond all doubt that the according <Col N="905" /> of similar treatment to the Fianna Fáil voters as was accorded to other voters would have established the Labour candidate as having substantially more support in the constituency than the Fine Gael candidate. The Opposition are pretending to believe that this post-election manipulation of the votes established a majority in favour of the Fine Gael candidate but I say it did not and it is demonstrable that it did not.  It did that on the basis of according favoured treatment to the 8,470 of the total of 18,258 who did not vote for the Fine Gael candidate and of victimising the 9,788 of that number who were not given this differential voting power group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if they were all treated in the same way, we would definitely, beyond all doubt, have established that there was a majority in favour of at least two of the candidates&mdash;an over-all majority in favour of at least two&mdash;and it is quite possible that if everybody was treated the same we would have established that there was a majority in favour of three and, of course, you can get that absurd result only because of one reason, that is, that the whole operation is based on the absurd assumption that an expression of opinion that a candidate is second best or third best or second worst is the equivalent of an expression of support as an indication that a candidate is the best.  Again, I ask the Deputies opposite to tell me on what democratic principle the 10,151 Labour voters in Limerick were not accorded the same treatment as the 10,039 who voted for the Fine Gael candidate and the 1,209 who voted for the Liberal candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that since that election the Labour spokesmen have been claiming that they did their work for the coalition better than the Fine <Col N="906" /> Gael people did, that they had succeeded in directing the people who supported their candidates as to how they should dispose of their preference votes more effectively than Fine Gael and I think they have the same entitlement to show that as the people who voted for the Fine Gael candidate had.  I can see no reason, and nobody on the opposite benches has attempted to put forward any reason, as to why the voters who found themselves in the smallest group should have three votes, those who found themselves in the second smallest group should have two votes and those who voted for the candidate who got the second greatest number of votes should have got only one vote.</P>
    <P>In fact, the position is that the people in Limerick indicated that there were 6,500 more of them in favour of the Fianna Fáil candidate than there were in favour of any other candidates and there is no possible system to prove otherwise than what the people have said in the ballot boxes and, certainly, this system, based on the ridiculous assumption of equating a preference vote to the nth degree, to an actual vote in the case of some voters and some voters only, is the most ridiculous method that it would be possible to conceive of to try to disprove what the people have said in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have just refused to justify this discrimination because, of course, it is contrary to the whole principle of democracy; it is contrary to the principle of one man, one vote which is the inherent principle of democracy. That is what we are proposing to establish here, that every man's vote should be treated in the same way&mdash;one man, one vote.  That is what this subsection proposes to establish.  Deputy Fitzpatrick described this as being repugnant to the idea of fair play.  I do not think so.  I should think that it is inherent in the idea of fair play that every person's vote should be treated the same and that if one group are entitled to differential voting because they fail to elect their candidate, then another group who fail to elect their candidate under this system are entitled to the same consideration.</P>
    <P>The other subsection, I agree, proposes <Col N="907" /> to establish the much more important principle of single-seat constituencies. The only argument I have heard in favour of this proposal is the argument put forward by Deputy Norton that it would be more expedient to accept this system of voting, but he has not given any indication that it would in fact be more expedient to do this.  We have no reason to believe that, despite the control of the means of propaganda exercised by the Opposition Parties, it will be impossible for us to put before the people the overwhelming arguments in favour of what we propose.  We have confidence that the experience the people have had since and the turnover of voters that there has been will result in the people deciding to take this opportunity of avoiding the dangers inherent in this present system.</P>
    <P>We have obviously got no reason to fear either the system Deputy Norton proposes or any other system of counting votes.  We have confidence that the people will continue under any system of voting to express their continued support of the Fianna Fáil Party and we merely put forward this system of voting because we know it to be the only one it is possible to justify.  We have no indication that any other system would be more acceptable to the Opposition.  In fact, we know it would not.  The Opposition are obsessed with one thing, with suspicion and dread of any proposal put forward by Fianna Fáil.  They are so obsessed that they are unable to consider any proposition put forward on its merits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy mentioned nationality when speaking of the system of election.  I cannot see it is in any way relevant whether the system of election is a British or an Irish system.

I think it was Daniel O'Connell who said that the fact you were born in a stable does not make you a horse.</P>

I do not think it is important whether the person who conceived the system was English or Irish or what his nationality was. Surely it is the merits of the system we should be concerned about?  When it comes to merits, it is perfectly obvious to the vast majority of Deputies that the single seat constituency is overwhelmingly superior to the multi-seat.  In any event, for Deputy Treacy's benefit, it was the straight vote system&mdash;Deputy Tom O'Higgins said it was not democracy at all&mdash; which elected such people as Keir Hardie, Ramsay McDonald, Clem Attlee, Harold Wilson and some of the gentlemen in the socialist states in Eastern Europe, so he should not knock it too hard.  It seems to be the socialist method of electing people.</P>

      <P>If they would stop interrupting me, I would do so.  It gives me no pleasure to speak like this.  The new faces we see in the Labour Party are well worth another look at and I hope the people will know what they are voting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merits and demerits of PR were mentioned at some length and it seems unnecessary to mention them again.  At the time the State was set up we had just emerged from a civil war and the minority groups may not have been as secure in their minds so far as representation is concerned as they undoubtedly are now.  In the time of stress we had then, the PR system was probably the best system we could have had.  The fact that stability came so quickly and that we overcame the effects of the Civil War is proof that it had merit and was justified at that time.  But the same argument could be made for the steam engine.  There was a time when the steam engine fulfilled a purpose.  It was part of the industrial revolution.  But I do not think anyone in the world of to-day would <Col N="910" /> be prepared to say that it should be retained forever and that we should refuse to evolve more efficient types of machinery.  We have come to the same stage politically in our constitutional development.  We are ready to evolve something different.  I think that the single seat is so obviously more efficient than the multi-seat that to refuse to accept it is to prove we are unsuited to occupy this House, that we simply do not want to progress but to stay in the same underdeveloped state forever.</P>
    <P>Replying to me, the Minister repeated one argument he has made several times, that he was mainly concerned with the system of securing single seats and less concerned with the method of voting.  He has made it quite clear he does not like what was described as the single transferable vote.  He is not prepared to accept that as a matter of expediency and he does not see it to be necessary, but I have to make a case for this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that a mere Independent Deputy has not the organisation behind him to enable him to produce proof, certainly at short notice, that the public believe and feel as I do about this.  I would not have tabled this amendment or gone to such considerable trouble as I have were I not firmly convinced that what I am proposing in this House as reform is necessary.  The Minister proposes that the single seat and straight vote must be conceded.  All I can say to the Minister is that since I first indicated that I was about to table this amendment, I have spoken to some 800 to 1000 people, mainly at business rather than political functions and people who would not normally discuss politics with me.  These people went out of their way to reassure me that their feelings in the matter were that the amendment I proposed was the correct one and the most feasible step the Government should take.  People are not happy about the single seat and the straight vote at this time.</P>
    <P>Each day I meet more and more people who hold this view.  In fact, since I spoke in the House today 11 people whom I had never seen before told me that this was their view and <Col N="911" /> pressed me to communicate to the Minister that this was the general public feeling.  I believe that half a loaf is better than no bread and I am convinced that the Minister's stubbornness is leading the Government to defeat. There is no question of principle involved. It is quite clear in regard to the single seat that my objective is the most appropriate at the moment.  There is no loss of principle or face involved. It is a question of which method is the most likely to succeed.</P>
    <P>This amendment which I propose is, in fact, based on experience of by-elections which have taken place since the foundation of the State.  It is based on a system which is known to the people, which involves no change, which has been tried and found to be successful.  If I might quote the ex-Taoiseach, Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, he said that the system we have we know; the people know it and on the whole it has worked pretty well.  This is what can be said about the single-seat constituency and the transferable vote.  We have had this system in the State since it was established and it has worked well.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said it was a most democratic method and I do not think anybody considers otherwise than that if we are sincere in introducing reform, there is no reason why Members on all sides of the House should not accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>I have to some extent suffered a certain amount of abuse from all sides of the House, and I have gone to considerable trouble to bridge the gap between the Government and the Opposition Parties.  I have tried to distribute blame or praise where I saw fit and as an Independent Deputy I feel I should make that known.  I have not met with success but I considered it the right thing to do, no matter what people in this House think to the contrary.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion I should like to make to the Minister if he finds that the single-seat and the transferable vote are not acceptable to him. There is another way to approach this problem.  The main objection to the straight vote as specified by the Opposition Parties has been that the immediate <Col N="912" /> effect would be to give Fianna Fáil an overwhelming majority.  I do not accept that but it is the allegation the Opposition have made.  For that reason, they have accused the Government of introducing this vote change for the sole purpose of copper-fastening themselves in power.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have denied this and I have no difficulty in accepting their denials.  This certainly has not been what motivated me.  My ambition in life is not to keep Fianna Fáil in office for ever, nor indeed to keep any Government in office for ever.  The members of the Government Front Bench and the members of the Opposition Front Benches are all people who, I feel, are men of integrity and honour and there need be no fear of what might happen to the country if any of them hold office.  We do not know how long these people will continue as members of the Government. Ministers come and go and we do not know who the future members of the Government may be.</P>
    <P>As a man with a family, I am concerned to see that the future wellbeing of my family and the children of the country in general will not be in the hands of any dictatorial group. I would in no circumstances condone bringing this about.  Bearing this in mind, dictatorship is not the reason that attracts me to the straight vote, nor indeed is the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil in office, or Deputy Liam Cosgrave perpetually in office or other Members of the Opposition Front Benches.</P>
    <P>Being realistic, we want to make some constitutional progress with more representatives of the Government introduced.  The single-seat constituency and the transferable vote is a system which the people know and, in the views of Ministers, this was agreed to as a matter of principle but objected to as being inefficient.  We could evolve many methods of election which would be efficient but which might be elaborate.  I would like to see the single seat introduced in the interests of efficiency and in the interests of progress.  It has been suggested on some television programmes that a computer based system should be tried.  The <Col N="913" /> number of Deputies in all Parties would be practically the same if we had the single-seat constituency with the single transferable vote and the change between one Party and another would be extremely small.  Therefore would the Minister be prepared to consider the introduction of the single-seat constituency and the straight vote in principle but, in order to allow the Opposition to readjust themselves mentally and physically in their constituencies, perhaps give some generous period of transition&mdash;say, ten or 12 years&mdash;before bringing in the new system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment simply because I believe the Minister for Local Government does not really appreciate the importance of the question I have tabled.  I have had several representations from constituents because of their difficulties in this respect and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and to enter into some agreement with his opposite number in Stormont involving reciprocal arrangements. Many people, particularly in my constituency, are affected by this law.  I understand that under the present law the Minister cannot do anything about it.  However, it is a bad law and the Minister should change it.  After all, that would only be democracy working as it should work.  That is why we elect Governments: if we believe in democracy, we elect a Government to bring in laws suited to the people's needs, laws which the people want. Against that background, I implore the Minister to enter into preliminary talks with his opposite number in Belfast with a view to arriving at a reciprocal agreement with that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been elected to the House to represent a Border constituency I have no doubt you, Sir, have come across <Col N="914" /> many of the difficulties I have posed in my question.  Let us consider the case of a clergyman of any denomination who is transferred from Derry to Donegal.  In Derry, he had been a licensed driver during 20 or 30 years but when he arrives in Donegal, he must do a driving test.  Having driven all those years in Northern Ireland, he must here submit himself to a test.  Let us take the case of a person who gets married and goes from one side of the Border to the other.  He, too, is caught in the trap.</P>
    <P>Our Road Traffic Act is recognised as being a reasonably good code.  It shows that an attempt has been made by a Fianna Fáil Government to bring in reasonably good legislation to control the issue of driving licences.  On both sides of the Border, this legislation has been recognised as being good and therefore there is no reason why the Minister should feel embarrassed by entering into preliminary negotiations with his opposite number in Stormont, with a view to the recognition here of driving licences issued by the Northern Ireland authorities and of their recognising our driving licences.  For instance, I cannot see why a person in Bundoran&mdash;we heard a lot about Bundoran during the past week or fortnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man from Bundoran goes to Sligo&mdash;a man who has held a licence under the County Donegal licensing authority&mdash;all he has to do is to go to the relevant authority in Sligo, to the local taxation office there, and they will find out whether he has held a licence in Donegal and will recognise that.  I cannot see why the same arrangement should not hold good if he goes, say, to Enniskillen&mdash; why the Fermanagh authorities should not be able to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say he is occupied with more important business but at least he can agree to have a talk with <Col N="915" /> his opposite number in Belfast and see what he is prepared to do in this important matter which affects so many people, particularly in Border areas. Let us take the case of a licensed driver from Northern Ireland who comes across to Donegal as a weekend tripper.  Unfortunately, he may take one too many, is apprehended by the Garda in Donegal, is charged and found guilty of drunken driving and, as a result, has his driving licence suspended here.  That suspension can be enforced only in Donegal.  That man is legally entitled to drive in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I am in favour of abolishing the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is, here is something he can do.  If the Minister agrees that a person from Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Buncrana, may go to any other county and is entitled to get a licence from the local authority of that county, why does he object to that man getting the same facilities if he goes to live in the North?  I take the Minister at face value in his reference to the Border but why does he blow hot and cold on the subject matter of my question?  I want to know what the Minister intends to do about this bad law.  He may not be fully alive to all its aspects or appreciate the difficulties there are for so many people.</P>
      <P>On 31st March, 1966, I addressed a similar question to the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, who was taken to task by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan on the matter of an amendment of the driving test regulations. Deputy P. O'Donnell also raised the matter.  The Minister that day, reported at column 537 of the Official Report, volume 222, said:</P>
      <P>I am fully alive to the problem, but the House will appreciate that these regulations are made under international agreements....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How alive was Deputy Blaney to this problem two years and three months ago when, in the meantime, he has done nothing?  How alive has his successor, Deputy Boland, been to the matter since he came to occupy that <Col N="916" /> office 18 months ago?  This is typical of the red tape in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  They are more preoccupied with the pursuit of their own political existence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has this much to do with it&mdash;that when I address a question to the Minister for Local Government, a straightforward question, I should get a straightforward reply. When I ask him a straightforward question, oozing with commonsense, he tells me he is not concerned and gives most unsatisfactory replies to my supplementary questions.  I believe that the Minister should appreciate the difficulties here and that he should, without any further delay, communicate with his opposite number in Belfast and ask him to enter into some reciprocal agreement.  Indeed, I understand you would have to do that with Britain but at this stage if the Northern authorities could agree with our Minister, this would meet the case to a major degree.  I can assure the House that clergy of all denominations find, when they are transferred from one side of the Border to another, that they are embarrassed by having to do a driving test twice or possibly three times during their lifetime in spite of the fact that they have always held a licence and have never allowed it to lapse.  People who transfer residence from one side of the Border to the other find themselves in the same dilemma.  This is unfair and I think there should not be laws like this for people who want to abide by the law.</P>
      <P>Those are the reasons I make this appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position.  I can assure him if I were a member of a Government on the other side of the House, I would not have to be asked a second time at least to ask the Minister in Belfast to sit down and talk on the problem.</P>
