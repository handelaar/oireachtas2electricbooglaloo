      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will consider offering hospitality in this country to a number of children in Vietnam who are now suffering because of war action in that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far Ireland's aid to the victims of hostilities in Vietnam has been channelled through the Irish Red Cross Society and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva and also through Caritas Internationalis.</P>
      <P>No request has been received for the transfer of Vietnamese children to Ireland although a few have come here under private auspices for medical treatment.</P>
      <P>If the International Red Cross should at any time come to the conclusion that Ireland can best help by our accepting a larger number of Vietnamese children here, the Government would, of course, assist in every possible way.</P>
      <P>May I add that the Irish Red Cross Society are at present making a public appeal for contributions to aid the Vietnamese people in their tragic plight and I hope and believe that there will be a generous response from our people to this worthy cause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will make a statement on the prospects for the tourist industry for the 1968 season, indicating in particular the income expected to accrue from tourists coming from (a) the USA, (b) Britain, and (c) Continental Europe; and the promotional expenditure in each of these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospects for the tourist industry in 1968 will be influenced by the proposed restrictions on travel from the United States and by the likely effects of devaluation. The restrictions proposed by the United States, if implemented, could have a serious effect on revenue from that area.  Devaluation should result in an increase in revenue from Continental Europe but the adverse effects of credit restrictions in Britain could offset this increase.  The uncertainty arising from these developments is such that it is impractical to make firm forecasts at this stage.</P>
      <P>A final decision has not yet been taken on the level of promotional expenditure to be undertaken this year but an active marketing programme is being mounted by Bord Fáilte and associated Irish tourist interests with a view to offsetting adverse factors to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the conferences from which the tourist industry may expect to benefit which have been arranged to be held here during 1968, and the estimated receipts; and if he will give comparative figures for 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of such conferences arranged so far for 1968 is 54.  It is estimated that these conferences will be attended by 13,500 delegates and that the contribution to tourist revenue will be £750,000.  In 1967 there was 63 such <Col N="1041" /> conferences attended by about 12,000 delegates and tourist revenue was estimated at £650,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent it is related to the number of people who are likely to use it and also to existing facilities, including telephones for emergencies at late hours of the night, and public call offices within a short distance where service is available up to 9 or 10 p.m.  There are a number of considerations and we are opening each year a great number of kiosks and we are continuing the programme as rapidly as we can but we have to have due regard to the economics.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware, I am sure, that the Department of Defence buys its rations for the troops by contract and the contract price determines the cost of the ration per head.  I may tell the Deputy that since 1964 the ration allowance to married soldiers has been increased by 11d per day and, in addition to that, the married soldier got the increase of £1 a week.  This is not the first time that the ration allowance was reduced by a penny per day from the prevailing rate. It has been done before.</P>

      <P>It was represented to me that, in the case of four firms, including the firm to which Deputy Tierney's question refers, which dismissed workers towards the end of 1967, the workers were dismissed in order to avoid the payment of compensation under the Redundancy Payments Act.  I had inquiries made in these cases and was informed by the firms concerned that the dismissals were due to pressing economic circumstances, and that the proposed introduction of the redundancy payments scheme was not an influencing factor.  Evidence of the financial state of the firms in question was furnished to me.  In the circumstances, I feel that I would not be justified in proposing any special steps in the matter.</P>

    <P>An Chomhairle Oiliúna is an independent statutory authority on whom <Col N="1060" /> clear responsibility has been conferred for carrying out certain functions in the field of training.  The Industrial Training Act, 1967, requires An Chomhairle to make an annual report to me of its proceedings under the Act and copies of the report must then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The first annual report will contain details of An Chomhairle's activities such as those sought by the Deputy.  I am informed by An Chomhairle that, in the meantime, they would, on request, give the Deputy reasonable information on particular matters in which he may be interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last ten years or so, substantial tax incentives <Col N="1062" /> have been introduced which have made a major contribution towards alleviating the impact of income taxation on industrial concerns operating in this country.  These reliefs include enhanced allowances for capital expenditure on plant and machinery and on industrial buildings, exports relief and mining reliefs.  Last year, the initial allowance for capital expenditure on machinery and plant was raised from 40 per cent to 50 per cent and, in addition, &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; for new machinery and plant provided for use in undeveloped areas was introduced.  Improved relief for profits derived from the mining of certain non-bedded minerals was also brought in which, in the case of mines which came into production since 6th April, 1956, exempted the profits from tax for a period of twenty years from commencement of trading.  The various tax incentives are not specifically restricted to existing Irish industrial concerns of long standing, as this would be neither practicable nor justifiable.</P>

The <Col N="1068" /> period is only referable to this limited category of lessees.  The extension of the period by special legislation would not, therefore, confer any benefit on the tenants of the Proby estate, as they are not within that category.  A substantive amendment of the Act would be needed to entitle these tenants to purchase the free simple.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission are at present examining, at my request, the position of these tenants in the course of their examination of the desirability of extending the categories of lessees entitled to renew their leases or to buy out their ground rents.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the qualifying conditions imposed upon applicants for contributory old age pensions who were insured under the National Health Acts for many years prior to the passage of the Social Welfare Act; if he will take steps to abolish the existing regulation whereby only 20 years national health stamps are counted; and if he will arrange for the full period for which an old age pension applicant has cards stamped to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Acts provide that an average test of contributions paid or credited is one of the contribution conditions for old age (contributory) pension to be satisfied by Social Insurance contributions.  Contributions under the former National Health Insurance Acts prior to 1953 not being Social Insurance contributions would not in the normal course reckon towards satisfying these conditions.</P>
      <P>As a transitional arrangement regulations enable National Health Insurance contributions to be taken into account for pension purposes at an enhanced value, each contribution counting as two for the average test. These regulations also prescribe that the maximum period over which the average can be calculated is the last 20 years before the person reached the age of 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> It is considered that these arrangements provide a reasonable basis for persons to qualify for old age (contributory) pension by virtue of insurance contributions which, it must be emphasised, did not contain any element in respect of that pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that people in this category are at a complete loss to understand why it is, when they have been stamping a card all their lives, they should be denied the full benefit of all the stamps for which they have paid since they started to work.  Surely the Minister appreciates that the somewhat obscure explanation he gave in regard to the various elements which go to make up the weekly contribution is lost upon the contributors?  In justice, and in view of the fact that it could not represent a very great impost on the Exchequer, would he not favourably reconsider this, with a view to providing full payment for all stamps in respect of the full period in which any old age pensioner has had cards stamped instead of the present limited period of 20 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements made originally for the transitional period when the contributory pension first came into effect were quite generous.  They have been amended on a few occasions since to give the maximum benefit to persons who had what was known as a national insurance record, giving each contribution double its value.  The period was extended from ten years to 15 years and later to 20 years.  This takes in practically every person in respect of whom records are available.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the signing requirements for unemployment payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> In April, 1967, I greatly eased these requirements in the case of persons over 65 years of age.  Up to then, such persons, if resident within four miles of their local office, had to attend there either daily or on alternate days to sign the unemployed register.  The general position since is that no person over 65, including CIE pensioners over that age, has to attend at this local office more frequently than once a week, i.e, on the pay-day.  This arrangement is by no means onerous when it is remembered that claimants to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, whether pensioners or not, must be unemployed, capable of and available for work.  I do not propose to make any further relaxation in the attendance requirements for persons over 65 years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question there is no provision in current Social Welfare legislation for payment of any of the benefits administered by my Department in the manner envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, with reference to the refusal of unemployment benefit to a person (name supplied) for reasons stated in his Department's letter of 7th February, 1968, he will, in view of this man's extremely good record of employment, re-examine the case with a view to granting benefit in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this case.  The position is that the person concerned made a claim to unemployment benefit on 7th December, 1967, but did not satisfy the required contribution conditions until 24th January, 1968, from which date he became entitled to payment and is being paid.  The deferment of title resulted from statutory regulations and was caused by the late payment by an employer of certain contributions due by him in respect of employment of the claimant in 1966.</P>
      <P>As explained to the Deputy in the letter he mentions, the claimant has a legal right to recover from the employer as a civil debt a sum equal to the amount of the benefit lost up to 23rd January, 1968 through the employer's failure or neglect to pay the contributions in question at the proper time.</P>
      <P>I should add that the disallowance of benefit for an initial period of the claim was imposed by a deciding officer in the exercise of his statutory functions and that the decision was upheld on appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not reconsider this?  This young man worked for a number of years with a particular employer and then became self-employed.  He came back and did casual work for his former employer, who neglected to stamp his cards.  Now this has been corrected.  There was no suggestion at all that anything was being evaded.  In the light of this, would the Minister not reconsider his decision, and if he is precluded by law <Col N="1081" /> from allowing the unemployment benefit, would he introduce legislation to empower him to do so?  This is a straightforward case, as the Minister will appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am precluded from doing what the Deputy suggests. The good record of this insured contributor is not in question at all, but he simply did not fulfil the statutory requirements when he made application in December, in that he had not 26 contributions in the 1966 contribution year.  It was found that he should have had 11 more contributions, which were paid in arrears, as is usually done.  The Minister does not step into make good where the employer defaults in not stamping the card, but the insured person has the right to claim from the employer the money which he lost and, in fact, I can do so for him at his request.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is perhaps fitting that we should recap here since we last discussed this matter as far back as 24th May, 1967. We are now dealing with section 28 of the Road Traffic Bill, 1966.  The object of this section is to rid the roads of drivers whose judgement and capacity to drive are impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor or the taking of a drug.  It is not the Minister's object, I take it, to ensure that none other than total abstainers drive cars. I should like, therefore, before we pass from this section to the next section, to ask myself and the House what exactly we are doing in this section, and what exactly is the position at present.</P>
      <P>Under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, it is laid down in subsection (1) that a person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control over the vehicle.  Needless to say, with that subsection and the sentiment expressed in it I am in complete and absolute agreement, and so, I think, is every responsible member of the House.  Apparently some years ago the Government and the Minister considered that that section was not strong enough to achieve what it set out to achieve, that is, that no one who became incapable of having proper control over a vehicle, due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor or a drug should drive a car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government thought that they <Col N="1091" /> should strengthen the hands of the courts and the Garda and with that end in view, on 14th September, 1961, they set up the Commission on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug.  The Commission was set up by the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy N. T. Blaney.  It consisted of the following distinguished persons, and I should like to put their names on record before we pass from this section: Mr. Justice Cahir Davitt, then President of the High Court; Professor Maurice Hickey, State Pathologist and Professor of Forensic Medicine at University College, Dublin; Very Reverend D. P. Kennedy, S. J., President of the Safety First Association of Ireland; Dr. Sean McCann, Terenure, Dublin, a general practitioner; Superintendent P. McGonagle, Traffic Section, Garda Síochána; Dr. Desmond McGrath, Psychiatrist, St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, and St. Laurence's Hospital, Dublin; Mr. Dermot O'Clery, MA, BAI, MICEI, AMI, Mech. E., representing the Royal Irish Automobile Club; Mr. R. O'Donohue, Area Secretary, Automobile Association; Mr. D. O'Donovan, Chief State Solicitor; District Justice A. A. Rochford; Mr. E. T. Sheehy, Principal Officer, Department of Local Government; Mr. R. Toal, Assistant Principal Officer, Department of Justice.  The Minister appointed the Hon.  Mr. Justice Cahir Davitt as chairman of the Commission.</P>
    <P>That Commission was set up on 14th September, 1961, and it reported to the Minister on 15th September, 1963, nearly two years later.  The cost of preparing the report was estimated at £2,439 approximately, exclusive of the cost of printing and publication. Amongst other things, that Commission dealt with the offence of driving while under the influence of drink or a drug.  It considered very carefully the advisability of introducing the blood test.  It made a number of recommendations. At paragraph 50, page 43, the Commission commented as follows:</P>
    <P>If any legislative changes are to be really successful and effective they must, in our view, have the support of the bulk of public opinion. In countries where a certain blood-alcohol <Col N="1092" /> level has been prescribed as conclusive evidence of critical impairment, public opinion has, we believe, been conditioned, perhaps gradually, to accept the position. Here the whole procedure of taking and analysing blood samples and giving evidence of blood-alcohol levels in prosecutions would constitute an innovation in criminal procedure with which everyone concerned might take some considerable time to become familiar, as well as an interference with personal rights which public opinion might be still slower to accept as necessary or desirable.  It may be that, as a result of experience, public opinion would in the course of time be conditioned to accept and approve of a prescribed level which would be conclusive evidence of impairment.  We doubt very much if the education of opinion on the matter has yet reached that stage.  We take the view that, initially at any rate, a blood-alcohol level should be prescribed which would be prima facie and not conclusive evidence of critical impairment.</P>
    <P>In its formal conclusions and recommendations on major issues to the Minister at page 52, subparagraph (3) there is the following:</P>
    <P>Proof that an accused person's blood alcohol level exceeded 125 mg. at the material time or within three hours thereafter (see subparagraph (8)) should be accepted as prima facie evidence that he was unfit to drive.  The prosecution should be free to adduce evidence that the accused was unfit to drive even though his blood-alcohol level did not exceed this figure; and an accused person should be free to adduce evidence that he was not unfit even though his blood-alcohol level did exceed this figure.  The law should make provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>Those are the recommendations of this Commission, composed of the distinguished and experienced persons whose names I read out.  They sat for three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I accept the Minister's correction.  The Commission sat on a great number of occasions; they travelled abroad to the Continent and to England.  They made these recommendations.  The Minister has not seen fit to accept them.  Instead of accepting the recommendations, the Minister introduced section 28 of the Bill which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 49 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;the vehicle&rdquo; in subsection (1) of &ldquo;or while there is present in his body a quantity of alcohol such that, within three hours after so driving or attempting to drive, the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That section is directly opposed to the recommendations of the Commission. I tabled an amendment which, if accepted, would constitute the concentration of alcohol set out in the Bill as prima facie evidence that the person's judgment was impaired and would shift the onus of proof on to the accused person to establish that, not-withstanding the fact that he had this concentration of alcohol in his blood, he was quite capable of driving a car. That might, indeed, be a heavy onus but it would, at any rate ensure that a person whose judgement had not been impaired and who was perfectly capable of driving a car, would not be convicted and would not expose himself to heavy fines and imprisonment and would not suffer the automatic suspension of his driving licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only did the Minister reject the recommendation of the Commission but he wants to have it both ways.  He accepted portion of the recommendation which suited him and he rejected that portion of the recommendation with which he did not agree.  In subparagraph (3) on page 52, it is recommended that the prosecution would be free to adduce evidence that the accused was unfit to drive even though <Col N="1094" /> his blood-alcohol level did not exceed the stipulated figure.  Let us stop there. That will still be the position if this section becomes law.  The person who is brought in and has a blood test taken and the concentration turns out to be only 100, 90 or 115 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood will still be exposed and still not be cleared of the charge because it will be open to the Attorney General to call evidence to the effect that not-withstanding this concentration, the person was drunk.</P>
    <P>The report goes on:</P>
    <P>An accused person should be free to adduce evidence that he was not unfit even though his blood alcohol level did exceed this figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted the first recommendation but he rejected the second recommendation.  That is not fair because it is accepting as much of this report as the Minister favours and rejecting the rest.  It creates a situation in which an accused person is to have cat-and-mouse played with him.</P>
    <P>We have had a lengthy discussion on this section.  The Minister concedes rather reluctantly that a person with the concentration of alcohol in his blood specified in this section could still be perfectly able to drive a car. The Minister will say that this is unlikely, but will not go so far as to say that such a case could not occur.  The Minister will admit that where you have a position in which a person who consumes four small whiskies, who believes he is able to drive a car and is in fact able to drive a car and whose judgement is not in any way impaired, has no way of knowing or checking whether he has the offending concentration of alcohol in his blood, unless he goes through the extraordinary procedure of having a blood test carried out in the public house, in the hotel or the private house before he leaves; and still that person, not a danger on the road, who does not know he is committing an offence and who cannot ascertain whether he is committing one, is to be convicted of this new offence which carries with it <Col N="1095" /> substantial monetary penalties, imprisonment and disqualification from driving a car.  That is not reasonable.</P>
    <P>Lest it might be said that I am standing up here in defence of the drunken driver or advocating that it is not a serious offence to drive while drunk, I wish to say I am doing no such thing.  I wish to point out that I offered to the Minister in this House on this section an amendment which would, in my opinion, strengthen the Minister's hands, strengthen the Attorney General's hands and the hands of the Garda to such an extent that it would be virtually impossible for a person who had a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood, and who was impaired as a result, to get off without being convicted, while at the same time ensuring that a person who had that concentration of alcohol and who, as the Minister admits, could safely drive a car, would not be convicted wrongly and would not suffer unjustly the penalties I have mentioned which are prescribed in this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going much too far in this section and he should give my alternative the fair trial recommended by the report.  I have said that in my considerable experience of district courts and of charges under the Road Traffic Acts, I am satisfied that if a man who has taken too much drink and who is charged with drunken driving does not get off on a direction and is forced into the witness box, having had the onus of proof shifted to him, he does not get off.  I am prepared here to shift the onus of proof of the concentration of alcohol mentioned in this section and that will ensure that only a person who is genuinely capable of driving a car and who is not in any way impaired by the consumption of alcoholic liquor will be acquitted.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands, under the Act of 1961, we are told that 62 per cent of those prosecuted were convicted. I do not know how that percentage compares with convictions in respect of other types of crime&mdash;I intend putting down a question to find out&mdash;but I can assure the Minister that <Col N="1096" /> if he accepts my amendment, that 62 per cent conviction rate will be increased substantially and he will then be convicting the type of person who should be convicted, that is, the type of person whose judgement is impaired, and he will be providing a safeguard for the lawful citizen who has taken a moderate amount of drink and whose judgment is not impaired.</P>
    <P>We have stated time and again during this debate, and it is not necessary to repeat it, that it is doubtful whether sections 28 and 29 are constitutional, but the Minister is taking a chance with them and he will deal with that situation, I suppose, when it arises.  Certainly it has been held always that a person should not be deemed to be guilty until he is proved to be guilty&mdash;he should be innocent until his guilt is proved.  The Minister will probably say that the difference between me and him is that he is creating a new offence, the offence of driving with this specified concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream, and that whether a person's judgement is impaired or not has nothing to do with the offence.  I appreciate that is what the Minister is doing but my objection to it is that it is not reasonable.  What we are after here is to make the roads safer by clearing off them the people whose judgement is impaired as a result of the consumption of alcohol or the taking of drugs.</P>
    <P>However, I say that we did not set out here to create a society of total abstainers even in the motoring community and for those reasons and for the reasons which have already been put forward throughout the debate, I am strongly against this section as it stands.  I think it is grossly unfair; it is unjust; it is unwarranted; and I think section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, with the amendment, suggested by the Commission on Driving while under the Influence of Drink or a Drug would meet the case, and meet it adequately, until such time as it had been proved that it was not sufficient. I am convinced that section 49 of the 1961 Act as recommended by this Commission would meet indefinitely the case of excessive drinking while driving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider this section and the following section, because if section 28 remained alone, it would not create any great problem.</P>
      <P>The question of section 29 has to be looked at as we consider section 28 because punishment for violation under section 28 is carried through in section 29.  I should like at first to explain that I am not here as a representative of any organisation of the licensed trade or any other group.  I have not been approached personally by any organisation to vote either for or against this Bill.  I want to emphasise that I am not here to put the case of any organisation or group.  I am here simply to represent, and to interpret as well as I can, the views of the majority of my constituents.  In discussing it, I have found amongst most of the motoring public, and indeed among people travelling in general, a great distaste for this legislation.  It is felt that it is a panic measure, because of an unusual number of events in unusual circumstances either here or in Great Britain.  We are copying the British or Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your following Great Britain if it is a good thing to do.  I believe that Deputy Fitzpatrick has put forward a good deal of commonsense.  He has suggested that under the previous Bill, with certain amendments, people could be brought to the courts and punished because of an excess amount of liquor having been taken and if there had been visible proof of their inability to drive; and the courts could act in those circumstances and the Garda had power to take people into the barracks if in their opinion, their ability to drive was defective and a scientific examination could be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> But we do not apparently accept that one man with three drinks can be an absolute danger and still come under the regulations laid down in sections 28 and 29, whereas another man who might violate the section can be judged more capable and much safer on the road.  If this is an effort to keep death off the roads, as evidently it is intended to be, I believe that 75 per cent of our deaths on the road are caused by excessive speed.  We have made an effort in this case to introduce a regulation for cars so that they cannot go beyond a certain speed.  That would be a practical and sensible suggestion but of course it might interfere with certain people.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether anyone who drives a car would disagree with me that the most dangerous thing you meet is a car driven at excessive speed, that is, out of control, whether driven by a sober man or a drunken man.  This section, to my mind, is a violation of the right of the individual&mdash;perhaps not section 28, but certainly section 29, as a follow-up, as guards can find guilty and force people to take certain tests, without any evidence of dangerous driving under penalty of imprisonment, fine and suspension for refusal.  That is a violation of the rights of the individual that I would want opposed on behalf of my constituents.</P>
    <P>I believe, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has put in a better way than I could put it because of his knowledge of legal proceedings, that there are ample powers vested in the present Act and that this new Bill is not required.  Certainly if some small amendments as he had proposed, and which were rejected, had been accepted, many of us who are now about to oppose this Bill because of sections 28 and 29, would probably be in favour of it.</P>
    <P>The breathaliser test is an indignity and I consider section 29 to be an indignity also.  I am not at all happy with the statistics that have been produced by the newspapers on the number of deaths in Great Britain in the past 12 months for the period of operation around Christmas.  I think it was the licensed vintners who asked the question: how did they compare with <Col N="1099" /> the year before?  The year before showed that there were fewer deaths when there was no breathaliser test as compared with last year.  In Ireland you cannot take one year with another and say this is caused because of that.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the previous Minister for Local Government was bringing in the last Road Transport Act certain regulations were introduced such as rear lights for bicycles.  It is a requirement of law at the present day. Anyone who travels the roads driving a car realises that these are an exception rather than a rule.  Are they really clear that there is a breach of the regulations?  We hear of having to keep on your side lights during parking in towns and villages and even in <i>culs-desac.</i> The regulations which were brought in are not enforced.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in Great Britain and Ireland if this Bill is passed, after a period the regulations will die the very same death as most of our road traffic regulations.  Deaths on the road are going to increase and in direct proportion, I suggest, to the number of motor vehicles registered each year over and above the previous year.  I think it is mathematically certain that the more cars you have on the road the more deaths there will be.  During that period in Britain, during the survey, I suggest the main reason for the drop in road accidents and deaths was that people were afraid to take out their cars.  The Minister could have achieved the same result by issuing an order that motorists with an odd number as the last digit of their registrations would not be permitted to drive during that period.  In time, as people become accustomed to the new regulations, you will find again the very same people driving.  The drunkard or the alcoholic will be caught under the present law.  This is directed&mdash;I agree that it is an effort to keep death off the roads&mdash;at the social drinker, the man who is quite capable of going about his business and of driving his family safely.  Nobody values his life as much as the driver of a car who is in his normal senses.</P>
    <P>I do not believe I would be interrupting the views of the majority of my constituents if I did not oppose this <Col N="1100" /> section and section 29.  This is a personal view.  It does not tie my Party in any way.  They have given permission for a free vote on this section, believing, as they do, that it is a matter on which each Deputy must make up his mind solely in the light of the reasons put forward here and the views and decisions he gets from his constituents and in particular, in the light of his own personal experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These sections &mdash; as Deputy Kyne says sections 28 and 29 must be read together&mdash;are designed jointly effectively to reduce deaths on the road.  I would be prepared to go a very long way with the Minister in such measures as he deems it expedient to take to achieve this objective, but, as Deputy Kyne says, it is extremely odd to have before us for consideration the advanced proposals in sections 28 and 29 at a time when we have not taken the elementary precaution of providing a general speed limit on all the roads of the country.  Although we have imposed speed limits on the dual carriageway, you may travel at 90 miles an hour down a narrow country road.  We have not taken effective measures to control what demonstrably has cost many human lives in motoring.</P>
      <P>We have not taken steps to prevent people parking gargantuan cattle lorries on the roads without any illumination. I know from my own personal experience, and I doubt if there is a Deputy who has not had similar experience, of injury and death occurring as a result of collisions with such vehicles.  We are told that the reason steps have not been taken to prevent these articulated pantechnicons which are sometimes 30 feet long, from swinging along the roads at night, constituting a frightful hazard, is that it would not be practicable.  We have not yet, by propaganda or publicity induced people wearing dark clothes to put scotch tape either around their collars or around their arms at night in order to make them manifest to drivers who are approaching them at the same time as they are approaching the headlights of an oncoming car.  All these things, I think, should be done if we are to increase safety for pedestrians and drivers on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> As this debate proceeds through the Second Stage and the Committee Stage in relation to these sections, there is great danger of the House allowing itself to be manoeuvred into the position of assuming that the driver of a car who kills a person on the road is quite content if he can avoid the legal sanctions attendant on dangerous driving, but the plain fact is that a man who kills somebody on the road in his car will carry that scar on his conscience all his life, even though a criminal court acquits him of criminal responsibility.  I suppose there is no more horrible experience a human creature can have than inadvertently to kill a fellow man.  I do not believe there is anyone in the country who wants to facilitate the operation of the drunken driver.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Fitzpatrick put most emphatically and with great force the case which he has made and which I think could be summarised by saying that he believes that drunkenness is drunkenness and that it is of questionable propriety to create a statutory offence of a certain alcohol level in the blood without any regard to the consequences of that alcohol level.  I see the force of the case the Deputy makes. I would be prepared to go so far with the Minister in view of the gravity of the problem he is tackling, that I would be prepared to accept the proposition that you must take an arbitrary level of alcohol in the blood and say that it is a statutory offence to drive a car with more alcohol in your blood than that statutory level.</P>
    <P>We know that there are a great many men and some women who may have a higher alcohol content in their blood and still be capable of driving a car, but in order to cover the majority of drivers we have arbitrarily chosen this level and propose to enforce it.  If you accept that principle, as I am prepared to do in consideration of the very grave problem of death on the roads, the question of effectively enforcing it then arises.  I implore the House to recollect that people, if they live in civilised society, have certain fundamental rights and one of those rights is the integrity of the person.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but section 28, which is the section under discussion, deals with the concentration of alcohol in the blood.  Section 29 deals with the method of determination and tests and these may be discussed when section 29 is before the House. If we discuss them now, there will be duplication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that our procedure becomes farcical if we are to discuss the creation of a statutory offence without knowing the means of ascertaining what the statutory offence is.  This would bring the rules of order to the point of making our debates utterly ineffectual.  If this section sets a statutory limit to the alcohol content of the blood, I am prepared to accept it, provided certain other things do not flow therefrom; but if the Minister says: &ldquo;You cannot approve of this section if you do not approve certain consequential things,&rdquo; then I do not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely I must be allowed to argue that I am accepting the proposition in regard to the blood level, and in that I appear to differ from Deputy Fitzpatrick, who speaks on behalf of my Party, and from Deputy Kyne.  I have a slant of my own.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, speaking on behalf of our Party, says he thinks we ought not fix an arbitrary limit and say that somebody was unfit to drive by reason of <Col N="1103" /> having consumed an excessive amount of alcohol.  I am prepared to say in regard to section 28 that I would accept the statutory definition of excessive consumption of alcohol, provided it does not lead me on to procedures for determining that level which I regard to be unconstitutional and inconsistent with fundamental human rights. I think I am entitled to say that I would be prepared to accept the maximum alcohol content of the blood with great reluctance if it were to be tested by the breathaliser but if I accept the principle of this section, and if I am to be told immediately thereafter that having accepted that principle, I must go on to accept the principle that any citizen of the State can be apprehended by a member of the Garda Síochána, brought to a police station and there required to give a sample of his blood or urine, my answer is &ldquo;never.&rdquo;  I hope and pray that if you put that section in this Bill, you will render the whole Bill unconstitutional and it will be struck down as it ought to be struck down.</P>
    <P>If I am told the price of accepting section 28 is the acceptance of section 29, then I reject section 28.  However, I cannot explain my attitude to section 28 unless I am allowed to express to the House the reason why I object to section 28 in its present content.  If section 28 is sustained for purposes of proof by nothing in excess of a breathaliser test, I would accept that with profound reluctance, but I would accept it.  If the Minister says: &ldquo;There is no use virtuously getting up and saying you are prepared to travel the road with me up to the end of section 28 and then say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to section 29; you will not give the Minister for Local Government the power to enforce section 28 because unless I get the right to enforce breathaliser and urine tests, section 28 is in fact nullified,&rdquo; my answer is: &ldquo;If the price of section 28 is to give full consent to section 29, then I reject section 28 and I say we should fall back on the traditional methods of establishing sobriety or insobriety at present available to the law.  If I must accept section 28, I am prepared to travel that far, if the Minister is prepared to say, when we come to section <Col N="1104" /> 29: &ldquo;I am going to ask the House to leave the breathaliser test as an obligation on a driver, whom the Garda suspect to have an excess of alcohol in his blood.&rdquo;  I am prepared to go even further to help the Minister in his problem.  If the Minister went on to say: &ldquo;I must ask this of the House, when a suspected person is brought to a police station, suspected of having committed the statutory offence of driving with a higher alcohol content in his blood, he must be asked by the Garda does he wish to submit to a urine or blood test and if he declines the Garda should be free to communicate that fact to the court.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Sir, I bow to your ruling, but it seems fantastic to say that I am obliged now to say that I am for or against section 28 without being allowed to say why.  My whole attitude to section 28 is conditioned by the question of how the facts which section 28 declare to be a statutory offence are to be established.  If certain machinery is indefensible to establish it, then I am against it.  I do not believe any country could justify such a means. I do not want to cause you any embarrassment, Sir, but if this is your view let that view prevail.  All I can say to Members of the House is go back and read what I said on Second Reading of this Bill.  Any attempt to make it a statutory offence to refuse to submit to a breathaliser or urine test in any Garda barracks is an outrage on our people, is unconstitutional, wholly unnecessary and is calculated to raise issues in connection with this section 28 which ought not be raised at all.  We can do all that is necessary to help in bringing under control a difficult situation without recourse to such measures.  We are unnecessarily complicating what ought to be a rational situation by this extremity into which we are allowing ourselves to be pushed, not, in my <Col N="1105" /> opinion, by cold reason but by something closely approximating to panic.</P>
      <P>May I again say that we are creating a statutory offence of having an excessive alcohol content in the blood level?  Do not let us forget that if we pass this section, it will be quite open to the Garda Síochána to bring a drunken driver into a Garda barracks and without recourse to the provisions of this section, or any test envisaged in later sections, proceed to prosecute him under existing law.  Is that not so?  If a drunken driver&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say to the Minister is this&mdash;and I beg him to bear this is mind&mdash;it is a great rule of good theology that there are enough sins without creating new ones, but in a changing world, as we are conscious at the present time, the moral law has, on occasion, to be restated in the light of new knowledge but this is something that even the highest authorities in the world would recoil from doing without the most mature reflection.  We are creating a completely new offence in section 28.  If we want to do that, surely we ought to try to do it with the maximum degree of unanimity that can be procured in the whole Legislature? I suggest to the Minister that if he sticks rigidly to the position which he has set out in the Bill, he will not get that.  He may get the law passed but it will not carry with it the moral sanction of the virtual unanimity in this Legislature and that is something that I think would be of incalculable value if the enforcement of this new statutory offence is to be made effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last analysis, the Garda Síochána are unlike many other agencies of government.  The Revenue Commissioners can enforce the letter of the law.  The Department of Social Services falls back on the letter of the law and you will frequently find a Minister for Finance or a Minister for Social Welfare making manifest to this House during Question Time that he wishes he had the power to relax the statutory provisions of the Act under which he is working because he thinks there is merit in the case being made but he is bound by the letter of the law and has not got the power to do it.  It is an entirely different situation with regard to the Guards.  The Guards, in enforcing the criminal law, require the sustenance of the virtual unanimity and approbation of the society in whose name they act, and if we pass laws in this House creating new offences without a degree of unanimity far greater than that ordinarily indicated by a Party decision taken here, we make the tasks of the Guards immeasurably more difficult because we will create a degree of misunderstanding and resentment that affects the Garda Síochána not only in the <Col N="1107" /> administration of the provisions of this Act but over the whole sphere of their relationship with society.</P>
    <P>I want to draw a parallel.  I remember when debating another Road Traffic Act, pressing on the Minister for Justice very strenuously that parking offences should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Garda and should be handed over to a specially constituted body of private wardens, because, I said: &ldquo;If you do not do that, you will create so much ill-will between the motoring public and the Garda Síochána that in your efforts to expedite the transit of traffic through the city, you will create a degree of antagonism between the Garda Síochána and an ordinarily law-abiding section of the community which will be out of all proportion to the advantage you have derived.&rdquo;  Now I want to suggest that if this kind of section is forced through this House against moderate and reasonable representation, against the strenuous advice of responsible Deputies who express themselves as anxious to help the Minister in abating the evil of which we are all conscious, you are going to create exactly the same situation in which the Garda, instead of coming to be regarded as the friends and protectors of the community, will come to be regarded by a very large section of the most law-abiding elements in the community as being public enemies.  I want to avoid that, and what you are doing here now is the very thing I seek to avoid and there is no need to do it.</P>
    <P>If the restrained approach to this problem in practice proved inadequate, the Minister could always come back and say: &ldquo;Well, I have tried to enforce the provisions of section 28 and I cannot do it.  I want further powers to make it effective&rdquo;, then we can consider that situation in the light of the experience he will have to relate to the House.  However, suppose the situation arises where he is obliged to come back to us and say: &ldquo;The enforcement of section 28 has become such a public scandal that I can no longer stand over it&rdquo;, we will have a very different situation because incalculable damage will have been done and of a character that we are not in a position to remedy, <Col N="1108" /> and if we seek to remedy it, we will simply exacerbate it because the plea will be made in this House that because of the powers we have conferred on the Garda the Garda have been converted from friends and protectors of the public into public enemies and we must circumscribe them again, and that carries the implication that we in Dáil Éireann are convinced that given wide discretionary powers, the Garda are likely to go berserk.  I do not believe that, but I do not want to create that impression and, remember, if we legislate requiring the Garda to do such things, we have no reason afterwards to blame the Garda if they do.</P>
    <P>Again, Sir, my mind works by analogies. I am weary in this House of hearing people coming in making passionate remonstrances against the activities of the Revenue Commissioners and describing some awful outrage of which they complain.  When you come to the source and the reason for the outrage, it is pointed out to you that the Revenue Commissioners had no option, that they were enforcing the law we made, and if the truth were told, if you canvassed the individual Revenue Commissioner, he would say: &ldquo;I think that was a bad thing to do, but once Oireachtas Éireann did it, it was our duty to enforce it, whether we thought well or ill of it.&rdquo;  If we force on the Garda an obligation here, it is their duty to enforce it, but it is on them and on their precious relationship with the public that the censure will fall and we, knowing the true root of that censure, by implication join in that course of censure that has unjustly fallen on the Garda whom we forced into a position which I do not believe they want to occupy.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should give this matter due weight and even at this late stage say: &ldquo;Very well, then; if a good many of you feel that way, I am prepared to make two bites of the cherry.  I warn you that in my judgment I will have to come back to you for larger powers but, <i>ad interim,</i> I will take the halfway method and give it a trial.  If it does not work, I am coming back for more stringent powers.&rdquo;  Then it will be considered on its merits.  <i>Ad interim,</i> I urge on the <Col N="1109" /> Minister most strenuously to reconsider this whole question in the light of what Deputy Fitzpatrick and I have said.</P>

      <P>But I do want to say that I am wondering whether it is proper to introduce legislation of this nature unless we are perfectly satisfied that it can be enforced.  As I say, I have very grave doubts.  For instance, the Minister has said that he is not responsible for enforcing regulations made under the Minister's Department in regard to speeding.  How much real enforcement is there?  How far is the law in regard to speed limits observed? I will deal with that on section 58 where it is relevant and I do not want to deal with it in detail now.  I want to stay within the rules of order.  But, if we have already a regular litany of offences and have a situation in which as far as the public are concerned there is a chronic habit of breaking the law, in regard to speed limits, parking, parking lights, we have already far too much chronic sin, if I may follow an analogy of Deputy Dillon's, amongst the public and it is very bad for public morale that that should be so.  We cannot even maintain traffic lights.  I know of a traffic light at the moment that has been out of order for a number of weeks and nobody has done anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we going to create another offence and find in the last analysis the very unsatisfactory position that offences are being committed all over the place with impunity and that occasionally there will be a raid and some unfortunate person who will be greatly depending on statistical luck, will be caught in a speed trap?</P>
      <P>I want again to say that it will be very difficult to have a uniform level of discipline.  Unfortunately, we have not got the resources.  Again, this would be more relevant to section 29 and I do not want to go into details, but perhaps I may be permitted to say that, in my opinion, we have not got the resources to make reality out of legislation of this nature and, although I do agree with the Minister 100 per cent that it would be ideal to clean up this drunkenness question in connection with offences, it is fair enough to say that if a person has had that much alcohol, he should not be driving.  I have no question to raise on that matter, although the methods of enforcement are, as I say, another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising the question as forcefully as possible as to whether it is wise at this moment to legislate in this way, whether there is not something of greater priority in regard to the roads. The Minister has mentioned the saving of lives.  By all means, let us save lives, but Deputy Kyne was very near the mark when he said that unfortunately there are certain mechanical factors and there are certain statistical environmental factors in it.  If there is going to be a correlation between the number of vehicles on the road and the density of traffic, and so forth, and as to whether this will be the major matter, I too, am sceptical.  I wait for the answer.  It is premature to shout one way or the other.  We should coolly and calmly wait for the right answer as far as the British experience is concerned.  It is costly, and although its supporters have been enthusiastic and have been shouting about the success of the scheme, there are other people on the other side equally interested who have been very busy comparing contrary figures and statistics. <Col N="1112" /> To my mind, enough time has not elapsed, nor is there sufficient information available, to make a sure opinion. The wiser approach of this House would be to wait and see and form an opinion then.</P>
    <P>Apart from its justification&mdash;and of course it can be justified from a certain point of view and the answers simply cannot be gainsaid&mdash;my dislike of this section stems from the fact that from the practical point of view as to whether it will achieve the results one wants to achieve, I have very grave doubts unless a number of other matters are provided for, and in the light of what I have said, I feel that we are not yet in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly said, I would be prepared to back that argument with a great deal of detail on the question of enforcement but if I get the answer: &ldquo;That is not my Department&rdquo;, I say that is fair enough but that any Department bringing in legislation or proposals has a responsibility to ask the question: &ldquo;Can this be made practical and effective?&rdquo;  I think I am within my rights in asking that question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present law and Deputy Dillon's point&mdash;again, this arises really under section 29&mdash;I think that if this legislation is enacted, it has an immediate practical effect on how any case can be conducted, no matter on what basis the case is made to stand.  This would be better under section 29 and I will reserve the development of that point until we reach the section.</P>
    <P>There is another question on section 29 but perhaps you would allow me to make the connecting link here without going into the details.  One would find it very hard not to believe if the Minister says, as he does say, that a person who has 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millimetres of blood is just not fit to drive a car.  If the Minister told us that that man should not drive a car, I would find it very hard to contradict that statement.  I find it very hard to say in the abstract that that should not be a crime but as I say, the question is when you make a crime or when you have legislation of this <Col N="1113" /> nature, can you enforce it?  What are to be the penalties for enforcing it? Why depart from the failure of the aim?  If you fail to enforce it, you fail in your primary aim too.  Quite apart from the failure of the primary objective, there is the demoralising effect of the damage that can be done to the public morale and the prejudicing of the whole administration of the law by having that kind of legislation.  Now we are dealing with the question of drink and very cognate to that was the question of our old licensing laws.  They had degenerated into a positive abuse. They were a temptation both to the administrator of the law and the seller of drink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about when they were severe.  There was a lot of opposition.  The fact is that those laws, because they could not be enforced, had not the real support of the public.  Remember that is one of the important things behind any law, especially in a democratic State, the spontaneous support of the people behind it.  Those laws were definitely damaging to the morale of the public and were conductive to crimes of another sort.  I will not go so far as to say that this could be conducive to crime as those were.  Frankly, I think that would be going too far, but if one cannot enforce it reasonably and uniformly enough with the support of the public, you bring about a situation which is very undersirable indeed.  Once you reach that situation, you inevitably fail in your primary purpose. Taking all those many things into account with regard to this section and whether, if the Minister wishes to have it, it should be there, if he says he does not want to have two bites at the cherry, he should have a provision for the postponement of the enforcement of the section until such time as the points I made are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a last comment on this section.  We have dealt with this with regard to our own environment without thinking of other places but one <Col N="1114" /> must realise that there are some broader things.  Vehicles and drivers of vehicles may be going abroad and there may be special considerations which should be taken into account. The Minister can rest assured that we will all be very willing to consider those and all other reasonable points. I ask the Minister, when we argue this, not to take it that there is any intention to cast aspersions.  There is not but on the other hand, it is only right that we should draw attention to certain very relevant facts when legislating like this.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister has heard all the objections both to the right and to the left of him, from the front and from the rear, to this section.  It is a section which is very controversial, a section on which the Minister should take the Whip off and give us a free vote of the House. <Col N="1115" /> There are people, on both sides of the House, genuinely in favour of the section, I presume, but there are many more opposed to it.  The Minister should take off the Whip and give us a free vote of the House.</P>
      <P>I am very worried about the section not from the drunken driver's point of view but from the sober driver's point of view.  He may be a businessman in the city of Dublin, a civil servant, a Deputy if you wish, any businessman, who after a very hard day's work motors home, without a drink, to the suburbs of this city.  When he gets home, he has what, in my opinion, he is entitled to, a ball or two of malt, or he takes, for instance, two glasses of whiskey.  He is entitled to have them because his day's work is over.</P>
      <P>He has driven his car home.  Possibly he may have his dinner and another ball of malt after, and possibly after, say, two and a half hours at home, there is a knock on the door and a civic guard arrives who says: &ldquo;Did you drive that car home because if you did, you drove it in a careless manner.&rdquo;  The man says: &ldquo;I drove it home two hours ago.&rdquo;  The guard then says that he considers the man had consumed excessive alcoholic liquor and then says: &ldquo;I want you to come to the station and have a blood test.&rdquo;  The man has no option but to go to the station.</P>
      <P>He goes to the station and a blood test is taken after his balls of malt, which he has taken before his dinner and after his dinner.  It is found that there is more than 125 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  He says to the guard: &ldquo;Look, guard; I know I took three or four glasses of whiskey but I had them after I drove my car home.&rdquo;  The guard then says: &ldquo;That may be all right but you can tell that to the district justice.  I am not concerned with it.  Tell it to the district justice.&rdquo;  That unfortunate, innocent man is summoned or possibly arrested and released on bail until he is taken before the district justice and charged with driving or attempting to drive under the influence of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that that is impossible, but let me prove to you how it is possible.  First of all, the guard may <Col N="1116" /> be on point duty.  He sees this car passing, takes the number and comes to the conclusion that it is being driven in a careless manner.  He rings up the county council office and finds out the owner of the vehicle.  He then gets into his patrol car or on his motor cycle and comes to where the owner resides and says: &ldquo;Under section 107 of the 1961 Act, I have come to the conclusion that you have committed an offence under that Act by driving in a manner dangerous to the public.  I now want you to tell me who was driving the car on that occasion.&rdquo;  Once the garda says he has reason to believe an offence was committed, the owner is bound to tell him that he was the driver.  The garda says: &ldquo;I have reason to think you have consumed more alcohol than you are entitled to consume under section 28 of the Road Traffic Act&rdquo;&mdash;as it will then be&mdash;&ldquo;of 1966 and you must come to the station and have a blood test.  You have no option.&rdquo;  That is the situation in view of the wording of section 28.</P>
    <P>If the owner of the car says: &ldquo;I drank that after I came home&rdquo;, we must turn to section 34 of the Bill which provides that it shall not be necessary for the garda to prove that it was consumed afterwards.  The onus is on the defendant to prove that the drink was consumed by him after he arrived home&mdash;and it can be proved only in the District Court, if he is able to satisfy the district justice.  His wife, members of his family and possibly the servant girl, if he has one, will have to attend in order to help to prove that he came into the house and had ceased driving before he drank three, four or five glasses of whiskey.  How ever, he is dragged through the court. Though the justice&mdash;they are generally reasonable men&mdash;may dismiss his case, for the rest of his life, the finger is pointed at him that he is the person who was charged with drunken driving, even though he got off.</P>
    <P>Why should a man who consumes liquor in his own home, when he has done his day's work and put his car away, be brought into court and prosecuted? Why should he be dragged into court to prove that he consumed <Col N="1117" /> the liquor after he had arrived home, as he is entitled to do?  That is one of the most objectionable sections in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else, I have no excuse for the drunken driver but I am very worried as to who will say that a driver is drunk.  Why should we lay down that he must prove himself innocent instead of the State's proving him guilty?  It is not for me, at this stage, to go into constitutional law but we have this problem of its being necessary for a man to prove himself innocent instead of the State's proving him guilty.  Section 34 of the new Bill provides that it shall not be necessary to show that the defendant had not consumed intoxicating liquor after the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed.  In other words, the onus of proving that he consumed it after driving is on the defendant and not on the prosecution.  That is my great objection to this section.</P>
    <P>I can see numerous cases where a garda, out of pique or otherwise, may call at a house to make an inquiry about some minor offence such as no tail-light, no head-lamp, and so on and, on seeing the car, may ask the owner: &ldquo;Did you drive that car home within the past three hours?&rdquo;  If the answer is in the affirmative, the garda can then say: &ldquo;I think you have consumed more liquor than you were entitled to consume under section 28. You must come to the station and have blood test.&rdquo;  If the man protests that he did not consume the liquor until after he had arrived home, the garda can say to him: &ldquo;Tell that to the people on the Bench.  There is no point in telling it to me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am possibly the only Member of this House who has had the breathaliser test.  On another occasion, I shall tell the House of my experience as a guinea pig in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wholly in favour of the introduction of the breathaliser test.  Before Christmas, I was very much in favour of the Bill. We have seen the results in Britain, particularly over the Christmas period, <Col N="1118" /> as a result of the introduction of the new system.  Nevertheless, I feel that this section 28 is worded in such a way that it can cause hardship and can cause something that is not intended or that would not be intended by this House.</P>
      <P>It is all right to say that, if a garda sees somebody driving a car and is under the impression that he is drunk, he is entitled to follow him to his home, or wherever he is going, to give him a test, wherever he finds him, so as to prove, by that test, that he was, in fact, over the alcohol limit.  The wording of section 34, in particular, is such that, if there is any doubt that, before he consumed all the extra liquor to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, he was in fact a little over the top, then the fact that he has consumed a lot of liquor afterwards, after coming home, is to be disregarded in the court. As it is at present worded, I think it is a dangerous section.</P>
      <P>As so often happens now, if he is a particularly influential person, there may be difficulty in finding a doctor. Perhaps a proviso could be inserted here that he cannot drag out the time before he is examined.  I do not know that the Garda are entitled&mdash;and it is not specified for what reason&mdash;to take him into custody in order to have him tested so as to know whether in fact he has committed an offence.  Section 29 covers portion of it.  Yet it remains that if somebody goes to his home and consumes liquor after going in he can be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>It may be argued that if this is not put in, there is a danger that people who might be stopped and charged would drive off and attempt to get away&mdash;indeed, it is done as it stands at present&mdash;and by getting to their own homes would be outside the law. I would suggest that the Minister have another look at this section because as it is written, even with the strong views I and most of my Party have in favour of the introduction of this test, I feel this section is one which should not be allowed in the Bill as passed by the House.</P>

      <P>When I read in January that special research was being carried out at 770 police stations to try to get the statistical information <Col N="1120" /> regarding the cause of accidents, which during the Second Stage I said was necessary, I was very encouraged.  I felt, when I read this, that the Minister would not pursue this Bill until this information was available.  I believe part of this Bill was constructed more with a view to gaining political advantage than being a properly considered piece of legislation.  I believe the Government are now in a political position where they can amend it only in a very minor way and that it would be politically inexpedient to make any serious amendment.</P>
      <P>In all the countries of Europe in the ten years from 1954, the only country with the same number of vehicles <i>pro rata</i> on the road to show a decrease in casualties was Ireland.  As I read from the Council of Europe reports on the Second Stage, where there is growing tension in society, you will find road accidents tend to increase.  That is why you hear the advice given that you should kiss your wife before going to work because if you have a row with her, you are potentially dangerous.  As Deputy Dillon was pointing out, if radar traps and so on are set up under this legislation, I believe they will increase tension on the roads and might have the reverse effect to what is intended.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  I tabled a question to get some information to see if we could distinguish between the carbonic content of the blood and alcohol.  The question was refused by the Chair as not being in order.  This is information we cannot get.  I understand also that if you are in a traffic jam and you have a heater in your car which draws the air from outside, the car in front of you could kill you with carbon poisoning and give the same reaction in the blood and urine tests as if you were drinking alcohol, although you might have been a TT all your life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are creating a new offence.  Nobody can tell you how much you can drink.  Nobody can tell you when you are actually guilty of this offence until you have gone through the tests. Despite this, if I commit this offence and am caught, it means for me that <Col N="1121" /> my livelihood outside as a commercial traveller is gone.  It might not affect people who use their cars only for jaunts at the weekend, but a person like myself, a lorry driver or a bus driver, who does not believe he is committing an offence&mdash;and nobody can tell him how to avoid committing an offence&mdash;will be in the position of losing his livelihood.</P>
    <P>If a man goes to a party to-night and drinks a lot of spirits, as opposed to beer and stout, he can get up tomorrow morning after a reasonable night's sleep, have his breakfast and lunch and go out after lunch without having any more drink and yet still have a content of 125 to 100 millilitres of blood.  That is a medical fact.  All these things should have been examined.  We should wait until we get more information about what happens in England and until we get the result of our own investigation for presentation to this House in support of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The mandatory penalties written into the Bill are a vote of no confidence by this House in the judiciary.  Before any mandatory suspension of licence came in England, statistics show that 60,000 licences were suspended there. The judiciary can be relied on to give a fair judgment because there is bound to be discussion of the extent to which a person is guilty of the offence.  It is all right for Deputy Tully to talk about the great results in England.  It is on record that in 1965, when there was no breathaliser, the number of deaths in England was 76 and in 1967 it was 98.</P>

      <P>I believe more research is required before we adopt this section.  The Minister would be well advised to hasten slowly in respect of all the provisions in this Part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>At the moment we have a very stiff driving test, in which 50 per cent of the candidates for licences are failed. When these new drivers come on the road, I think we will continue to show the progress we have shown in the past where, per vehicle on the road, we have had a reduction in the number of accidents.</P>
      <P>There is also the question, if this section is adopted as it stands, as to whether it should apply also to pedestrians. In a very large percentage of cases where there have been accidents in which drink was involved, it was not the driver but the pedestrain who was found to be drunk.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Planning Appeals Bill, 1967: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the suggestion that a tribunal should replace the Minister for Local Government in dealing with planning appeals would stand up to very much intelligent examination.  A comparison has been made between appeals on matters other than those with which the Minister will be dealing.  Surely they are not comparable because, in the final analysis, the Minister must be responsible for planning the whole country.  It would take Solomon himself as Minister to <Col N="1123" /> satisfy all the people who are involved, whether financially, aesthetically or any other way, in a planning application.</P>
      <P>We have had hard words said here about the Minister and, indeed, about his predecessors, and it will always be so, because I feel very often that a planning appeal is shrouded by emotionalism and that good sense goes out through the window when we have a body of preservationists trying to preserve something which they think should be preserved but which the Minister has given his permission not to preserve.  The local authorities have a much more powerful interest in this than some of us realise.  As a Deputy stated here yesterday, we have had cases of a local authority on some occasions turning down an application and then saying: &ldquo;Let the Minister decide it.&rdquo;  I think this does happen.  If a thing is going to be very awkward for a representative, he may vote against it but hope in his heart that the Minister will then allow the appeal.  He can then point out: &ldquo;I voted against it but the Minister let it through.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Every member of this House has, I am sure, at some time or another, been under great pressure in regard to planning applications, whether they be by a statutory body or by an individual.  We have a lot to think about and most of us are very interested in all aspects of this matter, but I would suggest that the Minister, being the man who will finally decide things on planning in general, must be left with this power. Perhaps it is not the best solution but it is the only one we know of.  I would certainly not be in favour of appointing outsiders to act as a tribunal, and even the Party who moved this in the House did not think very much about it, because if we had a tribunal dealing with planning permission, they would become suspect after a while.  Everything they did which would go against the popular choice, whether it was technically right or not, would become suspect, and they would be accused of all kinds of malpractices, when in fact the men would be serving to the best of their ability, as the Minister does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have a weapon over the Minister, that is, their bye-laws. <Col N="1124" /> It is not generally known that, even though the Minister may give permission for a certain thing to be done, if this contravenes the bye-laws of the local authority, the bye-laws will be upheld rather than the Minister's permission.  When planning permission is given subject to certain conditions, such as the bye-laws of a local authority, we often find professional people who ignore the bye-laws and build what they want to build.  This is a very big part of the whole Planning Act. Who will check on the builder who contravenes the bye-laws, unless it is something very apparent.  In considering future legislation on this point, we should provide for some effective method of inspection of every project which may be going on to make sure that the builder complies with the conditions laid down in the permission.</P>
    <P>In this city of ours at the moment we have numerous preservation societies. Take the case of the Georgian buildings which some people believe fanatically should be maintained.  In fairness to the members of Dublin Corporation, let me say that we are not all Philistines.  We do not want to see anything destroyed which is worthy of preservation, but I recall what the late Brendan Behan said on this point: &ldquo;The Georgian houses are good to look at but try living in one of them.&rdquo; This is where the members of Dublin Corporation and the preservationists differ.  The members of the corporation are dealing with a very big housing problem, and perhaps we rate more highly the need to house families than to preserve the aesthetic value of a Georgian house.</P>
    <P>The corporation generally&mdash;I speak as one member of it&mdash;want to preserve what is worth preserving.  We now face a great problem in this matter, because the corporation have power now to preserve a house of any kind of structure, if they so decide.  But who is going to pay compensation to the people who own those houses if they cannot sell them?  The house will be falling down, but because, perhaps, some famous person was born in it, the preservationists say we must preserve it forever.  The owner says: &ldquo;I cannot keep this house in repair any longer <Col N="1125" /> I have got to sell.&rdquo;  The corporation say: &ldquo;You may sell.&rdquo;  But nobody will buy the house from him.  He cannot knock it down and it cannot be repaired at a reasonable cost.  I wonder how the ratepayers of this city are going to face, in a few years time, paying compensation to some of these people, if these houses are acquired. We have not got the money at the moment, even though the corporation have, wisely or otherwise, listed a number of houses in the city which must be preserved.  When I asked the Minister here would there be any money coming from the Central Fund to help the corporation in this respect, he said no, there would not.  Therefore, on the one hand, we have the call for preservation, and, on the other hand, the fact that even if we do want to preserve many of these buildings, we have not the means to do it.</P>
    <P>I mention these few points to try to bring some sense into the criticism of the Minister.  Replacing him by a tribunal would just not work out.  The whole planning of a city and its preservation is so complex that the Minister must have power to make decisions even though they may offend people who wish to preserve an open space, a Georgain house or a canal.  The Minister has been elected by the people. The preservation societies have not been elected by anybody.  It is the Minister who must finally judge what is best having regard to the advice given to him by his technical men, and I do not think any Minister would have the right to hand over the power he has to an outside body.</P>
    <P>Deputies should have more regard for the position of the Minister.  Every planning application which is controversial is dynamite for politicians and Ministers.  I heard previous Ministers criticised for the permissions they gave for such things as petrol stations.  Some years ago when another Government were in power, in my constituency permission was given for a petrol station and there was an outcry about it.  I will admit that I thought it was not a bad decision at the time.  The place where it was to be built was an open space.  It <Col N="1126" /> was full of dirt and when the petrol station was erected it was cleared up. That Minister was not a member of my Party, but, in fairness, I would have backed him at the time.  We should try to understand the Minister's position and resist any attempt to take any power from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is right that I should have something to say on this Bill, as a former Minister who dealt with the Act which was in existence prior to the 1964 Act, the Act under which I was the appeals officer. So far as appeals are concerned, listening to Deputy Moore, one would imagine that it was the individual members of the corporation who granted permission to build under the Planning Act.  It is no such thing.  It is an executive function; it is not a reserved function. It is the county manager or the city manager who gives or refuses permission. In some cases in Dublin he may seek the advice of the corporation.</P>
      <P>Let me speak as a rural Deputy. Members of local authorities know nothing whatever about the town planning applications which are made to the local authorities.  Once a month they receive all the applications which are sent in, and which are really copies of the notices published in the press. All the members of the local authorities know is that John Smith intends to build a new house at Ballydineen or some such place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to Dublin, but to the country generally.  The county manager, acting on the advice of his local engineer, and studying the county plan, if there is a county plan, makes his decision and then the applicant has a right, if the application is refused, to appeal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies know how the Minister deals with these appeals?  An appeal is sent to the Minister which he never sees at that stage.  The Minister has a professional adviser and a non-professional adviser.  The professional adviser usually goes down, inspects the locus and makes a report.  The non-professional <Col N="1127" /> adviser also makes a report from another angle.  The recommendation then comes to the Minister. I wonder do Deputies realise how these recommendations come to the Minister?  I am speaking from practical experience and I know for a fact that there are many more appeals now than there were in my time, because the restrictions under the 1964 Act are greater than they were when I was Minister.</P>
    <P>One day per week the Minister receives approximately 1,000 leases from corporations, from local authorities, be they town commissioners or urban councillors or county councillors. He receives these leases for signature. He has not the slightest chance of reading through them.  He depends on his officials to ensure that they are legally drawn up and in order.  He stands there with his pen in his hand and an assistant beside him with some blotting paper.  He writes his name and, as fast as he writes it, his assistant blots it.  The leases are taken up and that is all he knows about them.</P>
    <P>Another day about 100 appeals are taken into him by his officials.  They are handed to him for signature.  He cannot possibly wade through them because there are files with them. There are local authority files, and also departmental files, and one could not possibly read through them.  All one can do is ask: &ldquo;Are you affirming or are you reversing the decision of the local authority?&rdquo;  If they are affirming the decision, and if no representations have been made, they are merely handed to the Minister for signature. As I say, you have not the slightest chance of reading them through.  I am speaking from practical experience and I am sorry to say there is not a hope in hell of reading through all the files. You depend entirely on your officials. I want to be fair to the officials and to the assistant secretaries or the secretaries who bring you the appeals.  If there is anything in them that should be brought to your notice, it will be brought to your notice, but you depend entirely on them.  If they are affirming the decision, and no representations <Col N="1128" /> have been made, you sign the order affirming the appeal and that is that.  If some person were to ask the Minister about it, he could not tell him anything about it.</P>
    <P>If representations are made by a Deputy, a Senator or any person other than the applicant&mdash;they may be made by a professional man&mdash;and the recommendation of the Department is not in agreement with those representations, the Minister will definitely examine the file, but not otherwise.  It is not every citizen of the State who can make representations through a Deputy, a Senator or a professional man.  I can imagine a poor man in the West, the South or any other part of the country who wants to build a small house and is turned down by the country manager.  He knows he has the right to appeal because that is endorsed on the refusal.  He writes to the Minister and sends in the grounds which he considers proper grounds for an appeal.  If no further representations are made, you can rest assured that the Minister will not see that file.  It would be physically impossible for a Minister to read through all the files because there are so many files with these appeals.  It would be unfair to any Minister&mdash;I do not care who he is&mdash;to expect him to read through all these files.</P>
    <P>Let me give three examples.  I came in at the last moment without any preparation to speak on this Bill but I can think of three glaring examples of decisions made in my time.  One was in relation to the Bray Road below Bray where there was a V-shaped junction.  It was on the main road on the other side of Bray.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on the other side of Bray going on towards Greystones. In any event, there was an application for permission to erect a petrol pump there which the local <Col N="1129" /> authority turned down because they thought it would turn this dangerous corner into a more dangerous traffic trap.  Representations were made to me by two different political Parties and, despite those representations, the recommendation I got from my technical advisers, administrative and professional, was that I should not allow a petrol pump to be erected there.  I decided I would go out and inspect the place myself.  I did so and I saw that, if we cut away that &ldquo;V&rdquo; and built the petrol pump right back, we would open up the vista on both roads and do away with the dangerous trap that then existed.  On the undertaking that the petrol station would be built back a certain distance, I granted permission. What was a death trap is now absolutely safe and, on many occasions, officials of the Department of Local Government have agreed with me that this was one case in which something advantageous was done from the point of view of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember another case in which an individual made application for permission to build a petrol pump on the Stillorgan Road.  The local authority turned him down and he appealed to the Minister.  All the professional advice I got was against the building of a petrol pump there.  This was round about the time of the Suez crisis when petrol was about to be rationed.  I had inquiries made locally and I found that the nearest petrol pump was about three-quarters of a mile away from a number of residents in the area.  If petrol were rationed, those residents would have to travel three-quarters of a mile for petrol.  I decided that, if we could get the developer to build a well-planned petrol station, with flower beds, and so on, that would be an advantage not only from the point of view of the appearance of the place but also from the point of view of the residents. We insisted on that being done and I have been complimented many times since, even by officials of the Department, on having made this amenity available to the people in the particular locality.  Had representations not been made to me, and had I not gone out to see the place for myself, we would, in <Col N="1130" /> my opinion, have done an injustice in refusing permission to build there.</P>
    <P>The third case was in Cashel, County Tipperary.  There is a very fine hotel in the town and two Fianna Fáil Deputies, neither of whom is in the House any longer, made representations to me.  One was anxious that the urban council should build houses to the rere of this hotel.  The other was most anxious that no houses should be built there because there was a most magnificent view from the hotel dining room across the river and over sweeping meadow lands.  One of these Fianna Fáil Deputies was a great friend of mine; the other was a friend but not as good a friend as the man who was anxious to have the houses built.  I went down and looked at the site and I immediately said that, if houses were built there, one of the most beautiful views would be spoiled.  I said I was sure the houses were necessary, but some other site would have to be found. Another site was found when those interested discovered I would not give permission to build.</P>
    <P>These are the cases in which the board we visualise could act.  The board could examine the locus.  It would take away from the Minister a most odious duty.  We all make representations to Ministers and Ministers are only human.  I am not making any attack on any Minister.  I am speaking from experience.  It is very unfair to ask a Minister to sign his name to a decision which is given not by himself but by some of his officials.  If we had an impartial board, we would be doing a service not only to developers but to the Minister himself because we would take away from him a duty I know he does not want.  This tribunal would be presided over by a judge, with two competent assessors, one an expert in planning to be nominated by certain individuals, the other also to be nominated, and both to be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission. This tribunal would be guided by the presiding judge.  They would have the technical advice of the assessors.  They could inspect the locus.</P>
    <P>A very unfair charge was levelled by Deputy Molloy.  He said no one <Col N="1131" /> speaks in favour of this proposal other than lawyers and lawyers are always trying to make business for themselves. The tribunal would be presided over by a branch of the law of which I am not a member.  I make no apology to anybody; I think a judge would make an ideal president of such a tribunal. We can say what we like about our judges but, irrespective of who appoints them to the Bench, they are completely impartial and no one can point a finger at them.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were a presiding judge, I would be satisfied, but he is not.  If this tribunal were appointed, I believe justice would be done.  They would have an opportunity of studying the plan.  They could visit the locus.  They could hear evidence, <i>viva voce</i> or otherwise, from interested individuals.  I know Ministers do not want to see appellants. They are damn right in that because, if they did, they would have nothing else to do but see appellants and hear their evidence.  Ministers have no time for that.  That is not the function of a Minister.  An <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal such as that suggested could examine the file, hear the evidence, and publish their decision, giving reasons for that decision.</P>
      <P>All of us have had experience of the successful appellant, having asked somebody to make representations for him, coming to the completely erroneous conclusion that it was political pull that got him some concession. Perhaps an Opposition Deputy has made representations to the Minister and he may come to the conclusion that that Deputy, particularly if he comes from the Minister's constituency, has some pull with the Minister.  That would be all the more so if the Deputy happened to be a member of the Minister's Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving the wrong impression because people are inclined to believe that unless they have a pull of some description with the Minister, through a Deputy of the Minister's Party, through an Opposition Deputy or through a Senator, their appeal will not <Col N="1132" /> be successful.  In 99 cases out of 100, it cannot be and will not be successful and it is for that reason that I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity we had not more Deputies in the House to listen to the speech just made by Deputy O'Donnell who spoke with a sound and fundamental knowledge of the subject we are dealing with.  We all accept that we live in a planning age.  Some 20 years ago one heard practically nothing about planning, but with the changing times generally and with the growth of urban populations not only in this country but everywhere, planning has become a necessity.</P>
      <P>It is only natural, therefore, that it should be in the hands of experts. There is a theory among the public in this country that all applications made to Departments are dealt with personally by Ministers.  That is possibly due to the fact that every letter a Deputy receives when he makes representation on behalf of his constituents contains a first paragraph: &ldquo;I am instructed on behalf of the Minister for so and so to tell you ...&rdquo; Deputy O'Donnell definitely has conveyed to the House&mdash;he being a former Minister concerned with the subject matter we are dealing with&mdash; that such is not the case.  But the public do not know that.  The public always conceive that anything referred to a Minister may very well become a political issue straight away.  Human beings being what they are, I do not say that from time to time some political preference is not shown here and there, and this debate, which has raged fast and furious during several sittings, goes to show there is a feeling among Deputies that a certain amount of political influence has been used in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a planning age and the figures quoted by Deputy Fitzpatrick when introducing the Bill show that we need a fundamental change in planning policy.  After all, to my knowledge the first attempt from a legislative viewpoint to deal with planning was the Act introduced by the former Minister for Local Government some three or four years ago.  At <Col N="1133" /> that time none of us envisaged the extent to which we would all become involved in this facet of public life&mdash; that virtually everything that happens in the country today would be concerned with some form of planning permission.</P>
    <P>We have almost reached the stage when if you want to paint your front gate you have got to get planning permission or at least to stick a notice outside to say that you propose to do so and so, and if there is not an objection within a certain period you can go ahead and do it.  However, if some junior official decides he would not like you to paint your front gate you are not allowed to do it without permission and in extreme cases you may find yourself, as a Deputy, having a constituent coming asking you to write to the Minister to reverse the decision of some official in the local authority who has refused you the right to paint your gate.  That may be an extreme case but that is the position we are faced with today in this Planning Act which we in Fine Gael wish to amend by this Bill.  It is a dictatorial Act.  Though in theory there is a right of appeal, there is not really the full right of appeal that exists in many other spheres concerned with other Departments and other situations.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly to consider the Land Commission.  The Land Commission have perhaps as much authority as a planning authority but they have a fair and open system of dealing with it.  I use the words &ldquo;open system&rdquo; because the planning system under existing legislation is not an open system.  Nobody knows exactly what is going on.  All they know is that permission has been refused and the reasons for the refusal are given in writing, usually in a very skimpy way, by the local authority.  An appeal is made and the appellant gets back the reply that the decision of the local authority has been upheld on such and such a ground, perhaps with a few minor alterations.</P>
    <P>How different is the Land Commissioners' system in appeals in <Col N="1134" /> relation to land?  It is virtually the same system we are seeking through this Bill.  The system there is that the appellant can go to the Commissioners, can state his case and bring his expert witnesses.  Furthermore, the Commissioners will contribute a sum of money for him to enable him to fight his defence, whereas in our planning system he cannot go before the planning authority and state his case. He cannot go anywhere to do that. That, to my mind, virtually approaches dictatorship.  It may not have been intended in the Act.  All those Acts are drafted by somebody who is caught up in this bureaucratic tangle in which we live, which safeguards the people who are now being given control over the lives, the ways and the means of people throughout the State.  That is evident in the planning system.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had been introduced by the Minister for Local Government as amending legislation it would have been accepted with acclamation by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We would have had Fianna Fáil Deputies standing up thanking the Minister for bringing in legislation to safeguard the rights of the individual.  On this occasion, instead of that, with the exception of the Minister for Health, who said there was a lot of substance and fact in this Bill, we had the Deputies from the other side of the House who spoke failing to approach the Bill with open minds.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a Bill like this into which so much work has been put by Deputy Fitzpatrick and other members of Fine Gael, has not been discussed in an unbiased way.  We should be able to get away from the situation in which anything an Opposition Deputy introduces in the House becomes controversial legislation straight away.  It would be welcomed in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am constantly being approached in my constituency about planning proposals. I feel sure my colleague in the Labour Party is also.  I feel that the majority of cases Deputies in the country like myself get are ordinary planning appeals.  One that very often <Col N="1135" /> comes before us is the question of a petrol pump.  The system is entirely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get to my point.  The system is not a good one.  Somebody wants to erect a petrol pump.  He gets one of the major petrol companies to stand behind or get the scheme going for him.  He decides to invest a certain amount of money and naturally chooses a place that will be of advantage to the public because if he did not, it would not be to his financial advantage.  The proposal goes in to the local authority and to the planning authority there.  I do not know if the planning authority in my county or in any county see any future in petrol pumps, but I know that no decision is taken for an interminable period.  I understand that in the Act going through this House, if you had a delay of a month, there is a safeguard to protect the ordinary individual. The local authority has to take a decision within a month as to whether they agree or disagree.</P>
      <P>I have never known a case in relation to a petrol pump where a decision was taken in one, two or three months.  As Deputy Corish says, they do not know whether to take a decision or not because they do not want to make up their minds whether it is a wise decision or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case came before me a few days ago where a man wanted to erect a petrol pump on an absolutely straight road.  North and south, one could see over 200 yards each way.  He was prepared to go back 30 feet from the road and was prepared, if necessary, to go back 50 feet; and one can see 200 yards each way.  He tells me that he has been turned down on the grounds that the road is too straight and that the traffic would be moving too fast.  I ask you: where is he supposed to erect the petrol pump?  Another case was referred to by Deputy O'Donnell which I know well.  When you get out of Bray, there <Col N="1136" /> is another road coming out and there is a triangle.  There is a petrol pump there which is an advantage.  That is one of the corners where you can put a petrol pump with safety.  But for any authority to say you cannot put a petrol pump on a straight road because the traffic is too fast is pure unadulterated nonsense.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing you get with a planning authority where you have no real safeguard against it such as the Commission we suggest would provide. It is a pity the Minister for Local Government was not in the House when Deputy P. O'Donnell was speaking and was giving the complete low-down on what happened when he held the same office.  In Deputy P. O'Donnell's day as Minister for Local Government, not one-third of the number of planning appeals, or probably not one-fifth, were coming before him.</P>
    <P>Judging from the statistics issued by the different speakers in favour of this Bill, these appeals are growing.  They have snowballed and are gathering force, with the number of planning applications coming in to the Department of Local Government.  Quite obviously, the Commission suggested by the Fine Gael sponsors of this Bill is reasonable.  They are asking that a judge preside over it, be the final arbiter on the facts when they have been placed before him, and that he sit with two experts.</P>
    <P>In the courts of law, one often feels &mdash;anyone who has had to go to law from time to time&mdash;that one does not get a fair crack of the whip from a judge.  One often feels, where a decision is given against one, aggrieved that one has to pay one's own as well as the other fellow's costs.  But against that, there is nobody else one can suggest as a presiding officer over a court like this other than a judge.  He will be impartial. He has no interest one way or the other but to decide what is best for the country as a whole, what is best in the planning interest and what is fair to the appellant, and the appellant will be free in this case to go before the tribunal to state his own case.  He could do it himself and he need not employ, as has been suggested by some <Col N="1137" /> speakers, legal advice.  He would be just as well able, if he is looking for a petrol pump, or wants to extend his premises, to explain his case before a tribunal as any lawyer, that is, provided he has ordinary intelligence.  That is a very fair and sound proposition.  I think the situation has now been reached in which these appeals are pouring in literally in hundreds.  Some new approach will have to be made by the Government in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, but many things surprise me in this House, that the Government have not jumped at this Bill with enthusiasm and that they have not shown a certain amount of gratitude when a Bill has been prepared and drafted for them by the Opposition Party.  It is not easy for the Opposition to draft a Bill.  We have not all the facilities available to us that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have.</P>

      <P>They have shown their ability in this case.  At the same time, I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not a lawyer's job to draft a Bill.  That is a job for the Parliamentary Secretary and when the Parliamentary Secretary wants to draft a Bill, he will have all the advice the State can offer available to him.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by the Minister for Health, who made a fair statement, that he envisaged a new Department, or a new section of a Department, coming out of this Bill.  Is it not quite obvious that planning in the city of Dublin, unplanned by the City Fathers for the past 50 years, with portion of it starting to tumble down, will involve a terrific volume of work if the grandiose scheme we hear about in the centre of Dublin is to come into existence.  You must have a larger staff and if you have that greater amount of staff, what earthly difference will this Commission make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> The Bill here provides for a Commission which will help to deal with a backlog of work.  To further simplify the matter for the Minister for Local Government, it provides also for an assessory commission, if necessary. I venture to guess that the Minister will probably not accept this Bill&mdash;I think he has not yet spoken on the matter&mdash;because the good things that come from Fine Gael are never accepted in this Parliament; that is why the country is in the present somewhat parlous position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am waiting to hear Deputy Briscoe who is, I understand, a distinguished member of Dublin Corporation, making his contribution to the solution of the difficulties that lie ahead for Dublin Corporation as a result of planning neglect throughout the years.  If he would concentrate on that instead of trying to trip me up it would be better.  This is all cut and dried.  The Minister has his scheme but I venture to guess that what will happen will be that the Minister will come in at a later date with a Bill very much on the same lines.  It will be a little different because what Fine Gael does must always be wrong in the eyes of Fianna Fáil.  He will bring in a Bill on somewhat the same lines and he can be grateful to this Party for laying the foundations of the Bill for him.  His work will be easier and will take far less time.  The draftsman will really only have to alter a few words to make it look as if it is not the original Fine Gael Bill.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I think this is one of the most sensible pieces of legislation that has been brought before the House and I hope the debate will continue longer and that the Opposition Deputies will contribute realistically instead of trying to denigrate the hard work that has been done by, if you like, the lawyers in the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I think we all agree that the absence of planning and <Col N="1139" /> planning schemes throughout the years in different parts of the country caused many serious defects in the layout and structure of our towns, particularly developing towns.  In my own town new areas have been developed where very fine houses were allowed to spring up without any regard to planning or harmony or things like that.  Now that we are adopting draft and development plans this fact strikes us more and more.  We see very fine localities that have been destroyed in the absence of proper planning.  In regard to this Bill which the Fine Gael Party have brought before the House for consideration, I certainly think they deserve a certain amount of credit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not hear about people whose applications are granted and to whom there is no objection by either the local authority or a neighbour.  Is it absolutely necessary to devise a rather cumbersome and expensive scheme to satisfy this <Col N="1141" /> section of roughly seven to ten per cent of the applicants?  I do not think it is. If the Minister so desires and if he were not satisfied with the present procedure, I think he could devise a simpler scheme.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  This device is not used in my county.  First of all, it is turned down and then a fresh application is made with some little change in it which will make it different from the original application. Then you have to make the rounds of <Col N="1142" /> the councillors in the different Parties to get a majority and then rush the county manager to make a decision legally, as you can under section 4, and get permission.  That is a most awful state of affairs and should be resisted in every county.  Either you have confidence in your county manager or you have not.  I ask the House to reject this Bill because the Minister, recognising the necessity for some kind of machinery to expedite the processing of appeals of this kind, could devise, and should devise, and might devise a far simpler scheme and a scheme which will be easier to operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill because it deals with something about which I feel very strongly.  Many of the accusations levelled from time to time at Ministers allege that they are rubber stamps and that they do not run their Departments, that the civil servants run them, and that all they do is sign various Bills. To remove from the Minister for Local Government the right to grant an appeal would be evading responsibility. We are public representatives; the people elect a Government to govern and personally I would feel, if I had to appeal to a lawyer who was chairman of a tribunal to decide a case for me that the human aspects of the case would not be considered.  This is another reason why I would be against handing over the responsibility for hearing appeals to a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House have, at some time or other, on behalf of constituents or otherwise, followed up appeals which went to the Minister. At council level we carry forward the representations we have received if we are convinced there may be a miscarriage of justice.  I know of a case which is actually before the Minister which involves a man who, literally, is likely to be rubbed out if his appeal is not granted.  While technically, and according to the officials, this matter should not be granted the particular solution which he is looking for, there is also the human point of view which is not considered and will not be considered, and it is in the hands of the Minister only to decide whether or not <Col N="1143" /> the grounds are sufficient for granting it.  At the moment if one wished to make an appeal on behalf of a person who might not have sufficient stamps on a card, there is no way in which one can appeal to the Minister; there is an appeals officer who decides and no public representative is allowed go to this man and make representations.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Donnell has been able to inform me on a matter on which I have been misinformed. In any case, by turning this responsibility over to a commission, the Minister would be evading responsibility. Deputy O'Donnell knows how the office of the Minister for Local Government works because he was himself a Minister for Local Government. He knows that the Minister is advised by his officials about the attitude he should take on any particular problem which is up for appeal before him and it is up to him either to accept or reject that advice.  It would be very harmful for the community to take this authority away from the Minister because, as I said, the Minister can look at this in a way in which a lawyer cannot.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that I oppose this Bill on those grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill and I should like to refute what the Parliamentary Secretary said when he suggested that town planning appeals are subject to section 4.  Of course they are not.  I should also like to refer to Deputy Booth's speech last evening.  He referred to a decision of Dún Laoghaire Corporation in regard to a CIE hotel and said that it was improperly debated at Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  That is completely untrue. The manager brought the matter before Dún Laoghaire Corporation for its <Col N="1144" /> decision because he considered the matter to be of considerable importance, as he was quite entitled to do. He was, of course, entitled to come to a decision himself without referring the matter to Dún Laoghaire Corporation but I may say that in Dún Laoghaire Corporation, we have always had managers who, when they had a matter of importance to decide, brought it before the corporation before coming to a decision themselves.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire Corporation considered the advice given by the engineer who had listed ten reasons why the CIE hotel should not be built on the proposed site, at the railway station. I want to place it on record that I am in complete agreement with the decision of Dún Laoghaire Corporation. The proposed site is a very bad one, both from the town planning point of view and from the scenic point of view. I am sure the Minister knows that Dún Laoghaire Corporation has always had as its policy not to build on the sea side of the road.  That has been followed right through to the Vico Road, which may have a familiar ring for the Minister.</P>
      <P>As I said, I support the decision not to build at Dún Laoghaire railway station.  I want to say, as I have said on other occasions, that I am in favour of having a CIE hotel in Dún Laoghaire but not at the railway site.  I think it is a bad site and I feel that the officials of this hotel want to build a hotel in Dún Laoghaire where they can put their hands out of the window of the hotel and grab the passing motorists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When this proposal was announced by CIE or Ostlanna Éireann&mdash;I will give you the difference &mdash;they were apparently in such a hurry that the invitations to the announcement which was to be made on the following Monday were sent out on Friday.  The invitation to me was addressed to the Town Hall.  It was sent out on Friday.  Of course it arrived at the Town Hall on Saturday and there was nobody there.  It was readdressed <Col N="1145" /> to my home address by the Town Hall on the Monday morning so that I got the invitation to this CIE announcement after the announcement had taken place at 5 o'clock on the Monday afternoon.  It appears to me that CIE were in a frightful hurry and apparently had no time to go and talk to the Dún Laoghaire Corporation officials.</P>

      <P>I want to say to Deputy Andrews straight here and now that when the officials of CIE did come out to Dún Laoghaire, we proposed an alternative site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me tell where the site is, please.  We proposed an alternative site&mdash;the harbour master's house&mdash;right outside the Town Hall.  It is only across the road from the railway station.  That site is bigger than the site which CIE proposed to build on at the railway station.  I am told by the officials of Dún Laoghaire Corporation that the Board of Works who are building the car ferry at St. Michael's Wharf are anxious for additional land.  Therefore CIE could give them this part of the railway station, the back of it, in exchange for the harbour master's house.  I think it is ridiculous.  There is no doubt that the harbour master in Dún Laoghaire could be found an alternative site and that site would be ideal for a hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I have gone into this problem fairly extensively and the thing that worries me about it is that CIE have it fairly fixed in their minds that they must spend money on the railway station in Dún Laoghaire, they have got to modernise it and just purely to modernise it, they are going <Col N="1146" /> to build a hotel.  I feel that the Minister, when he comes to consider this matter, should take all these things into consideration, and then when he considers the site at the back of the railway station as against the harbour master's house on the seafront road, he will be perfectly satisfied that what we in Dún Laoghaire Corporation did, turning down the railway site, was in the best interests of all the people of Dún Laoghaire.  The harbour master's site is ready and available for CIE to build on and we would welcome in Dún Laoghaire a CIE hotel.</P>

The man had sent for us to hear our case and the moment we started, one adviser caught him by one arm and said: &ldquo;You cannot do that, Mr. Minister&rdquo; and the other gent on the other side said: &ldquo;It is nonsensical hearing those people.&rdquo;</P>

We had to go to the trouble of bringing engineers over from England to see the Minister on that occasion.  That was the response I got.  Now, thank God, we have a different Minister in office and a different condition of affairs.  I am absolutely confident that we can get a better, sounder, more commonsense decision out of the Minister and his Department of Local Government than from any commission set up to tell me whether I am to build a house in Chapel Lane or somewhere else.  The thing is too nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> The usual routine is that a planning proposal is made to the county council where it is considered in the first instance.  If the applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the county council he can appeal to the Minister. There is an arrangement in Cork&mdash;I do not know how it is done in other counties&mdash;to have frequent county council meetings at which any councillor can bring up the matter of a planning proposal that has been turned down and it is examined by the council and arguments for and against are heard.  It is the elected representatives&mdash;not the officials&mdash;who make the decision.  If there is an appeal from that decision, it goes to the Minister for Local Government.  I would have far more confidence in any elected representative, even if he is Minister for Local Government, than I would have in any team set up by gentlemen lawyers to mess around and to give some of their needy comrades a High Court case. There is too much of that.  This House is too prone to it.</P>

    <Col N="1152" />
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to reply at any length to what was said here today. Obviously we could go on and on repeating what was said on two different days last May and what was said here again today.  The only reason I got up is that Deputy Tully expressed some doubts about this section today and also on another occasion and that is the only point I should like to clear up.  Deputy Tully expressed this doubt before and I drew his attention to what the position was but he may not have been in the House at the time.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to him that there is no question whatever of a garda going to a person's house sometime after he has arrived home after driving.  The point to remember is that this is an amendment of section 49 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act and it can only be read in conjunction with that section.  Section 49, subsection (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 provides:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment of that.  The prior requirement of being in a public place is relevant so that a garda cannot require the person to take the preliminary breathaliser test unless he comes across him driving or attempting to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place.  There is no question whatever of his going afterwards to the person's house.  In fact, he would have no authority whatever to do that. I pointed that out in volume 227, No. 6, of the Official Report, column 1029. That is the only point I want to clear up.  A garda would not, in fact, have authority to do what Deputy Tully thinks this might make possible.  There is no question whatever of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to everything else that was raised, I think there was nothing new and I would only be wasting the time of the House going over them again.  The fact is that this is a simple matter at issue.  The fundamental thing in the Bill is whether we are to create this new offence or not.  I am asking the House to make it an offence in future for the person who drives or attempts to drive a mechanically-propelled <Col N="1153" /> vehicle when an alcohol content of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood has been reached.</P>
    <P>I said before that it is scientifically established that virtually everybody would have his driving efficiency seriously impaired at such a blood-alcohol level.  It is as near certain as possible that everybody would have, and when Deputy Fitzpatrick said I would admit that a man when he shows this particular blood-alcohol content was incapable of driving, I said no such thing.  It is not possible to prove that every single member of the human race would be affected by the test.  There is no reason to believe that anybody would not be seriously affected at this blood-alcohol level.  I personally believe that everybody, no matter how experienced and how accomplished a driver, would have his driving impaired at this level.  That cannot be scientifically established but it is scientifically established that practically everybody would be so affected. The public are entitled to have this protection and my belief is that the public as a whole demand this protection.</P>
    <P>It is all right for Deputies to refer to what the Commission says, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, in May, 1963.  I quote from page 43 of their report:</P>
    <P>It may be that, as a result of experience, public opinion would in the course of time be conditioned to accept and approve of a prescribed level which would be conclusive evidence of impairment.</P>
    <P>They went on to say:</P>
    <P>We doubt very much if the education of opinion on the matter has yet reached that stage.</P>
    <P>That is almost five years ago, in 1963, and I do not know how many deaths and maimings ago it was but I certainly know that in the last calendar year, the number of deaths on our roads was 415 and the number injured was 5,693, so that the total in the 12 months of 1967 between deaths and maimings was 6,108.  The public have had five more years of that and it is my opinion that the public <Col N="1154" /> demand this protection, that they demand that the State do everything possible to ensure that people who run this terrible risk of impairing their driving efficiency when they are in control of a deadly weapon, should not be allowed to drive.  They demand that the State should do everything possible to ensure that such people should not go on the road endangering their own lives, the lives of their passengers and the lives of innocent people.</P>
    <P>I completely reject the suggestion made by my own colleague that because we cannot ensure 100 per cent enforcement of the law, we should do nothing about it.  We cannot ensure that every law passed will be 100 per cent observed and enforced.  We have to hope for some element of co-operation by the public.  We have to depend on whatever system of enforcement we have available to us.  Although we know it will not be 100 per cent effective we are called upon to safeguard the public from this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a fundamental issue, whether we establish this new offence or whether we do not.  Deputy Dillon says that he will go part of the road but there is no part of the road.  You either make it an offence to raise the blood-alcohol to this level or you do not.  If you make it an offence, you must have some system for establishing it.  As far as I can understand Deputy Dillon, he says he is prepared to make it an offence but he is not prepared to give us any method of establishing it.  A breathaliser test does not establish it. Deputy Dillon suggested that we establish it by that means.  That is not a reliable test.</P>

      <P>It would be unjust to convict anybody on anything we cannot stand over.  It would be unjust to convict anybody on the basis of a breathaliser test but the other tests are reliable.  I think that in the interests of public safety we are fully entitled to insist that anybody who wants to take on this terrible responsibility of driving a motor vehicle on the roads should <Col N="1155" /> undertake to submit himself to this test, if he is required to do so, and anybody who is not prepared to accept that condition in the interests of public safety should not be allowed to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle on the road.  There is no inherent right in anybody to drive a car on the public road, any more than there is an inherent right in anybody to be in the possession of firearms or some other offensive weapon such as was mentioned during Question Time today.  I think the three days debate we had on this section now has made it quite clear that there is a fundamental difference between the proposal I am making and the proposal from the Fine Gael Party and from the Labour Party, though not all.</P>

      <P>Maybe some of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is a fundamental difference.  What I am proposing is that it be made an offence to raise the blood-alcohol content to this dangerous level.  It is quite justifiable to make this a criminal level when driving a car.  Public safety demands it.  The results of a similar provision elsewhere strengthen my case.  It is obvious that such an improvement can be expected here also.  I want to contradict what was said here, namely that the decrease in deaths, in injuries and in total accidents in Britain resulted because there was a smaller amount of traffic on the roads, because people gave up driving altogether.  That is not a fact. These reductions took place in circumstances of an increase in the amount of traffic.</P>

      <P>We have to rely on official information.  I do not have to stand over the accuracy of figures the authorities in another country produce. It is usual to accept the figures they give.  However, I am not basing my case on that.  I am basing it on the fact that drunken driving is one factor that contributes to accidents.  Nobody can reasonably deny that.  I am not suggesting that it is the only factor.  I am not unmindful of the parking of lorries or even the existence of large lorries and trailers, tiredness, and all of the other factors which were mentioned. We must tackle all of them, too.  However, this is the one that it is reasonable to require every person who drives a car to avoid.  If he is not able to avoid it, then it is reasonable to require him not to drive his car.  I do not think it is any argument in favour of not doing this to say that people need their cars in order to earn their livelihood.  If they need their cars in order to earn their livelihood, and they are not able to resist raising their blood-alcohol content to this level, they should get some other means of earning their livelihood where they will not be dependent on having a licence to take out a motor vehicle on the public roads to the danger of other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that I am almost 100 per cent in support of the Bill.  The only thing I have doubts about&mdash;unfortunately, the Minister has not removed those doubts &mdash;is this question of the Garda being able to test somebody three hours afterwards.  The Minister says that because it refers to a previous Act, they must be caught using a motor vehicle or they cannot be charged.  I do not know if the Minister has considered this.  I deliberately raised it again today because, on the last occasion, last year, when this was mentioned, and when I did make this point, the Minister gave me a reply.  Now, having had an opportunity of looking at it, I feel the Minister might decide to give a better reply than the one he then gave. Would the Minister care to tell us here tonight how somebody who is driving and who is arrested, while behind the wheel of his car, would be able to take <Col N="1157" /> a drink subsequently while in the custody of the Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it reasonable that somebody who may be charged with drunken driving, and knows it, will take out a Baby Power and drink it?  That weakens the Minister's case.</P>
      <P>I am all in favour of the Bill.  I agree with what the Minister has just said about the necessity to use it and about the good effects that will result when it is passed&mdash;and I could give even better evidence than the Minister has given. This is the one weak point.  This section is a danger.  It still gives the right to gardaí to go after somebody.  They may say they suspect a person of drunken driving who got away from them.  They may go to his house and arrest him, though he may not have been the person at all.  A case of this kind is on record.  Before the Bill becomes law, the Minister must copperfasten this point so that there will be no danger in this respect.</P>
      <P>I speak as a Pioneer.  I believe that if somebody wants a drink when he goes home after his day's work, he is entitled to take it.  I do not think it should be open to the police to go into that man's house on suspicion, or whatever you like, and charge him afterwards, within three hours.  The Minister must find a better reason than the one he has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 34.  The garda has not the right to go into a person's house.  This is necessary for the reason that, before a person is required to give the evidence with regard to his blood-alcohol content, he must, first of all, be required to submit to the breathaliser test.  Surely Deputy Tully can appreciate that, in the circumstances in which this might happen, it might be some time before the blood or urine tests can actually be taken?  That is why it is necessary to have the three-hour provision in the Bill.  There can be no question whatever of a garda going to a man's house and producing a breathaliser and requiring him to breathe into it and then requiring him to submit to a blood test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Through the Chair, I pray of Deputy Booth to be patient for a moment or two.  It has been complained that, in such circumstances, a garda may go to a person's house, allege that he has committed an offence and bring the owner of the car to the barracks to have his blood tested, establish that his concentration of alcohol is more than 125 to 100, serve a summons on him, bring him to court and put him into the witness box to establish that he <Col N="1159" /> consumed drink after he put his car in his garage.  I say that by virtue of sections 49 and 107 of the Act of 1961, the guard has just that right.  Section 49 (1) of the Act of 1961 sets out:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Section 107 (4) of the same Act sets out, amongst other things:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that there has been an offence under this Act involving the use of a mechanically-propelled vehicle&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the owner of the vehicle shall, if required by the member state whether he was or was not actually using the vehicle at the material time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence....</P>
      <P>Therefore, if a guard sees a car being driven in a public place, he is entitled to call to the house of the owner of that car an hour afterwards and ask him if he was driving it on the occasion and the owner must tell the guard whether he was or was not.</P>
      <P>Again, subsection (4) of section 49 of the Act of 1961:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section, he may arrest the person without warrant.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister, to Deputy Booth and to the House that the cumulative effect of sections 49 and 107 of the 1961 Act, coupled with the section we are now attempting to pass, is to give this power to a member of the Garda Síochána: if for some reason a car is involved in an accident or is being driven in some peculiar way and the owner goes home, parks it in the garage, has the two glasses of whiskey I talked about, the guard is entitled to come along, bring him to the station, put him through these tests, bring him to court and put the onus on him of proving that he consumed drink afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> This House is a deliberative assembly.  It is our duty to scrutinise and criticise legislation going through it.  I put it strongly to the Minister that the complaints made by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Tully are well founded and that the Minister in his effort to explain them is not correct. We are all human.  I would say that the Minister just is not correct when he gives as his explanation that the offence must be committed in a public place.  Of course it must be committed in a public place, but that does not mean that the guard concerned must there and then at the public place detect the offence and arrest the person.  If he sees what he thinks to be an offence committed in a public place, subsection (4) of section 49 of the 1961 Act gives him power to arrest the person without warrant and section 28 of this Bill, which amends section 49 of the 1961 Act, enables him to do the things Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Tully complain about.  I defy contradiction on that.  There is no violent or acrimonious difference between the Minister and myself as to what the Minister has set out to do in this Bill: to rid the roads of the inebriated driver, the person who has consumed alcohol to such an extent that he is no longer capable of exercising effective and efficient control over a car.

However, I wish to draw attention to the fact that it is not alone members of the Fine Gael Party and some members of the Labour Party who are critical of this section.  I hope the effect will not be to bring down the big stick in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms to ensure that this will not happen in the future.  I have taken note of the number of Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke on this section both last May and today.  Deputy Briscoe who spoke after me last May, broadly speaking agreed with my sentiments and was not comfortable about the section.  If the Minister wants to disagree with me, he can read Deputy Briscoe line for line.  I am only paraphrasing him. After him came a professional member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  Certainly, Deputy Dr. Gibbons was not comfortable about the section.  As a doctor, he has given evidence in these cases, and he thought that depriving a man of his livelihood on the evidence provided by the section was going too far.  The next speaker who spoke last May on behalf of Fianna Fáil was Deputy Andrews.  I do not want to be unfair to Deputy Andrews.  The Minister can read his speech.  I think it is fair to summarise him by saying that he thought enough research had not been made to date to justify the introduction of the section, and I think it is fair to say he was not comfortable about it.</P>
    <P>Today we had Deputy de Valera.  I do not have to tell Deputies who were present here when he spoke that he was not comfortable about it and thought it should not be passed.  Deputy Lemass, who is here present, has taken a firm stand on this all along.  Since he said it, I should not be ashamed or afraid to say it also.  He said that he felt the Bill in general and this particular section were prompted by political rather than practical motives and that the Minister had got himself into a situation from which he could not <Col N="1162" /> retreat.  In view of the general feeling on all sides of the House, I want to emphasise that I am not advocating the right of the drunken or the inebriated or the impaired driver, and I am not saying to the Minister: &ldquo;I am not going to give you this Bill or any part of it.&rdquo;  However, I am saying: &ldquo;I think your section is going too far and I am giving you an amendment which will shift the onus on to the accused to establish the fact that he is not impaired,&rdquo; and that the Minister should have second thoughts even at this late stage about this measure.</P>
    <P>In this little island, we are moving towards a more reasonable approach to things, and the people in the Republic and the people in the Six Counties are fraternising.  They are getting together and they are at least talking.  The Minister in Northern Ireland believes that the provisions of this Bill are not necessary and he has refused to follow the lead of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and introduce the measures they introduced there.  It is going to be a nice state of affairs in my native parish, only a parish, if a person driving a motor car can be guilty of an offence in one part of the parish in which I was born and if he crosses the Finn River, which was discussed in a question here today, and goes into County Fermanagh in the same parish, he will not be guilty of any offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider this matter, having regard to the general feeling of the Members of this House, having regard to the views expressed by the members of his own Party.  He should be satisfied, for the time being at any rate, with the substantial strengthening of the powers of the Attorney General and the Garda which my amendment gives him.  He should be satisfied with that for the time being, until, as Deputy Dillon says, it has been proved that that is not sufficient.  There are things about which we can disagree with Northern Ireland, and there are things about which we have a mighty right to agree with them, However in the age in which we are living, and having regard to the fact that driving across the border is being <Col N="1163" /> facilitated, that you can get a pass at the customs hut now without getting anyone to sign for you, without getting any bond, it is absolutely essential that the laws relating to this fundamental matter of driving motor vehicles should be the same.  Until such time as uniformity can be got between the two parts of the country, the Minister should be satisfied with the proposals I have put forward.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to indicate that he will, between now and Report Stage, reconsider the matter in the light of the discussion here, and, if he is not prepared to do that, I ask him to agree to an appeal made here earlier this afternoon to leave the matter to a free vote of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not <i>ad idem</i> on this.  What I am asking the House to do is to create a new offence, to <Col N="1164" /> make it an offence for a person to drive a motor vehicle when he has raised his blood-alcohol content to 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  That is something that can only be established scientifically. What Deputy Fitzpatrick is proposing is that we should create this offence but that the only way in which it can be established is by means of the old clinical tests which, as we know, are anything but scientific, are anything but conclusive and which definitely result in a large number of cases that would otherwise go before the courts not being taken to the courts at all.  This can only be established by means of a scientific test, and that is at present only a blood test or a urine test because the breathaliser test is not reliable.</P>
      <P>Therefore we are completely and fundamentally divided on this.  I am well aware there is a very definite group of Deputies who are implacably opposed to this proposition I am making and that it has been opposed&mdash;I was going to say obstructed but certainly it has been held up&mdash;at very great length, as I said, on Second Stage and on the two days we had it on Committee Stage last May and again now.  The Government have decided that this proposal is necessary in order to protect the public.  Some Deputies have decided that this protection for the public is not required and that it is more important that people should be entitled to form their own opinion as to when they are capable of driving and when they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further to be said on it.  Everything has been said a number of times.  There is one thing.  I have been pressed to accept, at least, the Opposition's proposition that we should wait and see, that we should try this amendment. This means that the Garda will have to try to establish, by means of the ordinary clinical tests, if the blood-alcohol content has been reached, to accept that for a number of years and if it does not prove satisfactory, then to come back to the House and say: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  I look upon that as a request to me to gamble with people's lives, to come back and say: <Col N="1165" />&ldquo;We have not got any reduction in the number of people killed on the roads, the number of people maimed on the roads.  Therefore I am asking you now to do what you were not willing to do some number of years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only new piece of information that has become available to us since we discussed this last May is that the similar provision has come into operation in Great Britain, and that their experience has been that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of killings and the number of maimings on the British roads in conditions in which there was an increase in the amount of traffic on the roads, and I think that is relevant.  I should like to point out to Deputies that if we had had this provision in force here for the year 1967, and if it produced the same results as were produced in England, over 100 lives would have been saved&mdash;over 100 fewer lives would have been lost&mdash;and over 650 people would have been saved from serious injury.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1967 were that the actual numbers of deaths on the road were 415.  The British rate of decrease in deaths was 25 per cent, and if we had that, we would have saved over 100 lives.  The injured numbered 5,693.  The British rate of decrease in injuries was 12½ per cent, and if we had a similar rate of decrease here 763 fewer people would have been killed and injured on the roads.  We would have had a correspondingly smaller reduction over the past six months.  Is it not obvious that we will not reach agreement on this, because we are fundamentally divided on it?  I think there is no more to be said on it, and should we not decide the matter one way or the other?</P>
    <P>With regard to the desirability of being in conformity with the position in Northern Ireland, so far as I can see, if we were to aim at conformity with Northern Ireland, we would have to decrease the level of blood alcohol content which we propose to make an offence from 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres down to 80 milligrammes to 100 millilitres, because the Northern Ireland Government have announced <Col N="1166" /> their intention to be in conformity with what has been introduced in Britain. They have not done it yet but if we continue at the rate we are going, they will have done it before us, although we started before them.  I do not see any point in continuing to get up here to rebut arguments which are made so often.</P>

      <P>The statistics the Minister gave us were between 1967 and 1966, but if we take the comparison with 1965, the result is not so encouraging.  The 1966 period was a very black period, particularly over Christmas, in England.  I do not think this has been proved at all.  My attitude all the time is that we should not create this new offence.  I could agree to a breathaliser and a blood test being used as evidence in courts and letting the judges have discretion as to the degree of the offence.</P>
      <P>Let me say this.  A man may be socially drunk but be capable of driving a car.  A man who is totally drunk is completely irresponsible and should not attempt to drive a car.  In the second case, the man's licence should be taken away and he should be put in jail, if you like.  In the first case, the man cannot know that he is technically drunk.  He has no way of measuring this.  He may be perfectly capable of driving a car.  The medical information that has become available to me since the last time we debated this section is that a man can drink this evening and tomorrow, after a night's sleep, after his breakfast and after his lunch, his blood alcohol content can still be 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres.  That man can be perfectly sober in so far as capacity to drive a car is concerned but he can be technically drunk under this section.</P>

      <P>In January, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister set up a new board to investigate all the causes of accidents.  This should have been done before we debated this Bill.  I cannot say whether the Minister is right or wrong because there is not enough information available to me.  As I see it, in the political situation the Government will have to go through with the Bill as it stands.  I will not open my mouth on this Bill again if the Minister will do one thing on a later section&mdash;if he will not abolish the discretion of the judge in taking away the licences of people who are committing a new offence.  This is an attempt to average the law down and to average the punishment.  One man may be a Sunday driver because he is afraid to go on the roads and this will make him a little uncomfortable, but it will take away another man's livelihood.</P>
      <P>All I really want the Minister to do is to give a vote of confidence in the judges.  I have full confidence in our judiciary and I know they will administer the law properly.  When there was nothing mandatory in England for an offence of this nature, English judges took away 60,000 licences a year.  Our own judges would be just as responsible. I gather from the Minister's reply that if you fail the breathaliser test the Minister envisages that you may be in the police station for a period of three hours.  That is rather frightening.  If the doctor does not come for three hours and ten minutes, you are OK. This is rather harassing.</P>

At least Deputy Lemass admits that this is a fundamental thing we are divided on. He does not want this new offence created.  Deputy Fitzpatrick does not admit this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are divided on this fundamental issue.  We are making it an offence to raise the blood-alcohol content to this level and then to drive a car, and we should have a vote on that.  What I am asking the House to do is to make it an offence for a person to raise his blood-alcohol content to 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres and to drive a car.  It is scientifically established that the vast majority of people will have their driving efficiency seriously impaired at that blood-alcohol level and, indeed, very likely at a much lower level.</P>
      <P>With regard to other causes of accidents, everyone knows that there are innumerable causes of accidents.  We have to try to deal with them all as well as we possibly can.  We know that speeding can cause accidents, and can cause accidents which otherwise would not be fatal.  If Deputies looked at the rest of the Bill, they would see that we have in the Bill provisions giving permission for the introduction of an overall speed limit, if that is desirable and we have introduced speed limits at different places throughout the country.  Some people observe them Some do not.  Some who do not observe them are caught.  Others who do not observe them are not caught.  It was argued here that, because everybody who does not observe speed limits is not caught, we should not introduce them at all.  I cannot accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to try to deal with all the <Col N="1169" /> causes of accidents and this is one of them.  There is no point in Deputy Lemass trying to convince us that it is not.  Everybody knows it is.  It is not conceivably possible to establish with accuracy what percentage of accidents are due to drink.  Everybody knows it is not possible to establish whether or not drink was the fundamental cause, but we do know that it causes accidents. We know it is the most culpable cause.  We know it is the cause easiest to avoid and it is reasonable, I maintain, to insist on its being avoided.</P>
    <P>I believe the general public demand that the State does everything possible to protect them from people who take this grave risk.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that in May, 1963, the Commission did not think the public were ready to accept the test as a conclusive test.  That was their opinion. It was a matter of opinion only.  Even at that time I would say there were people who did think the public were prepared to accept it.  As I have said, we have gone five years forward since then.  Last year over 400 were killed on our roads.  I do not remember the figure for the previous year but it certainly ran into hundreds.  Those injured were numbered in thousands. It is not realistic for Deputy Fitzpatrick to suggest that this dreadful carnage on the roads in the five years since 1963 has not affected public opinion and has not induced the public to demand the protection I am trying to give them, and have been trying to give them since almost this time last year: it was in May, 1967, that we made the previous attempt to introduce this.  I found it impossible to get the Bill before the House all through last year.  Now we are making another attempt.</P>

I think the public are impatient <Col N="1170" /> for this protection.  I am asking the House now to allow me to give them this protection, to allow me to require a person who raises his blood alcohol content to this level not to drive a car and, if he does not know how much alcohol he can consume in different conditions without raising his blood alcohol content to this level, then I think the best thing he can do is not to drink at all if he is driving. I do not think it is unreasonable to require every person who takes the enormous responsibility of driving a car in present circumstances to ensure that he does not contravene this new provision I am asking the House to give me.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know it is, perhaps, annoying to the Minister to have this dragging on but, nevertheless, it is essential that we should clarify the position as far as we can and reply once more to certain points made by the Minister.  Our object is to keep off the roads people who are not capable of safely driving a car because they have consumed intoxicating liquor.  I think that is reasonable. Section 49 of the Act of 1961 says:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive, or attempt to drive, a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control over the vehicle.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am prepared to go further.  I am prepared to give the Minister the blood test and to make that <i>prima facie</i> evidence if the concentration of alcohol in the blood exceeds the amount stipulated in the section and to shift over to the man who has that concentration of alcohol in his blood the responsibility of proving to a court that, not-withstanding the fact that he has that concentration of alcohol in his blood, he was capable of driving a car.  That is a substantial onus I am placing on such a driver.</P>
      <P>I have told the Minister that I know from my experience that that will make it much more difficult for an accused person to get off, particularly if he is incapable or a borderline case. As the law stands, the prosecution must satisfy the court that the accused is incapable of exercising effective control over a car and, if a district justice or a circuit court judge has a doubt as to whether or not the State has discharged that onus, he must dismiss the charge.  If the amendment I offer the Minister is accepted, the onus will shift and, instead of the State having to prove that the accused was incapable of driving a car, the accused will have to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he was capable and the benefit of the doubt will not operate in his favour.</P>
      <P>Lest it might be said that I am arguing irresponsibly, I have based my case on the Report of the Commission set up by the Minister to report to him on driving while under the influence of drink or a drug.  I have drafted my amendments from that report and the Minister's only comeback is to say that the Commission sat a couple of years ago and reported in 1963.</P>

The Minister implies that, if the Commission were reporting at the time he introduced this Bill, they would have reported differently.  I do not think I am being unfair when I say that is the impression the Minister wants to create&mdash;that public opinion has changed and that presumably the <Col N="1172" /> views of the Commission would change.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that I do not know the collective views of the Commission now or on the introduction of the Bill. I have not heard all of them speak individually but I know, and I put it on the records of the House that in so far as Very Reverend D.P. Kennedy, SJ, President of the Safety First Association of Ireland, is concerned, when he was presenting prizes to bus drivers employed by CIE on 28th November, 1966, after the Minister's Bill had been published, he deprecated the fact that the Minister had not accepted the recommendation of the Commission and had not drafted the Bill in accordance with my amendments rather than the Minister's suggestions.  That was as recently as 28th November, 1966, after the Minister's proposal had been made known.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill, I quoted Father Kennedy, President of the Safety First Association.  As far as I know, he is not a dipsomaniac; as far as I know, he is a responsible churchman in this country who has displayed a great deal of interest in the safety of the public using the roads.  On 28th November, 1966, he agreed with me and disagreed with the Minister.  He was a member of the Commission set up by the Minister and it is reasonable to assume that, because none of the other members has said he now agrees with the Minister, collectively the Commission, who spent so much time on this and who travelled so widely to collect information, are of the same opinion as they were when they published their report in May, 1963.

This shows it is not the slightest harm to draw things out. In reference to what has been said by Deputies Tully and O'Donnell, I do <Col N="1173" /> not think the Minister is doing any service to his argument by insisting that the measure as introduced by him is flawless, impeccable and cannot be amended in the slightest degree. Deputy Tully said that as a result of consideration during the Christmas recess, and presumably discussion with other people, he is afraid that a person could be arrested in his own house two hours after he had been driving a car, after he had parked the car in his garage, without having had a drink for a fortnight and after he had taken a couple of glasses of whiskey in his own house.  The Minister said blandly that the garda could not go into a man's house and arrest him without a warrant, as Deputy Tully had said.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy O'Donnell and the rest of us. Section 49 (4) of the 1961 Act reads:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section, he may arrest the person without warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means to me&mdash;and I should think it means to every layman, to anybody who understands ordinary English, never mind a lawyer&mdash;that a garda can arrest a man wherever he finds him&mdash; in the public street, in his own house, at any place he finds him.  The garda must be of the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that an offence has been committed under the Act by the person concerned.  But the garda may be wrong.  Once he <i>bona fide</i> comes to the conclusion that an offence under section 49 of the 1961 Act has been committed, he can arrest the man wherever he finds him.  It cannot be contradicted that the accumulative effect of section 107 is that a citizen driving home lawfully after a day's work, without having taken a drink that day, with no trace of alcohol in his blood, parking his car in his garage, going into his house and drinking two glasses of whiskey, may be visited by a garda who had seen him drive the car a mile away&mdash; perhaps the man was putting a cigarette <Col N="1174" /> out of the window or had swerved to avoid a dog or had acted in some funny way.  The garda may have formed the wrong conclusion that the man was drunk.  The garda may go into that man's house, bring him to the station, subject him to the blood test prescribed by section 49 of that Act, bring him to court and put on him the onus of going into the witness box and proving beyond yea or nay that he was sober on the occasion, that he had taken drink after putting his car in the garage. That would be a case for saying: &ldquo;I will believe you but thousands would not.&rdquo;  Would the Minister say at this stage that this is a technical thing, that there is nothing fundamental or basic about it, that he will have another look at it with the assistance of his advisers?</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Fitzpatrick look at section 106 of the 1961 Act? He will see that where it is required that a member of the Garda Síochána shall enter a premises, it must be specifically provided that he must apply for a warrant and obtain one.  There is nothing in section 49 or section 107 authorising a garda to enter any premises without a warrant.  Apart from that, everything that can be said has been said.

      <P>It is fairly long.  It is subsection (6) of section 106 of the 1961 Act:</P>
      <P>(a)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that an injury has been caused to person or property in a public place and that a vehicle was involved in the occurrence of the injury (whether the use of the vehicle was or was not the cause of the injury), and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the member has, either consequent upon a statement made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section or otherwise, reasonable grounds for believing the vehicle is being kept in any premises,</P>
      <P>the member may, on information on oath, apply to any Justice of the District Court or Peace Commissioner for a warrant under this subsection.</P>
      <P>(b)  On an application being made under the foregoing paragraph, the Justice of the District Court or Peace Commissioner to whom the application is made may, if he so thinks proper, by warrant&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  authorise any specified member of the Garda Síochána to enter, within one week from the date of the warrant, and if necessary by the use of force, the premises to which the application relates, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  authorise any person or persons entering the premises under the warrant to search the premises and to examine, and take possession of for the purposes of examination, any vehicle found during the search,</P>
      <P>and any such warrant shall operate in accordance with its terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pointing out that where in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, it was felt it might be necessary for a member of the Garda Síochána to enter a premises, it was necessary to enter with a warrant for that purpose.  That was done under section 6 and not under <Col N="1176" /> section 49 and, therefore, I maintain that under section 49 a member of the Garda has no authority to enter on premises without a warrant.  Certainly even if he has, it is surely a very fanciful suggestion.  I can see no purpose whatever in introducing such a fanciful suggestion except to prolong this debate. I do not know what the objective is, but, as I said, it is apparently to prolong it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask in this connection, whatever about warrants, supposing you take the case of the driver who has had no drink that day and commits a traffic offence. He crashes the lights and goes home and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, has a few drinks and afterwards a garda calls.  There is no question of a search warrant and he asks to see the driver and the man innocently comes out, as any of us would, to the door and speaks to that garda.  He admits he was driving the car.  The garda smells the drink which the man has had since he came home and acts accordingly. This is not a fanciful case; it is a reasonable case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a number of Deputies are trying to sift all possible evidence to avoid injustice being done, but I feel this is leading them up the garden path.  If, as Deputy de Valera suggests, a man crashes the lights, he is not stopped by a garda but his registration number is taken.  It will take a hell of a long time for that garda at that hour of night probably, or even in daylight, to get back to the Registration Office and track down the name and address of the owner of car registration number so-and-so.  He will never do it in three hours.  Section 49 states that a driver may be arrested if he is committing or has committed, or is believed to have committed, an offence.  That has led some people to believe that this frightful time lag will take place and that we in our own homes will be harried by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that section is phrased in that way is that you cannot arrest a man while he is committing an offence.  You cannot arrest him as he crashes the traffic lights.  Therefore, <Col N="1177" /> you must arrest him when he has committed or after he has committed it. It must be done damn quick, as quickly as possible.  It has been clearly stated times without number that the garda has no right to come in to a person otherwise than in possession of a warrant. That does not arise.  By the time the garda would get a warrant the three hour period would have gone anyway.  There is no question of this fanciful suggestion having any merit in it at all.</P>
    <P>As far as the argument goes that this is creating a new offence and as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, it would be better if we put the defendant on proof, that is entirely unrealistic.  I agree that this is a new offence and it is basically a technical offence and merely as just or unjust as a speed limit.  There are many people who can drive in excess of a speed limit with complete safety, and each one of us would always claim we are one of those, but we have to conform with the law.</P>
    <P>If the law says the maximum permitted speed in an area is 30 miles per hour you may not go faster and if you do, however safely you are going, you are prosecuted.  I found that out to my cost, too, and I was not driving dangerously. I was driving at 36 or 37 miles per hour with no house near me but the law says I could go only 30 miles per hour.  I have learnt a lesson and I have been a damn sight more careful since.</P>
    <P>That is what we are doing here.  We are creating a new technical offence and, taking all personal opinion out of it, I would not pay any attention to any inquiries taking place at the moment by which the number of accidents has been shown to be due to over-consumption of alcohol over the last year.  At the moment it is purely a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>That is the whole fatal weakness of the law at the moment.  In view of the fact that there are so many cases of doubt and in view of the fact that the accused must very properly have the benefit of the doubt, there are many cases coming before the courts where the judge is practically certain the accused was guilty of driving while <Col N="1178" /> incapable of controlling the vehicle properly but he is not absolutely certain and he never will be.  It is no use Deputy Fitzpatrick coming back with the suggestion of just passing the onus of proof on to the defendant.  He is only codding himself because days or weeks or months after the offence, no driver can produce evidence to show that he was thoroughly capable of driving a car.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that it is practically impossible to prove yourself innocent, why cod yourself by putting it in?  It is in the Bill that to raise your blood-alcohol level above a certain limit is in itself an offence. We have gone high enough.  In my view, we have probably gone too high. The fact remains that this creation of a technical offence has had the most staggering results in the United Kingdom.  Granted the overall reduction in fatal accidents has not been colossal&mdash;it has been 20 per cent&mdash;but, if it were one per cent, I would still be in favour of it.</P>
    <P>What convinces me that we are right is that the reduction in the rate of accidents between 9 p.m. and midnight has been fantastic.  It has been cut by 50 per cent and the rate of accidents after midnight and in the early hours of the morning has been cut by 75 per cent.  Those are the clear figures that show that late at night in particular accidents are being caused by excess drinking.  It is in the power of anyone to avoid prosecution here.  It is ludicrous to say that you will be caught without any real responsibility on your part.  You might as well say you could be caught without any real guilt in a speed-restricted area.  It is perfectly easy to keep on the right side of the law, and when you see a 40 mph sign come down to 40 and when you see a 30 mph come down to 30. If you do not, and if you get what is coming to you, you deserve it.</P>
    <P>It is exactly the same with drink.  It is quite possible and should not be asking too much of anyone to say: you shall not drink if you are going to drive.  None of us would like to set foot on an airliner knowing that the pilot had been drinking at all and driving a car on the roads today is far more <Col N="1179" /> dangerous than flying an aeroplane. You have too many risks far too close to you and you can kill just as many people.  It is perfectly right that we should protect the great majority of our people by saying: you shall not drive too fast and if we say that 40 mph is the maximum speed permitted on that stretch, you shall not exceed it. That is perfectly right and everyone accepts it now.  It is perfectly right also that we should say, so far as your nervous or mental reactions are concerned: you shall be deemed to be below standard if your alcohol content is above a certain figure.  I agree that it is slightly arbitrary: so are speed limits.  It is the only way we can get certainty.  I agree with the Minister in all he is doing.  Deputy Fitzpatrick may have got a wrong impression.  The Minister is so quick to jump in and so well able to put the case for the Bill that many of us who are supporting the Bill do not easily get a chance of coming to his assistance.  He gets in too quickly.</P>
    <P>We have had criticism from this side of the House and it is only right that we should examine those criticisms, but I am still as satisfied now as I have always been, that this is the only way in which we can deal with this problem. I am terribly sorry that, for reasons over which we have no control, this Bill is not already an Act.  If we could have enacted it last year there would be many people alive who are dead today. It could easily be said that under this section a man may be found incapable of driving although he was really doing fairly well.  But that man was taking a hell of a risk by drinking at all and I would not apologise to anybody for saying: if you are going to drive lay off drink for hours in advance.  Do not take a chance not only for your own sake but for the sake of all the other road users.</P>
    <P>I have heard of some fearful cases of people driving miles off their route, completely lost, blinding off into the country looking for places such as Cabinteely or Ballymun a little distance from Waterford.  There was a lady looking for Ballymun but heading south through Mount Merrion and Stillorgan, for instance.  Those are <Col N="1180" /> incidents which came to my own personal knowledge.  I am going to make sure that we do everything we can to stop this sort of thing.  I wish that Deputy Fitzpatrick would not try to introduce these niggling criticisms.  I know he is trying to make sure that there will be no injustice but I should much prefer to see slight injustice&mdash;I do not see any chance of it&mdash;and somebody still living who would be dead if we had not got this Bill through.  That is the alternative.  I do not honestly believe there will be any injustice particularly when we make it clear to people in advance that anyone who drinks and jumps into a car is taking a tremendous risk not only of killing himself or somebody else but also of losing his licence and being put off the road for a long time.  He has been warned in advance and if he takes that risk he deserves everything coming to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I am deliberately exercising restraint.  Deputy Booth trots out the old statistics with which Mrs. Barbara Castle was floundering around in the British House of Commons.  Of course, those statistics are notoriously invalid.  I want to say quite categorically that, exercising the same discretion as has been accorded to me by my Front Bench colleagues and Deputy Kyne claimed from his colleagues, I am in favour of the arbitrary definition of alcohol-blood content and I accept that as being a statutory inhibition on the driving of a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  I believe that, faced with the problem the Minister is confronted with, it is not practicable to establish in court the existence of the declared maximum alcohol-blood content and thence to proceed to an argument as to whether that constitutes drunkenness in one particular case or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that the statutory definition shall be the test, provided I am satisfied as to the method by which that determination <Col N="1181" /> has been reached.  But we are in this extraordinary straitjacket that we are asked to debate section 28 utterly divorced from section 29 which, to my mind, makes a complete farce of the whole discussion because if section 29 is to pass in its present form, then I am 100 per cent behind Deputy Fitzpatrick and a variety of other problems arise.</P>
    <P>However, in the existing situation, I am in favour of a statutory definition of incapacity to drive, and I think that can be established with a reasonable degree of certainty, bearing in mind that the acceptance of that does not exclude the right of the garda to go on claiming that, if we fail to establish by expert evidence or chemical evidence, that the man was drunk, we can advance all the existing proofs which were available to us under previous traffic laws to establish it, such as inability to say &ldquo;British Constitution,&rdquo; to walk a straight line, to speak coherently and all the other recognised old marks of what is ordinarily understood to be alcoholic or drug intoxication.  But the statistics produced by Mrs. Castle for justifying the use of the breathaliser are of quite a different character from the statistics produced to justify the imposition, by the same Minister of Transport in the British House of Commons, of speed limits.</P>
    <P>Now there you have something concrete because the situation on the M.1, which is the principal autobahn, if we may popularise the word, in Great Britain, in regard to accidents became so horrifying that they actually built a casualty hospital to service accidents on the M.1.  From the time of the opening of the M.1, that casualty hospital was kept busy night and day and then in the special circumstances of Great Britain a limit of 60 miles per hour was imposed on that carriageway, and then there emerged the dramatic statistic that the staff of the hospital had nothing to do.  If they got two or three accidents a day, it was quite exceptional.  Now, those are statistics that have significance because there suddenly occurred a dramatic change <Col N="1182" /> in a given set of conditions and only one factor has been altered.  There was no substantial change in the volume of traffic, or substantial change in the character of the traffic using the highway; one thing that had been altered was that no vehicle was allowed to travel more than 60 miles per hour. Instantly the accident rate dropped.</P>
    <P>Here we have the astonishing situation that you cannot travel more than 60 miles per hour on the Naas dual carriageway, but you can travel at 90 miles per hour on any country road.  I find myself in a very great difficulty in agreeing to section 28, in the absence of appropriate measures in relation to the other obvious driving hazards that exist.  If I were told that the Minister intended to prohibit large lorries from parking on the side of the road, if I were told that he proposed to stop articulated vehicles of 30 feet long from waggling down the road, if I were told he was going to stage a publicity campaign to persuade people walking in dark clothes on main roads at night to wear some kind of scotch tape, or illuminated armband or scarf, and that over and above these things he was going to set a statutory definition of alcoholic incapacity to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle, I would be very much happier.  That is not to say that I do not despair that he will go on to do the other things as well, but do not let us imagine that if we pass the section, we have done everything that needs to be done, because we have not.  But doing what we are doing in section 28, without any regard to what is proposed in section 29, is, to my mind, procedural insanity.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a question in regard to section 28, which sets out:</P>
    <P>or while there is present in his body a quantity of alcohol such that, within three hours after so driving or attempting to drive, the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    <P>How does he propose to arrive at that conclusion?  We are told we must have regard only to section 28.  Deputy <Col N="1183" /> Dunne was not here when that ruling was made.  How do you arrive at that conclusion?</P>

      <P>Not when it is offered to me by shysters.  Then the rule of <i>caveat emptor</i> arises, and this here &ldquo;emptor&rdquo; is going to &ldquo;cave&rdquo; as long as he likes to.  Happily, the procedure of this House still entitles him to exercise that discretion.  I said recently in public, and I want to repeat it, that theology is too important in the lives of all of us to leave it to theologians; economics is too important in the lives of us all to leave it to economists; administration is too important in the lives of us all to leave it to administrators. Our only function as politicians, for those of us who do not occupy ministerial rank, is to operate as the correcting authority on the administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have had any ministerial experience will know that in the procedure of drafting or preparing a Bill, we tell the experts the ends we seek to achieve; then they draft the appropriate legislation and submit it to their Minister so that he may bring it to the Government for the Government's approval and thence to this House, for the approval of the Oireachtas.  If the Minister says to his permanent officials: The object I want to secure is that nobody will drive a car on the roads of Ireland while there is present in his body a quantity of <Col N="1185" /> alcohol such that, within three hours after so driving or attempting to drive, the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed that of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.&rdquo;  That is all right.  Their duty is not to recommend to him what they think is a reasonable political decision bearing in mind all aspects of the case, their duty is to recommend to him the way in which that which he informs them he desires to achieve can be achieved.  It is his function to say to them then: &ldquo;I am prepared to concede the method proposed by you gives me 100 per cent assurance that I shall achieve that end but no rational legislature would be prepared to pay that price to get 100 per cent assurance that we would achieve the particular end of section 28.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the function the Minister for Local Government has failed to discharge. He is coming before this House and asking us to accept a certain artificial standard of alcoholic incapacity to drive a car without having asked himself what is the reasonable procedure by which we can evidence such a crime, and, remember, it is a crime we have to find beyond all reasonable doubt in a court of law.  That is the danger in which we are at the present time.  If I am right in believing that the fact required to be established under section 28 can be established in no other way than the machinery of section 29, then section 28 is a thoroughly bad section but believing, as I believe, that the facts required to be proved for the purpose of bringing somebody within the ambit of section 28 can be established by procedures which are acceptable to human dignity, then I would be in favour of section 28 but that is a very vital and important decision to take and I think the Minister ought to be in a position to say to us: &ldquo;Could we get substantial agreement on section 28 and let us then argue on section 29 with an open mind and free conscience?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  The Deputy finds it hard to get the wheel of his intelligence around the axle of my argument.  I cannot blame him.  You cannot put a wheel designed for a more modest purpose around a substantial axle.  The Minister's function is to say to the House:  &ldquo;Here is my suggestion&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The Minister can say: &ldquo;If we can agree substantially on a definition for the purpose of section 28 the contents of section 29 are open to free discussion.  I do not propose to put pressure on any Deputy to accept all or any part of section 29.&rdquo; That would create an entirely new situation.  However, as we stand at present in the light of the Second Reading debate the acceptance of section 28 implies acceptance of section 29 or substantial acceptance of it which I never could accept and which I want to warn the House again in my judgment would get this Bill struck down by the Supreme Court under the Constitution. Anything I can do to get it so decided I will do because it ought to be decided as to its constitutionality if it passes with section 29 in it.</P>
      <P>There are those who will say, as the Minister has himself implied and as Deputy Booth almost said, that anyone who seeks to discuss or consider this Bill is precipitating the death of a number of people.  That is wide open to doubt.

I have given up hope of the Minister yielding one iota on this section 28 and if I wanted proof of his intention not to yield I have it in abundance in his attitude towards the fundamental technical legal point raised by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Tully.  I do not propose to yield on that or to shut up on that without putting it on the records of this House in black and white that the Minister is simply saying that black is white and trying to ramrod that through the House without even offering to reconsider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Tully stated here this afternoon that section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as it is proposed to be amended by this section 28, means&mdash;and I repeat &mdash;that a law-abiding citizen who has not taken a drink for days, who drives home, parks his car in his garage, goes into his house, takes two glasses of whiskey, may be visited by a guard, may be arrested, brought to the garda barracks, submitted to a blood test, brought before the courts and compelled to go into the witness box and establish beyond yea or nay that he <Col N="1189" /> had no drink taken when he was driving.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Since I spoke the Minister has invoked &mdash;and I think that is the word&mdash;section 106 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which had not been mentioned in this House when I last spoke and it is with section 106 that I wish to deal.  In order to do it in an intelligent manner I have to lead up to it.  The Minister said that a guard could not enter a man's house without a warrant.  I drew attention to subsection (4) of section 49 of the Principal Act and to the fact that, coupled with section 106 of that Act, the cumulative effect of these sections was to permit a guard to enter a man's house and arrest him in the circumstances outlined by me. The Minister, in order to establish the pluperfectness&mdash;if there is such a word &mdash;or the infallibility of the measure brought into the House asked me did I ever hear of section 106 and, luckily, I asked the Minister to read section 106.  Section 106 subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that an injury has been caused to person or property in a public place and that a vehicle was involved in the occurrence of the injury (whether the use of the vehicle was or was not the cause of the injury) ....</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Minister consults the Attorney General or perhaps some people nearer now to him he will find out that they do not agree with him.  Section 106 deals with damage to property and says that if he is going to enter to investigate damage to property he must go and get a warrant but subsection (4) of section 49 says:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section, he may arrest the person without warrant.</P>
      <P>I say that there are two separate and distinct things.  I do not blame the Minister, if he has not had an opportunity of considering this before, for not having the answer straight away, but I do blame him for not listening to arguments and for not saying that he will have a look at it, not in the rushed manner in which he can take advice in this House, but will consult his law officer and see whether there is any substance in what I say or there is not.  But, I want to put it on record that section 49 coupled with section 27 gives power of arrest in the circumstances stated by me and that section 106 has no relevancy whatever, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle ought to study what I have said.  What Deputy Dillon is saying is that section 28 of this Bill amends section 49 of the Principal Act, and that to proceed to amend section 49 of the Principal <Col N="1193" /> Act without referring to section 49 of the Principal Act is procedure acceptable only to a Deputy as inexperienced as Deputy Booth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out that if the new definition of &ldquo;statutory alcoholic incapacity to drive a vehicle&rdquo; is accepted under section 28, a situation could arise which manifestly was never contemplated under section 49 of the Principal Act, as originally passed.  That section, in subsection (1), set out:</P>
      <P>A person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>That a member of the Garda Síochána can arrest a person subsequent to the alleged commission of such an offence &mdash;we are at one.  The only evidence he has to produce to establish the commission of this crime is that when he arrested the man, he had more than a certain alcohol level in his blood.</P>
      <P>I begin to wonder.  It is not as simple as that because all he has to establish is that within three hours after the alleged commission of the offence, the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood.  That is an entirely different offence from that prescribed in section 49 of the Principal Act. Under section 49 of the Principal Act, he had to establish to the satisfaction of the court that at the time the person was driving a mechanically-propelled vehicle in such a place, he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs to such an extent that he was incapable of driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many Deputies realise that we are creating a new offence?  We are creating an offence that you drive home, never having consumed a drop of alcohol all day, put your car in the garage, lock the garage, then having <Col N="1194" /> gone into your own house, having taken two glasses of whiskey, a knock comes on the door and a member of the Garda Síochána asks you to come down to the station because you have committed an offence.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;drives home, garages the car, goes into the living room, takes two glasses of whiskey, and there is then a knock on his door and he goes to answer the door, and is there confronted by a civic guard who lays his hand on that person's shoulder and says: &ldquo;I arrest you under section 49, subsection (4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961; I believe you are a person in respect of whom it can be truly said that there is present in your blood alcohol in excess of a concentration of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood, and I require you to come with me now to the Garda station and submit yourself to a blood and a urine test&rdquo;.  The man says: &ldquo;Listen; I have been on the road since 8 o'clock this morning.  I never touched a drop of alcohol while I sat behind the wheel of the car.  I arrived home in my car and locked it up.  I am now in my bedroom slippers sitting by the fire and have been so for the past couple of hours&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The garda is still entitled to say: &ldquo;It does not matter, but under subsection (4) of this section, you have committed an offence and I propose to bring you now to the baracks, to apply the appropriate tests.  Bear in mind, if you refuse to submit to them, that in <Col N="1195" /> itself is a crime.  There is no use arguing with me that you have not had any alcohol before you locked the car up in the garage.  That is irrelevant. Oireachtas Éireann has created a new crime.  They may not have meant to do it, but they have, and I am not going to argue with you.  I am merely a member of the Garda Síochána and I am sent here to deal with you.  I am not arguing whether you were drunk in the accepted sense when you were driving your car.  I am stating that within three hours of driving the car, there is a certain alcohol level in your blood which is accepted by subsection (4) of section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The garda then says: &ldquo;I am not interested in the Act, but for the purpose of getting evidence and establishing beyond yea or nay in the district court of the town in which you live, you must come with me to the barracks and undergo those tests.&rdquo;  Does the House want to do that?  Is there one Deputy who believes that a person who has so comported himself as I have described has done anything which should be stigmatised by this Oireachtas as a crime punishable by prison?  The real truth of it is that we have been confronted with this Bill because people have taken up positions from which they are not prepared to retreat.</P>
    <P>We have been through this before. Look what happened on the Succession Bill.  It ended up with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Lenihan, who succeeded the present Minister for Finance, going to Deputy Costello and asking him if he would, for God's sake, redraft the Bill, which Mr. Costello, in his benevolent way, proceeded to do.  We are now drifting into a position here which nobody intended and which nobody in the House wants, but which we are going to be constrained to take up because the Minister has got himself into a jam and is not prepared to listen to anybody.  He will get this or bust.  I do not believe there is a Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who believes this ought to be done. Daft and all as I believe them to be, I do not believe they are that daft.  I do not believe there is a single <Col N="1196" /> creature in the country who wants it. I do not believe there is any precedent in any civilised country in the world for conferring on the police the right to arrest you on your own threshold on a wholly artificial charge which neither the court nor the Legislature, nor, indeed, the police force itself, believes to have any validity.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary seriously to argue a case of this kind.  It only goes to show how dangerous it is to treat Bills of the kind we are here considering without the protracted study which, fortunately, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Donnell have given to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Who amongst us, in studying section 28 of this Bill, related it fully to section 49 of the Principal Act?  All of us knew, because the section itself says so, that it is an amendment of section 49 of the Principal Act but did anybody really put the two together in order to discover the true meaning of what that combination involved?  Certainly, I had not done so and, if I had, I would have represented to the House the absurdity of the position at an earlier stage.  Fortunately, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Fitzpatrick did so and have brought the matter to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>There are seven Deputies listening to me, in addition to the Minister. Is there a single one who is listening to me who believes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already read what subsection (4) provides.  Either it is true or it is false.  I say that, as section 49 will read if section 28 of this Bill is passed, it will be an offence to have the alcohol-blood content set out in section 28 for a period of three hours after one has ceased to drive. Is that not true?  Therefore, if a person comes home stone cold sober, not having consumed a drop of alcohol all day, locks his car in the garage and, having entered his home, drinks two glasses of whiskey and is then called to the door by a garda, that garda can, under section 49 of the Principal Act, <Col N="1198" /> arrest him for having committed a breach of section 49 of the Principal Act as amended by section 28 of this Bill.  Is there a Deputy who thinks that ought to be within the power of any member of the Garda Síochána or of any other police force in the world?  I do not believe any Deputy believes that.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is a pity that the last hour or so of the House, in dealing with this section 28, had to be taken up in trying to get the Minister to see reason. I get rather apprehensive about having this Minister in charge of important measures such as this, in view of his attitude to this section.  If the Minister had behaved within the past hour like a legislator in charge of a Bill, instead of a political ramrod, he would get much more co-operation from this House and he would get this measure through the House quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> Experienced members of the Minister's Party know that what I am saying is correct.  The Minister did not speak since I dealt with his introduction of section 106 of the 1961 Act. Will he now inform us whether he says that a Garda has the right to enter a man's house and arrest him in the circumstances complained of or whether his attitude is that a Garda has not that right?  If the latter is his attitude, I want him to explain on what grounds he says that the Garda has not the right to enter and arrest in the circumstances of which we so bitterly complain.  I think the House is entitled to that explanation before leaving this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I know, did introduce <Col N="1200" /> section 106 (6) as an explanation.  I have dealt with that as the Minister raised it.  The Minister has not refuted my objections to section 106 as being a protection to the citizen.  We are leaving it now and we do not know whether the answer is that the guard can arrest or cannot arrest.  The Minister does not give a damn and he will not tell the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think I shall discuss them separately. We need not, perhaps, have a lengthy debate on the others.  In order to explain what I intend by my amendment. I should like briefly to refer to section 29(1) which says:</P>
      <P>Where a person (in this section referred to as the arrested person) arrested under section 49 (4) of the Principal Act or section 27 (3) (a) of this Act has been brought to a Garda station, the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge there may do either or both of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  require the arrested person to provide in the prescribed manner a specimen of his breath...</P>
      <P>In other words, he may use the breathaliser on him or (b) he may require the arrested person to submit to a blood test or a urine test.  Subsection (2) says that if a person who has volunteered to provide a sample of urine fails to do so, he must then submit himself to a blood test.  Subsection (3)&mdash;and this is the subsection to which I object and which I propose to delete&mdash;reads as follows:</P>
      <P>An arrested person (other than a person who has provided a specimen of his urine in accordance with the prescribed procedure) who, following a requisition under this section, refuses or fails to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take from the arrested person a specimen of his blood shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or, at the discretion of the court, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to both such imprisonment and such fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is right to say that that person also shall automatically have his driving licence suspended for one year.  What we are saying here is that the person who is brought to the Garda barracks on suspicion, whether he is arrested on the public highway after <Col N="1204" /> having committed an offence, or whether he is dragged from his own home, as the last division will entitle the Garda to drag him, if he is invited to submit to a blood test which entails a minor operation and refuses, he is guilty of an offence and may be fined £100, and may be sent to jail for six months, and will lose his driving licence for 12 months.  I think that is fundamentally wrong.  I am convinced that this subsection is unconstitutional because I believe it will make it obligatory on an accused person to convict himself. He has to submit to a test which may be used in evidence against him, and this may convict him of a serious offence.  This also violates his personal and individual rights.  I do not think any citizen of this State should be compelled to submit himself to a blood test.</P>
    <P>The wording of the subsection is: &ldquo;...to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take from the arrested person a sample of his blood...&rdquo;  I understand that in certain cases it is difficult enough to get a specimen of one's blood, and certainly it is a procedure to which many people would object.  At any rate, it has always been the law in this country that no person is bound to convict himself, that no person is bound to provide evidence against himself.  Now that section 28 has been accepted by the House which provides that a certain concentration of blood in a person's body is an offence if he is driving a car&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>A concentration of alcohol in the blood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Parliamentary Secretary's contribution to the debate has been very helpful.  Short and all as it was, it was quite helpful.  A certain concentration of alcohol in the blood is an offence. That provides the problem of ascertaining the concentration of alcohol in the blood.  Deputy Dillon had a big objection to 28 on these very grounds but, just as I was prepared to go a very considerable distance with the Minister in section 28 in order to enable him to strengthen the machinery for detecting impaired driving, I am now prepared to go a long way with him in section <Col N="1205" /> 29 in order to enable him to strengthen the hand of his legal advisers and the Garda, but I certainly will not be a party to making it a criminal offence for a citizen to refuse to allow his blood to be extracted from his body.  I do not think that is necessary in order to attain the objective the Minister has in mind.</P>
      <P>For that reason I move this amendment, and I hope the Minister will accept it.  If he does not, and if he uses his majority in the House to force the section through as it stands, I will have something to say on the section. As I say, subsection (3) as it stands makes it an offence for a person to refuse to submit to a blood test which entails a minor surgical operation.  I am offering in this amendment the same remedy as I offered the Minister in substitution for section 28.  The blood testing machinery can remain within the Bill as far as I am concerned, and the person who is brought to the station can, if he wishes, submit to a blood test, and consent to a blood test, but if he does not consent, the official in charge of the Garda Station or the doctor cannot compel him to submit to a blood test.</P>
      <P>I know the section does not provide that they can hold him down and take blood from him but it does provide that if he fails to submit to a blood test, he is guilty of an offence carrying all the consequences of the offence of driving a motor vehicle while impaired. In substitution for that, I say that his failure to submit to such a test shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that his judgment was impaired, and seriously impaired, from the consumption of alcohol within the meaning of section 49 of the Principal Act.  The onus would then be shifted on to him to prove that at the time he drove the vehicle, he was perfectly competent, that his judgment was not impaired, that he was not intoxicated, and was perfectly capable of exercising effective control over a motor vehicle.  That onus is a heavy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the person who refused to submit himself to a blood test was in fact capable at the time of the alleged <Col N="1206" /> offence, he will not be able to satisfy the court that he was so capable, and he will be convicted.  My experience over the years has been that if a person who is charged with drunken driving is not granted a direction at the end of the State case, it is most unlikely that he will be acquitted unless he was clearly sober and able to drive.</P>
    <P>I am putting this amendment to the House as a reasonable proposition, as a proposal to replace a thoroughly objectionable subsection, the most objectionable subsection which has ever been put to this House for enactment. I do not think that such a proposal has even come before this House before, that a person should submit himself to a minor surgical operation in order to provide evidence against himself.  That is fundamentally wrong and it is against the concept of justice which we have cherished here since the foundation of the State, and against the concept of natural justice that has prevailed in this part of the world since long before the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>My proposal is quite adequate to enable the Minister to achieve the object he has in mind.  Let me repeat that I am not here to defend the drunken driver.  I share with the Minister and all right-thinking Members of this House the belief that those who take alcohol in excess of their capacity to carry it, thereby impairing their effective control over motor vehicles, should be dealt with stringently, should have their licences suspended or should be put off the road altogether.  I am here, however, in defence of the sober driver who does not break the law, the responsible citizen who realises his obligation to society.</P>
    <P>There are rights both ways.  The motorist owes a duty to his fellow-citizens. Just because a man is licensed to drive does not mean that he forfeits the rights society and his fellow citizens owe to him.  But that is what will happen under this subsection.  It will take away from a citizen who purchases a driving licence the right which he, as a citizen, should enjoy.  I trust those Deputies who believe as I <Col N="1207" /> do will persuade the Minister to accept my amendment.  It is a reasonable and effective alternative to this objectionable subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only criticism which could be offered against this amendment is that it goes too far because it moves the onus of proof on to the accused person.  The reason it does so is that Deputy Fitzpatrick is anxious to meet the tremendous obligations which society insists should be imposed on people who drive motor cars.  There is no escape clause in the amendment other than that which should be properly available to a person who has some medical justification for not undergoing a blood test.  There is, therefore, no merit in not accepting the amendment.  To refuse to accept it is tantamount to saying that a person who refuses to have a blood test must be deemed to be guilty.  Within the last few weeks, I was quite surprised to become aware, for the first time, of a number of hardy individuals, whose stomachs would remain unturned at the most unpleasant sight, unable to undergo a blood test without fainting.  There are such people and it would be grossly unfair for this House to lay it down that these people must be damned.  It can, I know, be argued that such people can undergo a urine test, but they should be treated in the same way as all other citizens and not have this additional burden imposed on them.  That is what the Minister seeks to do in this provision. They will have no choice.</P>

      <P>Coupled with section 35 there does seem to be an <Col N="1208" /> option.  My objection to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is that it is out of line and, frankly, it makes the situation worse.  My objections to section 28 are procedural, but I am accepting it whole-heartedly.  My argument would be that we should stand on the breathaliser test.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is, I think, unnecessary. The position could be met perfectly well by standing on the breathaliser test and leaving the other two optional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the court will draw its own conclusions on the general law as it is.  In other words, let the prosecution stand on the breathaliser test.  I do not want to repeat what I said on Second Reading but, after all, what the Minister is trying to do is give further protection to the accused person.</P>
      <P>Now, if we start from the premise that we have section 28, as we have, and that the person who is guilty of an offence under section 49 of the earlier Act, as amended by section 28, is not entitled to any particular consideration &mdash;I do not think anyone was arguing to try to protect such a person; the arguments were to save the implications going further&mdash;then, if you accept these two principles, surely no injustice is done to anyone who opts to stand on the breathaliser test under section 29(1) (a).  Let the prosecution stand on that.  Just as the urine test is optional let the blood test equally be optional. Let the defendant, if he wishes, call for these other tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  If it stands on the breathaliser test, I do not think any great injustice will be done.  That will give the person involved an opportunity, if he feels he is innocent, of proving his innocence. Deputy Fitzpatrick has been trying to make the point of a person convicting himself.  There may be something in it, but I think it could be counter-argued. It is open to the accused to call evidence in his own defence.  My suggestion would be to withdraw the amendment.  I would suggest to the <Col N="1209" /> Minister then that he should make section 29 (1) (b) optional to the accused.  If he does not exercise his option to have a urine test or a blood test, then the breathaliser test is required. That is, I think, the simple, straightforward way out of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I regarded the Minister's reply to my question as unsatisfactory, evasive and impertinent, I would have restrained myself from raising the matter on the Adjournment, were it not for the fact that when, in the course of supplementary questions, I continued to press the Minister to give approval for the extension to the pathology laboratory in St. Kevin's Hospital, the Minister said, as reported at column 436 of the Dáil Debates for 6th February last, that if I continued along that line of country; &ldquo;I will not give my approval to it at any stage&rdquo;. On behalf of every Member of Dáil Éireann, I particularly object to any Minister saying that because a Deputy is pressing for something which he strongly believes in, the Minister will not give approval.  It may well be that the Minister, on reflection, might regret having said that, and if he expresses that regret here tonight, I will be only too willing to accept it.  It is something that should not have been said.  It represents a denial of the rights of Deputies to press matters in which they believe; it is something which the Minister in a democratic State should <Col N="1210" /> not give voice to, no matter what he might think is the provocation.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of replies he gave to further supplementaries, appeared to suggest that Dublin Health Authority were seeking something inefficient and unnecessary in seeking for sanction for the authority's proposal to extend the pathology laboratory department in St. Kevin's Hospital.  I had asked the Minister in my question:</P>
      <P>why he has not yet sanctioned proposals for extending the pathology laboratory department in Saint Kevin's Hospital, Dublin; if he is aware that because of lack of accommodation in the laboratory research equipment cannot be used and is stored elsewhere; if he will give the reasons for the delay; and how soon sanction will be granted.</P>
      <P>One would think from the Minister's reply that there was something novel, something casual, something reckless, in what the authority were proposing. Later on in the course of further replies to supplementary questions, the Minister spoke about doing &ldquo;something here, there and everywhere, higgledly-piggledly, throughout the hospitals in Dublin&rdquo;.  Later he spoke of &ldquo;muddled thinking&rdquo; about the whole hospital service in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, therefore, to put on record the history of the urgent appeals made by Dublin Health Authority to the Minister for the extension of the pathology department accommodation in St. Kevin's Hospital.  The Department were approached about the matter four years ago.  In a letter dated 18th June, 1964, the Department conveyed the Minister's approval to the provision of a new central pathological laboratory in St. Kevin's, and a couple of months later, on 9th September, a further letter from the Department of Health advised the health authority that the Minister would give a grant equal to two-thirds of the approved cost of the project, including equipment. In the same letter of 9th September, 1964, the authority were requested to give the planning of a new laboratory a high degree of priority as soon as a senior pathologist was appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> The senior pathologist was appointed with effect from 1st August, 1965, and immediately the necessary discussions took place and the planning was put into effect with the help of the architect, in consultation with the senior pathologist, the medical superintendent and the engineering and administrative staff.  Drawings were prepared and submitted to the Department of Health on 8th December, 1966.  Nobody can reasonably say that there was any undue haste on the part of the health authority.  Rather was every care taken in the preparation of the plans.  Every proper assessment was made of the needs of Dublin Health Authority and of the Dublin region in the preparation of the plans sent to the Department of Health on 8th December, 1966.</P>
    <P>That was two years after the health authority had been told by the Minister for Health that &ldquo;a high degree of priority&rdquo; should be given to the provision of the necessary laboratory accommodation in St. Kevin's.  More than two years passed by after the note of urgency was spoken by the Minister for Health.  Ever since, the health authority, having completed their plans and made the necessary arrangements in discharge of what the Minister considered to be necessary, have received no co-operation from the Department.  Indeed we were told by the Minister, when I raised the matter in the Dáil last week, that the Minister will not give a decision for some months until he gets a report from the consultative council on the general hospital services in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The health authority's visiting committee, in the course of a visit to St. Kevin's Hospital on 21st August last, were very concerned to note the position there and I shall quote from the report of the visiting committee:</P>
    <P>The Medical Superintendent outlined difficulties under which this Laboratory Department was operating due to lack of adequate accommodation; he referred to the extent to which the Laboratory Department had already encroached on hospital space on the first and second floors of Hospital 7, and to the fact that further accommodation was now <Col N="1212" /> being sought by the Biochemistry Section in connection with research work concerning inborn errors of metabolism in mentally handicapped children and the siting of additional equipment which had been presented to the Authority by the Medical Research Council.  It was stated that outline plans for additional accommodation had been with the Department of Health since December last and that, despite repeated requests, sanction to the proposal had not yet been received.  Accompanied by Dr. P. Moore, Biochemist, and Mr. John Duffy, Chief Technician, an inspection of the Haematology and Histology Departments was made in Hospital 7 and of the Biochemistry and Bacteriological Departments in the annexe at Rialto.</P>
    <P>During our inspection in Hospital 7 we noted the extent to which ward and ancillary accommodation had been taken over for haematology and histology and the problems which were being caused in endeavouring to accommodate additional equipment and staff in this area of the hospital.  There was further evidence of overcrowding and unsatisfactory accommodation for staff and equipment in the annexe at Rialto.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may not quote I can only paraphrase the report of the committee which carried out the inspections.  I now point out that there is a staff of 20 professional and technical people in the laboratory building and, as can well be imagined, there is a large amount of expensive equipment, including incubators, centrifuges, water-baths, flame-photometers, a number of precision instruments, and the like.  All of this staff <Col N="1213" /> and all this extensive and expensive machinery is housed in a little over 2,000 square feet.</P>
      <P>In other words, these skilled people have only 100 square feet per man, not only in which to operate but also to house their equipment.  It is really short of a miracle that in these slum conditions a quarter of a million examinations are conducted annually. That is the sorry situation as the health authority has to put up with it.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there are two other pieces of urgently needed equipment which are not in use because there is no accommodation for them, including the equipment which came to Dublin Health Authority by reason of the support of the Medical Research Council and the Hospitals Commission with the approval of the Minister and other equipment for the biochemistry department which is on order and cannot be accepted until there is accommodation for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said some arrangements were being made to house this equipment but Dáil Éireann should be made aware that the equipment will have to be temporarily housed in a building which was scheduled for demolition because of its decayed condition. Here, because of the Minister's delay, we will have to house very technical expensive equipment in a building which is only fit for demolition. In the experience of our engineering staff this can only be done as a temporary expedient.</P>
      <P>The health authority at a general meeting discussed the committee's report on the 7th September and following that, the Minister received a further appeal from the health authority for sanction for these plans.  Again on 19th October the health authority expressed strong criticism of the continuing delay which in turn was conveyed to the Minister.  At its latest meeting in January this year the Visiting Committee was appalled to find out that notwithstanding its repeated requests, and particularly with regard to the urgency of the representations made last year, no progress had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I have spoken of the terrible conditions in which we are forcing the laboratory staff to work.  I think we must also concern ourselves with the interference with other services in the hospital as a result of the necessity to use accommodation for the hospital laboratory which ought to be available for other purposes.  At the moment there is an extremely urgent need to provide additional accommodation for patients and staff.  St. Kevin's Hospital has a waiting list of up to 120 patients who cannot be taken in and many are awaiting accommodation because some of the laboratory equipment and staff are lodged in part of the hospital that ought to be available for patients.</P>
    <P>In particular, we urgently require accommodation for children in the adolescent and pre-adolescent age groups.  There is also an urgent need to provide accommodation in St. Kevin's particularly as it is a teaching hospital, for surgical cases.  At the end of this long queue there are the unfortunate members of the staff who have to tolerate miserable conditions which are less than fit for them and would not be tolerated anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Dublin Health Authority is also up against the problem of recruiting senior consultant staff.  It is reasonable that senior consultants should have adequate accommodation and we are aware that there are people who would otherwise be available but are not willing to come to the health authority because of the slum conditions imposed on them in St. Kevin's.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that the conditions in St. Kevin's were far superior to the laboratories in most of the voluntary hospitals.  We do not know whether this is true or not, but I am prepared to accept it if the Minister says so.  But, if that is so, it highlights the deplorable conditions in which laboratory work is being done in this city.  We must remember that the local authority hospital is different from the voluntary hospital.  Voluntary hospitals, particularly teaching hospitals, will have facilities available to them in the medical schools.  Such facilities are not available in the local authority hospitals which must be self-sufficient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> Because of the compelling need for laboratory accommodation in St. Kevin's, we say, and I speak with the unanimous support of all the members of Dublin Health Authority, that the necessity for the sanction of the Minister for Health for a new laboratory in St. Kevin's is a matter of such great urgency that it cannot await the report of the Consultative Council on the general hospital services in Dublin.  We cannot imagine any recommendation from that Council which will have any bearing on the laboratory accommodation in this mighty hospital of St. Kevin's.</P>
    <P>We ought to return to the situation as referred to by the Minister's Department in 1964, that this extension to the laboratory in St. Kevin's is a matter of urgent consideration and ought to receive priority.  I think that on reflection the Minister might appreciate the urgency and give this sanction.  All the other laboratory accommodation which Dublin Health Authority have is needed.  None of it is superfluous and what is required in St. Kevin's is small compared with the benefit which would flow to the hospital and the community in general.</P>
    <P>If the Minister now sees the need for giving permission, I trust he will agree with me that if I considered it to be an urgent matter it was part of my duty to press it.  I was consciously obliged to do it, and he might now see his way to withdraw his unfortunate remark that in no circumstances would he give his approval if he was pressed by me in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate issues involved here.  One is the role St. Kevin's will play in the future, and the other is the particular matter of the use or otherwise of a particular piece of research equipment.  I do not have to remind the House, or Deputy Ryan, Chairman of Dublin Health Authority, of my goodwill towards St. Kevin's.  It was with reluctance that I postponed a decision in regard to this matter of the extension of the laboratory facilities in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make perfectly clear that <Col N="1216" /> when I spoke about development on a higgledy-piggledy basis in Dublin, I must not be taken as referring to Dublin Health Authority hospitals exclusively. On the contrary, it is not even principally the Dublin Health Authority hospitals to which I was referring but to the over-all development of the hospital services in the city. This is something which I regard as of very high priority and it is because I regard it as so important for the development of the hospital services in the country, not merely Dublin, but in the country generally, that I set up the consultative body which I asked to report to me in what I said at the time was a record period of from four to six months.  From what I hear the body are working very hard and hope to be able to report to me within the stipulated time.</P>
    <P>The nub of the issue here was made quite plain by Deputy Ryan towards the end of his speech.  The question is whether the matter is so urgent that the decision could not be postponed until the report is available or could bear the delay of say three months.  In my opinion, taking everything into account, it would be better to postpone it for that short period.  As I understand the situation, out of one and a quarter million tests&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A quarter million was what I said: it is big enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of a quarter million tests carried out, only 5,000 have to be farmed out elsewhere and a certain number of tests would, in any case, have to be farmed out to UCC or the College of Surgeons.  I do appreciate that in the meantime and partly because of the vast growth in the number of these tests and their variety, the staff at St. Kevin's are at the moment working under difficulty.  I thoroughly appreciate that but I think it is worthwhile to wait for two or three months to get the report from the consultative body.  I have my own ideas in regard to the role St. Kevin's should play in the future development of our hospital services but I hesitate to impose my view and make a decision on the matter when I have a distinguished body of <Col N="1217" /> consultants who will advise me in a very short time and who, I hope, will make clear to me what they regard as the future role of St. Kevin's in hospital development generally.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that if the consultative body's recommendation in regard to the role of St. Kevin's happens to coincide with my own view, I shall make a decision immediately, one way or another, because it is possible that the proposals of the health authority may have to be amended one way or another.  If the body take a certain view, the proposals, even as they stand, may not be adequate because the role of the hospital may be improved rather than disimproved.  It is in the light of that and with all those considerations in mind that I, while appreciating the fact that the staff are labouring under certain difficulty at the present time, think it best that the decision should await the general recommendations of the consultative body.</P>
      <P>It is implicit in what I said that I was not making any serious attempt to deny Deputy Ryan's right to raise matters which he said affect his conscience and are concerned with the discharge of his responsibilities as a Deputy.  I was trying to do no such thing: I was trying to prevent him from raising further irrelevant questions by saying to him: &ldquo;If you do not keep quiet, I will not sanction the thing at all.&rdquo;  I think the import of that should have been perfectly clear to the Deputy and I feel it was perfectly clear to the House.  One thing about politics is that you are never supposed to make a joke&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not regard it as funny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy must have been in a cranky humour at the time.  The Deputy knows very well that even in the short time since I was appointed, various developments in regard to St. Kevin's have been approved and the necessary authority issued for the payment of grants from Hospital Trust funds and so on.  If Deputy Ryan were to try to suggest that I was <Col N="1218" /> in any way antagonistic to St. Kevin's I think nobody would believe him.</P>
      <P>With regard to the research equipment which I believe is used by the paediatrician and a biochemist in connection with the study which Deputy Ryan mentioned, I think it right to point out that this refers to the mentally handicapped and therefore does not concern any of the patients in St. Kevin's itself.  That is not to say that the use of the equipment is not desirable: of course it is, and I quite readily appreciate that it would be far better if you had a more suitable place in which this equipment could be used than a temporary shed which will have to be demolished in time.  It is relevant to point out that this is work which is being done for the good of mentally handicapped and towards research into the causes of the malady but does not concern in any way the patients who are the responsibility of Dublin Health Authority in St. Kevin's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but is he aware that there is a clinic for mentally handicapped children at St. Kevin's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It affects all mentally handicapped children.  It was implied in what the Deputy said that this research equipment was intended for the use and benefit of the patients of St. Kevin's&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only very marginally, some, so that so far as the patients are concerned, I do not think any real loss is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing I want to say is that I do not for a moment suggest that the proposals of the health authority in regard to extensions either here or elsewhere are casual or reckless.  What I would say and repeat is that, primarily from a medical point of view and secondarily, from an economic point of view, it is most undesirable that we should press ahead with casual improvement of hospitals here and there, without having regard to over-all development plans and in the belief that it is better to await the <Col N="1219" /> report on what those over-all development plans should be, including all hospitals as well as St. Kevin's, I made the decision to postpone final consideration of the health authority's proposals for another two or three months. I realise that while the staff may be slightly discommoded in the process in the meantime the situation would be clearer to all of us, and I think we <Col N="1220" /> shall be able to go forward then and proceed with goodwill to the implementation of those parts of the proposals which are designed to give us an over-all better hospital service in the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15th February, 1968.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state in tabular form in respect of each health authority for each year from 1964-65 to the estimate for 1968-69, (a) (i) net expenditure excluding non-grant items, and (ii) net expenditure including non-grant items, (b) the statutory grant, (c) the supplementary grant, (d) the total State grant, <Col N="1083" /> and (e) the State grant as a percentage of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no significant &ldquo;non-grant items&rdquo; in the expenditure by health authorities on health services. The expenditure which does not rank for grant under the provisions of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, comprises items of a capital nature and loan charges, and usually comes within the scope of (a) grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund, or (b) grants from the Health Vote in recoupment of loan charges on borrowings under the scheme for the improvement of county homes and similar institutions. <Col N="1084" /> The accounts of health authorities furnished to the Department of Health do not contain separate records of the relatively very small expenditure which does not come within the terms of one or other of the grant schemes and it is not considered that the time and cost which would be involved in preparing and verifying special accounts would be warranted.  The information set out in the table below is accordingly related to normal annual revenue expenditure towards which grants under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, and supplementary grant are payable from the Health Vote.</P>
