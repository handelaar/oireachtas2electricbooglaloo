      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my statement on Monday, the 11th instant &mdash;copies of which are now available in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not serious.  We all read the speech he made in which he gently rebuked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, but does he not recall that on the very night that he was administering the rebuke to him, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries delivered a speech which appeared to be contrary to the Taoiseach's policy on and approach to the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate&mdash;because it is not clear to Deputies or to the country&mdash; whether he proposes to continue the system of cross-border talks and discussions in the light of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries' criticism of the effect of these discussions up to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take the two supplementaries together?  In regard to the speech of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to which Deputy Corish referred, I regret that the Minister made it.  It was not made with my prior approval but, nevertheless, it was &mdash;taking up Deputy O'Higgins's supplementary&mdash;an assessment of the value of the contacts that have taken place in the past four years; and I think they are capable of subjective assessment and there can be differences of opinion, even within a Cabinet, as to how valuable they were.  I regard them as very valuable, as opening up new avenues of contact between people north and south, bringing people closer together so that we can eliminate past <Col N="163" /> dissensions and ultimately appraise the situation of Partition when these barriers are removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say who in the Government now is spokesman on the matters of Partition and civil rights in the North?  Are we to assume that the approach of the Taoiseach is to continue talks with the Six County Government and its various Ministers, or are we to have a different approach as per the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in which the matter of Partition will be raised at the United Nations or that there will be a special conference on Partition sought with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my speech on last Monday left nobody in any doubt as to what the Government attitude was on north-south relations and towards Partition generally.  That will continue to be the Government's attitude. I have spoken on behalf of the Government and that is what the Government think.  In regard to Deputy O'Higgins's supplementary, I indicated in my speech that I hoped that as a result of my contact with Mr. Wilson and Mr. Wilson's conversations with Captain O'Neill, the civil rights prospects would now become brighter and that the discrimination would be abolished; and that once we saw that was forthcoming we could re-establish north-south contacts.  As soon as I see anything worthwhile and reasonably capable of coming from them, I shall be very glad to continue them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to France's proposal, which was accepted by the other members of the EEC, for wider trade agreements with other countries for industrial and agricultural products with tariff reductions of 30 per cent over four years; and what immediate action the Government propose to take to benefit from this agreed proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposals in question.  My understanding is that they have not so far been accepted by the Council.  The Council at its meeting last week referred the proposals to the Committee of Permanent <Col N="165" /> Representatives for consideration and for report back.  The question of action by the Government to benefit from the proposals does not therefore arise at this stage, but developments in relation to them are being followed with the closest attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that the proposals to which he refers as agreed proposals are far from it.  They were referred to the Committee of Permanent Representatives. I am not in the position to assess how long the Committee will be studying them or when they will report back. That is a matter I cannot anticipate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach made that statement in the House during the week, may I ask whether it would be more practicable as a gesture of good-will towards restoring unity, that he would give instructions to have advertising resumed in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i>?  Might I further inquire whether pious expressions in the House are of value?  Would he not consider doing something practical towards restoring some form of sanity as between the Government and the people concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the President of the NFA, he will get the <Col N="167" /> letter and he will probably publish the letter.  What I said last week was not a pious expression.  It was a serious expression of intent which I will follow up, and I will do so when I feel the time is appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is to wipe the slate clean, to forget the past and to start anew, the best way he can begin is by restoring to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> the advertising which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries took away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the offer made by the Taoiseach, made sincerely in the House, was to wipe the slate clean.  Whether he left it to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I do not know, but surely part and parcel of the operation is to allow these advertisements to be put in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i>?  I ask the Taoiseach to be definite and specific about it rather than to leave it on the basis that this is a decision for the Minister.  Surely it is not too much that we should ask the Taoiseach at least to control his own Ministers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason for the delay in the Local Appointments Commission making permanent recommendations <Col N="168" /> of appointment of agricultural instructors to county committees of agriculture; if there is a shortage of applicants; and, if not, why permanent appointments are not expedited, as many committees are understaffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no avoidable delay in the making of recommendations for these appointments.  As a result, however, of the abolition of application fees, earlier this year, the number of candidates for the various classes of posts filled through the Local Appointments and Civil Service Commission has increased.  This has caused a backlog of work which is gradually being cleared off but which has meant some unavoidable delay in the arranging of interviews in recent months.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, there is no shortage of suitable candidates for posts as agricultural instructor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are some county committes of agriculture who have applied to have permanent posts filled during periods of between 12 and 18 months? Does he not consider that, in order that committees of agriculture effectively might carry out a first class service for the community, there should not be long periods of delay in filling permanent posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware there is not any post left unfilled for the period mentioned by the Deputy&mdash;12 to 18 months.  The normal period is four or five months but on occasions some difficulties arise.  Posts having been advertised, interviews having been held and the posts offered, the successful candidates do not take them up.  Efforts are made to fill vacancies from the existing panel but that is not always possible and it is in cases like that that delays of 12 months might occur but never delays of 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (Acting Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The short-term forecasting techniques used by the Department of Finance in assessing trends within the <Col N="170" /> economy are those adopted internationally for purposes of demand management.  As in most countries, forecasts are made within the framework of the national accounts, which provide a comprehensive measure of the level of economic activity as well as detailed information about the various components of demand which determine that level.  In forecasting, reliance is placed upon expert appraisal of the most up-to-date indicators available as well as past behaviour of the main economic variables and their inter-relationships.</P>
    <P>Forecasts are periodically up-dated. Forecasting is essentially continuous in nature and the predictions require modification and adjustment as the economic scene changes and the assumptions on which they are based become no longer valid.  Regular and careful watch is maintained on the various economic indicators issued weekly, monthly or quarterly by the Central Statistics Office, Central Bank and other organisations and on the main trends in countries with which we have important economic contacts. With the aid of these economic indicators and trends the forecasts are reassessed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning the forecasts for 1968 and 1969, a full national accounts projection was not published for 1968 for the reasons given in paragraph 53 of the Department's &ldquo;Review of 1966 and Outlook for 1967&rdquo; (Pr. 9372).  A general survey of prospects for the year 1968 was, however, given in the &ldquo;Review of 1967 and Outlook for 1968&rdquo; (Pr. 9992) in which a growth rate of about 4½ per cent and a balance of payments deficit of the order of £15 million were predicted.  It appears now that the final out-turn for the year will not differ markedly from these estimates.</P>
    <P>In regard to 1969, the Deputy will appreciate that prior to the April Budget there was little information available on which to prepare a forecast of likely trends for that year. While the prospect for 1969 is now somewhat clearer it would be premature at this stage to publish detailed projections.  The results of preliminary <Col N="171" /> work in the Department of Finance suggest that the growth rate in 1969 should not fall below 4 per cent or the balance of payments deficit rise significantly above £30 million.  This takes into account the effect of the recent budgetary measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Interchem Ltd is an Irish company engaged in the distribution of agro-chemicals some of which are considered by the Irish Sugar Company to be of importance to the beet industry.  The company was about to cease trading and the Irish Sugar Company was anxious to ensure that the products in which it was interested <Col N="173" /> would continue to be available to beet growers.  Accordingly, the Irish Sugar Company acquired the share capital of Interchem Ltd., which will continue to trade as a separate company offering the same range of services as it has offered in the past.  The existing staff of Interchem Ltd have not been disturbed in their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not know that the product, which he states was a worry in relation to its being available to the Irish farmer for the production of beet, would be available anyway in Britain for which Interchem is an agent?  The answer the Taoiseach gave is quite incorrect.  This is a case where a semi-State company has entered into competition with other companies in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem facing the Sugar Company was that while these special chemicals might have been available from the parent company there was no assurance for their continued delivery or delivery at a proper price.  The Sugar Company has ensured that through this company they will be assured of deliveries and at the right price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is quite incorrect in what he says.  The parent company has trade all over the world and provides those chemicals all over the world and at ordinary prices, available ex-factory in England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no instruction in existence that the staff of the Valuation Office should not discuss valuation cases with Deputies.  As regards the rest of the Deputy's question, I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that a caller, who did not give his name, telephoned the Valuation Office on the afternoon of the 6th November and asked for a certain district valuer; on being told by the switchboard operator that the district valuer was working away from headquarters, the caller asked for his address; the switchboard operator told him it was not the practice of the office to disclose the addresses of officials, and if he would write in to say what was required his request would be transmitted at once to the appropriate official.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the caller happens to be Deputy Coughlan and that he made his identity known to the switchboard operator?  Will he, with regard to the reply to the first part of the question, now inform the Valuation Office that representations can be made to this <Col N="175" /> alleged branch of a Government Department?  Will the Taoiseach remember and remind them that what he has been informed is absolutely untrue? I did make my identity known and I was told that under no circumstances could a Deputy make an appointment or discuss any valuation question with any officer of the Department of Lands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <P>The Government's decision that the headquarters work of the Department of Education be transferred to Athlone and that of the Department of Lands to Castlebar involves the building of modern offices at these centres.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider requesting CIE to examine the existing rail passenger services in Dublin to ascertain if these services could be used to a greater extent by commuters in order to help reduce the traffic density on the city roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a previous question regarding Dublin suburban railways on 24th October, 1968, CIE are fully conscious of the need to ensure that the suburban rail services are utilised as effectively as possible with a view to making the maximum contribution to the relief of road congestion in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Board that two market research surveys were carried out earlier this year to ascertain the requirements of existing and potential rail commuter travellers in Dublin. These surveys disclosed that in general the existing pattern of rail services is satisfactory except that there appeared to be a demand for more through services on the northern line to Tara Street and Pearse Stations.  At present, this is precluded by track and signalling limitations but a scheme to overcome these limitations will commence early in 1969.  It is planned to introduce a revised time table in June, 1969, with more northern trains running through to Tara Street and Pearse Stations.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply on 24th October, 1968, additional services during the morning and evening rush hours have recently been introduced between Connolly Station and Dalkey and it is proposed to open a new station at Kilbarrack next year.  In addition, almost all suburban stations have been renovated or are in course of renovation.</P>
      <P>CIE have informed me that suitability of the services is kept under continuous review and further action will be taken as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what definite plans he has in mind to increase the incomes of all farmers having special regard to the circumstances of small farmers whose incomes have lessened while other sections of the community have had their incomes increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend of farm income in the last two years has been very satisfactory.  In 1967 total farm income increased by 10 per cent. While it is too early to say precisely what the final out-turn will be for 1968, the indications are that there will be a further substantial rise in farm income which will keep it in line with income increases in other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The policies and programmes operated by my Department have been a major factor in achieving this pronounced improvement which is now everywhere apparent.  The wide range of measures operated by the Department include measures to support prices, improve land and buildings and the quality of livestock and crops as well as measures to reduce farmers' costs, to develop agricultural education, advisory services, training and research. Special attention is being given to the position of smaller farmers. The pilot area scheme operating in all western counties, as well as benefiting the farmers in the areas concerned, is making a valuable contribution to the solution of small farm problems.  The new farrowed sow subsidy in the West, the increased piggery grants, the mountain lamb subsidy scheme and the higher rates of grant under the Land Project in western areas are all helping the small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farm (incentive bonus) <Col N="184" /> scheme is a recent additional measure designed to bring income on potentially viable farms to an acceptable level.  Unemployment assistance to smallholders is now paid throughout the year and in the West is paid irrespective of the actual level of income from farming, thus constituting in effect a guaranteed minimum income. All these measures are kept under regular review and are adapted from time to time to meet changing circumstances.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently decided to increase the price of creamery milk as from the 1st September, 1968 by 1d per gallon on the first 7,000 gallons per annum delivered to a creamery by each creamery milk supplier and they also announced the introduction of a new beef cattle incentive scheme applying to herds not in commercial milk production.  In deciding on these measures, the Government had the position of smaller farmers especially in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister reconcile the principle of the Government's proposed scheme for a calf subsidy on herds not sending milk to creameries with the universal advice being tendered by agricultural advisers in the congested areas to small farmers <Col N="185" /> to switch over to creamery milk production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some apparent conflict there but the fact is that there is certainly none in my mind or the mind of the Government in regard to this situation.  It is to try to preserve the situation wherein the amount of milk produced will not be a continuing increasing embarrassment as a result of the larger producers going into it in a larger way that I am trying by these inducements to get the man who is not yet in milk and who is a big man to stay in beef or, if he is partially in milk and partially in beef, it is intended to induce him to come out of milk and go more into beef for which he is properly geared to make a worthwhile living.  At the same time, it is not intended to knock the small farmer out of milk or take him out of milk because, as I have stated on many occasions, milk in the case of the small man can constitute the entire livelihood which it is possible to derive from a smallholding, whereas what he would get out of beef altogether on the same smallholding would not keep him in cigarettes, let alone keep his family.  I am thankful to the Deputy for bringing out this point.  It is not intended to discourage all people from continuing in milk or, indeed, to discourage the small man from going into milk but it is rather intended to encourage the big man who can do well in beef to stay in beef or to switch over to beef.  That is the lesson and the lead and the aim of the policy that we are following as regards the extra penny on the first 7,000 gallons and the beef incentive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was endeavouring to show that the Government have no forward-looking policy.  Their policy appears to consist in imposing taxation and hoping for the best.  It is obvious now that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, about which there was so much talk in the rank and file of Fianna Fáil, is not likely to yield very much more in the agricultural sphere.  It has allowed for an industrial expansion, but a limited industrial expansion.  I suggested last night that the Government should take another look at the beef export potential.  The prosperity at the moment is due entirely to the fact that so much stock was lost in the United Kingdom through foot and mouth disease, with a resultant heavy restocking; that will continue possibly until the end of this year.  I was challenged last night by Fianna Fáil Deputies who said that stocks are higher today than they ever were before.  It may be that young stock is higher, but replacements simply do not exist as they might have existed had the Government exercised some foresight in their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach a question today and I suggested that the Government might avail themselves of the opportunity that now appears to be presented to them in the latest agreement, and it is an agreement, the first sign of a communal agreement between the Six, to explore a wider trading area than we have had over the last two or three years.  There is an opportunity now for an expansion of trade.  There is an opportunity of making a trade <Col N="195" /> agreement not alone with one of the Six but with every single member of the EEC.  It seems strange, therefore, that we apparently have to wait before we take any action.  It is for that I criticise this Government.  They never move in time.  They can never do the obvious thing.  Every other country has ambassadors and parliamentary representatives out looking for trade agreements. We never do anything like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but I thought I answered the Deputy today in reply to a parliamentary question on this matter. Apparently the Deputy does not believe me.  The Council at its meeting referred to the proposals to the Committee of Permanent Representatives for consideration.  The Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Luns, said after that meeting that they were in no way committed to the French trading arrangement and nothing of substance had been decided at the meeting.  That was stated in reply to the journalist's question. I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but he is now trying to put the Government on the wrong foot in defiance of an answer he got today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Our ambassadors should be instructed straightaway to approach the EEC.  They should be in on the ground floor and they should be making inquiries as to the potential for trade agreements.  This is the same as entry to the Common Market; one asks questions and one gets the same reply&mdash;negotiations will take place.  The only chance a small country like this has is to get in on the ground floor before anybody else.  It is easier for a small country to make a trade agreement because the other participant does not have to give as big a quota as that which would be required in the case of larger countries. That is why I indict the Government for its slowness and its lack of policy. All that is done is to impose more taxation.  The Taoiseach says that, because of the buoyancy of revenue, taxation is less than it should be.  That would have happened had there not been the buoyancy?  We would have had a maxi-Budget.  Indeed, it was very nearly that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must look to the future.  It is no use merely progressing from Budget to Budget, from one six months to the next.  The policy of the Government is one of living from hand to mouth. They will not be there indefinitely but, so long as they are there.  I hope they will keep improving the situation so that it will not be too bad when we take over.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that there must be an overall increase in trading.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is not the be-all and end-all of trade.  It has produced results in industrial exports.  The results in agricultural exports are largely fortuitous because of external circumstances&mdash;disastrous circumstances from the point of view of the British because they had to buy so much from us in order to replace their stock.  We have now practically reached saturation point in the British market.  Every time one reads the papers one notes that there are plans and schemes on foot to increase agricultural production in Britain.  The traditional policy of Britain was to buy food from <Col N="197" /> abroad and to export to the countries from which they bought food, industrial goods and products.  We were in on the ground floor.  We were an agricultural country living in close proximity to the United Kingdom and our trade with that country kept our economy alive over the years.  I want to stress that this is changing now. Our ambassadors abroad should be instructed to take action.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows as well as I do&mdash;he has travelled as much as I have&mdash;that a great deal of trade is arranged at social functions such as dinner and luncheon parties.  These matters can be discussed in amicable surroundings and very often trade follows on those discussions.  We have useful ambassadors in different parts of the world, and they should be instructed to look for all the trade possible, and pass back any information they have to the Government.  The thinking here today is on one track in Government circles.  We have had 50 years of self-government and although we have had our trials and tribulations we have had comparative peace. All the emerging nations which have come into existence as one unit are out looking for trade every day of the week literally.  Perhaps the Government are a little bit sensitive on the question of the British market.  The Taoiseach is responsible for the destiny of this country.  There was a time when it was suggested that we should not trade with Britain.  Now there is a complete swing around and the Government have a one-track mind.  So long as they have a one-track mind, and so long as we confine ourselves to the existing trade potential, the Government will continue to impose extra taxation.</P>
    <P>There is another angle with which I should like to deal briefly before I conclude.  I am sure many other Deputies are waiting to make their contributions. There has been very little mention of economy.  The idea in thinking circles seems to be that we should raise all the money we can, that anyone who is earning or producing should have the life taxed out of him to supply funds for Government purposes, and that there should <Col N="198" /> be an increase in the bureaucratic control of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We established the Department of Labour about two years ago.  It is costing the Exchequer £1,100,000.  I do not know what is the function of that Department.  When it came into existence it was said that it would have a special function with regard to establishing better relations between workers and employers and correlating production and wage increases.  I fail to see that the Department of Labour has achieved anything.</P>

      <P>It is rather interesting to note that some speakers from the Opposition benches seem to have a cure for all ills, believe it or not.  Many Deputies who spoke will remember the years 1949 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. The Ceann Comhairle is a man of great character and I do not like always to be reminding him of these things, but I am forced into the position of asking the Opposition why during their period of office they did not do all the wonderful things they are now criticising us for not having done.  In 1957 this country was at the lowest economic and political ebb possible.  As a matter of fact, we were nearly the same as Newfoundland, a country which asked another country to take over their administration or assist them out of their difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine that out of the conglomeration of intelligentsia made up of Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and Independents, someone would have produced some economic policy to save the nation.  I remember in my own constituency at that time about 1,800 <Col N="200" /> families left their homes, and over 100,000 were unemployed in the country. In my constituency 1,800 families left their homes and went to America, England, Scotland and various other places.  I saw this happening.  There was one honest man amongst them.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Education a question about a school in Brittas.  I told him we had the land and that everything else was settled, and I asked him when he would build it.  The honourable gentleman said: &ldquo;You cannot take the trousers off a Highlander.&rdquo;&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are one honest person.&rdquo;  At that time the Minister for Local Government was telling us there was money for everything. The Opposition talk nowadays about the building of houses, about what we did in relation to building enough houses, and what we should have done.  I was a member of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation during the period of office of the Coalition Government, and I remember that the building machinery of the local authorities was disbanded because there was no money to go ahead. Houses were built but there were no grants or loans for them.  There was not the price of a bag of cement left when they left office.  That is what we found in the city and county of Dublin, certain parts of which I have the honour to represent from time to time.</P>
    <P>We are trying to keep our economy alive.  We are only doing what any other intelligent Government would do.  I often stood up here, a Cheann Comhairle, to defend tough Budgets but today I am proud to say that the Taoiseach, as Acting Minister for Finance, is keeping the economy of this nation as it should be kept.  I do not want to see our nation back to where we were in 1956-57.  I remember in 1948, when we were defeated, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Seán F. Lemass, said to the Taoiseach, the very honourable gentleman, Deputy John A. Costello, that we had given over the country in a sound financial position and asked him to give it back to us in the same way. The whole approach to our economy by these people at that time was hopeless. They could not run a hotel never mind a country.  They scuttled everyless <Col N="201" /> thing and did not stand up to their responsibilities.  We are standing up to our responsibilities and so long as we can keep reasonable employment in the country we are going to do that.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that this country has to depend on its own resources. When I was a member of a delegation to Jerusalem in 1964 the Prime Minister of Israel spoke to me of what the Jews all over the world had done for their own country.  He, the then Prime Minister, in the course of a personal conversation while entertaining me in his home said that he could not find any country in the world which should be as good as Ireland because there are so many Irish all over the world.  The Jews would not have been able to carry on except for the Jews all over the world helping them.  In this country we have to depend on the resources of our own people.  Large numbers of relatives of Deputies and their friends contributed by sending home money from time to time to their own people.</P>

Lloyd George is alleged to have stated behind the backs of the plenipotentiaries when they signed the Treaty: &ldquo;We have given them back the agricultural south and they will never be able to carry on.&rdquo; That was the feeling then It is a great pleasure to see that the agricultural south is able to balance its Budget.  The balance of payments was never better than last year.  That is a great tribute <Col N="202" /> to the Fianna Fáil Government and to what we have succeeded in doing to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>We are concerned with every section of our people.  We are anxious to see that so far as possible the economy of this country should progress to such a degree that we will be able to employ all our people.  We have tried to do that.  It has been an uphill task.  No Government have any money except what they get from the people.</P>
      <P>During my visit to Israel the Prime Minister explained what the Jews had succeeded in doing for Israel and I saw what they had done.  Even if I was surcharged for my visit it was worth it. We had to fall back on our own resources in this country.  When the First Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced in 1958 the economic life of this country was at a very low ebb.  It took about four years' hard work to build up the economy and for this country to get going ahead again. Notwithstanding that, my friends on all sides of the Opposition will ask us: &ldquo;What are you doing about unemployment? What are you doing about drainage?  What are you doing about schools?  What are you doing about secondary and university education?&rdquo; They were not able to build national schools.  During their term of office there was a Minister in the Government who is not in the House now, and who was not concerned with unemployment at all.  Unemployment was a matter for the people themselves.  We have done much for the farming community and have given £80 million towards helping the farmers.  We are trying to do everything we can for them.  Look at what we have done for education.</P>

      <P>Since the commencement of the Government's Programmes for Economic Expansion the volume of output of manufacturing industries in Ireland has grown at an annual average rate of 6½ per cent. The employment given by the industries increased from 142,000 in 1958 to 177,000 in 1967, which is not a bad effort.  In the same period industrial exports rose from a maximum of £33 million in 1958 to an estimated £147 million by 1967.  How was that done? That was not done by the crows or the birds.  It was done by the initiative of the Government who looked after the interests of the nation and tried to bring about the balance of payments.</P>
      <P>The capital investment in industrial enterprise in the State in the nine years from 1959 to 1967 is estimated at £98 million of which State grants represented one quarter.  These industries have an employment potential of 44,000 people.  They have already absorbed about 30,000 of our people in good employment.  Most of these enterprises are producing for export. In dealing with this problem alone it is possible to see the great advances we have made; great things have happened in our time.  Notwithstanding the adverse criticism of the Opposition speakers, we have succeeded in doing great things and we will continue to do great things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Corporation was closed down in 1957.  There was not a bob stirring during that period. Since 1959, however, the Industrial Credit Corporation have advanced capital totalling £28 million to industry, the bulk of that being loan capital. More than 4,000 people are employed <Col N="204" /> in the enterprises at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House, as there are other Deputies who wish to speak.  I do not trangress the laws of courtesy in this House and, therefore, I do not speak for too long at any time.  However, before concluding, I should like to refer to education.  There has been an increase from 59,300 children attending secondary schools in 1957 to the present figure of 118,800, a considerable increase.  The number of full-time teachers has increased in the same period from 2,850 to 5,080.  In the vocational schools the trend has been the same.  The number of pupils attending wholetime day courses has grown from 22,000 to 42,000 since 1957 while the number of teachers in these schools has increased from 1,500 to 2,800.  In the universities, student numbers have increased from 7,700 to 16,000.  These advances could not have been made without very substantial capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This interim Budget, or moiety of the Budget, or whatever we might call it&mdash;we certainly cannot call it a &ldquo;mini-Budget&rdquo;&mdash;seems to me to be the proof, if proof were needed, of the sensible attitude taken by the Irish people only a few weeks ago when they refused, in no uncertain terms, to give this Government the mandate they sought to continue in office for an indefinite period of perhaps 20 or 25 years.  Coming at this particular time of the year, this Budget proves beyond all doubt, if proof were needed, that the Fianna Fáil Government is incapable of leading this nation other than up the never-ending <i>cul-de-sac</i> to which we have become accustomed down the years.  We seem to be in an economic and social rut out of which this Government do not seem capable of leading us.  As evidence of that statement, one could go back over a long number of years but I do not propose to do that now.  For instance, we could cast our thoughts back to 1965 and the occasion of the last general election, the one in which I became a Member of this House.  I remember that, just before that election, we seemed to be going ahead very well as a country.  Indeed, according to the words of the then Fianna Fáil Government, we were entering upon a long <Col N="210" /> period of prosperity.  No sooner was the general election over than all the economic ills, in precisely the same forms as now, reared their heads.  The new Fianna Fáil Government took precisely the same steps as are now being taken to curb those economic ills.  This seems to be an ever-recurring facet of life here down through the years.</P>
      <P>From that period in 1965, practically to the present day, we have had stagnation. Those of us in public life had repeatedly to make the standard excuse to people who sought local authority services and, in fact, who sought services of any kind that financial measures were taken to correct the ills that were apparent in the economy with the result that no money was available for such schemes.  The tragedy is that the corrective measures taken down through the years have tended to aggravate our basic ill which appears to me to be a lack of employment and a high rate of unemployment.  Until the provision of more and more jobs becomes a priority over every other consideration, our social and economic ills will never be solved.  We have, I believe, a small proportion of our people in productive employment&mdash;that is, in proportion to the numbers in our community&mdash;on whom the aged and the young depend.  Until we increase that proportion, our economic ills will certainly never heal for any length of time and our social ills will not be cured at all.  We have a relatively small work force with a wide disparity in the ranges of remuneration paid to that work force.</P>
      <P>We have an unjust taxation system in so far as the emphasis is on indirect taxation and in so far as direct taxation weighs most heavily on the section of the community least able to bear it. Some of the items taxed may be considered luxury goods but the fact remains that they are goods which are essential to some members of our community. While 4d on the packet of cigarettes may be an insignificant increase to a highly paid worker, to a man on £8 or £10 a week it represents a very large slice of his income on this one commodity alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About three years ago we talked about a minimum living wage.  Surely <Col N="211" /> with this never-ending spiral of taxation, taxation which, as I say, weighs most heavily on the poorer section of the community, the time has definitely come to introduce a minimum living wage?  However, I believe that all these ills to which I have referred, and many others to which in the course of the next few minutes I shall also refer, cannot be eradicated until we increase the number of people in productive employment and the number of people who will be able to contribute to the revenue of the country.</P>
    <P>The wholesale tax has been represented as not weighing on essential goods such as food and clothing.  However, it will have the effect of slowing down our economy, of slowing down housebuilding and very many other activities.  The increase in postal charges will have a similar effect.  The result of all this will be further stagnation and a further retraction in the number of our people in employment.</P>
    <P>Hardships have been imposed and hardships continue to be imposed, but they are not solving anything.  The basic problems remain, and this Budget, in spite of what Deputy Burke says, far from solving them, will only aggravate them.  Deputy Burke stated we have spent more money on water supply and sewerage schemes and other such local authority services in the past two or three years than we have ever done before.  That is a wild statement. My recollection of the last few years is that we never had a longer list of schemes waiting for sanction, waiting for money and waiting for the go-ahead from the Department of Local Government.  The people's needs are not being met in regard to housing, water supplies and sewerage schemes. Arrears are being built up year after year and it would appear to me that the present policy of the Government will not solve them within the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>We have basic problems in regard to agriculture and in regard to land drainage.  People are facing a situation where more and more acres of their arable land are becoming incapable of being cultivated and are being lost to <Col N="212" /> the economy.  Large sums of money are required and I cannot see this Government being able to provide the necessary finance.  Therefore, I can see this problem being aggravated to the point where it will be a very major one indeed.  Large tracts of arable land are being lost to us, a tremendous source of wealth which is not being explored and does not look like being explored in the foreseeable future.  Similarly large sums of money are required to arrest coastal erosion which is a very serious problem, because such land could be lost to us forever.</P>
    <P>Then there is the big problem of agriculture itself.  I do not intend to go into it in detail on this motion.  Suffice it to say that we should be gearing this industry to the future; otherwise we shall find ourselves facing serious problems which could well have been avoided if the appropriate measures were taken in time.</P>
    <P>Going back to 1965 I remember we had the good news of a White Paper on health.  It was not all that this Party would wish for, but it promised to go a long way towards eliminating some of the basic ills in the health services at the moment.  We were told this scheme would be in operation in a very short time, in a matter of months. Years have passed.  We have had various negotiations and various reasons have been put forward as to why this health scheme is not being put into operation.  Of course, the simple reason is that there is no money available to implement it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also spoke about education, and, perhaps, tomorrow we shall have an opportunity of going into some of the difficulties that remain in the field of education.  On this motion I shall confine myself to the remark I made in regard to the provision of jobs.  Education is a worthy goal in itself, but we must bear in mind that, having educated our people, we must find jobs for them.  This Government have fallen down badly over the years in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have intermittent Budgets and intermittent efforts to collect money for various purposes one of which is to improve the social welfare services.  I suppose they have been improved in <Col N="213" /> some small way, but not alone as a result of direct Budget reaction but as a result of lack of price control, these improvements have been vitiated. Whatever the Government may say, if you ask any Irish housewife about price control she will tell you there is no such thing.</P>
    <P>Because of the spiral of price increases and because of the big disparity year after year in the incomes of the various sections, our social welfare classes are no better off, relatively, than they were a few years ago. The same applies to our lower paid workers.  They are the people to whom we must give particular attention in the future.  They have been sadly neglected and they have been paying more than their fair share of the burden of all taxation.  In spite of that, there does not seem to be any long-term solution to their problem.</P>
    <P>I come back to the basic problem with which we should be able to get to grips&mdash;that of providing more wealth by way of putting more people into productive, taxable employment.  Unfortunately, we are as far away from a solution as ever.  Another basic problem is our unjust taxation system. Our taxation system has been unvaried over the years.  Under it, people with £6 5s or £6 10s a week must pay income tax.  All of us on these benches have agitated for the upgrading or the increasing of the personal allowance but we have been told of the big figure it would involve by way of loss of revenue.  This is another basic injustice which the Government do not appear capable of ever solving.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House longer on this subject.  We have many ills in our economy, industrial and social ills.  Occasionally we appear to recover from them temporarily, but always only temporarily.  The rut is still there and it calls for a lot of new thinking, for a fresh approach.  First of all, we have got to make employment a first priority.  The Government have to see that our economy develops to the point where there will be more and more jobs and they must take positive steps to intervene to ensure there will be more jobs.  Whatever the effects of <Col N="214" /> such a policy will be, if we are to get out of this rut we have got to take action.  It requires a fresh approach and it is clear now that this is not the Government to consider such an approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The year 1968 will go down in the political history of this country as the year in which the Fianna Fáil Government played party politics with the finances and the economy of this country, the year in which the Fianna Fáil Government wasted the time of this House and of the country in trying to alter the electoral system so as to consolidate themselves in power indefinitely. But it is the year in which the Irish people made their power and voices felt by refusing to be fooled and stampeded into handing over absolute power to Fianna Fáil, and how right the people were.</P>
      <P>The Budget which we are discussing is proof positive of the dishonesty of the present Government.  I want to put it to the House that in introducing this Budget the Taoiseach did so with a guilty conscience.  He realised that what I have just said is correct, and in introducing this Budget he immediately went on the defensive by trying to establish and to put across the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Taoiseach stated, as reported in column 2051 of the Official Dáil Debates for 5th November, 1968:</P>
      <P>The Financial Motions on the Order Paper for today are clear expressions of the Government's sense of responsibility for the good management of the economy.</P>
      <P>I think the Financial Motions on the Order Paper of this House for 5th November, 1968, portray the present Government as political adventurers who are more interested in keeping themselves in power than in the good management of the economy of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not without significance that we had a Budget introduced earlier this year by the Minister for Finance which should have been a Budget dealing with the finances of the country <Col N="215" /> for 12 months, a Budget which would raise by taxation or otherwise the finances to run the country for 12 months.  But, in fact, it was no such thing.  It was a Budget introduced in advance of a referendum, in advance of a national political contest to try to present the Government in as favourable a light as possible, so that they would be able to put over their electoral reform proposals to the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disgrace that an Irish Government in a referendum year, in a year of a national electoral contest, should introduce a Budget in the spring and then come along in the autumn of this year, immediately after the referendum had been disposed of by the people, with this second Budget, which was hailed in advance by some newspapers as a &ldquo;mini-Budget&rdquo;, but on the morning of 5th November was branded by Radio Éireann as the &ldquo;late autumn Budget&rdquo;.  The fact is that the Government hoped by the comparatively favourable Budget which they introduced in the spring of this year to get their electoral proposals across, and, if they had done that, I shudder to think what sort of Budget they would now have presented in the House.  I think the people are entitled to ask that.  It has been said that in the referendum the people won.  They certainly did. These kind of tactics are not new. They have been tried out before.</P>
    <P>The present Government are discredited. They have received a defeat at the hands of the people such as no political Party received in this country in the last 50 years.  They are a Government that seem to be divided.  The Cabinet, as far as we can see, are completely divided.  We had the Taoiseach making a speech one day, a senior Minister making a totally different speech the next day and again that speech being contradicted by the Taoiseach on the following day and a speech from a senior Minister on the next day.  But, in so far as this Government claim the confidence of the people in any shape or form, they do so on the basis that the Taoiseach is an honest man.  I am afraid the Taoiseach's record in the matter of budgeting, especially in election years, does <Col N="216" /> not entitle him to the description of an honest Minister for Finance or the honest Head of a Government.</P>
    <P>In 1965 the present Taoiseach introduced his first Budget.  At any rate, he introduced a Budget which I think was his first.  In the following year, 1966, which was the Presidential Election year, the present Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, introduced a Budget on the 9th March.  In the very early part of his statement he posed the question &ldquo;What went wrong with my Budget introduced in May last?&rdquo;  One would have thought that a Minister for Finance, who was forced on the 9th March, 1966, when introducing a Budget to pose the question &ldquo;What went wrong with my Budget introduced in May last?&rdquo;  would have gone to great pains and taken great care to ensure that the Budget which he was then introducing was an honest and adequate Budget and one that would meet the requirements of the country for the ensuing 12 months.</P>
    <P>That profound statement was made by the present Taoiseach on 9th March, 1966, and he introduced his Budget and put it through the House. As we know, there was a Presidential Election held here on 1st June, 1966. As things turned out, we know that was an election in which the Fianna Fáil Party and their candidate required any vote they could get and only won by a whistle.  That contest was held on 1st June, 1966, and, on 14th June, 1966, two weeks after, we had the present Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance, back into this House with another Budget&mdash;three months approximately after his Budget on 9th March, 1966.</P>
    <P>That was an extraordinary performance. It was a performance which required a lot of explanation, but the Taoiseach got away with it, and the Fianna Fáil Party got away with it. That was in 1966 and, as I have told the House, in 1968, in the year of the greatest electoral contest of all time, the contest in which the Fianna Fáil party gambled its future, we have a repeat performance.  We have a spring Budget before the referendum.  There was a generous increase of 7s 6d for the social welfare classes, and very <Col N="217" /> little taxes at a time when the Fianna Fáil Party anticipated that the referendum would be held within months.  At that time it was fairly clear that we would have a referendum in June.  The referendum was held but the people did not fall for the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and back we have the Taoiseach.  Perhaps it is ironical that fate should decree that the Taoiseach's nose would be rubbed in the mud, that the man who introduced two Budgets in 1966, in the Presidential year, should be directed by fate back into this House to introduce the second Budget of 1968.</P>
    <P>I do not think that by any stretch of the imagination the Budget with which we are now dealing could be described as a mini-Budget.  It is a maxi-Budget.  Not only is it not a mini-Budget but it is not a mini-Budget as compared with the spring Budget of this year, that was introduced on the 23rd April.  Let us have a look at the taxes imposed by the April Budget of this year and the taxes imposed by the Budget which we are now discussing.  The April Budget of 1968 imposed a tax of 2d on 20 cigarettes; the present Budget imposes a tax of 4d, double the amount.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is 3d tax and, as a result, there will be 4d more on 20 cigarettes.  If Deputy Cunningham wants to break that down or dissociate the Taoiseach from onethird of it, I will not argue.  Beer was increased by one penny per pint in the April Budget.  It has been increased by 2d a pint in this Budget.  It is true that wine was increased at the rate of 1/a bottle in the April Budget and it is equally true that wine has escaped <Col N="218" /> the Taoiseach's axe in this Budget&mdash; for what that will mean to the ordinary man in the street.  In the April Budget imported spirits other than spirits imported from Great Britain were taxed at the rate of 6d a glass but, as we know, spirits other than spirits imported from Great Britain again only concern the more wealthy classes.  In this Budget all spirits, including Irish spirits, are taxed at the rate of 2d a glass.</P>
      <P>When we deal with the taxation of spirits to the tune of 2d a glass in this Budget it is necessary to recall something the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, had to say on the 23rd April when he was introducing his prereferendum Budget.  I quote the Minister for Finance at column 66 of the Dáil Debates of 23rd April, 1968.  He said:</P>
      <P>Revenue receipts from Irish-made spirits in the year just ended were lower than in the previous year and I have decided that the home products could not be asked to bear additional taxation this year.</P>
      <P>The taxation of spirits had ceased to be profitable and he had decided that in the present year spirits could not bear any further taxation.  Well, I should like to remind the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that notwithstanding the fact that a referendum intervened between April and November we are still in the year 1968 and I would like to ask what change has come about in the spirits trade which justifies the change of attitude.</P>
      <P>That is why it is impossible to describe this as a mini or a minor Budget and that is important for two reasons because if it was an honest Budget one could understand some miscalculation but surely one would expect that the subsequent or second Budget in a year would impose less taxation if it was an honest mistake? The people are entitled to conclude that this was not a case of miscalculation or making a mistake, that it was a deliberate attempt to fool the people, a deliberate attempt to introduce an easy Budget in April, 1968, so that the referendum would go down and now the real Budget is being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the charges I have mentioned <Col N="219" /> up goes wholesale tax by 5 per cent from 1st January next.  That increase is as severe as the wholesale tax imposed in the first instance.  Post Office charges have gone up all over the place.  That is why I say, Sir, that this is not an honest Budget and that is why I say that the Fianna Fáil Party are not entitled to shelter under the umbrella of the Taoiseach's honesty because this Budget does not present him or the Government of which he is head as an honest Government or as an honest Taoiseach.  He is an experienced man in finance.  He served his time in Finance.  Surely he vetted this Budget when it was being introduced in April last?  If he was honest, if he was sincere about it, why did he not tell his Minister for Finance that he did not want any political playacting, that he did not want any electioneering tactics and that he should go back and introduce a full and adequate Budget?  People are entitled to know that and the people, mind you, as has been proved in this year of 1968, are not so easily fooled. I for one am satisfied that no matter what sort of Budget is introduced by this Government if they are still in office next spring the people will not accept it.  How could they accept any Budget introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party in an election year as an honest Budget in view of their experience in the election years of 1966 and 1968?</P>
    <P>So much, Sir, for the sincerity of this Budget.  So much for the motives which prompted an easy Budget in April, 1968, and this harsh Budget now.  The people have already caught out the Government in the referendum and they have certainly caught out the Government now.  I do not want to deal at length with Deputy Burke's speech but I seem to remember that the theme of Deputy Burke when speaking on the April Budget was: &ldquo;You do not want to pay for the social welfare benefits. Do you object to the old age pensioner getting an increase?  Do you object to the widows and orphans getting an increase?&rdquo; A funny thing about this Budget is that although its taxes are far more severe than those of the spring Budget there is not a penny in it for the social welfare class.  I shall deal with that when I come to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> Let us just discuss for a moment the objects of a Budget.  A Budget should reasonably be expected to raise the necessary revenue for 12 months; it should provide incentives for industry and agriculture and it should make a fair distribution of the national income by protecting the social welfare classes or those unable to protect themselves. Those would be my ideas about it. The Minister for Finance in introducing the April Budget gave us some of his objectives: &ldquo;To improve social welfare benefits so as to offset recent and foreseeable cost of living increases and to assure the recipients of a share in the advance in community living standards.&rdquo;  He also went on to say that there should be provision made to grant a moderate increase in public service pensions.  Those two objects are certainly worthy&mdash;to improve the lot of the social welfare classes, to cushion them against the increase in the cost of living and to give them a share in increased living standards and also to grant a moderate increase in public service pensions.  In so far as the Budget of April last honestly set out to achieve that it deserves credit but let us see what has happened.</P>
    <P>The increases for the non-contributory old age pensioners and social welfare people, the non-contributory classes, only came into force in August last and the increases granted in the April Budget to the contributory section will not come into force until next January.  Yet, within a couple of months of the non-contributory people reaping their small benefits and a couple of months in advance of the contributory sections receiving their benefits we have this late autumn Budget, as it is called, introduced with the effect of taking away substantially from the non-contributory social welfare classes the benefits which they received in August and of ensuring that the benefits promised to the contributory social welfare classes as from January next will mean nothing to them.  Was that fair?  Is that an honest deal?  If this was an honest mistake in budgeting, why did the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach not give some further benefit to the social welfare classes and the State pensioners to <Col N="221" /> bring them up to date and ensure that this Budget would not further reduce their standard of living?</P>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to the health services mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Desmond.  I remember sitting in this House for a week and spending a long week at home before that trying to understand the White Paper on Health.  That was early in 1966 and we were solemnly assured then that the necessary legislation to implement that White Paper would be introduced here before the end of 1966 and that the sections promised in that White Paper would be a reality before the end of 1967.  We are now at the end of 1968 and not a section of an Act of Parliament has been introduced to give effect to the White Paper.  That is a disgrace.  The fact that the Government were too busy all this year trying to steamroll their electoral reform measures through the House and distracting the attention of the country and trying to get people to accept these measures and the fact that we are now going to have further elaborate electoral reforms before the House present no excuse for the Government in regard to the provision of fundamental health services.</P>
    <P>The Government know perfectly well that if they introduce worthwhile health services, even on the lines of the White Paper and even if they do not go as far as some of us would wish they would be practically accepted as an agreed measure.  There is some satisfaction in the fact that the delay in the case of the health services is possibly due to the fact that the Government are now going to accept <i>in toto</i> the Fine Gael health proposals because I understand, from either the Taoiseach or one of his Ministers recently, that they are now considering a health scheme based on insurance.</P>
    <P>This Budget will further retard housing because it will increase the cost of houses which has already been increased several times in the last few years by turnover tax, wholesale tax, devaluation and now an increase in wholesale tax and all at a time when the standard State grant has not been increased since 1948.  I speak of the <Col N="222" /> standard State housing grant.  The honesty of the Taoiseach and the Government is at stake here.  That is the case and it is all they appear to have on which to hang their hat&mdash;the honesty not of the Members but of the head of the Government.  When the Taoiseach recently and not so recently &mdash;in months past&mdash;asked that workers should be careful in demanding increases in salaries and warned that if wages were further increased the economy of the country would get out of control.  I make no apology to the Taoiseach or any Member of the House for asking: did the Taoiseach appreciate that position when he as head of the Government sanctioned increases in ministerial salaries and in Deputies' and in judges' salaries?</P>
    <P>I am entitled to ask that question when the honesty of the Taoiseach is at stake and the integrity of the Government. It is no answer for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to throw across the House at me: &ldquo;If you do not want your increase, give it back.&rdquo; That is not the issue.  The issue is whether the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet, when sanctioning these increases, appreciated the necessity for the call for restraint which has since come from the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  It is no answer to say that I did not then stand up in the House and refuse or oppose the increases.  The Government are the experts and they are in charge of the country.  They have an expert Civil Service to advise them.  Either the Taoiseach did not know of the need for restraint, which he and his Ministers have been preaching, when he sanctioned these increases and he was not minding his business or, worse still, he did know and concealed it from the House and the country.  I should like the Taoiseach to deal with that point when replying.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that the Government have no mandate whatever to impose these taxes in this Budget.  It is a responsible function of a Government to introduce one Budget in the year but in my opinion a Government needs considerable authority before introducing a second Budget.  It is an unusual step, something that is <Col N="223" /> rare, although, admittedly, less rare than formerly.  Therefore, I say that a Government should be backed not only by the confidence of the House but of the country in introducing a second Budget in the same year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Government have lost the confidence of the people.  They went to the country on 16th October and asked the people to accept their electoral reform proposals, having campaigned up and down the country at enormous expense for months before that.  There is no doubt that Fianna Fáil put the Referendum to the country as a political issue.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is also true that the Government put the referendum to the people with the full support of every member of the Government and with the strong recommendation, both written and verbal, of every member of the Government from the Taoiseach down.  There is no doubt about it that practically every householder in the country received a letter from the Taoiseach strongly recommending as his firm conviction that his electoral reforms were in the interests of the country and that, if they were not accepted, he foresaw grave difficulties for the country in the future.  He urged the people to accept his advice and to accept those proposals.  If that is not making it a political issue, if that is not staking the reputation of the Government on the outcome of the referendum, I do not know what it is. The fact of the matter is the people, by a majority of practically 250,000 votes, refused to accept the Taoiseach's <Col N="224" /> recommendation or the Government's recommendation.</P>
      <P>I say, therefore, that this Government have not got the confidence of the country and it is very doubtful if the Taoiseach, who introduced this Budget and who is acting Minister for Finance, has the confidence of his own Cabinet.  It is impossible to find out who is the Leader of the Government, who we are to accept as the man in authority.  I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is here because I would prefer to say anything I have to say in his presence rather than behind his back.  One day we have the Taoiseach making a nice, polite hands-across-the-border, friendly speech to Captain O'Neill and the following day or a couple of days later we have the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have it on the authority of one member of the Government, to wit the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, that certain members of the Government are not pulling their weight.  We had the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries stating the other day that he is doing his best to serve under the Taoiseach and that he is doing a lot better than most.  I want to pose the question if in &ldquo;most&rdquo; he includes the Minister for Finance, because the Minister for Finance is responsible for this Budget?  If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries means to convey to the House that the Minister for Finance, who cannot budget for more than six months ahead, is incompetent, <Col N="226" /> is not pulling his weight and not doing his stuff, I for one agree with him.  We have it from within the Cabinet.  Sometimes we have to look for external evidence and sometimes look for evidence to corroborate statements we make.  I have been trying to establish that this Government is both incompetent and dishonest.  I can prove out of the mouth of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that it certainly is incompetent because he has stated that he put the Taoiseach where he is, that he played a big part in putting in the Taoiseach.  We know is was a big job and we give him credit for the part he played, but he went on to say that he has done his best to serve under the Taoiseach and we know what the best from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries amounts to; we know the Minister's best has ended up in chaos, absolute chaos in the agricultural industry.  Yet this is the man who says that he has done his best to serve well under the Taoiseach and that he has done much better than most.  I cannot conclude my contribution on a stronger note, and with some humility may I say on a more eloquent note, than quoting the words of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

As Deputy Andrews said, it is unfortunate that these matters should have been introduced but, since they were introduced, I would crave the indulgence of the Chair to the extent at least of allowing me to refute the statements and to put the facts briefly.  The tactics of the Party opposite were well displayed and equally well detected by members on this side of the House long before the referendum, when we said publicly that the reason for Fine <Col N="228" /> Gael's attitude to the referendum was based on their hope that, by joining with any sort of queer bedfellow, they might be able to resurrect themselves as a political Party and, if the referendum were lost, they would claim the victory as a political victory for themselves.

      <P>On a point of order.  Since the Chair ruled a few moments ago against Deputy Fitzpatrick and described his statements as irrelevant, under all the circumstances, does he now deem the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to be in order?

In my opinion&mdash;I have the greatest respect for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;the Minister is not in order; he is not speaking to the Motion before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know Fine Gael had been discussing it.  Sorry if I have been misled.  On the Financial Resolution, we had Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, the principal spokesman on the financial end.  I listened to Deputy O'Higgins.  He made great play about <Col N="232" /> this supplementary Budget.  He made this play on the basis that it was improper because the Budget of last April was conceived at a time when it was known that there would be a referendum some time later, and it was devised solely and entirely with that in view.  He, or some of the other people over there, said it was dishonestly conceived, that it was conceived purely and simply with a view to codding the public, and not providing the proper amount of money requisite and known to be needed at that time for the running of the country in the ensuing 12 months.  He or some of his spokesmen&mdash;I am not quite sure &mdash;said this mistake was of the order of £18¾ million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy told us that we did not know we needed extra money for milk, £4 million extra, that he knew last April what we would need by the end of this milking season, and that we would need more than we had provided for.  He told us also that he knew last April that we would need £1½ million for the undoubtedly bumper return of wheat which our farmers have produced this year.  I want to ask why as a good citizen&mdash;and as a wouldbe first citizen, for the last time I am sure&mdash;he did not pass on that very much-needed information, since he had the foresight which he now tells us about?</P>
      <P>Why did he not correct the erring Government and the erring Minister for Finance at that time, and tell him where he was going wrong by providing £4 million too little for milk?  Why did he not tell us that there would be an increase of over 50 million gallons of milk during the present milking season?  How he knew this is another matter, but since he alleges that he did know it, and blames our Minister for Finance and our Government for not knowing it, and accuses us of bad faith in not providing for it, I am entitled to ask why, as the good citizen which he makes himself out to be, he did not correct the Government at that time and tell us we would be £4 million short in the provision for milk support?</P>

      <P>I do not claim it but I probably have more than the Deputy. We have very clear and concrete evidence of the extraordinary increase in our milk production, and if we take from it the amount of milk produced by the additional number of cows that went into our herds and supplied milk to our creameries during 1968, we find that 37,000,000 gallons approximately were produced by the same number of cows as we had last year. That cannot be accounted for by saying we knew more people were going into milk production.  If we take the 50 million gallons produced with approximately 26,000 extra cows, an average national production of 500 gallons per cow, we will find that 37 million or 38 million gallons more were produced by the same number of cows, 99 per cent of which will be the same cows as were there the year before. They produced 37 million gallons more and Deputy O'Higgins knew last April that they would.</P>

Apparently, we do not know the cows as the Deputy knows them, or the farmers either.  I should like the Deputy to put on record now that in Volume so-and-so, and on such and such a date, he gave us a hint that he <Col N="236" /> knew what the cows were going to do in the five or six months which have now passed.  This would be useful. It would establish the Deputy as a new type of expert, the man who can see into the future the milk the cows are going to give, and no doubt calculate the weather we are going to have, the manner in which the grass is going to grow and how much sunshine we are likely to have.</P>
      <P>All these things would have to come into the calculation which Deputy O'Higgins made before the Budget last year which gave him the knowledge to say: &ldquo;Provide another £4 million for the extra 37 million gallons these same cows are going to give over and above what they gave in 1967.&rdquo;  This is a question the Deputy can answer by showing to us in his contribution then that he had the knowledge.  Perhaps, if he has not indicated it and if he has it, he will tell us the exact scientific approach he used to come to this conclusion which none of my advisers, technical or otherwise, were capable of projecting to that degree.</P>

      <P>I have been asked a series of questions.  I am entitled to remind the Minister that I indicated at the time of the last Budget that the provision in the Budget for agriculture was inadequate.  I queried why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who had not partaken in the debate&mdash;it was my recollection that he intervened in a hurry at the end&mdash;had not made better provision.  I indicated the subsidy provisions in the Budget were inadequate in relation to the agricultural situation.</P>

      <P>We have now discovered that last April some colossal conversion had taken place.  Here is a man who did not think that our provision for agriculture in the present Book of Estimates was nearly enough for <Col N="237" /> the farmers without specifying we are short £4 million for milk.  That has not been covered, despite the good answer given.  We will excuse that.  Last April the Deputy was concerned that we did not provide sufficient in subsidies for the farming community, despite the fact that our provision was then four times greater than the total amount that he and his Government provided in 1956-7.  This is really a conversion which is nearly as big as the conversion of Fine Gael to the point where they declared a Republic in 1948.  It is tantamount to that and deserves to be noted and recorded.  It was as big a change as was that great decision taken at that time and announced outside the country.  I think it was announced in Canada.</P>

      <P>However, to get back to the wonders of today, we have already found the wonder of the knowledge of Deputy O'Higgins in regard to milk and cows and things pertaining to farming in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And wheat.</P>

    <Col N="239" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Here is, if anything, an even greater wonder.  If what the Deputy alleged here the other day is true even greater tribute is due to his insight and foresight and knowledge of agriculture and all it means.  Here we have a man who says that last April he knew that we needed £1½ million or thereabouts over and above what was provided in the Budget in order to pay for the extra wheat our farmers would produce over and above our needs for milling purposes. The winter wheat was well on its way in April but the spring wheat was only just getting its nose up.  The Deputy was able by some computer mechanism he has installed to compute at that time when the little ears were coming up that they would provide a bumper crop of wheat.  He knew that there was going to be a new record yield per acre, a yield never before known to even the most ambitious farmers in the country.  Deputy O'Higgins knew it well.  He knew it so well he could charge my colleague, the Minister for Finance, with being dishonest in his preparation of the Budget by not providing an additional £1½ million to cover this excess of wheat over and above our needs for flour and bread purposes.  However, Deputy O'Higgins did not tell us that he knew this record was going to be created.  Probably the greatest thing of all Deputy O'Higgins was able to know was that, out of that yield of nearly 36 cwt. of wheat per acre, 98 per cent would be of millable quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is astounding.  It is absolutely phenomenal.  It is the greatest thing of all time.  If we can have these projections now, even six months ahead; if he can tell us that we are going to plant so many acres of wheat this year, that this will produce so many hundredweights per acre next year, it could be of great value not only to the Government but also to the farming community because they would then know to the exact penny how much they would make on their wheat.  They would know what profit would ensue from their activities in this regard.  I do not suppose there is any fault in the Deputy's computer that would not allow it to be used for telling us about barley and how many ears per stalk <Col N="240" /> will grow inside.  This is a colossal thing.  It is one of the greatest finds of our time.  We in this country and in this Parliament should put this man to work and get him a job in this great field.</P>
    <P>This is the dream of the planners of economies everywhere.  We could, in fact, not only make a great job of our own country with this knowledge and insight but we could make a fortune by selling the services of Deputy O'Higgins to other countries where the planners are only groping about with such calculations.  This is the biggest thing that has ever come about.  Everything pales into insignificance compared with the Deputy's new-found attributes that give him this sort of knowledge which could be turned to such great effect.</P>
    <P>It would be a shame, a loss to the community and to the farmers, whom Deputy O'Higgins knows so well, if he did not make this knowledge available to them and make it available right away.  It would be unfair, not only to this generation, but to the generations to come if this knowledge were not used in a proper way.</P>

      <P>Without interruption, Deputy, I and others are entitled to talk but with or without interruptions, talk we will about the matters that the Deputy does not want to hear.  There is no point in Deputy O'Higgins hiding his light under a bushel and running away from the claim that he undoubtedly can prove, that he has this knowledge and this insight, this ability to predict the future, to predict the amount of milk that a cow will give and the grains of corn that the wheat or barley will produce.  He might as well bring the oats into it also and let us have a computerisation of the entire grain policy.  There is no point in his being modest.  He should stand up and give the benefit of this attribute to the community.  We shall all be thankful for this sort of knowledge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not try to water it down and say that everybody knew there would be more wheat and more milk.  What everybody knows is one thing but what the Deputy knows in an exact way is quite another thing.  He should not depart from the claim that he has already made&mdash;that he knew last April that which nobody else on this side of the House and nobody on the other side of the House knew.  Not even Deputy Donegan who was sitting beside Deputy O'Higgins on the day he made that contribution knew and he is a <Col N="242" /> man who has been in the grain business for a long time.  He buys, sells, stores and dries grain.  He also makes calls on the farmers in his area in connection with the sale of fertilisers. Even he did not know this.</P>
      <P>I suppose Deputy O'Higgins is not only adept at forecasting and, indeed with certainty, telling us what the produce of the cows would be but he also took the Minister for Finance and the Government to task for not providing in the Budget of last April the amount of money that would be required this year to meet the wage claims and the salary adjustments that had not even then been commenced to be decided or negotiated.  He claims to have known how much we would need over and above to meet salary and wage claims and adjustments that had not even then been served, let alone decided, and, indeed, some of which are not even yet finally determined.  He knew then but he did not tell us.  This was very naughty of Deputy O'Higgins.  It was not fair at all.  He was not playing the game of the good citizen that he really is.  Perhaps, he forgot.  He might be excused for forgetting to give us the information.  Of course, he does not like the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am quite happy about that; in fact, I should be very worried if it were otherwise.  Had he given us this information last April we might have known a little more about what we were going to produce, but this might not have been a good thing.  But, apparently, it might have shown that I had more knowledge about farming than I have, that I had an insight into it that is superhuman.  This would not do.  This might put Blaney up a step. Also, if he was told about the wheat, this might in some way be used to Blaney's advantage and that would be bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, when it comes to the provision of money for the public service of this country, the civil servants, the members of State boards and all others who draw sustenance from the State Exchequer one way or another, the Deputy surely had not this excuse to make for not imparting this knowledge. Why did he not tell us then that £9 million more than we were providing for <Col N="243" /> would be needed before the year was out?</P>
    <P>I do not think he can be forgiven for this unless he has an explanation that none of us can really think about. I do not think there is any excuse for not imparting this very important knowledge, for not correcting the Government and the Minister for Finance at that time and keeping them on the right financial track: I do not think there is any excuse for not making them put up the taxes higher last April than the Government and the Minister for Finance announced in that Budget.  The Deputy should have told us.</P>
    <P>If we required to put another 2d, 3d or 4d on the fags last April, Deputy O'Higgins should have said so.  If we required liquor to go up, he should have told us.  Now, what I do not like at all, he comes along and says we are to blame, that we should have known, that he knew.  I think this is wrong.  I think it is unfair of Deputy O'Higgins to gibe at this Government for not making provision for these unknown things to ordinary mortals like ourselves over here.  He said he could see in the crystal ball what we did not know about, namely, that £9 million more would be needed.  It was terribly unfair of him not to say all that last April.</P>
    <P>It is now being said that we did know, whereas, in fact, we did not know and could not know because we have not this inbuilt computer that Deputy O'Higgins has recently developed.  However, an extra £9 million clear is needed between now and the end of next March; an extra £4 million is needed in order to pay for the additional great yields from our farmers and an extra £1½ million is needed for the wheat from a phenomenally good crop that has the highest millable percentage of all time; a yield that is a record for this country; a yield beyond that which we were seeking or even hoping to get.  All that amounts to £14½ million.  There are three items that Deputy O'Higgins could have told us about.  Now he blames us for not including them at that time.</P>
    <P>We publicly confess we could not <Col N="244" /> have known at that time that these things would happen and that they would cost that additional money but Deputy O'Higgins knew it and he knew it at that time.  He now says that we were really trying to cod the people. It was not that he was afraid to say it to us lest he might hurt our feelings when we were doing an honest job according to our lights and that he did not want to disturb us.  No.  He says we also knew and concealed this from the April Budget in order to present a false Budget in the hope that this would in some way affect the referendum which some of his colleagues said was expected last June. Deputy O'Higgins is not being honest: that is to say the very least about it. He is being far from honest when he makes these assertions and these charges.  Unless he can &mdash; by a display of this inbuilt computer that he has now got, this new mystical insight and foresight that he is now saying he has got &mdash; show us clear evidence that he has this quality that we never suspected before, then we can only say that it is not we who have been dishonest but Deputy O'Higgins who has been blatantly dishonest in all of his harangue about this supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins can and will have his opportunity.  As I say, I shall await him with open arms to disprove my belief that his assertions on this Budget are the dishonest participation in this debate and not the action of the Minister for Finance last April.  By coming along and offering his services; by projecting next year's wheat acreage, the yield, millable quantity percentage and the price the people will get; by telling me, in Agriculture, how many cows will give how many gallons and the profit; how the grass will grow; what day will be fine and what day will be wet; whether it will be a good or a bad grass season; whether it will be a good or a bad hay season: all of these things the Deputy can tell me if he has been honest with this House.  If he cannot, or if he will not, tell me those things then he is not standing by the farmers of this country whom he claims to know so well and for whom he alleges he has such great regard <Col N="245" /> because this is a service to them, not to me.  This knowledge is vital to them. I have not got it.  I am human and mortal.  I am without this inbuilt knowledge or insight or crystal ball that the Deputy seems to have.  He can give the information if he has it.  If he does not, he is losing faith and face with the people of this country.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Higgins chooses to give the information then it will authenticate the claims that this Budget of last April was conceived in dishonesty and presented with an ulterior motive last April by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey.  If, on the other hand, he cannot produce the evidence and show his good faith by putting that knowledge at my disposal and at the disposal of the farmers of this country then Deputy O'Higgins stands condemned as the man who has been dishonest in his contribution and in his assertions on these Financial Resolutions and on this Budget when it was introduced a week ago.  That is fair.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has his course open to him.  I am sure, before the week is out, we shall hear from the Deputy.  If, by next week, we have not heard from Deputy O'Higgins then we can only take it &mdash; as, indeed, I unfortunately suspect &mdash; that the Deputy, in fact, will be shown to be a man who has been misleading; a man who has been making assertions that are not honest; a man who has been blackguarding the Minister, who is now absent, unfortunately, through illness, and all that went with him in the preparation of that Budget, honestly done and undertaken and presented to this House at that time.</P>
    <P>Let us go on from there and see how we have fared during this past year and what the likelihood and chances are of faring well in the future.  When we are considering what our prospects are in the future, we must have regard to how the engine worked in the past &mdash; in the recent past and farther back.  Indeed, if there is this talk &mdash; as the Deputies over there like to talk amongst themselves, particularly in and around this House and more so here than anywhere else &mdash; that there should be a change, then we must also, in fairness to ourselves and to the people outside, have <Col N="246" /> a look at what the alternative to the Fianna Fáil Government would be. Thereby, we get very enlightening figures.</P>
    <P>The last opportunity we have to compare this Party and this Government would be with the Coalition Government of 1954-1957.  These indicators can, I think, be taken in any economy as fair indicators and a fair barometer on how fares the Government and what is the welfare of the country at any given time.  How fares the country? Growth rate is important to our wellbeing. Under that alternative government, the Coalition Government, the only alternative then and the only alternative now, we find that Government saw, during 1954-57, the results of its great efforts and its great promise in a growth rate of a miserable ½ per cent. That was the Coalition's growth rate during those three years 1954 to 1957 &mdash; one half per cent.  I cannot but be somewhat annoyed with that retarding of our progress, with that miserable ½ per cent that the Coalition recorded after all their efforts from 1954 to 1957. One miserable ½ per cent per year &mdash; that was the record of all their sweat.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Deputy may depart.  This ½ per cent average growth rate in the three years of the Coalition Government is to be compared with an average growth rate of 3¾ per cent during the ten years of Fianna Fáil Government from 1957 to 1967.  Maybe Deputy O'Higgins has another sort of computer that will show that a ½ per cent is greater than 3¾ per cent; that may satisfy Fine Gael but it will not satisfy anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports are a very important element in the economy of any country but particularly of our country which depends so much on its exports. During the years 1954 to 1956 exports went down by £2 million per year. That was the record of the Coalition <Col N="247" /> Government during those three years, and that Government is the only alternative to Fianna Fáil.  From 1957 to 1967 the increase in our exports was an average of £16 million per year. Therefore, exports go up under Fianna Fáil up to last year, the latest available figures, as against an average downward trend of £2 million per year in the three years of the last Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Some people say: &ldquo;Why accumulate external assets?  Let us blow them.&rdquo;  Maybe they are right, but at the same time we must remember that these assets do not belong to one, two or three of us; they are the assets of the nation.  It has been held by all the economists we have ever heard speak &mdash; that is, bar the scatty ones; there are always a few of those in every profession&mdash;that it is necessary for a trading country to have a reasonable amount of money available to them quickly in external assets.  When the last Coalition Government came in in 1954 our external assets stood at roughly £241 million.  Of course, it will be said the value of money fell since then.  Fair enough; it fell somewhat, but if it fell during those following three years, in order to have an equivalent value in our external assets it is obvious that, under a wise Government, that £241 million would have increased, to take account of the decline in money value.  But what happened? Instead of the assets increasing to take account of devaluation, they went down.  Just the same as the exports went down the external assets went down.  This is something that I hope the people here, over there and outside will take note of, that our external assets were allowed to go down from £241 million in 1954 to £183 million at the end of 1956, whereas our assets now stand, not at £183 million as we found them in 1957 when we came back into office, but at approximately £295 million.</P>
    <P>This is noteworthy, because when we came back in 1957 things were in a bad way.  Nobody knows that better than the people over there.  There were all sorts of bills lying about that had to be paid and there was no money to <Col N="248" /> pay them.  As a new Government we had to find ways and means of paying the debts of the Coalition Government. We had to find a few million pounds to make up the deficit in the Budget that was left as a legacy to us by the very people who are blasting us now about dishonesty in Budgets.  I have not the actual figures here; I will get them before I finish, but relative to the total Budget of that time, the error in the Budget of 1956-57 was far greater than the alleged error made by Fianna Fáil in relation to the present Budget. And there are reasons this year in regard to milk, wheat and wages and salaries that did not arise in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if Deputy O'Higgins wants to go home with arguments, let us give him the arguments.  Let him make his charges.  Let him compare his own performance as a partner in the Coalition of that time, using the same yardstick but without any of the causes of the increases which have arisen this year.  Let him compare the Coalition Government's performance with ours.  On that basis, if the Budget of last April was dishonest, the dishonesty of the 1956-57 Budget beggars description.  I will get the actual figures but, broadly speaking, there is no doubt the error displayed in the deficit in the Budget we inherited in 1957 was, relatively and percentagewise, far greater than the error alleged by Deputy O'Higgins to have been made in the Budget of last April.</P>
    <P>All the economists tell us is that savings as a percentage of gross national product are a fair indicator at any given time as to the state of the nation. So we have the records showing that savings during 1956, expressed as a percentage of GNP, stood at 7 per cent. In 1967, under Fianna Fáil Government as distinct from Coalition Government, that 7 had been converted to 12 per cent&mdash;a healthy 12 per cent savings expressed as a percentage of GNP.  Again, on comparisons, they are beaten by many points.  Another thing which is worthy of note is the matter of capital inflow and outflow to a country, denoting in its various ways the healthy state or otherwise of an economy.</P>
    <P>What do we find about 1954-57, a <Col N="249" /> period when we should have expected that all the friends the Coalition allegedly had, who had gone away during the period of Fianna Fáil Government and who would come back to reap the benefits of Coalition Government? Not only were the people still going out of the country in numbers approaching something we have never seen before but, in fact, the capital outflow was running at an average of £1 million annually.</P>
    <P>So, instead of attracting money in to develop our country during those three years, in addition to all their other failures there was a net outflow of capital of £1 million annually during those three years.  When we look at that and stop to think, we begin to realise just what sort of a Government would be in prospect if we had to have an alternative to Fianna Fáil tomorrow, next month or next year.  There is nothing in prospect but a return to Coalition and Coalition Governments have a record on all the worthwhile points I have indicated.  They have a record there on the economic barometer which shows them up in a very poor light as to performance for the benefit of the economy.</P>
    <P>That is the serious thing about all the squawking and the talking about how much Fine Gael want an election and about how they will come back as a Fine Gael Government.  Maybe they can cod themselves that far, but the Lord save us, let them not for a moment think they will cod the people of the country sufficiently to allow that to happen.  It will not.  The gentlemen have not a chance so let them not waste their time thinking they have.  There is the danger that at the same time as they make these big claims they will annoy the people who provide the only possibility of getting them into a Government&mdash;the aid and assistance of the Labour Party.  If a situation should arise when Fianna Fáil could not get an overall majority&mdash;I do not for one moment believe it could&mdash;Fine Gael's chances of participating in a Government lie with the boys over there.  They know as well as I that they have not a hope of making it on their own.  That is one bet that Deputy Coughlan would not chalk the board on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We all do but that is beyond even the Deputy's capacity.  I left out a figure which I should have given in fairness to the Coalition.  I mentioned capital inflow and outflow and said there was a net outflow of £1 million for each of the three years of Coalition Government.  I should have given that figure of £1 million a year as compared with the ten-year average inflow during the ten years of Fianna Fáil Government since 1957. In those years, up to 1967, the average capital inflow was £20 million per year. That is the end of the tables for the moment.  They provide a good all-round barometer&mdash;they all point the finger in the same way&mdash;that Coalition performance cannot match the performance of Fianna Fáil Government.  On each of the six heads of the economic barometer to which I have referred, which are taken as a guide, an indicator, in every economy in the world, the Coalition Government come out very badly, on the wrong side of each.</P>
      <P>This economic barometer, applied to the years of Coalition administration, indicates definitely that we shall not have progress if we should by any chance, mischance or otherwise, get around to the point of electing another Coalition Government.  We are realising to a large degree that if Fianna Fáil do not get an overall majority &mdash; I do not for a moment believe they will fail to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Even if we did it with buttons &mdash; two or three to one &mdash; we would have a bit of sport.  As I have said, the indicators in every respect point in the one direction, to vote Fianna Fáil for your own sake, for the sake of the country, because the alternative can only be a Coalition.  In that respect I advise Fine Gael not to be making all the big talk because all they are doing is annoying Labour.  If, by any mischance, we should not have an overall majority in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael's only hope would be to join with Labour, so they should not annoy Labour to such an extent that they would not join with them.  As I have said, and regardless of all the pious statements by Fine Gael and Labour that it will not come to pass, if Fianna Fáil should not get an overall majority, these two Parties would combine their strength and, if by so doing they could beat Fianna Fáil for Government, they would coalesce. They may say in good faith: &ldquo;Not on your life.  We will not touch them with a 40-foot pole.&rdquo;  I say that if such a situation arose at a general election, regardless of all the pious promises, there will be a coalescing of the same two Parties to replace Fianna Fáil as a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying to Deputy Coughlan in a particular way, and indeed to the other Deputies in the two Opposition Parties, even though you make these pronouncements in the best of good faith from now until the eve of the next general election that there will be no more coalition, if by any chance you should get enough to beat Fianna Fáil for the Government I say &mdash; and not in any sense by way of reflection &mdash; that you will coalesce.  This is what you will do and there is no point in trying to make people believe you will do otherwise. You will go together if you get an opportunity, no matter a damn what you said before.  This would be a misfortune. It would give us a coalition with the sort of results I have pointed out here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of other statements about the Government and their lack of ability to do this, that or the other, and that Fine Gael could do better.  We have heard the sneering of Deputy O'Higgins about our lack of knowledge in finance in preparing last year's Budget.  That I have dealt with to some degree already.  We also had Deputy O'Higgins telling us that we have done no planning during our period of office or that no planning was evident during the past year and the present year.  I wonder what Deputy O'Higgins had in mind?  Why does he say we have not been planning for the future?  Why does he say that since the evidence is there, even though the plans may not have worked out according to plan.  He cannot accuse this Government or the Fianna Fáil Governments for the last nine to ten years of not having a plan; they even published their plans.  We have been publishing plans since away back in the 1950s and Deputy O'Higgins says there is no planning under Fianna Fáil.  Maybe Deputy O'Higgins, bright in some <Col N="253" /> spots, will forecast milk production and the wages a man may get after bargaining a year or maybe he has a blind spot and has not seen any of the programmes for economic expansion that have been produced and discussed in this House &mdash; and even criticised by Deputies as to whether they were correct or not.  Deputy O'Higgins cannot be serious unless it is that corresponding to the bright spot he has displayed, there is a complete blank on the other side and there are certain things he does not see at all.</P>
    <P>There has been a little play on &ldquo;who is your leader?&rdquo;  I am asking Fine Gael &mdash; who is your leader?  It is not evident.  One cannot have them saying things about us which are not true and not have them saying these things about themselves.  Do you all agree with your Leader?  How long will you keep him?  Have you real belief in him?</P>

There will be coming before you in this House the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for the year 1968-69 and, coupled with that &mdash; it has been agreed that they be taken together &mdash; a Supplementary Estimate for £8-9 million additional aid for farmers.  Then I am told I do not seem to be in touch with and have no care for those on whose behalf I, as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will be bringing into this House an Estimate and Supplementary Estimate, totalling for the current year almost £80 million.  If the Deputy wants to discuss agriculture and my care for the farmers in detail on this discussion, I will oblige him, but I know the Chair may not wish <Col N="254" /> this to be discussed in that way and it would be a duplication of the much more detailed discussion Deputy T. O'Donnell and I and others will have within, I hope, a week.  I am waiting to get this through, to slam it into Fine Gael that the farmers of this country are getting this year almost £80 million against the miserable £17.5 million which you in your hey-day as coalition could provide for them in 1956-57.  That is a full play on its own, all the second and third acts of it and it would be a pity to spoil it by making it a trailer now.</P>

That was the bacon and eggs policy of Deputy Dillon, Minister for Agriculture.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The honesty of last year's Budget is the big matter that is being questioned by Deputy O'Higgins, Fine Gael's Front Bench spokesman on Finance.  I have been pointing out to him that these allegations of dishonesty against the Minister who prepared and presented that Budget last April are completely and absolutely unfounded and that any extraordinary foresight that Deputy O'Higgins could have, and that no human being in this or any other House could possibly have, was not in our possession here. Neither we as a Government, nor our Minister for Finance, can be blamed because this superhuman knowledge that Deputy O'Higgins had of cows and wheat, wages and salaries that had not even begun to be negotiated, we could not have in advance.  That being so, if you take that factor away and say that only Deputy O'Higgins could possibly have that sort of knowledge, you must admit that the Budget, as presented and passed last April, was honest and fair and a good attempt at providing for our financial needs in the <Col N="261" /> current financial year.  It would just about have balanced had it not been for the good fortune of the farmers in getting 50 million extra gallons of milk during an extraordinarily good season, the like of which I have never seen before and very few others have seen. We got wheat to beat the band, quality beyond anything we have ever had before and quantity and yield per acre beyond the dreams of the most optimistic farmer.  Also, through the collective bargaining of the trade unions with the employers of certain of their members and through the associations of civil servants and public servants during the time since April these people freely negotiated wage and salary increases and adjustments which, up to the end of next March, will mean an extra £9 million for those who benefited from the negotiations.  These increases are in line with the millions that the other hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the land have negotiated in these same months.</P>
      <P>That is something we could not possibly have known and provided for last April.  Deputy O'Higgins could do it with no bother.  He did no, tell us.  I do not know why.  Perhaps, he will give us the news for next year so that we can plan ahead but, whether he does or not, it is wrong of Deputy O'Higgins to make allegations of dishonesty and miscalculations against the Minister for Finance in preparing a proper Budget last year.  The Minister, no more than any of us&mdash; except Deputy O'Higgins, who has for the first time disclosed his ability&mdash;has not a built-in computer system.  This wonder-man of the ages can do a lot of good for the country in future if he puts to work the valuable asset he has now discovered in himself.  Not only will it make millions for us but if we can have him at the disposal of the nation &mdash; and I am sure that having offered himself in such a capacity in the past he would gladly do so again for this great work of planning our future, predicting the growth rate of our wheat, the yield and out-turn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should normally be finished in an hour as I am quite a fast speaker.  Indeed, I could, perhaps, say it all in half an hour if I had been let alone and if the Opposition had not been trying to upset me by twisting things so that they would not make good sense but now, thanks to the interruptions, I have been slowed down in my rate of delivery and have had to go into more detail to show that what I am saying does make good sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, we need this great asset, this wonder-man, if he can show that he has got what he claims to have, the ability to predict how much milk the cows would produce, how much wheat will be grown, how much barley <Col N="263" /> and what will be the incomes of the farmers.  Not only will this be an immense benefit to us in planning exactly our farming programme and, indeed, our economic programme as I am sure he can be switched over from agricultural to industrial forecasting. We shall be able to make a fortune on him, as I said earlier by hiring him out to all the other countries in Europe or, indeed, in the world.  It seems to me that if we can get this business organised none of us will have to work again because he will be such a valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>The Budget, in our humble opinion as ordinary human people, was designed in honesty and honestly presented on the basis of our needs and if there had been none of these changes I mentioned during the year, changes we could not have anticipated, the Budget would have been just about right and we could be saying to the Minister for Finance, who will no doubt be back hale and hearty before the end of the financial year: &ldquo;You were dead on the button&rdquo;, instead of having this unfair criticism that the Minister conceived this Budget and presented it dishonestly with an ulterior motive so as to cod the public.  Fianna Fáil have been here sufficiently long for the Opposition to realise that that is something we do not indulge in.  The Opposition should learn from us that it is because we do not try to cod the people that we have been the Government, in spite of all that the Opposition could do to prevent it, for 30 out of 36 years.  There is a lesson there for Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>One might expect that even in this debate they would &ldquo;get wise&rdquo; to themselves. If they want to attack us they should keep their criticism within the credibility limit of normal people. They should also keep it as near as possible, if not bang on the button, within the limit of the matters that should be discussed.  I do not mean that it should be tied into any particular sphere but the debate should be conducted in the realm of general politics. If they want to have &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at us, that is fair enough but instead they get down to the blackguarding and rumour-mongering that has been the hallmark of Fine Gael's efforts at frequent <Col N="264" /> intervals over the years since they were Cumann na nGaedheal.  I was quite small then but I never forgot you.  You were blackguarding the people in Fianna Fáil at that time and telling the most outlandish stories about them.  You did it approaching the 1948 election and you were back at it again around the 1954-55 period and I suppose, going in cycles in some queer way, it is motivating you again.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely, but the Deputy started this a while ago. Deputy Lindsay, unfortunately, has brought this discussion to the narrow debate that it is today.  It is a direct jab at me, an allegation by innuendo which would indicate that my friends and associates are people who take bribes to get favours for their friends and acquaintances and that they sell favours which they get by their friendship with me.  This is what Deputy L'Estrange charged me with by innuendo here a couple of months ago.</P>

      <P>It is on the records and no later than yesterday it was there again when we had the sludge pump Deputy from North Mayo, Deputy Lindsay, giving not only a rehash of what Deputy L'Estrange had alleged a couple of months ago but making many other groundless allegations against various members of this Party. I am only dealing at this moment with the charge that has been made by Deputy L'Estrange and reiterated by Deputy Lindsay.  I want to say to Deputy L'Estrange that this is false and without foundation, that he has made this charge by innuendo in this House.  As soon as it was made the Garda were informed and they came to this House and sought out the Deputy. In fact, that was the night that you <Col N="267" /> had a fairly critical Fine Gael meeting when there nearly was a burst-up. Maybe that is what is bothering you. However, the fact of the matter was that the Deputy was asked to give to the Garda the information that he had spoken about in this House when he made, under privilege, these unsupported charges against me.</P>

In referring the Garda to the Dáil Debates the Deputy was probably well advised by his legal friends about how he could get out of the obligation to say outside, by way of statement to the Gardaí investigating his allegation in this House, what he knew, if he knew anything that could stand up.  I should like to say to the Deputy that, even now, I do not know and I never did know the man who was said to have got the money to get a planning permission during my time in the Department of Local Government.

Surely I have not indulged in breaking the rules as to relevancy when, in fact, it has been my character that has been taken away by two blackguards of Deputies who <Col N="269" /> bloody well will not repeat the charges outside.

      <P>My name never was mentioned, but the accusation was made and there was a repetition of the accusation only yesterday by Deputy Lindsay.  There was a direct assertion that a Donegal teacher demanded and got money for his services in unduly using influence on the then Minister for Local Government, also a Donegal man.  The accusation was that this teacher got money and that planning permission was granted through his influence, the inference being that it was his undue influence, as a Donegal man, with me &mdash; because I was then in the Department of Local Government &mdash; that resulted in permission being granted, this undue influence being paid for and bought by a bribe.  Do not try to sidestep it now.  Take the challenge for what it is worth.  I have <Col N="270" /> never taken money from anybody for any of the jobs I did and I did as many as anybody else.  This is one of the things in which I sincerely believe and, God knows, there were times when I could have done with money when I first came into this House. Never at any stage in the past, at the present moment, or in the future will anyone get Blaney taking money from anybody.</P>

We made the accusation against Kelly, that Kelly said he could, for a sum of money, get the permission.  We do not know whether he got it, but we want to find out the truth.  The accusation was never made personally against the Minister.  It is only fair to say that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will get this thing straightened out.  Straightened out it has got to be, and not for any purpose of getting people on the wrong foot, as far as I am concerned.  All I am concerned about is my own character, and I am sure I will have the facilities of the House in order to straighten this thing out.  I will be vindicated of this, or any other charge of a like nature, at any time during my entire career&mdash;indeed, during my entire life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the Financial Resolution, the justification for this Budget is precise and clear.  Wages, salaries, wheat, milk and sundry other items all benefit.  That is the reason for this increased taxation.  Deputy O'Higgins took the line that we did not budget correctly last April, even though we knew at that time that we needed the <Col N="272" /> money.  On the other hand, Deputy Corish argued that we do not really need the money and that we are anticipating next year's Budget in order to influence voters at the next general election.  The two arguments are diametrically opposed.  There is no validity in Deputy O'Higgins's argument and neither is there any validity in Deputy Corish's argument.  We need £9 million to meet increases in salaries and wages in the public service.  We need £4 million for milk.  We need £1½ million for wheat.  That makes a total of £14 million.  All we will get between now and next March as a result of this increased taxation is £4.2 million.  With a sum of £14½ million already earmarked for various things and revenue of £4.2 million, it is difficult to understand how there could be anything left over to give away at the next Budget in April of next year, prior to the general election. This must be the greatest miracle since the loaves and fishes.  The total sum required is £14½ million.  The revenue will amount to £4.2 million.  Out of that it is argued there will be enough left to spread around the country to all the social welfare classes, to the farmers and others, and perhaps to reduce income tax.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Corish's summing up of the situation.  He thinks that £14½ million can be taken out of £4.2 million leaving, probably, £50 million still behind. That is Deputy Corish's philosophy. We must have missed it.  Fine Gael have got one of the wonders of the earth and here is someone not far behind.  To be fair, Deputy O'Higgins, with his great knowledge and foresight, dealt only with agriculture.  I was giving him credit that he would go on to speak about industry and finance and the general economy.  Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe there has been a visitation from outer space that has left its mark on Deputy Corish and on Deputy O'Higgins also.  Maybe these two great things are arriving together.  In the financial sense Deputy Corish thinks we can take £14½ million out of £4.2 million and still have £50 million left to give away in gifts to the people to buy votes.  That is what Fine Gael and Labour say we want to do at the <Col N="273" /> general election some months beyond next April.</P>
    <P>Maybe there is a new order of things, but why did it pass us by? Perhaps it was thought that we had a fairly good grasp of how to run the country without getting this supernatural and superhuman inbuilt mechanism. Maybe it was ordained that we already have enough ability and that the pair over there needed some input to be given to them.  Being an ordinary mortal I do not believe that Deputy O'Higgins knows something before it happens, as he indicated he knew something last April before it happened.  Neither do I believe that Deputy Corish can perform miracles.  I do not believe either of them.  We cannot be codded that far.  I am not easily codded.  I do not believe that these things are on for Deputy Corish or Deputy O'Higgins.  I do not think it is possible.</P>
    <P>I believe we should have a little honesty from those benches.  When we get to the point, which we seem to have passed now, at which the sky is the limit for the Opposition so far as lies and allegations without foundation are concerned, we are really on the downgrade as a nation and as a democracy.  Our people must be aware of the scandalous lack of consideration given to the truth by the Opposition in this House when they want to press a case to the detriment of the Government.  I hope that the people will take note of this and that they will build up a great kick on the behind for those boys at the next election which will not be too long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let us not allow that to happen.  Let us have the truth.

They are conflicting but designed to complement each other and confuse the people and keep them in confusion until you get them to the ballot boxes at the general election. Then they might give the two Parties the opportunity to get together and wheel and deal in broad daylight or in the middle of the night and coalesce as they undoubtedly will have to if they get the chance, regardless of what sort of undertaking they give before the election that they will not go together.

      <P>We cannot afford a Coalition Government in the future.  I say that without any reflection on those who took part in the last Coalition Government.  It has a bad record and we cannot afford a repetition.  We are trying to get the Opposition to be honest enough not to try codding the people by telling them before an election that they will not coalesce and <Col N="279" /> subsequently after the election wheeling and dealing to form a Government.  If you do not pull something like that out of the hat there is no danger.  The people will make up their own minds.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there is something on which I want to take Deputy Lindsay to task. He did a totally unfair thing.  When slandering people here last night he had a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the ushers of this House.  In reference to his attack on the members of Taca this is what he said: &ldquo;They do not have to bother about coming to the gates or about the ushers. We meet them regularly in the corridors of the new building.  We see them going into Ministers' offices without being ushered in by ushers or private secretaries.  They have open sesame to the House and all its corridors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to take Deputy Lindsay up on that.  I hope he will be a gentleman and admit his grave error in slandering the ushers and the staff of this House by saying that they, in some manner best known only to him, have been carrying out their jobs improperly and that people of Taca or others have been allowed to come in the gates and around the corridors without an usher taking any notice of them or that the ushers are under instruction not to stop these fellows.  I think this is a base charge made by Deputy Lindsay in a vicious and slanderous way.  In throwing muck he is capable of slandering the ushers.  I would ask Deputy Lindsay, if nothing else, to at least have the common decency to come in and withdraw that remark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring some sense into this debate.  I have been listening to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries for exactly two hours and 13 minutes.  Any man with a sprig of intelligence would have condensed what he said into a quarter of an hour.  It was repetition after repetition. He almost brought us back to Brian Boru at Clontarf in 1014.</P>
      <P>Then, having brought us back to things that happened 30 or 40 years ago, he jumped from 1954 to the future and started to tell us what will happen when Fianna Fáil are defeated.  From what he said there is no doubt that he has resigned himself to the fact that Fianna Fáil are beaten.  Their only aim now is to try to create an atmosphere of deception, to try, as the Minister himself mentioned, to cod the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trying to cod the people is one thing.  It has been fairly well accomplished by the Minister during the past few years.  But now, having codded the people, they are setting about codding God.  That is one thing they cannot do, <Col N="282" /> but they are trying.  The Minister sees himself as the great Cassandra, the great prophet and the great historian out of the past, but he has overlooked one fundamental &mdash; the plain, common people of Ireland.  He, and many members of his Cabinet, have failed to realise that there are in this country plain, common people, people who can think for themselves.  Indeed, the folly of the exercise carried out on the 16th of October can leave no doubt about this in the Government's mind. They got their answer when more than a quarter of a million people said &ldquo;No&rdquo; and it is not so long since more than one hundred thousand people changed their minds in the Presidential Election.  However, having got these cautions and warnings, the Government still pursued this road to perdition.</P>
    <P>Now they have introduced this Budget which is crippling, to say the least of it, but they tell us it is a mini-Budget. I should like to know what form a maxi-Budget would have taken if this was only a mini one.  The people most affected were the people for whom Fianna Fáil have no time, the people on whom Fianna Fáil depended in the past and whom they fooled along the road for years&mdash; the plain, common, working people of Ireland.  These are the people who are hit hardest in this Budget.  The social club of the worker can be visited maybe only one night or two nights a week. When I speak of the social club of the worker I mean the ordinary public house into which the worker can go at night to discuss his problems, to have his social contacts renewed and to seek relief from the toil of a hard day.  He has hit these people most through the imposition of taxes on beer, spirits and cigarettes.  He has not hit the mini-millionaires whom we have in this country.  He did not hit them because he could not.  He is indebted to them through this consortium of theirs which they call Taca.  He dare not touch those.  He hit hardest the section of the people who deserve most and, if he did, what concession did he give to those who are hit hardest &mdash; the widow, the old age pensioner and all those living on social welfare benefits?  He <Col N="283" /> has not distributed a farthing amongst them or given them one second's thought or consideration.</P>

      <P>These were the people who were hardest hit.  He could not touch the mini-millionaires. On top of that, has he not closed the social club of the worker because he cannot frequent his &ldquo;local&rdquo; at night in future as often as he did in the past?  Furthermore, the publican who supplied the comforts of the premises is hit harder than anybody else.  With one exception, every item inside a public house door is taxed to the hilt &mdash;and more taxes to follow.  If you want to know the exception, I shall tell it to you.  The 2d box of matches is the only thing that is not taxed in a public house.  Here we have men who came along and purchased these premises, who put a burden of debt on their shoulders, and, in every Budget that comes along, without exception I would imagine, the worker and the publican are hit hardest.  Here is the deception and here is where the unseen dig comes in.  While providing for these increases, there is added&mdash; which we have not heard of yet from the Fianna Fáil side of the House &mdash; the increase in turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man's turnover may increase or it may not increase because of these impositions <Col N="285" /> but he has to pay the turnover tax on top of these increases, on top of the wholesale tax.  This is something we have heard nothing about yet with regard to the imposition of these ruthless taxes.  We now find that there are more increases being applied.  The tea importers are looking for an increase.  The soft drinks manufacturers are looking for an increase.  The publicans are looking for an increase because of these taxes. On top of that, we shall have the worker and the wage-earner who has committed himself to agreements for one year or two years into the future: all these agreements are now gone by the board.  Another round of increases is on the way.  Some of them will be settled satisfactorily: more of them will not.  In any event, we shall have closures and strikes and lockouts.  This is what this Budget has done; let there be no doubt in anybody's mind about that.  The trade union movement and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions came out in no uncertain manner during the referendum campaign, as they did in the previous one in 1959, and made their stand, made their statement, worked on it and won and defeated the Government on both occasions.  This is the backlash which is typical of Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;If you do not come with us, we shall destroy you: we shall wipe you out.&rdquo;  That has been their approach.</P>
    <P>A younger generation is coming up, and this is what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, and the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, refuse to see. This younger generation came out openly on the 16th October and told these buckos over there: &ldquo;Come down off your high horse and live with us and work with us.  Find out what we are thinking and how we are living.&rdquo; More than a quarter of a million of them said that.</P>
    <P>The quicker Fianna Fáil face up to the situation which exists throughout the land the better.  I know this is asking for a miracle.  I know it cannot happen. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries talked about senile decay, but if there is a plague of senility in this land it is rampant in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="286" /> ranks.  They are living behind closed doors.  They are living in Tír na nÓg. They are also living on borrowed time, because the people will give them their answer in the near future.  Let the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries speak anyway he likes; he knows they will never come back with a majority.  He is trying to confuse the issue now talking about coalitions and the curse of this and the curse of that.  The greatest curse since Cromwell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These are the people you cater for, and these are the people who are not included in this Budget because they have given you too much already.  You have taken the 30 pieces of silver from them.</P>
      <P>We do not mind raising money if money has to be raised.  We must be practical.  We cannot live on air.  However, we disagree, first of all, on the method of finding this money.  We also disagree with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on his statement in regard to the over production of milk.  That surplus was there two years ago, and we tried to tell him.  The butter was in the cold stores for two years and it is still there; so is the cheese.  The surplus milk was let flow down the rivers, and every day of the week I saw it flowing down the Shannon into the Atlantic.  We told him the surplus was there but he ignored it.  No one can do anything except Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries comes along in the heel of the evening quoting figures, giving £6 million for this, and £14 million for that.  However, he did not give us the breakdown of the millions of pounds, and he did not tell us this could have been saved two years ago if he had taken our advice, and I was one of those who gave it to him.  If he had directed the agricultural industry along different lines instead of into the production of milk we would not be in the mess we are in today.</P>
      <P>He gave the farmers a bounty on heifers and calves, but who got the benefit of this?  It was the 400 to 500acre farmer, Lord This and Earl That. The man on the side of the road rearing seven or eight cows and doing a bit of work on the side as well got no benefit, because he had only six or seven calves every year if he was lucky.  He could not buy 200 or 300 heifers and have them in-calf and get the bounty on the milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> That is what happened.  When I pointed out here two years ago that he was handling the agricultural policy from the wrong end, and when I tried to point out to him the necessity for improvement in the bacon industry, particularly, and in the beef industry, what did he do?  He stuck his head in the sand, his whole carcase in the sand, and saw nothing.  Accordingly, we find ourselves in this mess because of the blindness of that man and his predecessor. I must say I am sorry his predecessor is indisposed.  All sides of the House regret it.  Though we are no Casandras as the Minister has set himself up to be, or <i>Old Moore's Almanac,</i> as he has set himself up to be, we can see the barometer and the way the pendulum swings.</P>

We told him where it would lead him and though we must congratulate ourselves on that, we must also sympathise with the unfortunate people who are now being asked to carry the burden of his folly.

That is what happened.  It is tragic for any of us to see the impositions of this Budget descending on the working people.  I ask Fianna Fáil Deputies to go into any of the social clubs in their constituencies on a Saturday night, the only night of the week people can afford to frequent them, and to listen to the sentiments, listen to a lad talking to his neighbour and ask him or his wife what he or she thinks of the alleged mini-Budget.  If they go to the country in the morning &mdash; I know they will not, I know they have no more notion of going to the country now than Stalin had of going to the poll &mdash; they know what will happen.  They are living in fear and trembling and their only resort is to a campaign of deceit and confusion with regard to what will happen after the next election.  Let Fianna Fáil resign themselves to the prospect that whatever happens at the next general election they will not be over there afterwards.  That is as much a certainty as Sir Ivor.  In their dying political moments, I appeal to them to make restitution and to do penance for their political sins of the past.  For them, the finger has written on the wall &mdash;<i>Mana, Thekel, Phares</i>.  It is written on the wall in indelible ink.</P>

I appeal, though, to Fianna Fáil at this late stage to make restitution and to go to the people whom they have deceived and robbed so often within the last two years, and certainly within the last month in no uncertain terms.  The <Col N="291" /> people will tell them where to get off and they will go to rock bottom.  It is the plain people of this country who suffer most under Fianna Fáil.  I am sorry the Taoiseach did not come in earlier to hear my appeal to his Party in the dying moments of their political lives to do penance and to make restitution particularly to the small farmers, the wage earners of this country.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Budget is another proof, if indeed any proof was needed, that Fianna Fáil are prepared to be less than honest with the people of this country.  In his concluding statement when he introduced this mini-Budget, the Taoiseach, as acting Minister for Finance, said that Fianna Fáil never flinched from taking unpopular measures when they were necessary.  He certainly flinched from taking unpopular measures when he deemed them to be politically inexpedient and inadvisable.</P>
      <P>Last April when the Minister for Finance introduced the Budget, speakers from these benches, and in particular Deputy Sweetman, told them that this Budget was not a Budget that would last the year and was being introduced because of the forthcoming referendum, but they tried to laugh him to scorn.  However, since last April the Government have found themselves no longer able to carry on and they want something in the region of another £18 million to try to continue on.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, introduced a second Budget in that year, and he then wanted to know what had gone wrong as he could not believe it was necessary to introduce a second Budget.  He did not ask us this year what went wrong with the Budget.  We all know what went wrong, because it was a Budget purely and simply designed to condition the people for events which lay ahead.  On 25th April the Taoiseach said the Budget was a good one.  He described it as a Budget which suited the needs of the present and also suited the hopes for the future.</P>

    <P>I wonder, when he was talking of <Col N="292" /> the hopes for the future, were those hopes the hopes of a success in the referendum.  He had hoped at that time that his Budget would condition the people to accept the Government's proposals which we all knew were doomed to fail, proposals which assumed the character of being political but which were non-political when it suited the Fianna Fáil Party.  We were told they were not political, that this was a national issue and had nothing to do with politics.  Yet, at every council meeting throughout the country when it was introduced Fianna Fáil opposed it as being a political matter.  However, the people of this country gave their answer in no uncertain terms to the Government in that referendum.  Never before have a Government been so defeated, practically annihilated.  The Government, because they neglected for nine months of the year to look after the finances of the country, because they were so occupied with this useless and wasteful referendum, could not see how the finances of the country were going.  They did not know until now that they were so deeply indebted and once again we have them coming in here taxing the usual items &mdash; the pint, the cigarettes and whiskey.  Those are things which have been taxed out of existence.  Those are the things which Fianna Fáil regard as a luxury.  We on this side of the House believe that the pint and the cigarettes are no longer a luxury.  They are practically a necessity for the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>In his Budget statement we were told by the Taoiseach that there is £4 million necessary for milk subsidy.  I do not profess to know a lot about agriculture but I can tell you that it is no consolation to the people I represent in an urban area to know that there is £4 million being given to subsidise milk prices.  I wonder has this surplus milk come as a result of the £15 heifer scheme?  If it has, this heifer scheme has proved to be a costly failure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries spoke here this evening and told us about the tremendous success he had achieved in agriculture.  Again, I do not profess to be an expert on it, but he told us the farmers were never so well off.  Indeed, lately inside and <Col N="293" /> outside this House he has been telling us how well off the farmers are.  He shouted through a barrage of interruptions last week, he nearly broke his vocal cords, trying to tell us that the farmers of this country were prosperous in spite of Fine Gael and that they will continue to be prosperous whether Fine Gael like it or not.  I am glad that he was able to tell us the farmers are prosperous.</P>
    <P>He also told us about the increase in exports.  He could have saved his voice and his shouting and could have more usefully told this to the members of his Cabinet.  Remember, Fine Gael always believed in farming exports.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us recently that 70 per cent of our exports are to Great Britain, even still, and the great bulk of our exports to Britain are agricultural produce.  The Minister, instead of trying to shout across and tell Fine Gael that these exports would increase in spite of them, could have turned to his colleagues on the Front Bench; he could have turned to the Tánaiste and told him how lucky it was that the people of Ireland did not take the Tánaiste's advice when he wished to have all the ships sunk to the bottom of the sea; I do not think he was considering that exports to Britain should be transported by air. He had other reasons.  He could go to another strong supporter, a former member of Fianna Fáil, and tell him that he was thankful that his words were not true when he said that the British market was gone and gone forever, thank God.  At that time Fine Gael advocated that it was in the best interests of the country to trade with Britain.  Fine Gael have always advocated trade with Britain and we are glad to hear that our trade with Britain is doing so well, even under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have talked about encouraging personal savings. How can they expect people to save when there have been no less than 300 increases in prices and services since the 1st January, 1968.  How can they expect the wage earner, the ordinary worker, to save under circumstances like this?</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Taoiseach did not <Col N="294" /> ask this time what happened in the Budget of the Minister for Finance.  It reminds me of a slogan that has appeared on notices all over the city.  I do not know where it emanated from. The slogan is &ldquo;What really happened to my son Henry&rdquo;.  I see it has been followed up now by a new slogan&mdash;&ldquo;Watch out for the Fiddler&rdquo;.  I do not know whether this has any reference to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We know that recently the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has thought fit to go to places outside this House and preach about Partition and wave the flags and beat the drums and even contradict the Taoiseach on his own statement.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is a question of Cabinet responsibility any longer.  The Taoiseach should become firm and make firm decisions before it is too late.  He should make changes and exercise his power within the Cabinet because, if the situation continues, changing Ministers from one post to another will not be sufficient. What they want is a complete change of Government.  The Government must know that the present situation can last only for a short time.  All the signs are against them, and the results of the referendum show in no uncertain manner that the people are tired of Fianna Fáil Government.  This trend has been evident for some time.  It was evident in the local elections; it was evident in the last Presidential Election. Certainly the Taoiseach, although he claimed it was a record to have won six by-elections, knows that they were all by-elections with reduced majorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows that in his own constituency the Government had an overall majority before ever he was Taoiseach.  Before even he was Taoiseach they won a by-election on the <Col N="295" /> first count.  He knows that in the last general election Fianna Fáil had an overall majority in his own constituency and yet in a by-election held there since he became Taoiseach not alone did Fianna Fáil not hold their votes but they dropped 3,000.  Surely he cannot say that this is an indication of a mandate from the people to carry on? Surely he must see that even if they won by-elections on reduced majorities they no longer have the confidence of the people?  In all sincerity would he not think it is time that he came out and gave the people a chance to show him what they want?  He is reluctant to move the writ for the Wexford by-election. If he would only come out and hold that the people would surely give an indication of what their feelings are.  The sooner the Fianna Fáil Government decide to hold a general election and let a fit and proper Fine Gael government take over the better for everyone.</P>

      <P>I am amazed by the attitude of the two Opposition Parties to this Budget and the Financial Resolutions which were presented to the House.  They were opposed by both Parties.  It is regrettable to think that the Labour Party would vote against the necessary Financial Resolutions when money was needed to pay the workers of the State concerns, deplorable to think that workers were granted increases and when the Financial Resolutions were presented to this House the Labour Party had the audacity to stand up and oppose them. This is an indication that they were not prepared to meet the bill to pay the workers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one portion of it.  The Fine Gael Party on the other hand were concerned about milk prices and other reliefs for the farming community.  This was also a factor in the Financial Resolutions which were put to the House and opposed by both Parties.  I can only <Col N="296" /> take it that the Party opposite was opposed to the increases for the farming community for which the money was necessary.</P>
      <P>I speak as a worker, as one who has worked, on behalf of the workers and as a member of the workers' party.  I say that the workers can now look forward with confidence and without the haunting fear of poverty destroying their peace of mind.  We can do that because the Fianna Fáil Party over the years have taken the necessary steps at all times to correct situations, to keep Irish workers in employment and to meet their commitments to Irish workers.  It is regrettable that when the necessary Financial Resolution was put to the House people who talk labour voted against it and tried to discolour the picture.  The bare facts are that the money was required to pay the State servants who are just as entitled to salary increases as other sections of the community.  The money was required for reliefs for the farming community and we faced it with the courage and understanding it deserved. Our policy throughout the years has been one of support for the worker and reliefs for every section of the community that needed them where reliefs could be granted in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>What is the Fianna Fáil policy?  It is to achieve the maximum development in both agriculture and industry.  It is to ensure that the benefits of this development are shared equally by all and not by the few only and to give special care to those who are unable to support themselves.  This has been the policy of Fianna Fáil over the years.  It has been the policy for which we have stood and for which we were prepared to come to this House time after time and look for reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said by Labour speakers in this debate that there is little difference now between the policy of our Party and that of Fine Gael.  Fine Gael speakers have said that there is little difference between our policy and that of the Labour Party.  This may be so. There may be a little difference in certain respects because we have convinced those Parties over the years that it is necessary to have industrial development, <Col N="297" /> necessary to have social services, necessary to meet our commitments in relation to the weaker sections of the community.  We are not a Party that talks left and acts right.  We talk left and we act left in relation to industrial development and in relation to the social services that are required to meet the needs of the needy sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Fine Gael Party have spoken at length about their Party's policy, the Just Society. It is interesting to hear Fine Gael speak of a policy because the political dustbins are full to the brim with discarded and rejected Fine Gael policies including the Just Society.  There is little need for me to speak about a Labour Party policy because they have no policy.  They are supposed to be compiling a policy.  The sham socialists of the Labour Party are now compiling a policy which they are going to present to the people in the future. Their policies, too, have been rejected and are filling the political dustbins.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the worker and about employment for the worker. As we look back over the years we see what has been done for the worker, not alone by the provision of industries which I will deal with in a moment but also by way of the concessions that are necessary and desirable to relieve him from the hardships and the hazards in employment.  We brought into operation the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 and 1944, which wiped out the sweated labour conditions for Irish workers.  We brought in the holidays with pay Act, 1939, the holidays with pay Act, 1961, the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, the Occupational Injuries Act, the Redundancy Payments Act and many others.  No doubt Deputy Dillon will laugh about what we have achieved for the workers by way of conditions.  We have set here a high code and high standards and we will press still further and I, as a worker, will keep pressing to ensure that all the needs and all the desires of the workers are met in full as finances are available and as we progress.</P>

      <P>Are unfortunate people to be deprived by a small section of the community of essential services, all the drugs and other essential items in hospitals that require an electricity supply?  If that is what you are referring to we value human life and we will continue to do so despite the Labour Party who have no interest at all in human life, or so it would seem.  At that time a man almost lost his life on the operating table.  We were aware of that.  Deputy Corish can take it from me that we are concerned about the workers.  The indications are there over the years by our action in relation to the services of the workers, in relation to the conditions of the workers.  They have been receiving our fullest consideration.</P>
      <P>No doubt when we go through this quite comprehensive list of items, giving concessions to the workers time after time, it is easy for Deputy Corish to sit back and pick out one particular point and disregard all the others in regard to the situation that developed here.  I have the same concern for the workers, for every worker, as Deputy Corish has.

      <P>All the concessions given and all the comprehensive legislation brought in in relation to conditions of employment, holidays with pay, industrial relations, apprenticeship and all the other legislation for the benefit of workers were brought in by Fianna Fáil and by them alone.  It was easy for Deputy Dillon to laugh earlier.  I could quote the Deputy in regard to many aspects of industrial life when he was not very concerned about the workers.  There was no cause for the workers to laugh when the Deputy finished his mouthings about what should and should not be done.  Perhaps I shall bring back his memory to some statements he made and deal with them in some detail.  He once declared that he would venture to say that five years from that day the rabbits would start to play leapfrog in Rineanna and that the masts erected for the purpose of radio communication would be converted into knitting needles to knit the wool off the rabbits. Thank God, we have at Shannon Airport now a very extensive industrial estate.  We know the vast numbers employed there and the service the estate is giving to the nation, but that was Deputy Dillon's view regarding the industrial development of Shannon Airport. The Airport has proved to be a boon to the nation and the industrial estate has given employment to thousands and will continue to do so despite the wanderings of the Deputy in the past.</P>
      <P>Also in regard to tourism, which is a very important industry, Deputy Dillon said on one occasion that he observed with amazement and astonishment a collection of strange people swarming into the hotels of Dublin and elsewhere and that it was time we warned them off in terms that would ensure that none of their brothers would favour us with their company in future.</P>

      <P>On the first occasion that Fine Gael and the Labour Party came into office in 1948 there was a statement by Deputy James Larkin. This is what he said about that gang: &ldquo;We know that Fine Gael used every opportunity that came their way not only in the open light of day but also in the dark of night.&rdquo;  The Deputy is one of those who acted in the dark of night.  It was during this period that they gave the tenpence a week to the old age pensioners, a never-to-be-for-gotten contribution.  There is this miserable sum of tenpence a week, of which the Labour Party and Fine Gael collectively must feel very proud as their contribution for their time in office&mdash; a remarkable contribution to social welfare.  I do not know to what degree the Labour Party were responsible for this enormous increase, whether we should give them credit for 60 per cent of it or more, but that is all the old age pensioners got under that Government.</P>
      <P>I could make quite a number of contributions in regard to the advances of that time, but to get back to the Conditions of Employment Act and the various other Acts we brought in so that the workers would get justice, I am pointing out that it is only from this Party they got justice I should like to know what policies favouring the workers or what aids to workers were enacted in the two periods when both the Labour and Fine Gael Parties enjoyed power.

      <P>We find that the Fine Gael policy was to attack industries which had been set up and we will take just a few of them.  We find that in the 1965 election address of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Mr. O'Reilly of the Fine Gael Party, they referred to the establishment of the Verolme Dockyard as financial extravagance and a waste of money.  This dockyard has provided substantial employment and now has a very wide range of skilled personnel.  As a result of its being established we have trained a substantial number of skilled personnel who are members of trade unions and who have made their contribution to the trade union movement.  This industry was frowned upon by the Fine Gael Party as financial extravagance and a waste of money.  They also condemned the building of luxury hotels.  We were not supposed to build any more hotels or attract visitors who had money to spend.  We were supposed to remain in whitewashed houses and ask people to come and stay in them.  Fortunately, we have long since passed that stage and it was regrettable that this attitude should have been adopted.  They also advocated that we must not have any more fine roadways, continental speedways as they termed them.  Is that their policy, that we are to remain a backward nation for all time, that we are not to have good roadways or good hotels?  Surely we are entitled to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To refer again to the Verolme Dockyard, it has provided valuable employment, brought new skills to the country and increased the earning power of <Col N="304" /> many of our workers, yet it was condemned by the Fine Gael Party as a waste of money and as extravagance. We know that this is their mentality and it was not the only industry that was sabotaged by Fine Gael over the years.  I will deal with more of them before I am finished.  There was the chassis shop at Inchicore and the transatlantic air service.  The Verolme Dockyard which employs 750 people was one of the silly industries about which we heard so much spoken in the past.  This may be silly in the eyes of Fine Gael or in the eyes of the Labour Party but we consider that these people are getting valuable employment. This industry will develop and will continue to expand and will bring greater skills and greater opportunities to the workers.</P>

No Minister of this Government has ever said that it was not the duty of the Government to find work for the people.  That is the distinction of an ex-member of the Fine Gael Party.

      <P>If the Deputy takes the time to drive around the vast industrial estates being developed in Waterford, Shannon, Galway, Ballyfermot, Finglas, Coolock, Walkinstown and elsewhere, he will see the basis on which industries are being built in order to provide work for the people. The population increase demands even greater effort by Fianna Fáil and we will make the effort and make greater efforts than ever in order to ensure that all our people will be employed.  We know that when we had the terrible tragedy of 1957 there was not a building worker in the country and, as Deputy P.J. Burke says, not the price of a bag of cement.  That is an undeniable fact.  There were very few workers in the country and we can judge the fact by the number of vacancies in the corporation housing schemes and the vast number of people who were forced to emigrate by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party working in close co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent that area and I am aware of the barricades that went up in a vast number of houses and the tears that were shed for not alone one member of a family but the whole family, father, mother and children, who had to emigrate because of the situation which existed when the Coalition were in power.  Anyone can create vacancies by forcing people out of their homes and then say that there are houses available.  Deputy Dillon talks about the number of houses available <Col N="306" /> and he takes pride in it but they were only available because people had to leave their homes, just as they had to leave the country before in coffin ships and in other ways.  There would be plenty of homes available if we drove the people out of the country. It is not our intention to drive people out.  We want to ensure that they have employment in industrial estates like Shannon, Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Coolock, Waterford, Galway and elsewhere. We will not be impeded in our industrial development by crackpots who would try to ruin such development.</P>
      <P>The ambition of the inter-Party Government in 1948, when they first came into office, was to drive people out of Aerlínte, sell the aircraft, and deny them the right to work in their own country.  The disposal of these aircraft was put into the hands of a very competent auctioneer, Daniel Morrissey; he was a Minister in the inter-Party Government at the time. There is no doubt about it; if they got into power tomorrow they might give the same opportunity to Deputy Oliver Flanagan, who is a very competent auctioneer, and I am quite sure he would be just as capable of disposing of anything put into his hands for sale. He would probably sell this place, if he had his way.</P>
      <P>The last general election gave the people an opportunity and they rose to that opportunity in no uncertain fashion.  They returned this Government. They were satisfied that this Government, and this Government alone, were the only people who would help the nation to make progress, limited as it might be. As a worker and trade unionist, I hope there will be more progress still.  We are prepared to meet our commitments.  We are prepared to impose taxation.  We are prepared to measure up to our responsibilities in the future as we have done in the past, irrespective of whether or not the steps we take are popular or unpopular.  We are not concerned about trying to rule the people.  We do what we think is right and we do it when we think the time is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been criticised here a good <Col N="307" /> deal, particularly in relation to this Budget.  But this Budget is designed to increase the income for the farmer and for a very responsible section of the community employed in the Government service.  It may be that the Labour Party do not want the workers to get these increases, even though they deserve them.  It may be that the Fine Gael Party do not want the workers to get these increases.  It may well be that they want discontent among workers. We want to ensure good conditions for the workers.  We have passed legislation here designed to achieve that object.  We will pass more in the future. We will build more factories, whether the Opposition like it or not.  If Providence decrees that the Opposition get into Government and if they try to sabotage the nation, as they sabotaged it before, we will again rectify the position, as we did on the last occasion. Unfortunately, so many had lost their jobs and departed to foreign fields in search of employment it was not possible to rectify the situation in its entirety.</P>
    <P>The chassis shop in Inchicore, which would have been a valuable source of employment in the heavy engineering industry, was ruthlessly closed down by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  Both Parties had no regard for Irish workers.  They stabbed them in the back.  They sold the means by which they could be employed. They sold the machinery, some of it still in the packing cases.  Some was sold as scrap.  That is the picture, and the only picture, one can present to the people of government by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party when they get together.</P>
    <P>Facts speak for themselves.  They had no regard for the workers.  They cannot point to any legislation passed by them on behalf of the workers. They said the workers should get this, that and the other.  When they got in, what did they do?  What did they give the worker?  They gave the majority a one-way ticket to Australia, Birmingham, London, and elsewhere. Those are the places to which our building workers had to emigrate in search of a livelihood.  That was the <Col N="308" /> coalition's contribution to the Irish worker.  There have been reckless and untruthful statements made here. Some were made by Deputy Dillon in relation to Verolme.  Verolme is now giving employment to 750 workers.</P>
    <P>When talking about tourism, Deputy Dillon spoke about observing with amazement and astonishment a collection of strange people swarming into the hotels of Dublin and elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon wants to frighten away tourists from the country.  The coalition were not prepared to build hotels or improve roads.  The latest figures available for tourism show an income of approximately £84.3 million.  Tourism is our second highest earner.  Directly and indirectly it employs 160,000 people. That is the industry Deputy Dillon wanted to frighten off in 1948.  Fortunately he did not have his way and today 160,000 people are employed in this industry.  He was not the only one, of course.  Deputy Costello was another who wanted to frighten away tourists.  He said it was nonsense.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Industrial Estate was developed in spite of the Opposition, in spite of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  It was developed because we had confidence in the ability of the Irish worker to acquire the skills needed in this industrial estate.</P>

In the Shannon Estate today there are 3,942 people employed and despite the sabotage of Aerlínte, in all sectors of Shannon Airport we have 6,201 people employed.  That represents a considerable amount of employment and we can be proud of it.  We never tried to sabotage anything but people who are here today tried to sabotage things when they were in power.

      <P>They tried to sabotage Aerlínte.  Today Aer Lingus employs 4,954 people.  Despite that sabotage by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party we brought it back.  It took some time.  I venture to say, to use Deputy Dillon's words, that if we had remained in power at that time that figure would be greater and many more people would be employed at Shannon and elsewhere.  The vast amount of money made available to Aer Lingus is an indication of our confidence in the Irishman, the Irish worker, to carry out a certain type of job in the field of aviation.  I will not dwell on that any further.  I hope I have got the message across.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves in relation to social welfare. This Party have always been concerned with the workers and their conditions of employment.  If there are defects I have no doubt that the Government will set about rectifying them at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Department of Labour was an expression in the strongest terms of the Government's desire to ensure that Irish workers got the consideration they deserve and the consideration of which they were deprived for far too long.  We have at the moment a very responsible Minister, Dr. Hillery, who has devoted time and energy to try and alleviate and solve the problems of the Irish workers.  We are behind him and we will continue to be behind him despite the opposition of the Deputies opposite from time to time in relation to our progressive legislation for Irish workers.  I know there are defects and I am very conscious of them.  I want to make my voice heard until these defects have been rectified.  My trade union comrades are anxious to ensure that Irish workers get the treatment they deserve and that they will not be sent to Birmingham or elsewhere, as happened in 1947 when the nation was deserted by the then Government.  We will never desert the worker.  We will not desert the nation in the future. That goes for many generations of people associated with this Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back now to the social welfare aspect and to the various schemes brought in like the unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, conditions of employment, disablement allowances, children's allowances, holidays with pay, and wet time allowances to obviate workers having to shelter from inclement weather in their own time.  I heard a reference to wet time allowances by one speaker <Col N="314" /> earlier who described them as farcical. We have the contributory old age pension which gives people in their old age, after years of toil, a pension by which they can live.  I know the pension itself is contributory.  The State make contribution charges as they do in other cases.  Because of the contributory old age pension the situation of an old age pensioner today is far removed from that in which an old age pensioner found himself in the dark and difficult years when the Coalition were in power.  These advances, together with the Redundancy Act, the Occupational Injuries Act and various other Acts, as well as other to come, will confer on the workers many advantages. We will never shirk our responsibility to them and, if we require taxes to give increases to the workers, we will not be afraid to vote for them.</P>
    <P>We know from the past that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party can speak with two mouths.  They praise the increases given but vote against financial resolutions.  This is equivalent to stabbing a man in the back.  They say, in affect:  &ldquo;We are in favour of the increases but we are not going to give you the money to implement them.&rdquo;  That is not the type of Party the people want.  They appreciate honesty and that is the reason we have had the support of the working people for so long.  We will continue to have the support of the workers because they can rely on the honesty and understanding of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They know that when it is possible to assist them we will be courageous enough to do so, even at the expense of becoming unpopular. We will seek the necessary taxes and the necessary moneys to make the increases available.  We will continue to make increases not in the region of 10d per week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were depending on Fine Gael they would get 10d a week.  We have been supported consistently because of our concern for the worker as expressed in the legislation <Col N="315" /> to which I have referred.  This is only part of the assistance we have given to the Irish workers to give them that sense of security to which they are entitled. I feel we could go much further in the future.  It will not be my fault or that of my colleagues here if we do not.  We would like to make it as easy as possible for the aged and the unemployed or those in need of assistance in any way.</P>
      <P>There is much one can say about this but I do not want to go back and point out all that has been done and what has not been done by the various other groups here in this House.  I would like to say once again that so far as social welfare is concerned we are ever conscious of our responsibility to the aged and the unemployed and other sections of the community and we will continue to assist them whenever it is necessary and possible to do so.  We are not afraid to come and ask for the necessary money whether we may be unpopular or not. We will not hide behind the banners that the Opposition hid behind when they were in power.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with one or two other items.  I would like to refer to Deputy Lindsay who made some references here last night.  He spoke about <i>Old Moore's Almanac</i>.  It is quite obvious from his speech here that this has been the guiding line of the Fine Gael Party.  There is no doubt about it, judging by the blunders and inaccuracies in the past.  This was the particular policy by which the Fine Gael Party were guided &mdash; Old Moore, Old Dillon, Old Flanagan and a lot of other old people in their time. Deputy Lindsay referred last night to a number of other factors worthy of mention.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent the socalled research workers of Fine Gael come and go, but I do know that the personnel in charge of the security here are responsible people.

I am sure Deputies are aware that <Col N="317" /> when we came back into office the building trade was at a complete standstill and the workers were employed in Birmingham.  Coventry, Glasgow and elsewhere.  This was the situation which prevailed when we came back to power but in a short space of time we had that rectified.</P>
      <P>I read in a report in the paper of a demonstration which is being planned by members of the Labour Party in Dublin Corporation in relation to widespread agitation by Labour supporters for the immediate improvement of the housing situation in Dublin.  This was revealed in a statement to the press by a man who is vice-president of the Labour Party. The report appears in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, November 13th.  It comes from a man who knows nothing at all about housing but, nevertheless, he thought it worth his while to protest. This man is vice-chairman of the housing committee.  He has no confidence in himself, in the committee or in the Corporation.  At the moment Dublin Corporation have 2,430 houses under construction.</P>

      <P>In relation to this demonstration which is to take place I should like to let the situation be known as it exists at present and as it will exist in the future.  The housing situation on 1st July, 1967, indicated a need for 17,219 dwellings in Dublin city up to March, 1971.  The Corporation propose to provide, in that time, a total of 17,914 dwellings which is in excess of the needs assessed.  The Corporation will make both houses and private sites available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, of course, aware that it is necessary and desirable that money <Col N="318" /> be made available for housing programmes. Money has been made available.  The Corporation are working at full pressure to provide houses for our people and not, as has been suggested by the publicity mongers of the Labour Party in Dublin Corporation, that the Government are not providing for housing.  I might add that in Dublin Corporation Fianna Fáil have a very small representation as compared to the Opposition Parties who have the controlling interest.  One would think that no money was provided in any Budget to meet demands for housing, but in actual fact the demands of Dublin Corporation have been met in full by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

I am a member of the local authority here in Dublin and I can therefore speak with some authority on it.  I am aware that any moneys that were requested were made available and I am sure they will continue to be made available until the housing programme is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sites that are available and the package deals that will be entered into in the near future will be more than enough to meet the needs of the people.  Due to the expanding economy, I am quite sure there will be more people.  With the population increase and other factors, we shall have a bigger demand but this, too, will be met in no small way. While at the moment the housing programme needs to be speeded up to some degree, nevertheless, much has already been achieved.  It would have been unthoughtful of me if I did not compliment the progressive thought of the Minister for Local Government and, indeed, other Ministers for Local Government in their efforts to stimulate building in Dublin when the local authority had failed to measure up to the targets.  In the development of the Ballymun and other housing <Col N="319" /> schemes, the Minister for Local Government has taken upon himself the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am going off the track.  I was rudely interrupted here so many times tonight that I can hardly be blamed if I am inclined to get confused in relation to what I may discuss in detail now.  However, to get back to the Financial Resolution and to the moneys that are given by the Minister for Finance for housing, health, industry and the money to aid other sectors of the economy, I want to dwell briefly on a number of other sectors of our economy that have not been dealt with.  I think this is justiable. It is regrettable and unfortunate that I was not allowed to pursue the discussion in relation to housing. I can well understand the desire of some members of the Opposition to interrupt me and to silence me on that score because they know that the targets that have been set will be met by 1970.  I do not know how far I can now deal with the housing position.  If the Chair feels that in my observations I am unduly labouring the question of the housing situation or I am in any way infringing on the rights of others or am out of line with the procedure, then I do not mind going to another aspect of Government policy and dealing with it in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, Budgets, whether supplementary or otherwise, concern the financial set-up of the nation in relation to all aspects of Government policy.  I know that in a general situation in relation to housing as a whole, in 1964 when targets were set, the housing programme was formulated and published.  At that stage, there were 9,679 houses, taking into consideration all aspects of building.  Today, in 1967-68, that figure has risen to 12,000 and it is estimated that it will reach 13,000 in another year.  This housing achievement will be second only to a record year in the past when, on one occasion, this figure was surpassed by a Fianna Fáil Government. I do hope that every effort will be made to push forward diligently with the housing of our people and that, as more demands are made on the Minister <Col N="322" /> for Finance for housing and other services in relation to housing &mdash; the services I have mentioned &mdash; this money will be forthcoming.  For my part, I shall do all in my power to ensure that the weaker sections of the community, whether they require social assistance or housing or any other assistance, will be catered for and I shall raise my voice at all times in an endeavour to ensure that the necessary moneys will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the many demands that are made on the Exchequer. I cannot but be aware of the demands that are made from day to day by the Opposition Parties in relation to a variety of different schemes whether housing or other types of development and I am forced to note the cowardly attitude adopted by them, which is shown up in the Division Lobbies when they are called upon to face up to their responsibilities, as on this occasion when they were asked to provide money for the take-home packet of the Irish worker.  It would seem as if the Government worker is in a very different position from that of the industrial worker or the workers outside.</P>
    <P>The people who speak loudest and longest in defence of the workers are the people who flowed into the Division Lobbies on this occasion and voted against the necessary moneys to make the increases available to Government employees.  I wonder if Government employees are a different type of people, if they do not require the same type of meals or the same facilities as other workers.  It would seem the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party single them out for special attention. When called upon to meet their responsibilities in order to ensure that the necessary moneys would be available to meet the increases which had been granted as a result of trade union and other pressures, those Parties failed to respond to the call of the Government that they should go into the Division Lobbies and support the Financial Resolutions which would make the money available for this very deserving purpose.  As a trade unionist I take pride in saying that my colleagues and I went into the Division Lobbies, and <Col N="323" /> whether it was unpopular or not to vote for further taxation, we were prepared to meet our responsibilities fully in order to ensure that the Government workers got what they deserved, the increases that have been awarded to them.  We as a political Party honour our obligations to the workers. When we are called upon to impose additional taxation for the benefit of Government employees, whether they be in the Board of Works or in the Chamber or in any other Government employment, we will meet our responsibilities fully and ensure that the wage packet of the Irish worker is protected.</P>
    <P>The effort on this occasion by Labour and Fine Gael to sabotage the situation by voting against the necessary taxation shows their disregard for the workers and shows their complete disregard for everything that is honest and just.  We will measure up to our responsibilities, however difficult the task may be.  If additional taxation is necessary to meet these requirements I will never hesitate to go into the Division Lobbies to vote for the imposition of the taxation on a section of the community that can afford to pay it.  While my colleagues and I are here we will honour our obligations to Government employees and other workers.  It was regrettable on this occasion to see members of the Labour Party going into the Division Lobbies to vote against the necessary Financial Resolutions which means, in effect, they are opposing an increase to Irish workers, to workers employed in Government service.  It indicates that they feel that Irish workers in Government service have no right to these increases and that these people are to be treated as lepers or something else divorced altogether from the rest of the community when it comes to a general wage increase.  We will fully meet our obligations to the Irish workers and to the weaker sections of the community, and if it is necessary at any time to impose additional taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order. I wish to submit to you, Sir, that it is a shameful prostitution of our procedure that a Deputy should be sent <Col N="324" /> in here by the Taoiseach to repeat nine times in my presence the same sentiments for no other purpose than to waste parliamentary time.  I submit to you that that is not consistent with our rules of order and gravely reflects on the dignity, not to speak of the decency, of our procedure.</P>

      <P>This is a disgraceful display by Deputy Dillon, to indicate that the Taoiseach sent me in here to waste the time of the House.  It is a deliberate falsehood and is in keeping with many of the falsehoods that have been uttered during this debate by members of the Fine Gael Party.  I am not a party to any delaying tactics. I do not tell untruths.  Anything I say is factual.  The suggestion by Deputy Dillon that I was sent in here deliberately to use up the time of the House is completely false and erroneous. What I have said about various aspects of Government policy, the housing of our people, employment and so on, is a bitter pill for the Opposition to swallow.  I know that early on in my statement I did direct some of my remarks to the statements which have been made by Deputy Dillon on many occasions in the past and which have now become a joke.  I can well understand that he would become frustrated at this stage and try to create the erroneous impression that I was sent in here by the Taoiseach.  I came in here of my own accord to deal with the problems before this House.  We had the courage to back up our policies by going into the Division Lobbies in order to ensure that the necessary finances were available to meet the workers' claim for increases, the claims of the farmers and of the other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be intimidated by Deputy Dillon or anyone else in the Opposition. Moneys are being made available in order that the workers in the employment <Col N="325" /> of the State will get their fair reward for work done, and they should not be intimidated as they were intimidated by members of the Fine Gael Party, and particularly by the foul utterances of Deputy Lindsay in relation to a very responsible group of people here in this House, the ushers, and the various people in control of the services in the House.  As a Deputy I will not see these people trampled on by Deputy Lindsay, Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy.  We will protect the right of the ordinary employees in the Government service.  We will see that they get the increases they fully deserve, and <Col N="326" /> even if it means the imposition of taxation we will go into the Division Lobbies and vote for it, whatever the reaction may be.  We will not be put off by Deputy Dillon or by the other Deputies who have spoken here from the Fine Gael benches or by the tactics used to try to silence me.</P>
