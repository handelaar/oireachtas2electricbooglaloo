The Minister said that he referred again to the need for careful stewardship and that spending should not be allowed to rise unduly because of excessive income increases.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the fact that rateable valuations in the Dublin area have been and are being increased in numerous instances without any explanation to the people who have to meet the bill; that the system provides that appeals against such valuations are determined only once in each year; that reductions in the valuations, when they occur after successful appeals are derisory in extent; and if, in view of the generally unsatisfactory nature of the system, he will institute an appeals tribunal empowered to deal speedily with contested increases, or request the appropriate authority to do so, pending a comprehensive recasting of the entire PLV system which works against building improvement and imposes grave hardship upon sections of the community who cannot afford increased living costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixing and revision of valuations under the Valuation Acts are carried out by the Commissioner of Valuation under the statutory provisions governing the exercise of his functions in these matters.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that rateable valuations in the Dublin area have been and are being increased in numerous instances without any explanation to the people concerned.  On the contrary, I am informed that, as well as complying with the statutory requirements, the rating authorities in the area notify individual property occupiers of their revised valuations and of their rights to appeal soon after receipt of the Valuation Lists at the beginning of March. A special staff is also provided in the Valuation Office to deal with resultant inquiries from the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals against new or revised valuations are determined once each year, save where there is a further appeal to the Court.  This follows from the fact that the Valuation Lists, containing the revised valuations which may be appealed against, are issued once in each year, namely on the 1st March. Under the existing arrangements the appellant may take his appeal to the Court and may secure such relief as the Court considers appropriate.  If, on the <Col N="1411" /> average, appeal decisions do not vary considerably from the original assessment, this would indicate that most valuations had, in fact, been properly assessed.  At the same time review by the Court is available in any case where the valuation is considered excessive, and I understand that, on occasion, this has been effective to secure a substantial reduction in valuation.</P>
    <P>Appeals are determined as speedily as is possible.  The existing arrangements appear to be fair as between the valuation authorities and the ratepayer. The machinery of appeals will fall to be considered in due course with other matters arising out of the Reports of the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Finance and Taxation, including the impact of rates on various sections of the community.  I would point out to the Deputy, however, that substantial statutory rating concessions have already been granted to encourage building improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that practically every instance in his reply is contrary to the facts as made known by aggrieved ratepayers who have made representations I am sure to practically every Member of this House from time to time in regard to these matters and is he now saying in effect that there is nothing wrong with the system of levying rates and with the determination of appeals? Is he satisfied that the present method, for instance, whereby 12 months must elapse in many cases before the appeal is determined is a fair one to the ratepayers who have to wait for this and in the meantime pay the increased rates?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made mention in his reply of an interdepartmental committee which, in due course, will report on this and related matters.  Could he say what he means by &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;?  When will we get a revision of the valuation system?  Does he not agree that, in fact, the system we now have is not in accord with the demands of modern requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is or not would be a matter to be determined <Col N="1412" /> on the examination of the reports to which I have referred.  As far as the suggestion of the Deputy goes in relation to the accuracy of the answer I have given, my information is that the revised lists are made known very soon after the revisions are made, that appeals are dealt with expeditiously, but that in the case of appeals to the court it is not possible for the Dublin rating authority or anybody else to ensure expedition in the hearing of these appeals.  There is one aspect of it that the Deputy may be referring to and that is the listing of certain valuations for revision.  The Valuation Commissioner has advised the Dublin rating authority to make the people whose valuations are listed aware of that fact.  I believe that advice has not been followed but as far as the actual revisions are concerned I understand the notifying of the revisions is carried out in the ordinary course without any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the increased valuation which results in the ratepayer having to pay more rates comes into operation right away and that if there is a revision, which is usually of a very minor nature, this revision does not become effective for a considerable time and in the meanwhile the ratepayer has to pay the higher rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not pass from one year to another in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that it is the people who fix the valuation who decide on the appeal?  They are hearing an appeal against themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of income tax, inspectors make the assessment and the appeals can be taken to the Commissioners but the decision of the Commissioners can be taken to the courts.  This is the same system.  The officials of the Valuation Office fix the rateable valuation.  These are appealed to the Commissioner of Valuation but his decision is, in turn, appealable to the court.  I do not think we could devise a fairer system.</P>

      <P>The services were discontinued by the Burns and Laird line because they had become uneconomic.

      <P>Additional operating staff are being trained and more are being recruited to deal with the greatly increased volume of traffic which has led to some delay in answering callers at certain times after 6 p.m. at Dublin exchanges.</P>
      <P>The number of operators employed after 6 p.m. varies from hour to hour and from day to day; the average number employed on operating duties during the peak period each evening after 6 p.m. during the first half of this month and during the same period last year was 180.  Figures for the gross number of transactions in the exchange are not available but the number of effective trunk calls dealt with each evening during this period averaged 5,040 compared with 4,450 during the same period last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29, 30 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing authorities generally were required by the Housing Act, 1966, to assess their housing needs and prepare building programmes, initially for a period to be specified by the Minister, and subsequently at least once in every five years.  The period ending 31st March, 1971, was specified by me as the initial period.  Dublin Corporation's <Col N="1432" /> present housing programme, which was adopted by them in October, 1967, therefore, relates to that period.  Further programmes will be adopted by them in due course in respect of subsequent years.  Their statutory assessment of housing needs dated 1st July, 1967, indicated a net need, allowing for vacancies, for new units of accommodation to be provided under a building programme for the period to 31st March, 1971, of 17,219 dwellings. Their building programme for that period proposes the provision of 12,240 houses and 5,674 flats &mdash; a total of 17,914 units.  Separate figures for each year of the programme are not available.</P>
    <P>Between the date of their needs assessment, and the 30th September, 1968, the corporation had rehoused 3,261 families and provided 112 purchase houses or private sites.  At 30th September, 1968, under their programme of dwellings for renting, they had work in progress or ready to be started on 2,901 dwellings, had schemes in formulation for 2,800 dwellings on acquired sites, and were in process of acquiring sites for 5,030 dwellings.  Under their purchase houses/private sites programme they had work in progress on 636 dwellings or sites; had schemes at tender or in formulation for 1,275 houses or sites, and had acquired additional land for 7,000 houses or sites.  The gross total of these figures amounts to 23,015 dwellings or sites.  This figure will be supplemented by further dwellings, estimated to be not less than 1,800, which may become available for letting before March, 1971, through casual vacancies, in the corporation's existing housing estate, on the basis of their present average rate of vacancies.</P>
    <P>The corporation are at present carrying out a full revision of their approved waiting list on the basis of their new scheme of letting priorities under the Housing Act, 1966.  This revision will not be completed for some time.  There were 5,437 families on the approved waiting list when it was revised last December.  In the period between last December and 30th September, 1968, a total of 1,968 dwellings became available to them for letting. The corporation have, I understand, <Col N="1433" /> recently estimated that they will complete a total of 5,417 new dwellings within a two year period from the 30th September, 1968.  On this basis, and taking into account casual vacancies which will continue to arise in the existing housing estate, all families on their present approved waiting list should have been offered suitable accommodation well within that period.</P>
    <P>No housing programme can be considered adequate while any family is compelled to live in bad housing conditions. Having regard, however, to the practical limitations on what the corporation can do at any one time, I consider that the housing programme adopted by them in October, 1967, will, if fully and vigorously implemented by them, enable families on their approved waiting list as revised last December to be offered suitable accommodation within a relatively short period, make reasonable provision for other accumulated needs, and make substantial inroads on the new demands which will arise during the remaining period of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing authorities, in submitting proposals for any large housing scheme, are required to make provision for essential community facilities. I have already recommended to them, by circular letters, that in considering the suitability of housing sites regard should be had to the need to have community facilities within reasonable distances of the sites.  It is not always practicable, however, to insist on such facilities being provided at the same time as the dwellings, because many interests may be involved. Delay in providing urgently needed housing accommodation could result from such insistence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average time taken to issue copy maps over the last 12 months has been seven to eight weeks.  The reasons for the delay are (1) an increase of 20 per cent in the number of applications received as compared with the previous 12 months, (2) the continuing difficulty of recruiting and maintaining an adequate staff, and (3) the necessity, under the Land Registration Rules 1966, to issue, in many cases, 25&rdquo; scale maps which entails the enlargement <Col N="1436" /> of existing maps from 6&rdquo; to 25&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Priority continues to be given to applications of an urgent nature.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for a critical examination of the organisation and procedures in the Registry as the provision of a prompt and efficient service is one of my top priorities.  In the meantime in view of the delay in recruiting permanent mapping staff, I have arranged for the making, as a matter of urgency, of temporary appointments to fill vacancies.

I have, in fact, set up a special committee to re-examine the whole of the Land Registry procedures.  It was discovered that one of the bottlenecks occurred in the mapping section and I have given the Deputy the reasons why this bottleneck has built up.  Evidently it has been very difficult to get these mappers or draughtsmen but we have been having much more success recently with our advertisements.  I have already arranged to give priority to urgent cases which cover the type of case mentioned by the Deputy.

      <P>The Building Societies Acts do not prohibit building societies from making loans for purposes other than the purchase of private houses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the review of resources of the principal societies revealing that the amount advanced for building other than private houses being something less than eight per cent of the total.  Would he ask his Department to carry out a survey of each building society with a view to determining whether some societies do not come within that category which he has mentioned and devote up to 50 per cent of their loan resources to purposes other than housebuilding?</P>

I should say, perhaps, that in the survey that has been made regard has been had to the activities of individual societies and it would appear that one of the building societies is going beyond the average. Inquiries are being made as to the causes of this.  I have pointed out that the heading &ldquo;other purposes&rdquo; can include things which have to do with matters relating to house building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the fact that medical card holders are experiencing great hardship due to the restricted dispensing hours in many Dublin dispensaries; and what action he proposes to take to remedy the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, <Col N="1442" /> a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 to 48 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 pharmacists are employed at present in the dispensaries of the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Dublin Health Authority are authorised to employ sufficient pharmacists to cater for the needs of medical card holders in their area.  They experience difficulty at times in recruiting their full complement of staff for dispensary pharmacies but, whenever necessary, pharmacists are loaned from the Central Pharmacy to fill dispensary vacancies.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that medical card holders are experiencing great hardship due to restricted dispensing hours in many Dublin dispensaries.  The Health Authority regularly review the dispensary pharmacy services in each district and extend the hours of attendance of the pharmacists whenever necessary. The Authority introduced revised arrangements in November last whereby patients entitled to medicines may attend any one of a number of dispensaries which operate a morning and an afternoon service, if the hours of their local dispensary pharmacies are not suitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister is completely out of touch with the position in regard to the dispensaries in Dublin city.  It is a fact that these patients are experiencing extreme hardship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister investigate the hardships these people are suffering, when queues of people have to wait for three or four hours to get medicine in Dublin dispensaries?  The Minister seems to be unaware of this fact.  Will the Minister look into it to see if there are a sufficient number of pharmacists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of certain complaints last year I approached the Dublin Health Authority and had <Col N="1443" /> a fairly exhaustive investigation carried out at that time.  As I said in my reply, there were considerable improvements effected as a result of that inquiry and I most certainly will be glad at any time to carry out further investigations and I shall do so with regard to the statements now made by Deputy Dr. O'Connell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the reason for the delay is, in fact, due to the fact that the regulations do not permit county and city managers to delegate the decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to services in the Dublin area.  As the Dublin Health Authority does not issue temporary medical cards, I take it the Deputy is referring to directions issued by authorised persons under Article 16 of the General Medical Services Regulations, 1954.  These require the appropriate district medical officer to give to the person concerned, or his dependants, a general practitioner service.  I am not aware of any case where a district medical officer has failed to provide this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I wrote to him six months ago complaining that there were numbers of cases in which people who were given temporary medical cards were refused attention in dispensaries?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did bring two cases to my attention.  I am having them investigated but the investigations are not fully completed yet.  The information I have does not <Col N="1444" /> bear out the Deputy's suggestion that patients were refused medical attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been a number of instances in the city of Dublin in which persons with authorisations, commonly known as medical cards, were refused attention by the staff, who seemed unacquainted with the regulations?  In the light of that would the Minister take whatever steps are open to him to impress on such staff that these authorisations have the validity of medical cards pending examination of the particular person's case by the health authority concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to give a precise reply, valid for all parts of the country, to the Deputy's question. Inquiries made in a number of health authority areas suggest that, where a person is prompt in furnishing the necessary information, it may take about three weeks from the time a completed application form is received to consider and approve the application. Final approval has however often to be deferred pending the submission by the applicant of verification of a particular item, for example, weekly income.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Inquiries which I have made from a number of health authorities indicate that a medical card is generally not withdrawn until a decision has been made on its renewal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £292,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, including a Grant-in-Aid; and of the Public Record Office, and of the Keeper of State <Col N="1461" /> Papers and for the purchase of Historical Documents, etc.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose, as has been the practice in previous years, to treat the six Votes as one group so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise a particular point on any individual Vote.</P>
    <P>The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £11,660,000.  The total provision for the year 1967/68 was £11,668,550.  The total provision for the present year is, therefore, lower by £8,550 than the corresponding figure for last year.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice caters for the staff and services of the Department's Headquarters, and shows an increase of £13,400.  This increase is accounted for mainly by the provision of £10,000 for additional assistance that is essential to enable some of the overtaxed administrative divisions to deal more expeditiously and efficiently with the growing volume of work in such fields as criminal legislation, road traffic control, international agreements and conciliation and arbitration; and to deal with new work arising from the implementation of recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and from the centralisation in my Department as from 1st August this year of responsibility for the payment of the expenses of State witnesses in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>The balance of the increase is accounted for by normal incremental progression.</P>
    <P>The law reform activities of my Department continue to make satisfactory progress, and it is my intention, in what is of necessity a long-term programme, to give priority to the preparation of measures which are of practical importance to the general body of our citizens.</P>
    <P>The text of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1967, was circulated last May and, as the Bill will be coming up for debate on the Second Stage in the near future, I do not propose to say anything more about it now other than to mention that there has been a great deal of <Col N="1462" /> misconception and misrepresentation as to the purposes and effects of some provisions of this Bill which I hope to dispel on Second Reading.</P>
    <P>I hope to bring before the Oireachtas later this year proposals to amend and consolidate the law relating to the registration of deeds.  These proposals will include measures designed to modernise the practice and procedure in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have submitted eight interim reports, and have at my request, made available to me quite recently the portion of their ninth interim report which deals with the organisation of the district court in Dublin City and County.  In this advance section of their report, the committee recommended unanimously certain changes in the structure of the district court in Dublin City and County.  This section of the report has been circulated for the views of those affected, i.e., the Justices concerned, the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council, the local authorities and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The first of the Reports from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure dealt with the preliminary investigation of indictable offences; and the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, which came into operation on 1st August, 1967, is based on this report.</P>
    <P>Three of the interim reports deal with the jury system, and another deals with the question of increased jurisdiction for the district and circuit courts. Proposals for legislation are at present being prepared on these and other related matters, and I shall submit these proposals to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>Two reports deal with the reorganisation of the structure of the courts on the criminal side.  I hope to introduce amending legislation, based on these reports, in due course.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question of criminal law, I should mention that I have decided to examine as a matter of urgency the present law as to bail, which, as I see it, is highly unsatisfactory. I doubt very much if the protection of the liberty of the individual requires that every accused person <Col N="1463" /> must be granted bail unless there is substantial evidence that he would be likely to abscond or evade justice.  The law officers and the Garda are aware that in a great many cases of persons awaiting trial, persons, indeed, with a previous record of criminal convictions, the grant of bail is availed of to commit other crimes similar to those with which they are charged.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied from the facts placed before me by responsible police officers that in the 12 months ended 30th September, 1967, some 150 persons granted bail by the courts while awaiting trial committed over 500 fresh offences against property. The Garda authorities have pointed out to me that there must be many more of these bail cases which have not come to light.  To my mind, in this day and age of widespread crime, it is unreal not to take into account, in bail applications, the previous bad character of an accused and the views of responsible police officers that there is a likelihood of further criminal acts if the accused is on bail pending trial. In this connection it is of interest to note that, at a conference held in Lagos in 1961 under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists, it was laid down as a fundamental principle of penal law that courts and magistrates shall permit an accused person to be or to remain free pending trial except in the following cases which are deemed proper grounds for refusing bail:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of a very grave offence; (b) if the accused is likely to interfere with witnesses or impede the course of justice; (c) if the accused is likely to commit the same or other offences; (d) if the accused may fail to appear for trial.</P>
    <P>A prisoner facing a heavy sentence has little to lose if he commits further offences.  He may consider that he has to go to prison in any event and in an effort to get money may commit further offences.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Constitution imposes a specific obligation on the State by its laws to protect as best it may from <Col N="1464" /> unjust attack the life, person and property rights of every citizen.  I do not see how we as legislators can be said to be discharging this obligation if we do not take measures to ensure that the general public will be adequately protected from persons who by their criminal acts over a long period, and in particular by their continued and deliberate defiance of the law while on bail, are making nonsense of the protection which the Constitution purports to guarantee to law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not want anything I have said to suggest that I am not as anxious as anyone else to safeguard the liberty of the individual and the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings, but there is surely scope for achieving a better balance between the rights of individuals and the reasonable rights of the community in these matters.</P>
    <P>To revert to the activities of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, I should mention that the Committee's eighth interim report deals with the service of court documents by post and the fees of professional witnesses.</P>
    <P>One of the specific matters which is engaging my attention at present is the regulation of solicitors' costs.  The present system whereby solicitors' remuneration is determined by five separate statutory bodies is open to serious question.  It seems to me that the proper way to deal with the problem is to have solicitors' costs determined by a single authority.  I have in mind to provide in legislation for the appointment of a small advisory committee consisting of not more than, say, ten persons to formally advise the Minister on matters in relation to costs or charges.  I envisage also that this committee would be empowered to take evidence in public and to receive representations from the Council of the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council and from any other interested bodies or persons.  This whole question is under examination at the moment and I hope to deal with it in the proposed legislation to increase the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts.</P>
    <P>Legislation is at present being prepared <Col N="1465" /> to consolidate, amend and reform the law on compensation for malicious injuries.  Apart from revising the present system of compensation for damage to property, the Bill proposes to introduce a completely new system of compensation, as of right, for persons killed or injured while coming to the assistance of the Garda, while preventing crime or while saving life. I hope to bring this Bill before the Oireachtas before the end of the present session.</P>
    <P>I am also having legislation prepared to provide for the enforcement of foreign judgements in this country on a reciprocal basis.  There will be two Bills, one relating to maintenance and affiliation orders and the second dealing with other judgements.  Negotiations are in progress with the British and Northern Ireland authorities on both measures.  In addition, I propose to make provision in the Courts (Jurisdiction) Bill already mentioned for an increase in the maximum amount of maintenance which the district court may award to deserted wives and to empower the court to order the payment of maintenance allowances in respect of children in desertion cases.</P>
    <P>During the year the Landlord and Tenant Commission completed and presented their Report on Occupational Tenancies under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  The Government have considered and accepted in principle the recommendations in the report.  Legislation is at present being drafted to give effect to the Commission's recommendations and I hope to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas later this year.  The Bill will repeal the relevant provisions of the 1931 Act and re-enact them with the amendments proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission have also submitted their second report which deals with the question of extending the categories of persons entitled to reversionary leases and to buy out the fee simple as well as the question of whether lessees holding their dwellings from local authorities under purchase schemes should be given the right to purchase the fee simple.  I have their recommendations under examination at present with a view to <Col N="1466" /> preparing new legislation.  It may be possible to deal with these matters in the Bill on occupational tenancies.</P>
    <P>The Commission are now proceeding with their main task, which is to examine the entire body of landlord and tenant law with a view to modernising and consolidating it.  It is my hope that within the next few years it will be possible to have a comprehensive statute enacted which will repeal Deasy's Act of 1860 and the other Landlord and Tenant Acts and contain a full statement of all the statute law on this subject.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board made 1,493 orders in 1967, 315 more than in 1966, and this is the highest number ever. There has in fact been a steady increase in the number of orders being made in recent years.  The proportion of children placed by Adoption Societies was 78 per cent, slightly more than last year's 77 per cent.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the excellent work that is being done by the Adoption Societies, of whom there are 21.  Seven hundred and sixty-two of the orders made in 1967 were in respect of boys and 731 in respect of girls.  The board continue to hold sittings outside Dublin so as to facilitate prospective adopters.  Forty of the total of 98 meetings held during the year were held in various centres outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>There has been little change during the years in the number of aliens registered as being resident here for three months or more, but the influx of visitors continues to increase at a rapid rate.  More than 116,000 alien visitors came here in 1967 from places other than Britain or Northern Ireland as compared with 96,000 in 1966. Those figures do not, of course, include Irish citizens or British subjects.  The increasing number of foreign visitors coming here creates problems for the immigration service.  These problems are, however, under constant review by my Department in consultation with the other Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1967, 57 persons were naturalised as compared with 79 in 1966.  This brings the total of all persons naturalised since 1935, when provision for naturalisation was made, to 2,617.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> In 1967 the Film Censor examined 983 films with a total footage of 3,118,293.  The number of films examined by the Censor in 1966 was 1,016 and the footage examined in that year was 3,084,525.</P>
    <P>Of the total of 983 films which the Censor examined in 1967, 890 were passed, 71 were passed with cuts and 22 were rejected.  He issued 86 limited certificates which were not the subject of appeals.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Films Appeal Board examined 31 films.  Six of the appeals related to &ldquo;limited certificates&rdquo; issued by the Censor.  Ten films were rejected by the Appeal Board. one was passed without cuts for general viewing and ten were passed for limited viewing, eight of them with cuts.  In the case of the six appeals against the limited certificates issued by the censor, four were passed for general viewing and two were passed for limited viewing.</P>
    <P>In all, 99 films were passed for viewing on &ldquo;limited certificates&rdquo;, i.e., conditions were inserted prohibiting their exhibition to audiences under a stated age&mdash;the particular age being specified in each &ldquo;limited certificate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publication Board examined 309 books and five periodicals in 1967.  Fourteen books were examined as a result of formal complaints from members of the public and 295 books were referred to the board by officers of customs and excise. The board made 175 prohibition orders in respect of books and one in respect of a periodical.</P>
    <P>Appeals were lodged with the Censorship of Publications Appeals Board in respect of three books.  Two of the appeals were successful and consideration of the third is no longer necessary as the prohibition order made in respect of it has now expired under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967, which became law on 11th July, 1967. That Act provides for a time limit of 12 years for prohibition orders made in respect of books on the ground that they are indecent or obscene and it revoked the provision in the 1946 Act that required an appeal against a prohibition <Col N="1468" /> order in respect of a book to be taken within 12 months.</P>
    <P>Transfers of testamentary documents from the Principal and District Probate Registries and from the Courts were temporarily suspended in October, 1966, owing to building operations on the two-storey extension to the Public Record Office to provide additional accommodation for the Land Registry.  Some testamentary and other miscellaneous documents have, however, been acquired since then.</P>
    <P>The Irish Manuscripts Commission is continuing its work on the preparation for publication of the Calendar to the Council Book of 1581-'86, the list of political prisoners in Kilmainham Jail during the period 1789 to 1910, the two 16th century Munster surveys and the Record Commissioners' calendars of inquisitions for the 16th and 17th century Convert Rolls.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the Garda Síochána Vote.  This shows an increase of £7,000 on the provision in the previous year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £78,000 in subhead A&mdash;salaries, wages and allowances.  This increase arises mainly from the provision made for the appointment of traffic wardens as authorised by the Road Traffic Act, 1968, to carry out certain traffic duties connected with parking offences. The first batch of 20 wardens took up duty in Dublin at the beginning of October, the present number is 40, and I expect that by the end of the year the number will have risen to over 100.  I am happy to say that the introduction of the new group has gone smoothly and that public reaction has been favourable.</P>
    <P>I am also making arrangements to have typing and minor clerical work at the larger stations carried out by suitably qualified female personnel, thus making it possible to release Gardaí for outdoor police duties for which they are urgently needed.  There is an additional provision of £18,000 in this subhead to meet increases in the rates of boot allowance, plain clothes allowance, detective allowance and transport and training allowances which have been granted in accordance <Col N="1469" /> with recommendations by the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £31,000 in subhead B&mdash;travelling and incidental expenses.  This is due mainly to the progressive improvement and extension of the radio service which has been taking place for some years and will continue.</P>
    <P>The provision for Post Office services &mdash;subhead C&mdash;is up by over £50,000. This is due to the fact that there are outstanding charges for postal services for which provision has to be made this year.</P>
    <P>The provision for superannuation&mdash; subhead G&mdash;shows an increase of £48,000.  This is due to an increase in the number of pensioners and to the increase that was granted in pensions from 1st August, 1967.</P>
    <P>The provision for Appropriations in Aid shows an increase of £197,000. This increase will come from the Road Fund to meet the rapidly rising costs of pay and equipment of the Garda Síochána engaged on road traffic duties. The increased provision will also cover the pay of the new traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>The present Estimate for the Garda Síochána does not make provision for the 9 per cent salary increase recently granted to all ranks up to and including Chief Superintendent with effect from 1st June, 1968.  This increase is on the same basis as the eleventh-round increases in the public services generally.</P>
    <P>I have recently set up, at the request of the Garda Síochána Joint Representative Body, a Commission to inquire into and make recommendations to me in relation to Garda remuneration and conditions of service. We have been fortunate in obtaining for the Commission the voluntary services of four eminent persons under the chairmanship of Judge Conroy, and I should like to record my appreciation of their willingness to devote their skills and time to this onerous assignment.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a policy statement shortly after my appointment as Minister for Justice.  I am engaged in a review of the present organisation and distribution of the Garda Síochána.  It is clear that, if our police service is to <Col N="1470" /> maintain or improve on its standards of service, its strength must be increased fairly substantially or the existing structure must be overhauled so that the distribution of the force will reflect the needs of each locality and, in particular, requirements in relation to serious crime.  As the annual cost of the force now stands at about £10,000,000 and as every additional Garda would cost a taxpayer about £1,000 a year, it is absolutely essential to make the best use of our existing manpower.  All the members must be used to the best advantage in the prevention and detection of crime, the preservation of the peace and the handling of the serious problems arising from the huge increase in the number of vehicles on our roads, etc. It is estimated that, apart from Gardaí who are engaged full-time on road traffic duties, almost one-half of the time of the force as a whole is taken up on these duties.  A review of the manpower situation is, therefore, a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is important also to keep under constant review the question of providing the force with up-to-date equipment. The mechanisation of the force is proceeding at a steady rate.  There are now 272 motor-cars and 219 motor-cycles in the Garda fleet, as against 169 cars and 19 motor-cycles 10 years ago.  I have already mentioned the provision for additional radio equipment. There has been a three-fold expansion in the radio service in the past four years.  This expansion has brought the service to many provincial towns throughout the country.  Personal pocket radios, which have been introduced in Dublin, have been a great success.  This service will be intensified in Dublin and expanded to other large centres in the near future.</P>
    <P>Modern office equipment of various kinds is also being provided.  This includes an electronic punch-card system which should improve the efficiency of the Central Criminal Records Office. An up-to-date copier is being provided which will facilitate the keeping of criminal records and the supplying of information from Headquarters to the Gardaí at local level.  A number of portable recording units are also being obtained.  These will replace the traditional <Col N="1471" /> notebooks in the case of Gardaí who have to make on-the-spot records at the scene of crimes and traffic accidents.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that in 1967 the crime figures increased again.  In the year ended 30th September, 1967, 20,558 indictable offences were recorded as against 19,029 in the previous year. The next highest figures were in 1964 (17,700) and in 1943 (17,305).</P>
    <P>Of the total of 20,558 indictable offences, 12,170 were committed in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and 8,388 in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The increase in crime gives me cause for serious concern.  It is, nevertheless, true that the incidence of indictable crime in this country is still low by comparison with what is happening in many other countries in Europe and further afield.  It is a cause for satisfaction that our detection rate still continues at the high level of 64 per cent, which is away beyond what is achieved in any other country the statistics of which we have studied.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would remind the House that larcenies, generally, even where the value of the money or goods stolen is trivial, are indictable offences.  The figures for indictable crime are invariably swollen by, for instance, larcenies of pedal bicycles, for which, incidentally, it is very difficult to get evidence against the culprits. In 1967, 1,936 bicycles were reported as stolen and proceedings were instituted in 316 cases only.</P>
    <P>Those convicted of indictable crimes last year numbered 9,521 and of this total 31 per cent were under 17 and 57 per cent under 21 years of age.  The comparable figure for 1966 was 9,220, of whom 34 per cent were under 17 and 59 per cent under 21.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 30th September, 1967, the number of persons charged with summary offences was 164,068 as compared with 150,213 in 1966, a steep rise which is in accordance with the trend of recent years.  Road traffic offences continue to constitute by far the greatest category&mdash;some 123,000 persons were prosecuted for road traffic offences in 1967.  Nearly 97,000 fine-on-the-spot notices were issued for contraventions of the parking bye-laws <Col N="1472" /> and similar offences and in slightly less than 15,000 of those cases there were prosecutions.  In the Road Traffic Act, 1968, provision has been made for the taking over of &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; duties from the Gardaí by a special corps of wardens.  This will permit the Gardaí to concentrate on their primary duty of detecting and preventing serious crime.  A number of wardens have already been recruited and have taken up duty in Dublin city.  Further appointments will be made.</P>
    <P>No difficulty has been met in the operation of the statutory arrangements for the backing of Irish warrants of arrest in Britain and Northern Ireland, and for the backing of British and Northern Ireland warrants here.  In 1967, 128 warrants, 23 of them from Northern Ireland, were received for execution here and 83 warrants were issued from here, nine of them to Northern Ireland.  So far no warrants have been received from any of the other countries who are parties to the European Convention on Extradition, nor have any warrants issued from this country to any of them.</P>
    <P>Before I pass on from this Vote the House will no doubt be interested to know that since the 1st August, 1968, a simpler and more direct method of payment of the expenses of State witnesses in criminal prosecutions has been in operation.  The previous method of payment was unsatisfactory involving as it did three Departments of State, local authorities, the Chief State Solicitor, local State Solicitors, County Registrars and the Garda Síochána.  Under the new system the bulk of witnesses claims are paid locally by the Garda Síochána and a relatively small number of contentious claims are referred to my Department for payment.  This has had the effect of expediting payment and will ultimately relieve local authorities and all others of any responsibilities in the matter. From the 1st April next year these expenses will be borne by the Garda Síochána Vote.</P>
    <P>The next item in the list of Estimates, the Vote for Prisons, is for a sum of £449,000 which shows a net decrease of £9,500 in the Vote for <Col N="1473" /> 1967/68.  The changes in the Vote as compared with the previous financial year are in the main reflected in subheads B and C where increases in the cost of victualling, clothing, fuel, etc., due to an anticipated increase in the prison population, and additional requirements for escort and travelling, as aresult of higher transport charges and subsistence rates, are more than off-set by a decrease in the provision for the maintenance of prisoners in district mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is also a decrease of £2,000 in the provision for materials for the manufacturing department and farm: stocks in hand make it possible to reduce purchase of materials below that which would normally be necessary. The saving in the financial requirements for the maintenance of prisoners in district mental hospitals is the result of a ruling of the Supreme Court that the statutory provisions, which enabled the Minister for Justice to transfer to district mental hospitals from prisons persons who had been certified to be insane while on remand in custody from the district court, were legally operative only in respect of the period of remand ordered by the court and that persons so removed and detained in hospital after the expiry of the period of remand ceased to remain within the jurisdiction of the court.  As a consequence of this ruling the maintenance of a number of patients in the hospitals ceased to be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for a daily average population of 580, as against 570 in 1967-68.  The increased provision is due mainly to the impact on daily inmate figures of the larger numbers of offenders receiving long or fairly long term sentences.  As compared with the year 1966 there was an increase of 95 in the number of offenders who were given sentences of imprisonment or detention of six months and upwards in 1967, the figures being 846 and 751 respectively.</P>
    <P>The total number of committals of persons under both sentences of imprisonment and of detention in St. Patrick's Institution during 1967 was 2,789 as against 2,528 for 1966.  Of this number of 2,789, 833 were young <Col N="1474" /> male offenders in the 16 to 21 age group, of whom 635 were sentenced to detention and 198 were committed to prison.</P>
    <P>This shows an increase of six over 1966 when 616 youths received sentences of detention while 211 others were sent to prison.  The increase is small in itself and might indeed be taken to reflect favourably on our preventive measures to combat juvenile crime when regard is had to the increasing population in the young adult age groups: according to the census returns, the number of young males between 17 years and 21 years had increased from 82,000 in 1960 to 99,000 in 1966.</P>
    <P>Because of inadequate accommodation it was not possible to transfer from prisons to St. Patrick's young offenders who might derive more benefit from treatment in the latter institution and this has made it necessary to explore further the question of additional or alternative accommodation for the inmates of St. Patrick's Institution. Moreover, the pressure on space in St. Patrick's has not made it possible to segregate inmates to the extent that one would like and has inhibited improvements in the institution's educational, vocational and recreational activities. Up to the present, the efforts which have been made to obtain a suitable site within reasonable distance of Dublin for the erection of a new St. Patrick's have met with no success. Some improvement in the situation materialised in August of this year, when a State property in Shanganagh, which had until then been used as a residential college, was made available to my Department.  The buildings stand in some twenty acres of ground and with some minor structural adaptations can accommodate 50 to 60 boys.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to operate the new undertaking as a training centre for suitable first offenders and for selected long term inmates who show promise of improvement and of responding to guidance.  What I have in mind is that training will be imparted in building construction, woodwork, decorating, vehicle driving and horticulture, which will help the boys to secure and retain worthwhile employment on release. Already a start has been made there <Col N="1475" /> with compensatory education to overcome the more obvious results of neglected schooling.</P>
    <P>Instruction in woodwork has commenced also under the guidance of a vocational teacher.  Vocational instruction will be extended shortly to some of the other skills I have outlined. There are now about 30 boys in residence and this number is gradually being increased to the full complement. The whole project is still only at a developing stage and legislation will probably be necessary to put the project on a long term formal basis, but by next year I expect that my hopes for Shanganagh will have materialised to the full.</P>
    <P>The availability of this additional accommodation will allow of the introduction of a re-planned educational programme for St. Patrick's itself involving the appointment of an educational psychologist and the employment of additional instruction staff, aided by a corps of voluntary workers with teaching experience.  In the latter connection I am pleased to record my appreciation of an offer, which I have gladly accepted, from the students of St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, to participate in providing compensatory teaching.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the prison welfare work and analogous services continue to operate satisfactorily. During 1967, as a result of the efforts of the prison staff and the prison welfare officers, employment during their sentences was secured for 26 prisoners who were granted daily temporary release to take up the employment obtained for them.  The earnings of these prisoners in respect of their pre-discharge employment, after deductions for tax, insurance, etc., amounted to £2,250 approximately.  A sum of £739 was contributed to their dependants; £444 was spent on tools and equipment, travelling between prison and places of employment and out of pocket expenses; expenses for special hostel meals and comforts accounted for £555, leaving something over £500 for the prisoners themselves on discharge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> In St. Patrick's Institution 35 inmates were granted daily temporary release for employment while serving their sentences of detention and, with one exception, all the inmates fulfilled the conditions of their temporary release. In addition to release for employment, temporary release was granted to 26 prisoners and to 39 inmates of St. Patrick's during the year for other purposes&mdash;Christmas holidays, domestic difficulties, family illnesses, interviews for employment, driving tuition; 12 inmates qualified as drivers during the year.</P>
    <P>The development of the probation and after-care service on a voluntary basis is, thanks to the willing co-operation of the community at large and particularly the well-known charitable and religious organisations, also progressing in a most satisfactory manner. Voluntary workers are now available in upwards of 100 centres outside Dublin to give assistance to the courts in the supervision of young offenders and to help in the after-care of those discharged from industrial and reformatory schools and penal institutions.</P>
    <P>In this connection I wish to mention particularly a project of the Cork Council of St. Vincent de Paul, namely, the establishment of a probation hostel for homeless boys or boys from bad or broken homes.  The presence of this hostel has made it possible for the local courts to make probation orders with a residential condition in suitable cases where otherwise the alternative would have been to commit them to institutions.  An annual grant of £750 is now being paid to this council.</P>
    <P>Another project which is proving its worth is the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme.  The scheme which has been operating for some time in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford has now been extended to Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford. Since the scheme started in September, 1963 and up to the end of last September, 3,124 juveniles had come under the care and supervision of the Gardaí participating in the work.  Of this number, 345 or 11 per cent have since become involved in further offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Apart from the numbers of the Garda force attached to the juvenile liaison unit, a large number of Gardaí continue to participate in a most praiseworthy and voluntary way in the organisation and day to day running of over 200 boys' clubs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to let this occasion pass without recording my indebtedness to the statutory visiting committees, the recognised societies engaged in welfare work, the voluntary organisations, the many private individuals and the employers whose generous efforts and ready co-operation proved so helpful a factor in the discharge of my responsibilities for the treatment of prisons offenders.</P>
    <P>The next Vote is that for the courts. At £609,000 it shows a net decrease of £7,000 over the year 1967/68.  The gross vote shows an increase of £11,550 which is accounted for by a small increase in district court staff, normal increments and an increase in mileage allowances.  This increase is offset by an increase in appropriations-in-aid due to an increase in receipts from fines and fees.</P>
    <P>The Rules Committees of the District Court, Circuit Court and Superior Court have been busy during the past year.  The District Court Rules Committee continues its major task in connection with a general revision of the existing district court rules and additionally, with my concurrence, made the District Court (Criminal Procedure Act, 1967) Rules 1967 setting out the procedure to be followed in the preliminary examination of indictable offences under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court Rules Committee made the Circuit Court Rules (No. 2) 1967 prescribing new scales of costs and fees and the Circuit Court Rules (No. 3) 1967 providing for an increase in costs in certain cases settled before entry.  The Rules received my concurrence. The Committee have also drafted new Circuit Court Rules on contentious business for the purposes of the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>The Superior Courts Rules Committee made the Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 2), 1967, providing for a <Col N="1478" /> number of miscellaneous amendments to existing Rules and revision of costs in certain cases.  Those Rules received my concurrence.  The committee have drafted two sets of rules dealing respectively with contentious and noncontentious probate business, which are necessary under the Succession Act, 1965.  These are being examined in consultation with the committee and in conjunction with draft rules on contentious business submitted by the Circuit Court Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>I should like again to pay a special tribute to the judges of the several Courts who are voluntarily assisting the work of the Department of Justice in what I might describe as personal, non-judicial capacities.  I refer to the judges and justices who are serving on the Bankruptcy Committee, the Censorship of Films Appeal Board, the Censorship of Publications Board and its Appeal Board, the Committee inquiring into Court Practice and Procedures, the Commission inquiring into the law relating to landlord and tenant and ground rents, a committee formed during the year under review which is making inquiries relating to reform of substantive law and the committee of inquiry into the pay and conditions of service of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The extent to which I am indebted to the Judiciary in these respects is very great.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 24 is that for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  The figure of £299,000 for the year 1968-69 represents a decrease of £12,800 as compared with 1967-68.  The decrease is accounted for mainly by the replacement of senior by junior officers and by a decrease in Post Office charges.</P>
    <P>As forecast last year, the reversal in 1966 of the progressively upward trend in the volume of business coming into the Land Registry in recent years was short-lived.  Business, in almost all the various categories handled by the Registry, increased again in 1967, and is continuing to increase in the current year.  Dealings, for example, which had fallen from a record figure of 37,052 in 1965 to 33,875 in 1966 rose again in 1967 to 34,693.  The indications are that the intake of dealings this year will be of the order of 40,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> In the case of the Registry of Deeds the progressively upward trend in the number of registrations which had declined in 1965 and 1966 was also resumed in 1967, the number being 29,446 as compared with 27,879 in 1965 and 25,411 in 1966.  Applications for searches also continued to increase, the figure for 1967 being 5,463 as compared with 5,324 in 1966.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of additional accommodation to meet the needs of the Land Registry in the years immediately ahead, the construction work on a two-storey extension over the Public Record Office which commenced in May, 1966, has been completed and the new building is now in the process of being occupied.  This should solve fully the problem of accommodation.  There remain, however, the difficulties of recruiting and maintaining the necessary staff in all the branches of the Land Registry, with the result that delays are still giving rise to some complaints.  I have arranged for a critical examination of the organisation and procedures in the Land Registry as the provision of a prompt and efficient service is one of my top priorities.</P>
    <P>The final Vote makes provision for the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The estimate for 1968-69 is £13,000, that is £350 more than the total provided for this service in 1967-68. The increase is accounted for principally by normal incremental progression.</P>
    <P>The useful and valuable work of the Commissioners continued during the year.  Cash amounting to £30,455 and stocks to the value of £17,635 were transferred to the Commissioners during the year 1967, and on 31st December last the nominal value of investments standing in their name was £2,064,295.</P>
    <P>It remains for me to express my sincere thanks to the members of the various voluntary boards and commissions which are associated with my Department for their valuable services during the year.  One of the things that impressed me deeply since my appointment as Minister for Justice is the extent of this unpaid public service <Col N="1480" /> and the manner in which persons concerned carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to share in the sentiments expressed in the last few sentences of the Minister's remarks.  It is well that not only the House but the public should know of the voluntary services rendered by these boards, commissions and committees, the members of which are very often extremely busy in their professions.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the new Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Commissioner Weymes, on his appointment.  In doing so, I should also like to put on the records of this House a small tribute to the outgoing Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Carroll, who has retired.  Mr. Carroll could be described as one of the founder members of the Garda Síochána, a man who went into the service in the early days of the State and who undoubtedly was a very dedicated and devoted public servant and police officer.  By his attention not only to the affairs of the Force, so far as the question of the preservation of law and order was concerned, but by his attention to and interest in the sporting and recreational activities which are associated with the Force he did immeasurable good during his term of office.  It is only right that someone should record our appreciation of the magnificant service he gave to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, on the fiftieth anniversary of Easter Week, many people took a look behind them, took a look at the past and pointed out the faults and failures which had occurred during the half century since Easter Week.  It was a good and a salutary exercise but we should not overlook the fact that one of the best, if not always the most fully appreciated, success stories of this State was the establishment, the subsequent growth and development of an unarmed police force here, the Garda Síochána.  Their job, of course, is to preserve law and order and to do that impartially. Everyone will agree with me that down <Col N="1481" /> through the years since the establishment of the Garda we have been remarkably lucky, &ldquo;remarkably&rdquo; because of our past history for the reasons, which are historical now, that the inclination of the people of this country would have been towards antagonism and hostility to the then police force.  Notwithstanding that history, which might have become ingrained in some of us, there have been extremely good relations between the Garda and the public.  It would be a great pity, indeed, a tragedy, if anything were to occur which would disturb that sense of confidence which the people have in Garda and the co-operation which the Garda get from the people and are, I think, entitled to expect from the people.  In this connection I want to say that it is up to all of us and up to the public at large to play our part and their part in upholding not only the authority but the kind of respect which exists and has existed throughout for the Garda Síochána as a force.  I have read recently, and I have here with me, some remarks in what would be, I suppose, the editorial of the <i>Garda Review</i> for the month of June last and it seems to me that there must be in the force today at least some doubt as to whether the happy relations which have existed are going to continue unimpeded, because this article starts off by saying:</P>
    <P>For some time now the Garda Síochána have been under a systematic and well organised attack from a small but increasingly active and mischievous faction.  Some people prefer to use the word sinister in describing this small group.  The imported term, police brutality, has been flung about by members of this group on various occasions, from different directions.</P>
    <P>Later on in the course of this article it is stated:</P>
    <P>We are concerned, however, at what appears to be an organised anti-police campaign in existence here.  Several times recently, the same persons purporting to support popular and sympathy-evoking causes have taunted, baited and tried deliberately to antagonise Gardaí <Col N="1482" /> who were carrying out their duty. The same people would appear to be sympathetic to a variety of causes, some simulated, which they manage to engineer in order to bring them into direct conflict with members of the Force who are trying to maintain law and order.</P>
    <P>This is the particular portion of the article that I want to refer to because it is essential that it should be heeded. The article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We think the public should be aware of this campaign.  We are the servants of the public from whom, ultimately, we take our directions and whose interests we are here to protect.</P>
    <P>It goes on later to say:</P>
    <P>We believe that a &ldquo;red&rdquo; influence, much of it carefully cultivated among our emigrants in Britain, is trying to spread to organisations in this country.  The representatives of this sinister ideology have infiltrated some existing organisations which promoted popular and deserving causes.  They are attempting, we believe, to infiltrate community development and co-operative movements which they may use later as a base.</P>
    <P>I want to say in connection with an appeal of that sort appearing in such a responsible magazine as the <i>Garda Review</i> that it is a matter which not merely this House but which the members of the public should pay heed to. We have had an extremely good police force in this country and we still have. We have had a police force which has in difficult times in the past carried out extremely well its function of the maintenance of law and order and has done that on an impartial basis.  If the members of the Garda Síochána feel that it is necessary through an article such as this appering in the <i>Garda Review</i> to, so to speak, look to the public for help and understanding, then it is up to those of us in public life who appreciate the worth and the value of the Garda force in this country to underscore the appeal that has been made by them and to recommend it to the public in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> With regard to some of the more detailed matters dealt with by the Minister in his statement, towards the end of it he referred to a point I intended raising.  It is the question of delays in dealings in the Land Registry. I want to say, talking for a moment as a legal practitioner, that I find the very greatest courtesy and efficiency among the personnel working in the Land Registry.  I find that they are willing to do whatever they can to assist legal practitioners and to assist members of the public with whom they have to deal.  But, as the Minister has mentioned in his statement, it is frustrating at times to encounter the delays that take place.  I know of a particular case with which I was dealing where a matter was lodged in January last and has not yet been completed.  From recollection, it is a question of first registration.  I am not raising this by way of complaint but I am giving it as an example of the kind of thing that leads to frustration among legal practitioners. Naturally, clients, when they have left a thing with a solicitor, regard it as finished; and if a solicitor has to report in six, eight or ten months time that it still has not gone through the Land Registry I do not blame clients if they do not feel inclined to accept that as an excuse.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned and those of us who go down near the Four Courts know that the building programme for the Land Registry has been completed.  However, he mentions in his statement: &ldquo;There remain, however, the difficulties of recruiting and maintaining the necessary staff in all the branches of the Land Registry, with the result that delays are still giving rise to some complaints.&rdquo;  I would like to know, because I do not understand it, why there is difficulty in recruiting and maintaining the necessary staff.  Is the difficulty a financial one because if it is, speaking for myself in any event, I would feel that this House should vote whatever additional money is necessary to overcome it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make this quite clear: I do not consider that the kind of work which the legal assistants and examiners in the Land Registry have <Col N="1484" /> to do is the kind of work that can be rushed unnecessarily.  I do not think that you can require a legal assistant or an examiner in the Land Registry to fill a particular quota of cases in any given period, whether it is a day or a week or a month, because cases are going to vary enormously as regards the length of time required to examine them.  They will vary enormously as regards difficulties that may be incurred concerning title and other technical matters.  I do not think you can eliminate, or reasonably expect to eliminate, delays that might be incurred in cases requiring examination of title in the Land Registry by requiring the present personnel either to do more work or work faster.  You cannot ask people to do more than they would be supposed to do in legal practice outside the Land Registry so that the difficulty seems, as the Minister has pointed out, to be the difficulty of recruiting the necessary additional personnel to avoid delays that occur.  If the difficulty is a financial one, if the terms being offered to professional or other people required for service in the Land Registry are not sufficiently attractive I would urge the Minister to look for more money and see to it that sufficiently attractive terms are proposed in order to get the necessary additional staff.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, who was a practising solicitor, is very well aware of this problem but I am not sure that the public are aware of it.  A problem arises from the fact that so far as Land Registry transfers are concerned the transfers are only effective from the time of registration.  This is completely different from the procedure in the Registry of Deeds.  I know that once a transfer is registered the efficacy and validity date back to the time of the application but there is a procedure in the Land Registry when dealing with registered land that if a transfer is taking place there is a vendor and a purchaser and on completion of the sale the purchaser pays over his money and that is all as far as he is concerned. His money is gone and he gets in exchange the transfer but until that is registered it is not effective.</P>
    <P>If there are delays in the Land Registry, if there are investigations <Col N="1485" /> there&mdash;and obviously there must be, once a State guaranteed title is being given in cases of compulsory registration&mdash;that is all right but if something turns up which is a flaw in the title, it does not get the person back his money.  I should like the Minister who has had some personal experience of these matters to consider whether it would be possible to set up some system in the Land Registry whereby you could have an intermediate stage before full registration with a State-backed title.  Before that takes place, if you could have some procedure such as that in the Registry of Deeds so that you could go along to the Land Registry and register there your transfer subject to any requisitions that may subsequently be raised in the Land Registry at least it would have the force and effect of registration and of validity as between the vendor and purchaser.  Something on those lines might be possible and would relieve the pressure that will be there until something like that is done.  If some system like that could be operated then, as between vendor and purchaser, the pressure would be off and everyone would know that the transfer had been lodged in the Land Registry and that it was effective subject to whatever requisitions the Land Registry might decide to raise in connection with it.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask the Minister how the Act popularly called the Ground Rents Act is operated.  The impression is that it is in danger of becoming a dead letter.  I know that ground rents are being purchased under the Act, that some cases have gone for arbitration and have been dealt with by the County Registrar in Dublin and I assume by county registrars elsewhere but I have the impression, which I would like the Minister to correct if it is wrong, that in many cases potential purchasers of their ground rents, people who want to buy out the fee simple in their property under the Ground Rents Act, are finding that title difficulties in some cases are too enormous to enable them to tackle the purchase of a comparatively small ground rent without becoming involved in great expense.</P>
    <P>Once or twice I suggested to the <Col N="1486" /> Minister's predecessor that it would be worth while to consider, in order to allow the Act to operate fully and effectively, introducing some provision whereby a declaratory title could be obtained, where the owner of the ground rent, the person selling it, has been in undisputed possession for a particular period.  There should be some stereotyped form of declaration which would be accepted and acceptable with, so-to-speak, official backing, which would eliminate to a great extent the very rigorous and searching investigation and trouble that is frequently necessary now in some ground rent cases where the root of title is back in the dim and distant past.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister referred to the position of county registrars in his statement and I would like to raise it.  I understand that they are seeking an increase in their salaries and it seems that they have an extremely strong case to make to the Minister. The Minister and the House are aware that the judiciary and all its branches obtained fairly substantial salary increases from April last.  It is accepted and, I think, always has been that county registrars are in effect judicial officers.  It is not an exaggeration to say that many of their functions nowadays&mdash;and, indeed, this House has put additional functions on their shoulders in recent years, including functions under the Ground Rents Act that I have been referring to&mdash;are at least quasi-judicial in nature.  For example, under the Ground Rents Act they are required to act as arbitrators.  <i>Vis-à-vis</i> the district justices, the salary scales of county registrars have remained stationary while those of district justices, which used to be less than those of county registrars, have increased and may increase in future but they have been substantially increased as recently as last April while those of county registrars have remained stationary.</P>
    <P>It is usually argued that one of the reasons why it is necessary to pay good salaries to members of the judiciary, whether they be district justices, circuit court judges or judges of the High Court or of the Supreme Court is in order to attract the best, in order to <Col N="1487" /> attract good men and also that it is essential that their independence should be safeguarded.  I would urge on the Minister that those considerations are just as valid when applied to county registrars as they are in the case of the judiciary.  Remember&mdash;this is a matter that is of special interest to Members of this House &mdash; county registrars throughout the country not only act as sheriffs but act as returning officers for elections and this is quite apart from what I called earlier their quasi-judicial functions.  They are required to act as returning officers in elections and it should be of interest to every Member of the House to ensure that in relation to discharging that task, apart from any other tasks that they have to do, they are in a position of independence. I would ask the Minister at least to give very sympathetic consideration to the position of county registrars in their application for an increase.  I feel, and I hope I am not wrong in this, that so far as the Minister himself is concerned I am probably pushing an open door in making that plea but I am hoping that the remarks I have made on the subject may be of some help to the Minister in making the case with his colleagues in the Government on behalf of the county registrars.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to ask the Minister about because it is a matter that I have raised here before.  It may be that it is covered in the legislation which the Minister forecast in his opening statement.  It is with regard to the necessity of lodging parchment memorials in the Registry of Deeds.  I took this matter up also with the Minister's predecessor and I understood&mdash;whether I was correct or not I do not know&mdash;that we were on the brink of departing from the necessity of having to lodge memorials on parchment in the Registry of Deeds and that there was a prospect that in the near future it would be possible either to lodge a full copy or certified copy of the document rather than have to go on with this procedure.  I should like the Minister, if he can, to confirm that that is the position.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to let the House know how the free legal aid <Col N="1488" /> legislation is working out and if he could conveniently let us know the number of applications made for free legal aid and, generally, how the scheme is working and what the cost of it is.</P>
    <P>I am glad to notice, as far as I could hear, that there was no mention made in the Minister's statement this year of closing down the Garda stations.  In fact, I think the Minister referred to the necessity or desirability of increasing the number of men in the Force.  I simply want to say, as I did on the occasion of the Estimate last year, that if it is desirable to increase the number of members of the Garda Síochána for the prevention or detection of crime and to carry out the work that it is necessary for the gardaí to do, I do not think the Minister should hesitate in trying to increase the numbers in the Force.</P>
    <P>The Minister did refer to the crime figures and said that he was concerned about them.  On page 13 of his brief he dealt with the question of crime and said that the increase in crime gave him cause for serious concern.  It is no wonder that it does because, as the Minister has mentioned, for the year ended 30th September, 1967, the total number of indictable offences came to 20,558 as against 19,029 in the previous year.  I think I am correct in saying that summary offences also showed an increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister, quite correctly, refers then to the fact that the detection rate continues at the high level of 64 per cent.  It is not as one who wishes to carp but simply to record the fact because I think it is rather disturbing, that I say that while the Minister is right in referring to the detection rate as being high at a level of 64 per cent, I think I am correct in saying that that, in fact, is a drop on the detection rate in previous years.  For the year 1966, the detection rate was 66 per cent and in 1965 it was as high as 70 per cent. So that, while the 64 per cent to which the Minister referred is high, nevertheless, it shows a drop and it may be that more modern equipment is required. The Minister has referred to the question of equipment but I am still a firm believer in the efficacy of <Col N="1489" /> the man-on-the-beat, particularly in rural areas, and no question of shortage of manpower in the Garda should be allowed to hinder the Gardaí in either the prevention or the detection of crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also, towards the end of his speech, to the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  I think it is a sergeant and eight or nine Gardaí and a couple of Ban-ghardaí who implement that scheme in the Dublin area anyhow and I should like again, as I did on previous occasions, to compliment them on the success of the scheme and the way it is operating.  I think I am correct in saying that, generally speaking, the scheme applies to people who are under the age of 17 who have committed a minor offence in the stealing or larceny line, who admit it and who have not been in trouble previously with the Garda; and provided the parents co-operate and the injured person has no objection these people, instead of being dragged through the courts, even though it might only be the juvenile court, can be dealt with on the basis of a caution administered by the officers operating the scheme. This is an excellent thing.  The low figures the Minister quoted in his statement of the number of juveniles who subsequently got into trouble having been dealt with under the scheme, about 11 per cent, show how successful the scheme has been.  All of us would feel that not only is this a humane way of dealing with matters but one which, so to speak, pays dividends to the community, because instead of people who are not criminals, who are not going to be criminals, certainly if they are handled properly, being brought to the courts and having all the pain and the turmoil associated with that in their minds and in the minds of their parents and members of the family, they are dealt with by means of care, supervision and caution under this scheme.  As I say, it is an excellent scheme.  It is operating well, and the tribute that the Minister paid to it is a well deserved one.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters I should like to raise by way of query to the Minister.  I should like to know how the fines-on-the-spot scheme is progressing, whether it is felt it is one that <Col N="1490" /> has been worthwhile introducing and what effect it has had in speeding up court work in the district court.  I should like to know, if the Minister has the figure available, what it has meant in cash to the Revenue.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister in a general way what he or his Department or the Government are doing to prepare for the harmonisation of legislation with the EEC countries in the event of this country becoming a member of the Common Market; and specifically I should like to know how do the Government propose to secure implementation of Community regulations which are binding in every respect and are directly applicable, I think, to each member State.  This is a matter which must have been examined by the Minister's Department and the House should know what is contemplated in that direction.  I know it is an unpopular word with the Government in these days but I should like to know will it be necessary to have a referendum to alter the Constitution in any way in connection with EEC membership should it come about.  A discussion on those lines could take a long time, but, perhaps, the Minister would indicate generally the lines on which the Government are travelling in that direction and what Constitutional amendment, if any, would be necessary in the event of this country achieving membership.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister &mdash;I am not sure whether it is his function or that of the Taoiseach; I rather think it is the Minister's&mdash;whether any consideration has been given to the question of repealing the resolution declaring a state of national emergency which was passed by the Oireachtas as far back as 3rd September, 1939.  The Minister will be aware that as long as this resolution is in force the courts cannot declare invalid any Act which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State.  It would seem to me that after 29 years the question of rescinding this resolution should be fully considered.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite frank with the Minister about this.  In view of the statement I have read out here from <Col N="1491" /> the <i>Garda Review</i> article I would have some reservations about rescinding the emergency powers orders.  If the Garda seriously considered that a situation was being forced in this country where communist infiltration might be taking place, then the existence of the orders might prove effective in combating infiltration of that sort.  However, on the general grounds that this was a resolution passed at a time of emergency at the outbreak of the last war, 3rd September, 1939, it would seem appropriate now that the House should be given an opportunity of discussing the matter and seeing whether or not the resolution should be still kept in force.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to say anything much about the proposed Criminal Justice Bill to which the Minister has referred.  In relation to the Criminal Justice Bill the Minister said that he did not propose to say anything more about it than that there had been a great deal of misconception and misrepresentation as to the purposes and effects of some provisions of the Bill and which he hoped to dispel on Second Reading.  I doubt if the Minister will be able to dispel people's doubts with regard to the appropriateness of some of the provisions of the Bill, particularly those dealing with restrictions on the right to hold public meetings without giving notice to the Gardaí and so on.</P>

      <P>That may be. I do not intend to discuss it and I started out by saying that I did not intend to discuss it but merely to make a passing reference to the Minister's remarks.  It may be that there are misconceptions. Section 28 of the Offences Against the State Act is now being repealed and instead is being incorporated in the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> Without prejudice to the views I may express as to whether or not the powers which are now in section 28 of the Offences Against the State Act should be continued or not, I had set out to say that I think it is better that this kind of provision should be dealt with in ordinary legislation, as the Minister is doing in this particular instance, than that it should continue under an Act such as the Offences Against the State Act.  We have had the experience of section 28 of that Act being operated when there were pickets outside this House and the feeling of the public at that time was that, whatever else might be said, there was no question of public safety or the safety of the State being involved.  To that extent it is right that the Criminal Justice Bill should endeavour to deal with these matters.  May I conclude by saying that this is the first Estimate the Minister has had to introduce as Minister for Justice and I know that he will not take it as personal when I say that it looks as if it may be his last.</P>

      <P>I will start where Deputy Michael O'Higgins finished, that this is a new Department for the Minister and I congratulate him.  Certainly, from the statement he made today, we can see that justice is being administered well.  This is a particularly important Department because the law and order of the State depend on it.  I was very impressed by the Minister's statement about juvenile delinquency. I was very pleased to see the great advances being made in this regard and the humane approach to this matter by all concerned with it, by the judges, the district justices, the Gardaí and so on, who are trying to deal with this problem, as well as the voluntary organisations who are playing an active part in this regard.  It is up to us to express our appreciation of their wonderful work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency the Gardaí have organised a boys' club in West Finglas. While I attend their annual general meetings, I do not have time to go there more often but I am very proud to see the wonderful work they are doing.  Any Garda who has a particular leaning towards helping humanity as a whole should be commended by us and <Col N="1493" /> by the Department.  We require more people like that and, while there may be other Gardaí who take a different view, there are Gardaí who are engaged in this work in helping the boys, even in trying to place them in employment afterwards and sometimes pleading for them if they are up before the courts for a first offence.  I believe they are doing God's work and I hope they will continue to do so.  This problem of juvenile delinquency is a very big problem and is one which confronts all churches, all bishops and archbishops and all are trying to do something about it.  Even voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have an interest in the well-being of our youth and we too must have sympathy and charity towards them.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal for the provision of more Gardaí at the County Dublin coastal resorts in the summertime. In certain areas in North Dublin we have had experiences of this rough and contrary element arriving at a resort and causing all sorts of mischief. The only thing that will prevent them from doing this is if they see a Garda on duty.  I have made representations about this on many occasions, once to the present Minister and on other occasions to previous Ministers.  I wonder if it would be possible to have a barracks opened in that area.  It is a big area.  In summer the population is trebled and every year it is increasing. Apart from the decent people who visit these resorts we have some undesirables who cause a good deal of trouble.  I should like to thank the Minister for the co-operation I received from him last summer when he put a squad car at the disposal of the Lusk barracks in an effort to eliminate crime and various forms of trouble.</P>
    <P>I should like also to congratulate Commissioner Weymes on his promotion. He is a very fine man and has earned his promotion.  He is a very diplomatic person and I wish him well. The Minister has made a wise choice in appointing him.  I should also like to pay a tribute to ex-Commissioner Carroll who was a particularly kind and efficient man.  In my opinion, he is a man who displayed a deep sense of justice and charity in his dealings <Col N="1494" /> with all kinds of people and, in particular, in his dealings with the Gardaí under his control.</P>
    <P>Our tourist trade grows yearly more and more important from the point of view of our balance of payments and I suggest to the Minister that the Gardaí should have special training to equip them to deal with tourists.  I cast no reflection whatever on the Gardaí, but there is need for some training because these men are in a position to sell the country to the tourist, to sell it perhaps more effectively than even the hotel and guesthouse proprietor and it is from that point of view that I suggest some special training.  I have not had any complaints, but there have been occasions on which tourists have inadvertently broken traffic regulations, perhaps by driving in the wrong direction up or down a one-way street.  The Gardaí should be made aware of the importance of the tourist to the country as a whole.  I shall not say any more on the subject.</P>
    <P>People in north County Dublin, especially legal people, are disappointed because certain cases are no longer tried in the local district courts. This decision to transfer certain cases to city courts was not a decision of the Minister's.  The legal profession and the litigants concerned would prefer that these cases should be tried in the local courts.  I do not know all the pros and cons.  I am sure the Minister will give me the reasons for the change when he comes to reply.  A protest has been made to me and I am conveying it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The district court buildings continue to be eyesores.  Some of them date back to the 17th and 18th century.  They defeat the purpose of those towns which enter for the Tidy Towns competition. They are gloomy looking buildings.  Surely something could be done to improve these buildings, internally and externally.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid a tribute to district justices and judges who have taken on certain work outside the scope of their normal duties.  They deserve commendation.  I am sure this work will continue.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister and his <Col N="1495" /> Department for their courtesy and co-operation over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief remarks on a particular aspect of this Estimate, an aspect about which I spoke on the Estimate in 1966. Mountjoy Jail is in my constituency. I happen to be interested in conditions there.  The men in the prison service have to some extent been ignored.  There have been some improvements since 1966.  As reported at column 1730 of volume 225 of the Official Report, I said to the Minister: &ldquo;I want to get some assurance that the prison officers' conditions of work and overtime payments will be given priority treatment in the year ahead.&rdquo;  I referred to conditions generally. As I say, there has been some improvement.  There are still one or two problems that need to be resolved. We should consider seriously improving the status of the prison officer.  In nearly every section of the public service there has been an improvement in status, but there has been no upgrading in the prison service.  So far as I know, there is no official title by which to refer to these officers.  There are Gaelic titles for most sections in the public service, but no fresh look has ever been taken at those who staff our prison service and, as I remarked two years ago, a fresh look is necessary at the conditions and the whole occupation of the men employed in the prison service. In relation to the Garda Síochána at Templemore, we have changed their curriculum somewhat.  We appreciate that it is necessary to give them all a general training at the very start of their career in the Garda Síochána.  I would say that to look after a person detained at the State's pleasure is as important as the job of the person who apprehends a person who has broken the law.  I remember referring to this in 1966.  The Minister agreed that there was an increasing complexity in the job of the prison officer; that refresher courses were needed at certain points and that he would need to learn certain elements of psychiatry and criminology.  It is high time to introduce a general introductory training <Col N="1496" /> course for all new recruits into the service so as to shape this service in the way it should originally have been shaped and certainly in accordance with the agreed requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i>: I feel very strongly about the subject matter of this motion which stands in the name of the Fine Gael Party.  For many years we had these schemes&mdash; the minor employment schemes, the bog development schemes and the rural improvement schemes.  They were operated by the Department of Finance through the agency of the Office of Public Works until 1st April, 1967, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While money appeared to be very scarce in 1965 and 1966, it was very difficult to get many of these schemes proceeded with by the Office of Public Works but, nevertheless, the schemes were there and, when properly operated, they performed a very useful function.  The minor employment scheme was used to provide roads and drainage, without any local contribution, when the amount of unemployment in the area warranted it.  The bog development scheme was used to provide roads into bogs.  The rural improvement scheme was also very <Col N="1497" /> important because it enabled residents on lanes to bring those lanes up to a reasonable standard.  Admittedly, a local contribution was necessary but people who could afford it gladly paid it in order to have proper access to their homes.</P>
    <P>Now, on 1st April, 1967, as far as I know, the Department of Finance washed its hands of these three schemes and handed them over to the Department of Local Government.  From that date, I think the minor employment scheme and the bog development scheme were abolished and the rural improvement scheme was operated, or was supposed to be operated, by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years, during which these schemes were operated by the Department of Finance, to my personal knowledge it was very difficult to get any schemes under way and hope was held out that, when the Department of Local Government took over&mdash;when a Minister took over who was supposed to be in close contact with local authorities and local conditions&mdash;something more might be expected. However, instead of improvement, there was deterioration.  When one made representations about a scheme one was told that the amount of money allocated for this particular year was used up.  Then, at the beginning of this year, we had the introduction of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act which scrapped the three schemes mentioned in this motion and conferred authority on local authorities to do substantially the sort of work that heretofore had been done through these schemes within the limits of finance provided by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Things were bad enough on 1st April of this year when the Department of Local Government, following the example of the Department of Finance, washed its hands of these schemes, save in so far as it would continue to exercise control in the form of sanction over them, and handed the schemes over to the local authorities.  As I say, things were bad enough then because a backlog had accumulated in each county in Ireland.  One county that I can speak of with first-hand information had a backlog of something like <Col N="1498" /> 100 schemes which had been submitted to the Department of Local Government, or to its predecessor the Department of Finance, and had not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>What has happened since?  Things have got far worse.  In the year 1968-69, as far as I can find out, throughout the country not one scheme has commenced. In fact, in reply to a question today which I had down to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and which I hope to be dealing with in more detail on the Adjournment tonight&mdash;I was informed, and I can take this as an example, that, for the current year, that is, for the year 1st April, 1968, to 1st April, 1969, a sum of £30,000 had been allocated to Cavan; that on 14th April, 1968, the list of cases unattended to, which amounted to approximately 100 at the beginning of this year, had increased to 363.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister to tell me the number of schemes which have actually been commenced by the county councils since the Act came into operation, I was informed that none has commenced.  Here we have these three schemes being passed on by the Department of Finance to the Department of Local Government on 1st April, 1967, and being passed on to the county councils by the Department of Local Government on 1st April, 1968, and we see that since 1st April, 1968, no schemes have been put into operation, no schemes have commenced, because the Department of Local Government, as I will establish later, have refused to co-operate with the county councils in providing or sanctioning the provision of machinery to put this work into operation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment or two the type of work that is covered by this scheme, the type of work that is carried out.  There are in rural Ireland, particularly in the poorer counties, miles and miles of lanes in each county in which two, three, four or, perhaps, up to ten families reside.  It is utterly impossible for any one family or any one person living in such a lane to have it repaired because the cost would be beyond them.  Heretofore, the practice was that, with a small local contribution, usually about ten per cent or 15 <Col N="1499" /> per cent of the cost, the work on these lanes was carried out under the rural improvement scheme by, as I have said, the Department of Finance in the first instance and later by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Now, the whole thing has been scrapped.  That is what it means.  It is not a question of replacing the schemes mentioned in the motion&mdash;the minor employment scheme, the bog development scheme and the rural improvement scheme&mdash;by a scheme under the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968.  That is not the position.  These three schemes have been scrapped and the other scheme, which exists on paper, has not been implemented.  I know of many families living in intolerable conditions.  I know that the man who drew milk to the creamery, the contractor, refused to drive in these lanes to collect milk and the people consequently have to wheel out the milk on wheelbarrows.  I know of a number of lanes in which there are positively dangerous bridges liable to collapse at any time.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was being operated by the Board of Works under the Department of Finance, I had a case in my constituency in which a grant was refused for a lane in which there was a bridge.  Within months of the refusal, a young lad was driving out from his home on a tractor across the bridge when it collapsed.  The tractor was thrown into the river.  Fortunately, the young lad was thrown clear and did not receive serious injuries.  A photograph of the collapsed bridge, and the tractor in the river, appeared in the local newspaper and I cut that out and sent it to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons.  I must say in fairness to him that the decision to refuse to sanction a grant for that lane and bridge was reversed and the work was done, but I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that, perhaps, within the next 12 months further bridges will collapse in lanes in my constituency and, perhaps, on these occasions we may not be as fortunate as we were on the last and there may be fatalities or serious injuries.</P>
    <P>I am reminding the Parliamentary <Col N="1500" /> Secretary now, as I will the Minister for Local Government later, that I am putting this on the records of the House, and if anything like that happens I will hold responsible the people who scrapped these schemes and who refused to implement the scheme for which there is provision under the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act.  So will the public hold them responsible.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is mentioned in this motion.  Of course, there is considerable, genuine unemployment in rural Ireland.  The fact that the Minister for Social Welfare has seen fit to regard farmers under a certain valuation as unemployed and to provide these small farmers with a small amount of unemployment assistance is ample evidence to me, I am sure to the House and the country, that there exists wholesale unemployment in rural Ireland.  It exists side by side with poor roads, bad bridges and rivers that need draining, yet the minor employment scheme, which provided employment for small farmers and unemployed labourers, has been scrapped.  It is hard to understand it, it is difficult to see the reasoning in it.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to explain it to us when he is replying to the debate&mdash;indeed, it is difficult to know who will be replying to it or what the position is: I assume the Parliamentary Secretary is sitting in because these schemes were operated originally by the Board of Works. If he is not replying personally to the debate, I am sure he will pass on the remarks that have been made and that will be made about it to his successor on the Front Bench and that we shall hear from him.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i>: The matter is too serious to let it be sidetracked or to draw the red herring of Ministerial and Parliamentary Secretary changes across the trail.  I would like to know, first of all, why the schemes were scrapped when there was plenty of unemployment in the localities concerned.  People would much prefer to get work and be paid for it and, at the same time, they would be <Col N="1501" /> rendering useful service to themselves and to their neighbours.  The people who would qualify for employment on these schemes would be living on the very lanes that need attention.  I want also to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain to the House why the scheme which is supposed to have superseded these schemes has not been brought into operation&mdash;because it has not been brought into operation&mdash;and why the Government have not seen to it that the scheme which I say is supposed to have superseded these schemes is simply there on paper only and why not one penny has been spent under it in County Cavan in the current year.  Presumably what applies to Cavan applies to every other county in Ireland where the schemes should operate.</P>
      <P>We hear much talk about flight from the land and keeping the people in the west of Ireland.  I have said here repeatedly that I do not know of anything more calculated to drive the younger generation out of rural Ireland than to be compelled to travel a mile or two of an impassable lane to get to their homes.  I remember canvassing in a by-election in the west of Ireland and going into a house at the very end of a fairly long lane where there were a number of teenagers.  They were not interested in high politics or in the activities of the Minister for External Affairs or any other Minister.  What they immediately said was: &ldquo;Will you get the lane done?&rdquo; One could not blame them.  These lanes are driving the young people out of rural Ireland. Lanes like that are responsible for the low or no marriage rate in large parts of the country and the consequent drop in population in these places.  There is much emotion about this and, if all the concern we heard for the west of Ireland in recent months or throughout this year meant anything, I fail to understand why the Ministers responsible have so disgracefully neglected this elementary duty of assisting these people in rural Ireland to provide for themselves a proper access to their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drainage is also concerned in this because these schemes were availed of to drain agricultural land.  We hear from the Parliamentary Secretary from <Col N="1502" /> time to time that the major schemes cannot be proceeded with because there are very grave difficulties and much money involved.  Why scrap this scheme which enables the farmers and others to do local drainage?  I want to charge the Government with showing complete disregard for the people of rural Ireland.  I want to charge the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government because between them they are responsible for the state of affairs that exists at the moment.  I want to charge them with having deprived the people of rural Ireland of these worthwhile schemes.  I want to charge the Minister for Local Government with putting a confidence trick across on the people of Ireland this year by introducing the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act and allocating sums varying.  I suppose, from £14,000 or £15,000 to perhaps £70,000 or £80,000 to various counties when at the same time, he knew that it would not be possible for the local authorities to spend any of that money in the current year because he was going to see to it that they would not have the machinery to do it and that he would not, therefore, have to provide the money.  I wonder will this money, which was provided for 1968/9 and which has not been spent because the Minister for Local Government would not permit of its spending, be carried forward to the year 1969/70, or will it simply not be paid at all because it was not utilised in the year for which it was voted?</P>
    <P>These are all questions that need answering.  One question is unemployment in rural Ireland.  The Government admit it is there, because they have provided for it under the Social Welfare code by acknowledging that small farmers are not gainfully occupied. They have them on their hands and they can do this work.  Another question is that of drainage, of the hardship imposed on these people in rural Ireland by having bad drainage and having deplorable roads or lanes to their houses.  These are the questions I want the Parliamentary Secretary to attend to.  It is no answer for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the scheme has been handed over to the county councils, that they have a better <Col N="1503" /> local knowledge and are in a better position to operate them.  They are not, because they have not got the technical advisers nor the administrative machinery to put them into operation and the Minister for Local Government will not sanction them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what are the engineers in his Department doing who in previous years carried out the necessary inspections on schemes submitted to them.  If they are there at the moment they should be made available to County Councils to enable them to do the work.  I simply do not know where they are.  Maybe they have retired. I know the County Councils cannot get engineers and, if the Department of Finance have engineers available, they should send them down to check these schemes as an interim measure if they have the interest of the rural population of Ireland at heart. I can only come to the conclusion that the Government and the Ministers for Finance and Local Government simply want to wash their hands of these schemes and that they simply want to get rid of them because they cannot be bothered.  They passed them on to the county councils and, at the same time, refused to co-operate with the county councils in implementing them.</P>
    <P>I hope that after the shock the Government recently received they will now realise that they are out of touch with the people and that the people of Connaught and of the three remaining counties of Ulster are more interested in practical finance like this and in practical assistance and organisation. They are more interested in practical organisation and finance than in the offer of more Fianna Fáil TDs. With the present number of TDs in these areas about which I am speaking and with an absolute Government majority in this House, this thing has happened to these people.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary, when the <i>post mortem</i> is resumed, to bring home to the Government that these schemes are very important and that the people regard them as being very important.  It is such absolute neglect as this which has led <Col N="1504" /> to frustration in rural Ireland and has helped to deliver to the Government in the recent referendum a massive vote of no confidence.  However, if that wakes up the present Government to their responsibilities to the people of rural Ireland it will have been worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The events leading up to the change from the Department of Finance to the Department of Local Government and then to the county councils have been well explained by Deputy Fitzpatrick and I shall not follow along that line.  However, I said at the time&mdash;I said it in the county council and I think I said it in this House&mdash;that it was the most ill-advised change that could possibly have taken place.</P>
      <P>The three types of grants for the schemes mentioned that came under the Board of Works were so important to the west and to the county I come from that I thought it was a pity that any change whatever should be made, or that any change should be made in the method of allocation, in the method of staffing and all the other things that go into the investigation of a scheme before the final allocation of a grant. I knew the engineers who were involved.  I knew that during the years they had acquired wide experience in the various matters connected with it that could not be matched by any new staff recruited by the county council.  I knew a lot about the type of work that had to go into it once an application was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew, too, the length of time it would take to deal with an application and in many cases the lack of co-operation of some of the people involved with regard to getting them to agree that a particular road or laneway, or drain, might be brought through their land and the right given to people to go in on the land to do the work.  It was often very frustrating work.  In many cases grants had to be held up for a long time due to the fact that, perhaps, one awkward individual would not agree to the scheme going through.  There were also cases of individuals who would not agree to pay a contribution.  I must say that <Col N="1505" /> during the time that the Department of Finance handled this and that the Parliamentary Secretary himself was in charge more progress was made and more money allocated and wisely spent than at any time since.</P>
    <P>While in Local Government we got nowhere and finally the Department or the Government were attempting to pass on to local authorities a burden, which they themselves found too heavy, with complete disregard for the burden carried by local authorities, like County Mayo where the rate is 91s 6d in the £.  They forgot how it might affect the local authorities and shed their responsibilities ill-advisedly.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say why this should have been done.</P>
    <P>I have a fear that the schemes will not be successful.  The new Local Government scheme cannot be successful for many reasons.  First and foremost, we now have a situation where no scheme can be embarked upon without a contribution.  I know a lot about this and I know, too, that the Parliamentary Secretary knows about it.  I feel that where there is a situation in which a contribution has to be made in all cases there cannot be progress&mdash; progress, for instance, like that which we had when minor relief schemes and big development schemes were carried out without any contribution from the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that people go into bogs from varied and wide areas.  The distance between their houses and holdings may be miles and miles and to attempt to get these people to come together and provide the necessary contribution is an impossible task.  I feel that this will put paid to any good work being done on bog roads and bog drains in the future.  In the west of Ireland there never was a greater need for good solid bog roads than there is at present because turf cutting machines are being brought in now where heretofore the slane was used and, instead of the horse and cart or the ass and cart, tractors are now being used on the bogs.  Roads of better construction are needed for those vehicles.  I am afraid that under the new scheme, because of the difficulty of collecting contributions <Col N="1506" /> over a wide area, bog roads will be completely neglected.</P>
    <P>Regarding bog drains and other drainage, we have a tremendous problem in my county in that we have almost 1,000 miles of lanes not yet vested in the county council.  Bearing in mind the fact that we have 1,400 miles of green roads not yet black topped, you can imagine what a shocking problem it is to attempt to solve. The £57,000 allocated to Mayo, taking into consideration the amazing mileage of lanes we have, not counting the bog roads, and the mileage of drainage we have in the county &mdash; and notwithstanding the fact that the Moy drainage scheme and the Corrib scheme came partially through the county &mdash; is only a drop in the ocean compared with what our needs are.</P>
    <P>As I said, the feeling is there that the scheme will not be successful due to the fact that it is so hard to get the contributions.  The contributions are much less now than they used to be. That is a step in the right direction, but I feel that some other scheme will have to be devised so that the bog roads and bog drains can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out earlier, it appears that in no county has any work been done under the local improvement schemes up to now.  I had the feeling that this would happen.  All along the line I asked the county engineers if it were possible to get the staff transferred from the Board of Works, from the rural improvements schemes and the others, to the county council to enable them to carry on the work that was necessary because, as I said earlier, this staff knew what they were about.  The job had become to them everyday routine.  If a difficulty arose they knew how to deal with it.  They were able to estimate costs better than any new people who might be brought in.  For that reason, I felt that without them we would be held up, as we have been, and I do not know when we will break out of it.  We know there is a shortage of engineers throughout the country.  It is difficult for county councils to get engineers for the many and varied types of work they have.  I felt that, if the Government were serious about this, they would have turned over the staff, lock, stock and barrel, <Col N="1507" /> to the county councils; but they did not do that.  In fact, every other Department raided the Board of Works and the Land Commission took the engineers. The Department of Local Government held on to some of them and the county councils were faced with the fact that they could not get an engineer at all.  If they did get one, or if one were assigned from their own staff, he had not the experience necessary to deal with the questions speedily.  Thus we find that at this date in the year no work has been done.</P>
    <P>The county councils have been accused of being slow in dealing with this.  We have taken our own officials to task in Mayo but they have pointed out to us that to start up a service, to employ staff and to provide the necessary office accommodation and all that went with it took such a long time that they have not been able to get the scheme off the ground up to the present.  The new staff are not familiar with the work and, consequently, you will have great delays, even if they start on the field work, because they have not the knowledge of dealing with people which the engineers and supervisors who were there for years had. Therefore, when the new people go out to attempt to break down the view of some awkward individual who does not want to let the lane or drain go through, they have not the necessary tact because they have not had the experience.  That means that we will have slow movement forward or perhaps no movement at all in many cases.</P>
    <P>Some people may ask why the county councils do not take over the lanes.  A circular was sent out by the Minister for Local Government a year and a half ago telling the county councils that they should be very slow to take over roads not yet vested in them, that there would be plenty of money available from other schemes through the Board of Works to do the lanes. Of course, everybody took the Minister at his word.  But now the roads are there, the lanes are there and the drains are there and I see no hope on earth of any advance in Mayo in the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> There is another thing.  The change has meant that many small farmers are unemployed who would be able during the summer months working on drains and during the winter months on roads to earn some extra money to help them to eke out a bare living on their holdings.  This was extremely important to them.  In many cases the amount of money that would be earned meant their not having to emigrate to England for six or more months of the year. They were enabled to stay at home with their families and have a happier and better life.  During part of the year up to now many of them had to emigrate because the employment they used to get was not there and they could not earn the money.  Some people may say that all this is sentimentality. It is a fact that this has happened.  In the final analysis the Government must take the blame for that whether they like it or not.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act also meant that in future everything connected with investigation had to be carried out by local engineers of the county council.  The staff in the county council have no knowledge of the many and varied angles of this and it will take a long time before they can build up the type of expertise that existed when the scheme was controlled by the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>Beyond any doubt there is a danger that drainage and bog roads will be left without any money and that the emphasis in my county at least will be on the lanes.  The lanes are very necessary. The fact that the lanes are bad means fertilisers cannot be brought into many farms because lorries will not travel in.  If a man wants to build a house the fellow who comes with the blocks must leave them at the end of the lane to be carted up and this causes a lot of difficulty which Departmental officials do not know about. However, the worst feature of it is the social aspect.  A man living at the end of a lane, where he is up to his knees in water, is a third class citizen.  Yet the people living under these conditions pay rates and taxes.  Surely something should be done to enable them to have better living conditions?  A county council like the council of <Col N="1509" /> Mayo, who have put such a shocking burden of 91/6d. in the £ on the people, can do nothing to help where you have 1,000 miles of laneway.  I feel that it is the Minister's and the Government's duty to ensure that in some manner more money will be channelled into this worthy work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate but when I hear a western Deputy like Deputy Lyons who, with others, has signed a motion asking that these schemes be restored to the Board of Works and looked after by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, I cannot understand it.  I will give the reasons why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one person who should be responsible for the roads of this country, be they by-roads, county roads or anything else, it is the county engineer in each county council.  Every shovel of sand that is spread on a road should be looked after by the engineer-incharge in that county.  Each council has assistant engineers all over the place. Surely, if anybody knows the state of the roads and where money should be spent, it is these men who are dealing with these roads every other day.  In our local authority in Galway we accepted these schemes and we are carrying them out at the moment.  Our county engineer appointed some supervisors to check on the roads.  They report back and he carries out the improvements. I do not think any Deputy from the west of Ireland will say that I am talking out of the way when I say that the haphazard manner in which this was done by the Board of Works was a disgrace.  You had men with pickaxes to dig sand.  A man was sent out to dig a lock of sand to put on a road.  That day is gone.  Each council has its own machinery.  They have diggers and graders and all the rest of it. They have machinery to do the work. Is it not a grand thing to see each county council doing its own roads so that they can have a permanent staff working the whole time?  I am sure Deputy Lyons or any other western Deputy and even the Donegal Deputies will agree that, where you had a certain amount of money allocated to <Col N="1510" /> roads, the work was carried out for approximately nine months of the year. There were nearly three months of the year when the workers had no work. Now, with the acceptance of these schemes, at least in my county and in my constituency there will be continuous work for those workers and they will be able to qualify for the contributory pension when they reach the age.</P>
    <P>You had a few engineers looking after this work down the years.  They went out sometimes, maybe in the Spring, and examined the roads which people had applied for.  They selected one here and one there.  To my mind, it was not the right way of attacking the job.  In our local authority we will take over these roads and maintain them, and rightly so.  Every road leading into a townland should be maintained by the local authority.  I am sure nobody will say I am wrong in saying this.  I hope I live long enough to see every road leading into a townland or village in the country districts tarred to the doors of the people, the same as our main roads.  I will never be satisfied until I see that done.</P>
    <P>That is why I think that this motion signed by a number of Fine Gael Deputies is wrong.  I feel it is something that should not have come here at all.  Some of them should sit down and say to themselves: &ldquo;Did we do something wrong?&rdquo; They must admit they have done something wrong. Surely it is a grand thing for Deputy Lyons, Deputy O'Donnell or myself to be able to walk into our local engineer and say: &ldquo;There is a road leading into a townland.  Will you have a look at it?&rdquo; Our county engineer has put notices in the paper and asked the people to apply for roads to be done so that he can have them investigated. He has a supervisor out on the job at the moment.  Some of them are being done and the others are being investigated. I feel it will be a better job and the townlands will be better off than they were in the past.  I certainly think that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, who handled the transfer to the local authorities, did a good day's work and we should thank them for doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of this motion bears repetition:</P>
      <P>That in view of the widespread unemployment and consequent hardship caused by the merger of minor employment and bog development schemes with rural improvement schemes, the reduction of the total vote in respect thereof by approximately one-half, and the absence of any or any adequate plan or scheme to absorb those who have lost employment, Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government to restore the said schemes in their original form and the amount of money needed to implement them.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the description of the scheme first of all&mdash;a minor relief scheme.  It is for the relief of unemployment. It is a minor scheme for the relief of unemployment in an area where there is a very big percentage of unemployment and these schemes apply mostly to the west of Ireland. Has the unemployment position in the west, north-west and south-west of Ireland improved so much that the Government can afford to abolish these minor relief schemes which were generally carried out in winter in rural Ireland?  Let us look at the figures.  In October, 1966, we had 45,817 unemployed; in October, 1967, this rose to 49,474 and in October this year we have 51,728, an increase of 5,911, unemployed. Can anybody question that most of those unemployed are in the west, in what were originally congested areas but which are becoming rapidly depopulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the west we depend quite a lot on migration and, unfortunately, still do, but during the winter months people were encouraged to come back to the country and seek employment, admittedly temporary, on minor relief schemes for the repair of accommodation roads, bog roads and for drainage work also.  A considerable amount of money was spent and good done as a result because in many western counties, in practically every county in the west, we have minor roads which are not county roads and for which there is no fund on which we can draw <Col N="1512" /> for their repair and upkeep.  This scheme whereby we could procure funds from the Office of Public Works was a good one.  The official in charge is merely the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and the scheme was not administered by the Office of Public Works; it was the Department of Finance that made the moneys available.  In my county the work was carried out under the supervision of the county and district engineers.  The Board of Works had no engineers there other than those selecting the jobs to be done.  Now these roads are left with grass growing on them, with potholes and rocks, and there are no funds available for repairs.</P>
    <P>We did receive in Donegal approximately £66,000 for minor relief and rural improvement schemes and most of it was spent on the western seaboard in poor, congested areas, Gaeltacht areas.  That money has been cut by half this year to £33,000 and extended to the entire county and if farmers with high valuation apply for what are now known as local improvements schemes grants and are willing to pay up to 25 per cent of the cost of the work I have no doubt they will get preference over unfortunate residents of congested areas and that very little of the money will trickle through to those for whom it was originally intended to fill lacunae in employment in the winter.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a Fine Gael meeting in the Gaeltacht village of Annagry and the sole complaint there was lack of funds to repair non-county roads.  I went and saw some of the roads which were impassable for cars or other vehicles.  Where will these people get money for such repairs?  I was amazed to hear Deputy Geoghegan say they had already received an allocation for the local improvements schemes and were already spending the money.  Donegal County Council have not received a penny and all applications received as a result of the scheme which was inaugurated last March or April are postponed pending completion of some schemes taken over from the Board of Works when the rural improvements schemes were transferred to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>When will we get even this meagre <Col N="1513" /> £33,000?  I know on my own coast of islands such as Arranmore and Inishfree which depend on minor relief grants for the upkeep of non-county roads.  Some of these islands are not in the Gaeltacht and will not qualify for grants.  It is a shame, in view of the flight from the Gaeltacht, that we are now leaving them short of money for the maintenance of roads that we made for them through minor relief schemes. I know the Parliamentary Secretary may later say they will provide funds for petty grants in the Gaeltacht area but, unfortunately, the Gaeltacht is dwindling in area and numerical strength and only small areas will benefit from Gaeltacht grants.</P>
    <P>There is no winter employment in these congested areas.  Most small crofters in the west win their own turf and depended on minor relief grants to get it from the bog when saved.  They now depend on transport being provided other than the ass and cart or pony and cart.  They have depended on tractors but the roads have become so impassable that it is impossible for tractors to use them.  I know some people have to use a creel to bring turf to the county roads before a tractor can transport it home.  That is very bad.</P>
    <P>Most of the migrants can now afford a motor car and when they come home they bring it with them.  It is purchased out of money earned in Britain.  Many of them must park their cars from a half to one mile from their homes because they cannot drive cars on the roads formerly repaired by minor relief schemes.  Some migrants refuse to come&mdash;can one blame them?  &mdash;until such time as road relief grants are expended on these roads.  Deputy Geoghegan said the people of Galway were taking advantage of the local improvements schemes grants to improve accommodation roads and that, when approved, local authorities would take over and maintain these roads.  Is he serious?  We have so many minor or county roads in our county still untarred, still not dust-free that we could not possibly take over many of these accommodation roads for the next 15 or 20 years and it will be longer unless the grant is restored to the original amount of £66,000 instead of £33,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Why should we cut back on a grant which relieved unemployment in the congested areas of the west?  Is it not false economy?  Is it not driving people from the country and from the Gaeltacht?  Is it encouraging people to marry?  Donegal County Council have a scheme of specific instance houses. The local authority will build houses for individuals in specific cases but the local authority will not build a house unless the site is beside a road which is passable.  They have refused on many occasions to accept sites that were offered because the road nearest the site is impassable from the point of view of traffic.  Their reason for that is that they know that, if the minor relief schemes are not restored, some day, a house built on such a site would become a monument in a field because nobody would live in it.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to turn his back on the west even though the west, the north-west and south-west, may have turned their backs on him in the referendum.  I would appeal to him that these traditional strongholds of Fianna Fáil should not now be deserted because the people are deserting Fianna Fáil. The grants which were payable in the past and to which these people are entitled should be restored.  If that is done, it will encourage people to come home and spend the winter months working in Ireland.  Would it not be much better to give that employment on minor relief schemes than to pay unemployment assistance?  The men would appreciate it much more and would be satisfied that they were giving a good return for the money they were receiving, not only to the State but to themselves and their neighbours.  That is one of the reasons why the minor relief grants should be restored.</P>
    <P>Remember, when a person is in receipt of unemployment assistance he is not working.  When he is working on a minor relief scheme he is doing national and local work which will benefit the community.  These factors should be considered.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consult with his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare to discover the amount of money that is now being paid by way of unemployment assistance during the <Col N="1515" /> period of the year when, under minor relief schemes and other such schemes, men were employed in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under minor relief schemes, culverts were covered, bridges were repaired, small jetties were built, slips were constructed to facilitate fishermen.  Such work can no longer be done under local improvement schemes.  That, again, is a tragedy.  Now that so many tourists come for a short period to the western seaboard, facilities should be made available to them to use small pleasure boats such as are in use in Europe, Great Britain and parts of Ireland.  If necessary, money should be made available for the provision of landing strips at seaside resorts, beauty spots or strands.</P>
    <P>The only method known to me of procuring such money is by way of minor relief grants.  As that source has now dried up, I do not know where we are to get the money for the repair of the little works already carried out such as small marine works, bog drainage and the drainage carried out under special employment schemes.  I do not know where we are to get the money necessary to keep in repair and in fit condition the projects that have already been carried out.</P>
    <P>It is for all these reasons that I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the scheme which was originally introduced here is implemented and that provision such as was originally made available by us for local improvement schemes will now be made available.  Why should the provision be cut in half?  Why should the unfortunate unemployed of the west be victimised <i>vis-á-vis</i> the industrialist or the hotelier or others in other areas?  The amount of money spent on that famous monument, Potez, would have financed all the minor relief schemes in the west of Ireland for at least one year and possibly more.</P>
    <P>These are things that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider.  The minor relief schemes are schemes that concern Irishmen, that concern the cradle of the Irish language, namely, <Col N="1516" /> the Gaeltacht.  Therefore, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the decision on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion gives an opportunity to those of us who disagree with the action of the Government in transferring the schemes in question to local authorities to air our views. I do not know whether or not it is correct but it did appear that the Special Employment Schemes Office were, in fact, running down schemes in cases where they were not being done, at least in a number of constituencies that adjoin mine and in the constituency that I represent.  It appeared that, in an effort to get out of an awkward situation, some bright boy got the idea that the schemes should be transferred to local authorities who would then be responsible for carrying out the work.</P>
      <P>I am not against decentralisation; as a matter of fact I am very much in favour of it and I will have something to say on the Estimate the debate on which is to be resumed with regard to some of the things being done.</P>
      <P>Schemes which have been on the stocks over a number of years and which have not been processed, just left on a list, are to be transferred to the local authority and the local authority are expected to implement them (a) without the necessary finance and (b) without their being satisfied that the order in which they are asked to do them is the proper order.  When the transfer of the schemes was first suggested some of us wanted to know whether or not we would be allowed to select the schemes that should be carried out or if it would be necessary to carry them out as listed.  We were told that the Department would send down a list which was to be followed. I do not think that is a good idea because, apparently, the Department made no attempt to find out whether or not the schemes were placed in the proper order of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter with which we completely disagreed was as to the amount of money allocated for the schemes and the amount which the local authority were allowed to retain for administering the schemes.  I do not know whether or not the Department consider <Col N="1517" /> that the county council administration is far more efficient than their own but they did seem to suggest that it would be cheaper to administer the schemes at local level than directly by the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies are aware of the position up to this.  Usually a man who was employed on one of these schemes would tell you, on inquiry, that he was employed by the county council.  There were many cases where people were working with the county council and were transferred to a special employment scheme or a bog scheme and then returned to the county council who were not aware that they had been in two different employments.  In theory, the people employed on these schemes were supposed to come from the local labour exchange.  In practice, that very seldom happened except where there were very big pockets of unemployment.</P>
    <P>County council employees were transferred to these schemes and the person who administered the schemes at local level was the county engineer, for which he received a certain amount of money.  In addition, where the work was supervised by the overseer for the area, he usually was paid a sum by the county engineer for doing that work. Under the new arrangement this has been cut out and the system now is that the local authority get a set percentage for the job.  They must supply all the supervision and pay for it themselves, and the amount of money being made available, according to the officials of my county council anyway, is not sufficient to pay for the administration of the scheme.  This is something which, I suppose, experience alone will prove to be right or wrong but our local authority said that the amount being made available was not sufficient to administer the scheme.</P>
    <P>We were then left in the position that we either had to say we were prepared to take over the schemes and do them or, alternatively, we did not do any of them at all because there was no central office from which they would be done.  The result was that the county council had no option, if <Col N="1518" /> they wanted any of these schemes done, but to do them under whatever terms were offered.</P>
    <P>Again this brings me to the position referred to last week on the Estimate for the Department of Lands, where the people at the top like to play God. They say: &ldquo;This is what you get and you can take it or leave it&rdquo;.  I was referring there to the question of wages. In this case it is in regard to the amount of money being allocated to do the job.  The money has been allocated and you take it or leave it.  There is no question of trying to negotiate.  If it proves that the amount was wrong that is just too bad.  You do not get anything else.</P>
    <P>Another question that caused a great deal of unrest is in relation to people who were employed by the Special Employment Schemes Office to do certain jobs.  There were a lot of these schemes done and where there were supervisory grades, gangers, mainly employed doing these jobs, these people suddenly found themselves, because of the change, out of a job.  The local authority should make provision for their employment but they could not do it.  The county council who were taking over the administration could not do it because they have their own supervisory grades and their own employees. They have a superannuation scheme in operation over the years. There is a certain set of men to do certain jobs and these people, being superannuated, were entitled to such employment.  It was nonsense to suggest that the other people should just simply be fitted in there and used on the job as they had been previously when the employment was directed from a central office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>When decisions like this are being taken Departments of State are too prone to make decisions without worrying about what the little fellow at the bottom is going to do when the decision is finally put into operation.  It is unfair when a sizeable number of people, having been in employment for seven or eight months of the year, suddenly find there is no employment for them.  Over the years we have had considerable trouble in regard to people employed on these schemes.  This is one <Col N="1519" /> of the things that should be simplified now because they are being administered by local authorities.</P>
    <P>On the question of hours of work and wages, I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary, as an ordinary Deputy, has ever had to take up matters of this kind, but it was very difficult to try to find out what particular system was in operation in regard to hours of work or how the wages were related.  We had the ridiculous situation in at least one county where the ganger in charge was paid three hours overtime on a Saturday but the other men employed on the job were paid only their ordinary rate; in other words the ganger was working for 45 hours and three hours' overtime and the labourers for 48 hours.  It does not make sense and it is the sort of thing which is very difficult to explain to a group of men when talking about their conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a Bill was passed through the House and was referred to as the McQuillan Bill&mdash;it has been called other things.  The former Deputy Jack McQuillan proposed it as a Private Members' Bill.  It was subsequently taken over by the Government and passed here.  It allowed local authorities to take over public roads and certain laneways which had a certain amount of public amenity.  But for this the Special Employment Schemes Office would have been very much busier over the years, and I do not think it would have been possible for them to do what they have done in this case.  There is one thing on which we found it difficult to get a ruling and I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary can give a ruling on it: if such lanes are repaired under this scheme by the local authority, will the local authority be entitled to do this themselves?  Up until now the situation was that, if a group of farmers got together and repaired such a lane, the county council could not take it over; but since the situation now is that the local authorities themselves are carrying out the work, will there be an order to use such moneys for the purpose of doing a job like this and subsequently taking over the lane and <Col N="1520" /> making it a public road?  If the Parliamentary Secretary can give me a ruling on that before the debate concludes I should be very glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem in a number of counties that, because it was notified at one stage that the list of schemes in the Department was so great that there was a 12 months time lag, lots of people did not submit schemes who would otherwise have done so. The result was that when the money was being allocated the allocation was made on the basis of the amount of money which had been used in the previous year.  This was an unfair basis because it resulted in a number of counties who would normally have been carrying out schemes if they were allowed to do so suddenly finding they had 40 or 50 jobs on hand but had only £3,000 or £4,000 allocated to them.  My own constituency got about £3,500 and that amount of money is absolutely useless for the work they are anxious to do.</P>
    <P>There may be a system by which this could be revised.  I should like to know whether or not the idea is that when the next allocation is being made it will be on some other basis because it cannot be based on the previous year.  If it is, then it will be at such a figure for years to come; there will be no change in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that despite some of the reforms that have taken place in the prison service, in general the detention service is in need of what I would call a facelift.  It is in need of a completely new approach on the part of the State to the grading of the personnel in the service and to the kind of training they should undergo. We should inaugurate, as we have done in the case of the Garda Síochána, a general introductory training course for those who join what I would prefer to call the detention service rather than the prison service.  We should have a general course for those who wish to become members of the State detention service.  We should have a completely new approach to both the training and the status of that service.  Although there have been some improvements there is still a tendency to regard the person working in the detention service as little better than what he was in other days, namely the keeper of the criminal classes who are doomed to remain in that state for ever, to regard him merely as their keeper on behalf of society.  That tendency still lingers on in some official quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall putting a question to the Minister for Justice some months ago &mdash; I cannot recall who was the Minister then; there have been so many changes made by this Government that we should be forgiven for not remembering the names of Ministers of the day &mdash; asking him whether we were going to make any arrangements in the city whereby officers in the detention service could attend the appropriate university level courses to keep them up-to-date in any aspect of criminology or in any other area in which they should have refresher courses.  I cannot remember the exact reply but I got the impression from the Minister then that the idea of an officer in the detention service attending a university in any capacity was some kind of heresy and that it was totally inappropriate to the training and grading of these <Col N="1522" /> officials.  From the Minister downwards we must change our ideas about the people in the detention service.  In view of the duties and responsibilities given to them today by society, and in view of our changed attitude to the whole question of criminals in custody &mdash; the fact that we believe such persons can be rehabilitated and in many cases made into useful citizens in society&mdash;the people who help in this process must be regarded as being on a pretty responsible level.  As such officers are given the task of helping to rehabilitate people in custody and ensuring that once again they become useful citizens, it is important that we should approach their occupations and conditions in the detention service with great seriousness.</P>
    <P>Regrettably the old attitude in regard to the single officer in the service still persists and he is still forced, because of a ridiculous convention, to return to the detention centre each evening by 11.30 p.m.  It does not seem to me that we are going the right way about attracting the right type of young person to this branch of the public service when we have this ridiculous convention still operating.  I do not know whether some people in the Department of Justice understand some of the present day social habits of young people today but it could be said at the very least that they do not include being home each night at 11.30.  We would certainly be putting a great handicap on the material prospects of any young man today if we said that he must return home each evening by 11.30 p.m.  This rule should be abolished as quickly as possible.  In addition, we should change immediately the requirement whereby the single person in the service is required to have quarters within the confines of the prison itself, within the detention centre.</P>
    <P>As I said, in 1968 it should be possible for us to imitate other more enlightened countries such as the Scandinavian countries, or Britain, or even that part of our country where, whatever their failures may be in other directions, they are more enlightened in this regard.  In Northern Ireland they allow single officers to live out.  If <Col N="1523" /> a young man is in the service it should not be considered part of the job that he should be regarded as a member of the overall security services of the detention centre.  This is what is implied by the requirement that he should return to the detention service by 11.30 p.m.  This is unfair to the individual and we should allow him to live out wherever this is possible.  If he does find accommodation outside we should not insist on the other part of this ridiculous convention, that £1 a week should be deducted from his salary for the accommodation provided within the centre.  That rule should also go.</P>
    <P>I hope that the next time we come to consider this Estimate, whoever will be here holding the seal of office, we will see that changes have been made in regard to these matters.  I cannot see any reason why this rule should be allowed to continue.  In addition, as part of the general boost to morale in the service, we should consider improving the quality of the uniform.  It is often thought that the duties of an officer in the detention service are confined in their operations and take place behind the prison walls but it should be remembered that like the Garda Síochána the officers in the detention service have to meet members of the public and they may have to spend a considerable amount of time escorting people who have been detained to the courts.  Therefore, they should have a certain smartness in their appearance in order to keep up the standard of the service.  At present a man may come off fatigue work and be expected to accompany someone in custody to the courts.  If we are looking at the question of uniforms the matter of better quality cloth should be considered, a quality better able to stand up to wear.  We should also consider the possibility of a more frequent issue of uniforms and that issue should include, as in the case of the Garda Síochána, the issue of shirts and so on, because this is an integral part of the uniform.  It is important that an officer's appearance should be smart at all times and this would help in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> We should, too, have a look at the position in which many servants of the State find themselves when they retire. A number of problems arise for those who have given their best years to the service of the State.  They are faced with the problem of finding housing accommodation on an already overcrowded market.  What help can be given to these people?  The accommodation available is severely limited.  It is not a sufficient answer to say that a man's gratuity should suffice to enable him to provide himself with housing accommodation.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this problem to see what can be done.  We cannot just sweep the problem under a mat and say that, once a man retires, he is no longer our problem.  We must make amends now for our years of neglect where these people are concerned. Their numbers are small.  There is no publicity attaching to their work and they, therefore, have difficulty in airing their grievances.  They have been neglected and it is time, even at this late stage, that we made amends.</P>
    <P>Some consideration will, I hope, be given to the suggestions I have made. I trust every step will be taken to obliterate the remnants of Victorianism attaching to the detention service.  As public representatives, we should all make it our business to visit these detention centres and report on conditions in them.  I trust that the process of improvement already initiated by the Department will continue.  We must cease to regard these centres as sacro-sanct, as places which must not be mentioned in public.  I believe conditions in every part of the Public Service should be discussed in public.  This is the place to raise such matters in an effort to bring about some improvement. When facts are brought to our attention it is our duty to mention them here.  I trust the Minister will look into the matters I have raised and I trust that, next year, we will have no scope for criticism, even in matters of detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring a few matters to the attention of the Minister.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure was referred to <Col N="1525" /> by the Minister.  I should like to remind the Minister that there have been various resolutions by Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce calling for a district court and a circuit court for Dún Laoghaire.  A deputation from Dún Laoghaire Corporation to the Minister's predecessor withdrew the application for a circuit court, but I want to bring to the notice of the Minister the present position with regard to the district court and to ask him to redraw the court areas.</P>
      <P>A large section of Sallynoggin has at present to litigate in the district court in Bray.  If a litigant is not satisfied with the decision of the district court in Bray he then finds himself in the position of having to go to the Wicklow circuit court.  That position arises because the Shankill district court area was added to Bray district court area. I suggest to the Minister that the line should be drawn at the bridge over the old railway at Shankill.  People living at points between there and Dún Laoghaire would be better suited by going to Dún Laoghaire rather than to Bray.</P>
      <P>Much the same position obtains in Stillorgan.  There you have both the Dublin Metropolitan district court area and the Kilmainham district court area. It would be easier for the people in the Stillorgan area to go either to Dún Laoghaire, to which they could get the 46A bus, or go into Dublin to the Dublin metropolitan district court instead of having to go to Kilmainham court, to which there is no direct bus route.  People affected have to take a bus into Dublin and another bus out to Kilmainham; en route to Kilmainham they find themselves passing the Dublin metropolitan district court.  The areas should be redrawn to facilitate litigants as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite sure whether the resolution passed by Dún Laoghaire Corporation and other bodies in Dún Laoghaire necessarily means that the people of Dún Laoghaire want to have a Dún Laoghaire district court.  By that I mean that they do not necessarily want to have a Dún Laoghaire district court, Court No. so and so.  I think they would be satisfied with an outrider <Col N="1526" /> court of the Dublin metropolitan district court sitting in Dún Laoghaire Courthouse.  I do not know if the Minister has ever visited the Dún Laoghaire court but I would remind him that it has parking accommodation and is a court that could be used.  I think, and people of Dún Laoghaire think, it should be used more than it is used at present.</P>
    <P>If one turns to the circuit court, I think one will find that certain parts of Killiney, and from there on into Bray, do not litigate in the Dublin Circuit Court but have to litigate in Wicklow. I think that is a position that should be changed also.</P>
    <P>Regarding a Circuit Court for Dún Laoghaire, as I say, the deputation which came from the Dún Laoghaire Corporation withdrew that request for a separate Circuit Court for Dún Laoghaire but I think that, again Dún Laoghaire could be used for certain sittings of the Dublin Circuit Court.  I am somewhat in a difficulty here tonight because, like Deputy P.J. Burke who spoke earlier, I have no copy of this report, the Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, and, anyway it would be rather difficult to follow it without having a map.  The Minister has said that he has sent a copy of this interim report to various people but I notice he does not name the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association nor does he name the Society of Young Solicitors although I think both of those bodies would be vitally interested in any re-organisation and might have many suggestions to make to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a record number of 1,493 adoptions which took place in the year 1967. Like him, I welcome this.  However, I think the time is now ripe for the Minister to have another look at the Adoption Act.  First of all, I should like to suggest that he consider the raising of the age for adoption.  The present ceiling is either seven or nine years of age and I think the time is now ripe to raise it still further.  In that regard might I inquire if the Minister would have another look at the section of that Act which precludes the partners of a marriage between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant from <Col N="1527" /> being allowed to adopt a child.  In this day and age, that is a matter that might perhaps be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I should like to start, before I get on to more general matters, with a particularly urgent problem in my constituency and that is the difficulties that unfortunately have been arising from time to time in the Limerick District Court.  I understand that representations have been made a number of times to the Minister in an effort to solve these difficulties but, so far, there has been no success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying that I am not in any way critical of the learned justice who sits in Limerick city.  He performs remarkable feats of endurance and patience under most trying circumstances.  The position in Limerick is that the district court, summary district court, which sits on a Friday at 10.30 a.m. is frequently not finished until 8 or 9 o'clock at night.  The result is that the learned justice is sitting for eight or nine hours.  They are not 300 trivial matters such as double parking or bicycle lamps, and so on.  Fifty of those cases may be serious matters carrying possibly long terms of imprisonment, on conviction&mdash;matters on which a defendant would be entitled to every possible <Col N="1528" /> consideration.  I myself on one occasion had finished in the district court in Limerick at 9.30 p.m., having been there since 10.30 a.m., and the court was not finished at that time.  I do not go there very often now but I am told by my colleagues and by members of the general public who have recourse to the court that it is still frequently sitting, unfortunately, until 7 or 8 p.m.&mdash;and even then the court is not finished.  The learned justice&mdash;very properly, in my view&mdash; decides to adjourn any further cases rather than keep people there any longer.</P>
    <P>The root of the problem probably is that there is only one day a week made available specifically for the hearing of criminal cases in Limerick city. There are sittings on other days for Limerick rural district court area. There are sittings of the Limerick district civil court, but the vast bulk of the work is done in the Limerick city district criminal court and these matters are expected to be disposed of in one day, a physical impossibility, particularly when one bears in mind that Cork city, about twice the size of Limerick, has a district justice of its own who sits every day of the week to deal with Cork city alone.</P>
    <P>The learned justice who sits in Limerick also has to preside at five or six other district courts in various parts of County Limerick, County Clare and County Tipperary.  One of the district courts is as far away as Thurles.  It is a burden that is too much for one man and I appeal to the Minister to attempt to lessen the size of District No. 14 in order that the learned justice who sits there will be confined more or less to Limerick city and the immediate surrounding area.  As it is, he must work in the whole of County Limerick, in County Clare, practically the whole of the North Riding of Tipperary and a certain section of Tipperary South Riding also.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Minister's speech that he proposes to introduce legislation shortly to deal with the Registry of Deeds.  I do not think the public in general realise the archaic methods still being used in the Registry <Col N="1529" /> of Deeds.  A precis or summary of every deed executed has to be written out on goatskin parchment and registered in the Registry of Deeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time today I heard the Minister answering a question on the subject of delays in respect of Land Registry maps.  He admitted there were excessive delays but I am afraid that maps are not the only subject of delay in the Land Registry.  There are frequently delays in excess of 12 months with regard to dealings in land registration.  I know there are staff problems in the Land Registry, but the Minister should be prepared to spend considerable sums of money, if necessary, to try to overcome these staff problems in order that these appalling delays can be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the results of these delays, brought home to me clearly in recent months, was when there was an increase in mortgage rates some months ago.  A great many people who had applied for and had been passed for loans at the previous lower rate found themselves burdened with the higher rate simply because of delay in the Land Registry in getting their titles registered.  The local authority would not give the loans until new folios had been opened and leases registered.  The <Col N="1530" /> delays are often up to 12 months and I know of cases in excess of that period.  The average delay in getting a deed registered, involving a change of ownership or a similar dealing, is in the region of six months.  I know the Minister is cognisant of this problem, but I add my voice to that of others in urging him to try to overcome it more speedily.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that legislation to increase the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts, presumably on the civil side, is imminent.  This is urgently needed.  The civil jurisdiction of the district court is £50 which is quite ludicrous.  The most minor accident today results in damage or injury exceeding £50.  The result is that the time of the court is used for very little except the collection of small debts.  I suggest that the appropriate figure for the district court is £300.  My figure for the jurisdiction of the circuit court would be £1,500 or £2,000.  Certainly a substantial increase on the present figure is called for.  At present somebody who is involved in a serious accident from which he might hope to recover £700 damages is forced to take proceedings in the High Court, not always a very rewarding occupation for a litigant.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Criminal Justice Bill which I hope to see before the House shortly for a Second Reading. I do not with to go into the details of it now but I hope one or two sections which appear to be controversial will not prevent the great bulk of the Bill from getting the consideration it deserves because the Bill is a splendid effort, indeed, to bring our criminal law up to date in many important respects.</P>
    <P>I notice also that the Minister intends to revise the malicious injuries code.  I am glad to see that he proposes to bring in some system of compensation for physical and personal injuries as opposed to damage to property.  We had such a system previously but it was done away with in the 1920s.  It is a very welcome measure and I hope that when it is introduced the cost of it will be borne by the Exchequer rather than by local rates.  If the Minister sees fit, as I suggest he should do, to make <Col N="1531" /> the cost of compensation for personal injuries a national charge, he should avail of that opportunity also to make compensation for damage to property a national charge because we have had experience in recent years of heavy decrees being given in counties and cities that were not at all well able to bear them.</P>
    <P>In recent years there was a claim for £120,000 in Limerick which, very fortunately from the point of view of the ratepayers, was dismissed.  If it had been awarded it would have meant something in the region of 11/- in the £ on the rates.  There have been substantial decrees given in other counties and, the value of property increasing as it is, I do not think the risk should be taken in the future of saddling an innocent community with, for them, such enormous sums of money.  This should be made a national charge.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that under the present Minister law reform seems to be proceeding satisfactorily in the Department.  I am glad to see such activity in the Department in that respect.  A number of commissions are sitting to advise the Minister and the Department on various aspects of law reform and I urge the Minister to try to implement the findings of these commissions as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long but there are a few matters to which I should like to refer, the question of law reform and also the question of court practice and procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one thing referred to by Deputy P.J. Burke which I think deserves further consideration.  It is a suggestion that the Swords Court is to lose value as a court and that in effect cases from the Swords area, which stretches from Santry to Donabate and from Lusk to Garretstown, which is a very wide area, are to be taken to Dublin.  If somebody is arrested on what may turn out to be a trivial offence his case must be taken to Inns Quay.  The man must come up and then he is referred back to Swords.  It seems a blundering type of thing which should not be proceeded with.  The <Col N="1532" /> Minister will see a difficulty which could arise and which seems to be entirely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Another thing proposed is that all children's cases must be taken to Dublin. The case made for that is that probationary service is better in Dublin than in the country.  It is almost non-existent in the country.  I wonder can the Minister envisage children in the Garretstown district, which is near the Meath border, being charged with some offence and going to court in Dublin.  First, they must be taken into Balbriggan or near Balbriggan to get a bus into Dublin to the Busaras.  Then they must be taken across town to where the case is being heard and finally back again.  This course is recommended without consideration for the needs of the people living in the country districts.  Possibly this is because of the fact that there does not seem to be anybody on the committee from the country district.  It seems to be a Dublin idea.  They seem to feel that so long as the Dublin end is looked after it does not matter about the country district.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to licensing applications.  I would hate to think that these cases should be allocated to somebody practising in Dublin.  Normally it means they must now be taken in Dublin.  In the case of civil bills, for instance, somebody who normally went to Swords must now come into Dublin.  Perhaps, the Minister will agree that in some cases this will result in decrees being given against them because they will not attend.  They will find it impossible to attend.  I understand one of the reasons given in the recommendation was that the people concerned, the hire purchase companies who would be dealing with these, mostly had offices in Dublin.  If that is so it is a ridiculous suggestion.  This affects the people against whom the charge is being taken&mdash;they may be people of very limited means who really should receive more consideration than the people who talked them into taking out hire purchase agreements which they were unable to meet. The hire purchase gentlemen are facilitated by having these cases heard in Dublin.  They are in a far better position <Col N="1533" /> to travel to Swords to have the cases heard than the unfortunate people from the Garretstown or Donabate areas are, who if this is put into operation would have to travel to Dublin and home again.  If they are working people they would lose a whole day which, I think, is wrong.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, I was engaged in certain work on the Constitution which required a minute examination of the Constitution.  One of the things we did was to look into every letter and every word of the Constitution and if I remember rightly it was suggested that so far as possible in courts of justice that justice should be done locally.  Is this being taken into account in putting this recommendation into operation?</P>
    <P>With regard to the Balbriggan Court, the administration is to be from Dublin.  Normally a district justice is allocated to an area and over a period of years in that area he knows those who come before him and the type of crime which normally happens there and he has a certain way of dealing with them.  In my opinion it is wrong that a situation could arise where there would be a different justice at every court and, perhaps, the administration of justice would appear to be lopsided. Something for which there is a heavy penalty one time could receive a light penalty another time.  The old lag could go in there and because there is a strange justice might talk himself out of a situation.  This could happen very much more often if the new arrangement is put into operation.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why a new district should not be made in Kilmainham with Kilmainham, Swords and Balbriggan, and have one justice do the rounds and have one court a week in each place?  At the present time there are two courts a month, both fairly full.  This is not the way to do things at all and we suggested&mdash; and I mentioned in Private Members' Business&mdash;trying to remove the administration of many things from the city.  People talk about having this done.  Here we have a case in which somebody decided that unless everything is controlled and done from Dublin it could not be properly done <Col N="1534" /> and people who live in Dublin even if they sell on hire-purchase should be facilitated while the unfortunates who live in the country will not be taken into account at all.  I do not want to say anything more about that, but it is my opinion that the Minister should give grave consideration to this before he decides to accept the recommendation, even if it is a unanimous recommendation by the committee.  It is a unanimous decision of the committee without taking into consideration all its effects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Garda, we have had much criticism from time to time about the way the police act.  I believe that the police in this country are doing a wonderful job under grave provocation.  We all know we have at the present time throughout the country and throughout the world people who are against everything and who would just love to start a row of some kind.  These people consider that it is their mission in life to protest and by protesting they mean hitting somebody they feel will not hit them back with bottle or baton.  The police in this country have been doing a good job particularly over the last year or so and have shown great restraint.  I have condemned in this House on some occasions acts of violence carried out by members of the force.  I should like to pay tribute to the Garda.  They are doing exceptionally well.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that the type of new recruit being accepted into the force seems to be improving. About two years ago there were young Gardaí in the force who certainly did not appear to be of the same calibre as those who went before them.  They were prepared to give the short answer to anybody who asked them a question and to be pretty stringent with somebody caught committing a minor traffic offence.  They have grown out of that and the new people who have now joined the force certainly do not adopt the same tactics.</P>
    <P>Most of the Gardaí at present are doing a good job but the Minister might have a look at two things.  First, the number of Gardaí must be increased, because it is just too bad that there are not sufficient Gardaí to <Col N="1535" /> deal with crime.  Secondly, the Gardaí must be adequately remunerated. I am glad that a commission has been set up to investigate this matter.  I would ask the Minister and the people on the commission to remember that, when somebody who has been badly paid suddenly gets a substantial increase, it is likely to cause an outcry.  This outcry should not be heeded.  I believe that the substantial increase which has been recommended for the Gardaí should be paid by the Government without any attention being paid to those who will raise their hands in horror.  I believe the Gardaí are doing a good job and the only way to keep them is by paying them properly.</P>
    <P>I do not know how musical the Minister is but perhaps he will at his leisure have a look at what happened to the Garda Band and see if it would not be a good idea to restore it.  Perhaps it was shortage of funds which prompted the Minister's predecessor to chop it off so ruthlessly.  It was a pity it should have happened.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to something I have mentioned on practically every occasion I have spoken on this Estimate. That is the question of district justices.  We have in this country a group of district justices who are doing a very good job.  The only fault I have to find with some of them is that they tend to be too lenient with the criminal type.  I believe that when a cold-blooded person appears in court for doing some blackguardly act it is a bit of a joke if that person can succeed in getting away with it again and again or, perhaps, he may put on the poor mouth and persuade the justice to give him a light sentence.</P>
    <P>District justices, on the whole, are dispensing justice courteously and well, but there are one or two exceptions. I had occasion here before to refer to a personal incident when a district justice abused me when I appeared as a witness in a court case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He got his own back before I left the court.  I understand <Col N="1536" /> that this still happens with the odd district justice.  It is no excuse to say that he is ill.  If he is, he should not be on the bench; if he has ulcers he should have them treated; if there is something wrong with his head, there is a place for him, too; if he abuses witnesses or tries to be funny, there is also a place for him.  The stage has been reached where they are attacking solicitors and counsel and they feel that they are perfectly entitled to do this.  However, for the most part they are a decent body of men doing a good job.  If a man is too ill to be on the bench he should take a few months off until he is well enough to do his job properly.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the Malicious Injuries Act.  It has been suggested by the Minister that he proposes to introduce legislation to ensure that injuries to persons as well as to property will be dealt with.  I believe that the Malicious Injuries Act should be dealt with in a different way.  As far as I can see the only people who wish the Act to remain as it is are the insurance companies.  They seem to be doing quite well, while the unfortunate ratepayers throughout the country are paying again and again for something which should be adequately covered by insurance.  It is not good enough that this should continue.</P>
      <P>In my district recently some blackguard blew up a bus.  I am quite sure that when we are striking the rate next year for the county council we shall have to make provision for the cost of that bus.  I am sure that bus was adequately insured and that it is the insurance company who should pay.  In another area more than one bus was blown up.  These heroes who go around freeing Ireland by doing malicious damage should be responsible and, if not they, the insurance companies who take money for insuring property of that nature should be held responsible. The responsibility should not be on the unfortunate ratepayers who have no reason to feel guilty about it in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Injuries to persons, particularly those who go to the assistance of Gardaí, should be adequately covered.  As the Minister knows, agreement on such legislation was reached recently in <Col N="1537" /> another country.  Damage to property should be dealt with in a different way. It was introduced as a punitive measure &mdash;the collective punishment system. Why should we continue with collective punishment?  I do not see enough of the punishment being carried out on the people who perpetuated it.  Very often the children of wealthy parents get away scot free when they do damage and it is the ratepayers who have to pay.  If the Minister could think of some way of getting around this problem, I believe it would be appreciated to a great extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred also to the Adoption Board.  The Adoption Board are doing a good job, but I agree with Deputy Dockrell's reference to the question of adoption by people of different religion.  This is something which could be looked into.  I do not wish to meddle in church affairs&mdash;there are enough people doing that&mdash;but I feel that this is a matter which should be given attention.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion, too, that the Adoption Board are too stringent in their regulations regarding adoptive parents.  Perhaps it was necessary to be strict in the early days of the Adoption Board, but I feel that at present there is not a necessity to be so strict.  If it could be eased slightly it would possibly help in a big way. It makes a big difference to a child reared in a institution whether it is boarded out to people who have little responsibility for it except that they are paid for keeping it until the child is old enough to do work, or whether it is given to people who adopt it into a home where it is treated as a member of a family.  This should be taken into consideration and, if at all possible, the regulations regarding adoption should be less stringent than they are.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to traffic wardens and I wish he had not.  I was about to say that these would be under the Department of Local Government and any reference to them here would be ruled out of order.  When the Road Traffic Bill was going through the House a number of Deputies referred to the fact that ex-Gardaí were to be <Col N="1538" /> appointed at low wages.  What we told them is what has happened.  I am one of those who believe that membership of the Garda Síochána is an honourable position and that people who serve in the force until they reach pension age should get a decent pension.  To have them taken on again as a kind of half-garda with a most peculiar type of uniform&mdash;I did see milkmen some years ago wearing something like it except that they did not have a blue collar but this is the nearest thing I can think of&mdash;and doing that work at a low wage is not the way to do it.  I am in agreement with the necessity to relieve the gardaí of this type of duty and replace them with somebody else.  I would prefer to see young people, who would perhaps later on become gardaí, or junior recruits who had passed the Garda examination but who were not called, doing this work and paid a decent wage rather than have the situation that exists.</P>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the people doing this work but it is too bad that these men when they have gone into honourable retirement&mdash;and it must be because their pensions are not good enough&mdash;have to come back to do something with which they thought they would be finished a few years ago.  It is not right.  Other persons should be employed on this work and paid a decent wage.  The Minister says that 97,000 fine-on-the-spot notices were issued for contraventions of the parking bye-laws and similar offences and in slightly less that 15,000 of those cases there were prosecutions.  There were 97,000 on-the-spot fines and this would, therefore, compensate for the employment of people and the payment of a decent wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not pay for the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will never have a referendum like that again. The Minister has referred to the fact that there has been an increase under subhead B which deals with travelling and expenses, and he says that there has been a threefold expansion in the radio service.  I agree that the equipping <Col N="1539" /> of a number of gardaí with radio has improved the efficiency of the service very much and nobody will grudge the extra money required to pay for something like that.</P>
      <P>The one thing which is rather alarming is the number of crimes under various headings and the fact that the Minister refers to a high rate of detection. He says that it is 64 per cent and that this is away beyond what is achieved in any other country the statistics of which we have studied. This does not get away from the fact that a certain percentage of criminals are not caught.  I know that larcenies of pedal cycles, and so on, are included. Perhaps there could be some way in future years in which the Minister could take pedal cycles&mdash;the larceny of pedal cycles is not in the same category as other offences&mdash;and list them separately.</P>
      <P>The incidence of car stealing in this city has reached a stage it is hard to believe possible.  Somebody said in a newspaper that there was an average of 18 cars per day &ldquo;temporarily mislaid&rdquo;&mdash;that was the term used.  If that is so something special must be done to try and prevent this sort of thing going on.  It means that that number of uninsured cars are careering around the city and country.  An extra effort should be made to try and prevent this.  This is where I would condemn the district justices who have young brats, some of whom confess to having stolen as many as a dozen cars, being brought before them and who tell them to be good boys.  I think that is wrong, no matter who these offenders are.  In many cases they are people who come from good, or shall I say, wealthy homes and they should be dealt with the same as if they came out of a cabin.  The one way to deal with them and teach them that this will not be taken from them is to give them a good, stiff sentence.  If this were done a few times the incidence of car stealing would drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to witnesses expenses, I am glad to see that a new system for paying these expenses is being introduced. I happened to have to make representations to the Minister's predecessor on half a dozen occasions on <Col N="1540" /> behalf of unfortunate working men who had been unwilling witnesses. They were taken to court and lost half a day's pay plus travelling expenses, which they could not afford.  In one case it was two years before payment was made.  The sum involved was small to the Department of Justice but for a man earning £10 a week to have to be without £4 of it for a period of two years is not good enough.  I am glad that arrangements are now being made to have these expenses disposed of more quickly.</P>
    <P>I was about to say something about extradition but in view of the situation at present it might be safer to say nothing.</P>
    <P>With regard to prisons, I should like to say that trying to help prisoners who are about to be discharged and making an effort to get jobs for them is certainly, apart from anything else, a work of charity.  I am glad efforts are being made towards this end.  I believe our prisons are reasonably comfortable, as long as we remember that people do not go to prison to be comfortable. Otherwise, there would be no prisons at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to young offenders there is something wrong when the Minister states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Because of inadequate accommodation it was not possible to transfer from prisons to St. Patrick's young offenders who might derive more benefit from treatment in the latter institution and this has made it necessary to explore further the question of additional or alternative accommodation for the inmates of St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on further to say that accommodation is being found for from 50 to 60 boys in another institution.  This is a step in the right direction but I feel that since we have (a) apparently a sizeable number of this type of offender and (b) a growing number of this age group, as is mentioned further on in the Minister's brief something should be done as a matter of urgency to find extra accommodation to deal with them.  The one thing that will make a criminal out of a young offender is putting him in with <Col N="1541" /> old lads who will not be very long teaching him all the tricks which kept them behind bars for so many years. Every penny spent on this would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I know Artane comes under a different heading.  Otherwise I would be asking the Minister if he could say anything about the Artane Band and what is going to happen there.  However, it belongs to another Department so I suppose it is not possible for him to give any information on it.</P>
    <P>I have had some communication with the Minister since he has taken over office.  I have got courteous replies to all my letters.  His officials, on the occasions on which I have found it necessary to communicate with them, have been very courteous and I am glad to make the comment that throughout the country any time I have met the public face of the law which is the Garda, from the ordinary garda up to chief superintendent, all of them have been more than courteous and willing to assist in any way they could.  I think that is what we should require of a police force and particularly the way in which they have been handling incidents which have been occurring in this city over the past few months proves that they are made of the right stuff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins I would like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the Garda Síochána from the top down, especially to the men who went out and founded the Force and founded law and order in the country.  They have the respect of all right-thinking citizens.</P>
      <P>During the fight for freedom it was the policy of the old IRA to close down all the RIC stations.  There was a purpose in that and it worked very well.  Now I think there is a similar policy abroad today and the Minister made a statement which I think is a double-barrelled statement.  The Minister states:</P>
      <P>It is clear that, if our police service is to maintain or improve on its standards of service, its strength must be increased fairly substantially...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But he adds the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  We all agree that there is need for more <Col N="1542" /> gardaí.  Every speaker has stressed that point today and before we finish I suppose we will have other Deputies doing so.  After the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; we read:</P>
    <P>....the existing structure must be overhauled so that the distribution of the force will reflect the needs of each locality and, in particular, requirements in relation to serious crime.</P>
    <P>He goes on further and talks about vehicles and the number of cars in the Force.  In other words, we are going to have what is known as the squad car effort.  This in its place is laudable but I think it is not the view of many people throughout the country who have realised that it is the intention to close down many stations.  That was lost in the fog of PR over the past few months and the people thought it was shelved but as I read it here it is at the back of the Minister's mind.  The people in the country feel that they are entitled to protection.  Are the people to be left at the mercy of the mechanised marauder we see on &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; when we hear that this house and that house has been broken into?  Before Christmas we will hear of many a turkey disappearing and the culprit will not be the fox.</P>
    <P>I read in a local paper in my county of a young garda who, at great risk to himself, entered a blazing train and removed explosives which were liable to cause great damage and possibly loss of life.  This garda's name rings a bell with me.  His name is Garda McCurtin.  I never met the man. He is no connection or no friend of mine but this is the second occasion on which this man has performed something of an heroic nature.  I feel it is only right to mention this.  We are critical at times of the Garda so we should not let this occasion pass without paying a tribute.  I would respectfully ask the Minister to pass on that tribute to the garda's superiors.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years I have noticed the great success of the Garda Boat Club.  It brings to mind the great victories of a former Garda Boxing Club.  They were internationally famous men who brought great credit to this country.  I think it would be a good thing to see this brought back <Col N="1543" /> because you can see the respect that is paid to any garda who is trained in the art of self-defence.  Mind you, there is great respect shown by some of the young blackguards in parts of the country when one of these men comes on the scene.  He does not have to do anything.  They know he has the power to deal with any situation that may arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to sound a note of warning to the Minister.  While you have in the Garda Síochána men of the highest calibre it may not be so easy to keep those men on.  When one looks at the conditions under which they have to work and the hours they have to work and compares them with conditions abroad it is not easy to expect men to remain on in the Force. The Minister should look at a few of the little things I should like to mention. One thing is the condition of our Garda barracks in places.  They are damp, black old holes.  I heard of one man who was brought into the day-room and thought it was the black hole.  When he was told it was the dayroom he said: &ldquo;If this is the day-room, God help me if I was put in the black hole.&rdquo;  There are many of those dayrooms around the country.  It is something like our schools which had been let go to rack and ruin. I have seen barracks in which a young garda hung up a uniform and found it covered with green mould a few days later.  Such conditions do not encourage young men to remain on.  Something should be done to improve things for them.</P>
    <P>At a time when so many banners are being carried throughout the country we should take another look at an element associated with this activity. There are many banners with which we thoroughly agree but one finds a certain element following all the banners irrespective of what they advocate. This element I should like to see weeded out.  It is the element of troublemakers.  Unless they are weeded out before the parades&mdash;I have seen them in London and Dublin but thank God not yet in my own town&mdash;these elements make things very difficult for <Col N="1544" /> the forces of law and order.  There are words that are easily used by these elements, the words &ldquo;police brutality&rdquo;. This term is becoming international but I think there is not enough brutality for some of these gentlemen and it is time the authorities had another look at them and realised that they are there to make trouble. That should be anticipated before it happens.</P>
    <P>In regard to sales of bicycles the owners of which have not been traced, could the possibility be examined of having these machines registered?  The bicycle is the small man's motor car and may make the difference between having a job and not having one.  I understand the matter has been examined before but when one sees these bicycles piling up in local barracks, their owners untraced, it is time some form of registration was introduced, even with a fee if necessary.  I should like the Minister to examine that because the bicycle means a great deal to those who use it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned payment of State witnesses but I do not see any mention of payment for the loss sustained by jury men.  This causes much worry and if we want justice to be done and seen to be done it should be done all round.  Unfortunate workers who can ill afford it sometimes have to stand around for a fortnight without a penny.</P>
    <P>I notice reference to the training of first offenders who have been convicted and it says here that they are trained in such things as decorating and vehicle driving.  Is it easy for some of these to get a licence to drive when many people find it so hard?</P>
    <P>I have been criticised on this account before but I make no apology for repeating my argument in this House as regards the return of the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; in cases where young criminals make murderous attacks on old people who may have saved a few pounds to ensure a decent burial.  I make no apology for advocating the return of the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; although we may have outbursts by some people who will go around with banners saying: &ldquo;Do away with the `cat' &rdquo;. The defence of blackguards should not be attempted and we should adopt a sane approach in this matter.  Deputy <Col N="1545" /> Tully mentioned the finger-wagging of the Bench and the admonition not to do it again and then the criminal is let off.  It is time we put our priorities right in this matter.</P>

      <P>This Estimate covers practically all activities of the Department and what falls naturally into a number of subheads is set out in the Minister's opening statement.  Some of these are interlinked; others are not obviously connected.  I should like to begin with a few words about the Garda as other Deputies have done.  We are unanimous in praise of our police force but the police force or the Garda, no more than any other human institution, will not thrive merely on compliments and pleasant words.  If our police force in the modern setup we now have here is to be effective it must have certain facilities and it must have the support of the people.  From our point oi view the first question to ask is: what is the basic element that goes into a police force?  No matter how much we talk about mechanisms, about cars, radios and such things the basic unit is the man, the individual garda. To express my own view, I think our police force is under strength for our requirements, having regard to modern conditions.  We need more men in the Force and, as the Minister himself remarked in his statement, more men available for what are properly police duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to think&mdash;and it has been suggested to me&mdash;that financial restrictions would come into this matter of keeping the Force up to the strength needed.  What that strength should be is a matter for expert examination, I freely concede, but I should like to ask the Minister if we have been in the position in recent times when we could get recruits and there were financial restrictions to prevent us getting them. It was said in the very recent past that the recruits were not on offer but I would not be talking as I am now if I had not a reason for asking this question&mdash;not having very precise information I am merely putting it as a question&mdash;have the Garda been able to recruit what is available, because it is vitally important that they should?  Have financial restrictions, <Col N="1546" /> what I might call ordinary budget restrictions, Department of Finance restrictions, if I may put it that way, been operating to the detriment of the Garda?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back over old ground but the reason I raise the point at all is that it happened more than 20 years ago that it was my job to review the situation of the recruitment to the Defence Forces before the last war and the story of the dead hand of the administration was an appalling one from whose consequences we only escaped by a very fortunate concatenation of causes in 1939 and 1940.  This is not the Estimate on which to go into detail but I mention that fact to ground the fears that I have in this case that it could happen.  If recruits were available to bring the Garda up to a strength that would be desirable, I should like to be reassured that no mere financial restrictions have operated in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not making that point merely as a criticism of any other Department. The Department of Finance have their job to do and I do not mean it to be taken as a criticism of the Department of Finance but in relation to one very fundamental thing about police duties.  The efficient functioning of a police force depends on having sufficient men available for the jobs in hand and as far as I can see&mdash;maybe I am wrong; I have not any figures&mdash;but from a casual impression, looking at the strength of the police forces across the Atlantic, on the Continent of Europe and across the water in Britain, I rather think that the strength of our police force may, perhaps, be a little low.  I should not say &ldquo;a little low&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; might be the better word.</P>
    <P>In that connection there is a very interesting comment to be made on something that happened in London only a week ago.  I was not there myself but from reading newspaper reports and from what I have heard directly, the police force in London were able to deal with what could have been an extremely ugly situation in a very competent way and, what is more, in a very restrained manner, and got a very favourable press all over the world for <Col N="1547" /> their behaviour&mdash;an unarmed police force which did not even go so far as drawing their batons, collectively anyway.</P>
    <P>That is all very admirable and that is a very fine ideal and one that I should like to see here but let us who are talking about this problem not blind ourselves to the fact that that excellent performance of that police force depended, first, on having the numbers. If you look carefully at what happened in London you will see that there was a very strong force available, a force that was so strong that it was possible for it to function in the way it did. This is a vital point in this question of responsible police action in the mass. I am not taking away from the high organisation and the good leading.  That is the second factor that comes into the situation.  The point I want to emphasise for the purpose of this Estimate is the numbers that were there. In dealing with things like that, difficulties often arise where you have an insufficient number of men, who are then attacked in such a way that they have no option but to act in a way that people afterwards will feel was a little harsh.</P>
    <P>Let us understand this&mdash;and the ultimate responsibility comes back on us&mdash;in that London demonstration there were enough police there to keep the situation under control.  There was a big enough body and even the moral effect of that prevented further undesirable things happening.  But, if you have only a handful of unfortunate gardaí, first of all, there is a temptation to rush them and get the better of them and, secondly, in that situation a small body of men trying to enforce order, if they have not got the mass behind them, have a very simple but horrible choice&mdash;either not to do their duty, or else, in the doing of their duty they are forced to act in a way that could be avoided if the strength of the Force were sufficient.</P>
    <P>The same thing goes for crime in general, especially in highly-organised modern cities.  If you have a weak police force and it is not properly backed up, then the individual policeman will be the victim very often of the criminal.  I remember in the past <Col N="1548" /> year raising this point about the undesirability of unfortunate gardaí being left singly patrolling parts of my own constituency at night time.  We have all known of cases of gardaí who have been seriously injured.  I pleaded here years ago that they should patrol in pairs.  This has helped very materially with the squad car and radio contact. I know that is so.  The point I want to make is that by the very fact that you have a police force of sufficient strength you have won nearly half the battle of order, quite apart from the fact that you are also ensuring that the morale of the force is maintained. Therefore, the first plea that I should like to make to the Minister is to see that in future, even if we have to pinch in other directions, the strength, and particularly the available strength, of the Garda Síochána be maintained.</P>
    <P>Granted the strength, we have now a second consideration&mdash;the remuneration of the policeman.  I do not want to go into this in any detail, nor do I want to go into it in connection with the specific circumstances of the moment, but I want to talk about a principle.  In the 19th century and in the early part of the 20th century here and, indeed, in many other places as well, there was a tendency to think that when everything is arranged in the administrative office, life is ordered.  The people in the administrative offices are vitally important, too, but there is a tendency to think that the whole community completely depends on the man in the office&mdash; whether I start with the Minister himself down to the whole of the public service organisation&mdash;and that everything else is completely subordinate. I think we are getting to the stage when it might be very useful for governments and administrators to remember that their position and the ultimate sanctions depend on the garda, just as the ultimate economy depends on the worker.  I would be digressing rather far in discussing the relative merits of people in a community but I have often thought that one of the things that are wrong with our modern civilisation is just this fact that the productive worker, the garda who maintains law and order, the person who is actually doing the work, is regarded as a worker, <Col N="1549" /> as being on a lower level to the administrator.  He is just as important in the community as any other branch of the public service or of the community as a whole and in assessing remuneration and status this factor should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail in regard to remuneration here but I should like to enunciate the principle that, whether it is the teacher, the Garda, the technical officer or any other member of the public service, these are as vital as any other section of the community and remuneration and conditions should be comparable. Graduations of responsibility in all parts of the public service will naturally carry their remuneration as well. In the last analysis it is on these categories I mentioned that the stability of the whole structure ultimately depends.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in asking the Minister the question I have asked about keeping up the strength of the force, I should like to mention the second principle, what I call the social evaluation and the social worth of the Gardaí. Lastly, of course, there comes in the question of facilities and technical equipment, which is receiving attention and, reading the Minister's speech, I do not think it calls for any other comment from us here than to say: Go ahead with that.  That is good work.</P>
    <P>The next thing is the availability of Gardaí for duty.  That is a difficult matter.  I notice the Minister refers to the absorption of the Gardaí in traffic duties.  It is an improvement to be able to shed off, in this city at any rate, the parking duties, and to bring in traffic wardens.  It might not be any harm to make this remark in parenthesis: these wardens will need a certain amount of support; the situation has become rather chaotic and they have, to say the least of it, a pretty tough job before them.  But granted these wardens, there will always be a necessity for certain traffic police, motor cycle police in particular.  I presume these problems are having attention, but the main function of a police force of preserving law and order in the community and protecting <Col N="1550" /> the law-abiding citizen should not be lost sight of, and it is for that essentially the Gardaí are needed.</P>
    <P>On many previous occasions with other Ministers here I have talked about the support of the Gardaí by officialdom and by the public.  It is vitally important that the good relations the Gardaí have established over 45 years with the community as a whole should be maintained.  On their side it means a certain amount of forbearance and courtesy, but they should also remember that they are esteemed and respected for the firmness and efficiency with which they do their duty.</P>
    <P>This comes back to the whole question of the morale of the force. Granting, as I say, the first two points I made&mdash;strength and working conditions and remuneration&mdash;it is vitally necessary that they should get the support of the community and, in particular, of the administration and of the courts.  I do not think it would be fair to suggest that they are not getting support from the Government and particularly from the Department of Justice. There can be no complaint with that Department on that score.  However, it has been far too often said that the Gardaí are very often not supported when it comes to the prosecution of a criminal apprehended, and that can arise in two ways.  The most dangerous way is where the criminal, because of a legal technicality or what I might call sloppy thinking, is able to thumb his nose at the Gardaí. Remember, a garda is a human being, and if the garda finds, having done his duty, that the result of it is that somebody who is guilty can turn around and sneer at him because he has been made into an object of pity, it is very disheartening. It is all right where that is a genuine case, but there are too many of the other type of case.  The garda who has that experience once or twice has a hard battle to keep up his morale and to do his duty.</P>
    <P>While I would not go so far as Deputy Coogan, my own approach to this is that, except in the case of first offenders&mdash;very often you can win them and I want to accept that, but I am referring to the cynical, hardened <Col N="1551" /> criminal&mdash;we must not make the mistake of sacrificing the community to the criminal.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that he should be unjustly treated or made an example of. However, we must weigh up whether the effect of what has been done is to sacrifice the law-abiding citizen.</P>
    <P>There have been many instances of violent crime where the perpetrators got off because somebody wanted to reform them.  They may be put in jail, a home from home, as it is now.  What about the person who has been assaulted?  What about the rights of the community and order in the community? What about the right of the law-abiding citizen to move abroad freely?  That is a side of the story that has to be looked into.  There is also the question of the morale of the Garda.  Everybody should be alert to these problems.</P>
    <P>I know the pattern is changing.  I know the pattern in the world is changing.  I know that problems of this nature are very difficult and that it is very easy to make black and white statements standing here and to make all reasonable allowances for the things that may be said and the arguments that can validly be advanced, but the old British system&mdash;and I make no apology for referring to it&mdash;as operated in England was a very fine one.  It went on the principle that the law was for all citizens without respect to persons and it was to be so administered impartially and there were courts and judges who did that.  The law was meticulously administered and gave the benefit of the doubt.  If there was a doubt it was given to the criminal because, as the maxim went, it is better that ten guilty persons should go free than that one innocent person should be convicted.</P>
    <P>Taking all that into account you had a judiciary, a judicial system and a legal framework uncomplicated by a lot of the psychiatry and psychosis that have come into modern life.  That in itself was a very just protection for the criminal and a very fine safeguard for the law-abiding citizen.  The way in which those judges functioned had the <Col N="1552" /> effect of keeping the police force up to scratch.  It was necessary for the police force to be efficient and to operate properly. Mark you, under that system if there was any dereliction of duty or abuse of power by the police the same court that protected the community from the criminal by means of a sentence of the court, which was duly executed afterwards, controlled the functioning of the police arm.  If a policeman was guilty of any particular crime, particularly of the abuse of his own duties and powers, merciless and exemplary sentences were imposed.</P>
    <P>There is still much to be said for that system but for its efficient working it presupposes certain things.  It presupposes, first, that the police force is efficiently organised and has the numbers to do the job; secondly, it presupposes that there is a code of law there that will enable the courts to take that impartial judicial view of each individual case, and, thirdly, it presupposes facilities and organisation for the execution of the sentence.  This is happening all over the world and is bound to happen.  I do not know what the answer to the problem is but it is bound to happen in huge conglomerate cities like New York or any other big city, and Dublin is becoming a big city now.  What are you going to do about it?  I know that half the trouble stems from the fact that nobody wants to maintain jails.  On more than one occasion I have been tempted&mdash; although I have not actually done it as I was not sure that the form in which I would do it would be in the public interest&mdash;to ask a question about culpable homicide.  I do not want a general answer to this; I just want to raise the thought.  I should like to know how many people convicted of culpable homicide have served a term at all comparable with the crime involved. I know that this is not peculiar to this country but it would be interesting to go back on the statistics of convictions for murder and serious assault and see exactly what happened. If these statistics were to be sought out one might have many questions to ask. One problem which the Department of Justice and the police are up against in all this is to some extent a financial <Col N="1553" /> problem, to cope with the post-sentence phase where the criminal is involved.</P>
    <P>I always remember the night we passed the Bill abolishing capital punishment.  A number of individuals thought that the ordinary human being does not want to see anybody, even the unfortunate murderer, being capitally punished.  My own view is that I would only consider this necessary where it is in the interests of the community. However, one has to keep that open and the murder of a Garda or a warder would be something which must be met in that way, or else the whole order falls.  However, that night some people in this House, some women, approached me and to my surprise they said: &ldquo;It is all right for you people but if you had to move around as we have to, returning home from our jobs at 11 o'clock at night you would know what it means to run the danger of assault or of having the few pounds you have on you taken from you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was said to me in this House. I do not want to be more specific because it might identify the people and the class who said it but I never forgot it.  It is a thought that we should keep in our minds in dealing with this whole problem of the police and the problem of dealing with crime.  Ninety per cent of the community are law-abiding, useful citizens and it is they who suffer and they who pay if law and order are not maintained.  That mere fact alone must point to the vital importance of the Garda and of warders in prison. Before moving from this aspect I should also like to repeat what I have said on many previous occasions, that where a warder or a Garda is injured in the course of his duty adequate compensation should be available, the criminal responsible should be dealt with accordingly and the law enforced in such a way that the probability of similar occurrences would be reduced to very small proportions.  What I have said here is not to be taken in any way as a criticism of the Minister or his Department, for rather am I trying to say things that might be helpful to the Department.  The Department and the Minister must be vitally interested in having a police force of adequate <Col N="1554" /> strength and morale, efficiently organised to deal with the problems that they know only too well exist.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of crime, I shall not go into details.  Neither shall I go into the details as to what I think the criminal law should be, but we must, I think, face the fact that, when you have big urban centres growing up, such as you have in Dublin and its environs at the moment, the problem of indictable crime will undoubtedly grow.  Let us face it.  I do not see in these figures any ground whatever for criticising either the administration of the Department of Justice or the Garda Síochána.  I am, in fact, agreeably surprised that we have been able to maintain a relatively favourable situation for so long, but that is all the more reason why thought should be given to maintaining that situation at any cost.</P>
    <P>With regard to criminal legislation one has to be a little bit careful of how it is framed.  I am afraid there is a tendency in modern times for Departments to frame legislation to deal with particular cases as those particular cases arise.  It is becoming too easy to get Acts of Parliament through modern parliaments.  It would be better, in my view, to deal with more general principles and general propositions because there is always a danger in too specific legislation.  I came across a case recently which will show what I mean.  An Act was passed for a very good purpose.  I think most people would agree with the purpose.  When it came to be applied an attempt was made in court to apply it in a way that was never intended, if one is to judge by what was said here.  We know, of course, that no matter what the Minister says, or what any one of us here says, that will have nothing to do with the subsequent interpretation of the particular law.  The Act will be interpreted by the court without regard to parliamentary discussion; I might add that it is a very good job that that is so.</P>
    <P>How does it work?  A section of an Act was designed to protect the accused.  The whole purpose was to prevent publicity in a certain case in order to protect the accused.  There was a case&mdash;I shall not go into the details, but it was very interesting&mdash;in which <Col N="1555" /> an attempt was made&mdash;it did not succeed&mdash;to turn that Act around for a totally different purpose, a pernicious purpose, to my mind.  I am not saying that was deliberately contemplated, but it shows the danger of a certain type of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.</P>
    <P>One does not want to make the job of those who administer the law any harder and so I shall take another example to illustrate what I mean and to show how things can operate in the public service.  This is outside the scope of the Estimate, but I want to use the illustration to show my point. There was an old rule of law that a local authority was responsible for misfeasance and not for monfeasance. If a local authority did a job of work on a road, so long as that law was there, it at least left the road in a reasonable condition afterwards.  I think that was abolished.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression it had been abolished.  If a road is botched it becomes a trap and I was blaming the local authority for that.  The purpose of legislation like that is to get the necessary power to curb abuse.  In fact, when one has that, one very often raises something worse because of misapplication.  Where criminal law is concerned certain definite general principles are the best and, after that, let us rely on encouraging the courts to take the impartial view to which I referred earlier.  But, in doing that, it is absolutely vital both for the morale of the courts and the morale of the gardaí that the sentence be executed in the spirit intended and that there is no window-dressing. A man is condemned for murder and, under the law at present, if he gets a life sentence he is roaming around within ten years as if nothing had ever happened.</P>

      <P>I am playing on the safe side, I know.  What can one expect of either court or Garda in that situation?  Just what can one expect? I know this goes back to prison accommodation, organisation and so forth but, having the warning and experience elsewhere, I believe the thinking of people now should enable Deputies, talking for the people, to say to the Minister, the Government and the Minister's Department that the support of the people would be forthcoming to enable them to deal adequately with these rather serious problems.  Deputy Tully smiles.  I do not think he disagrees with me and I could, therefore, nearly go so far as to say the House would be almost unanimous on any reasonable propositions in this particular field.</P>
      <P>I have, perhaps, said some unpopular things.  I do not want to be in any way vicious or to offend against the charity one should have for another, but the majority, and they are the majority, of law-abiding citizens have rights and, in the nature of things, they should be protected.</P>
      <P>I do not want my remarks about the status and remuneration of Gardaí and teachers to be taken in any controversial spirit.  They were not meant in any way as a reflection on other sections of the State service.  All I want to do is to point out their vital importance in our community and what can be gained by raising their status and that which brings status to the proper level.  Deputy Tully may be surprised to hear me say that, if we were to go outside the public service, I would adhere to the same principle.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister is considering amending the law relating to landlord and tenant. I should like some information on this. The Minister referred to certain reports. Are these reports available to us to read or will they be forthcoming? This is an intricate, but interesting, subject.  As a result of experience I have been driven to a certain conclusion <Col N="1557" /> in regard to the acquisition of property by the individual citizen. Now, it was right and proper&mdash;in fact, it was the only way it could be done&mdash; that housing in this city, and in the growing city, could be provided only through State and local authority effort: in the last analysis, it was through State effort.  It was very noticeable how the whole standard and outlook and living of people improved with proper accommodation.  Indeed, the phenomenon I refer to is not in evidence at all as it used to be but it is a phenomenon that indicates the point I am making.</P>
      <P>In the old days when they were clearing out some of the very worst slums of Dublin and people were being transferred to areas on the outskirts of the city&mdash;for a while there was an area in Dublin once known as &ldquo;The Wild West&rdquo;&mdash;when they went out they could not immediately adjust themselves and there was vandalism and lack of appreciation of the houses they got, and so on.  The interesting thing is that this settled down.  One will see and one sees it also in the centre of the city where a proper block of flats is put up or where there is proper housing, that very quickly the majority of the people going into these places have an appreciation of their worth and you will see a very great improvement. You will see comfortable homes built and developed and people taking a pride in the furnishings of their own houses and their decoration of them, and so on.  That is very noticeable. The cynic might well pause to think about it.</P>
      <P>Going through the city, I have often noticed how tastefully kept are many of the blocks of our corporation flats and all these houses by people who are in the so-called lower remuneration wage bracket, and so on&mdash;people who, before, because they had not accommodation, were living under totally different conditions.  In other words, the provision of housing is vitally important. As soon as a family and these groups of people grow into the feeling that they have a stake in it, it immediately raises everything to their own benefit and for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> Perhaps a certain type of socialist will not agree with me but I think there is a lesson to be drawn from that and it is simply this: enable a man to have a stake in the community, particularly something to call his own&mdash;in a modest way, yes, if you like&mdash;and he is all the better citizen for it and both he and the community benefit.  Housing is not in this Estimate but it is referred to in a sense from the point of view of acquisition.  I think the policy of enabling, in a reasonable way, the tenant to acquire his house or even his flat&mdash;there may be problems with a flat, all right, in these corporation buildings&mdash;is a pretty sound social principle. It makes for stability: so much so that, perhaps, we might think far too much of what we might call the balance-sheet accounting in all this. Perhaps one could go too far, in making a calculation to see what the sum for acquisition should be, in going back to see cost.  After all, this housing is actually built and has been paid for, and so on.  There will still be maintenance charges for the local authority, and so on.  However, weigh up the whole thing.  It might be a very good national policy to try to enable people to purchase the property of which they are in possession.  I am not able to read anything, definitely, in the Minister's comments on this matter.  However, I think this type of legislation, emanating from his Department, should be correlated with the activities of the Department of Local Government in the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>On the question of law reform and court reform, my observations will be brief.  So far as law reform is concerned, let us make sure that it is reform and not some of the patch-work stuff we had already.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of the Succession Act as one of those beautiful bits of purple patching.  I think that, eventually, we shall have more trouble than we bargained for in the amended form.  Let us see that we have a homogeneous legal structure that the courts can really administer. As to the organisation of the courts, <Col N="1559" /> I think we have all said as much as we might usefully say on that subject until some specific proposals are put before us.</P>
      <P>With regard to prisons, all I want to plead is the case of the warders.  They need the same kind of support and protection that the gardaí need.  I think that, with that, I can end generally my comments on the Minister's Estimate for this year.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that the role of the Department of Justice in the future will be even greater than in the past and that this is a Department in which this House should take a great interest.  In the uncertainties and unsettled nature of modern times all over the world, when humanity is trying to evolve a social system compatible with population increase and technological development, there are bound to be problems of order and these will be the concern of this Department.  In commending the Department for our most sympathetic consideration and support, I would commend to the Government and to the Department the need for a very practical and extensive support for the arm of the law, for the institutions which must enforce the law and make the law a reality for the benefit and protection of the law-abiding citizen who is so much in the majority in the community.  That is why I make the plea for the gardaí and for the prison warders.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to make a contribution on the occasion on which the present Minister is presenting, for the first time, the Estimate for the Department of Justice because the political barometer indicates that it will also be his last time to do so.  The Department of Justice, under successive Fianna Fáil Ministers over the past decade, has been mis-directing its energies introducing the kind of legislation which Deputy de Valera has rightly condemned, legislation which has changed for the sake of change, which has written into the Statute Book some casual readings of legal traditions from abroad without a proper understanding of the manner in which the application of these notions from abroad would <Col N="1560" /> create injustice in Irish family arrangements and in the Irish judicial system.</P>
      <P>We have, as we have seen, further warnings from the Minister in his statement today that this miserable meddling in our legal system is to go further and that the sacred principle of innocence until proof of guilt on which we have based our system of justice is to be swept aside because of some notions of convenience.  The rights of the individual which are the foundation stone of our judicial system and democracy are to be suppressed.  I will return to that extremely dangerous trend after I have dealt with a few particular matters which I think ought to alarm our people.</P>
      <P>One area of gross neglect in the Department of Justice has been the imprisonment of juvenile offenders. For many years past we have had a serious worsening of the situation in St. Patrick's in Dublin.  We had an admission from the Minister today that the situation is so bad, that the accommodation at St. Patrick's is so overcrowded, that as many as 50 youths who should have been sent to St. Patrick's in a year were not sent there.  The situation is, of course, worse than that.  Eighty inmates of St. Patrick's were released before the end of their term because it was necessary to release them to make room for other youths committed to that institution.</P>
      <P>It is terribly important that when justices commit young people to an institution of correction for a particular period that they complete that period.  Such youths are sent there in most cases not principally for the sake of punishment but primarily in the hope that during the period in which they are there they may be trained to become better citizens&mdash;that they may be, as it were, cleansed of the temptations which brought them into trouble in the first instance.  If we have our juvenile prisons so overcrowded that young offenders, in particular first offenders, are unable to complete their terms of corrective training, we are only sowing the seeds of greater trouble in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would not be rash enough to suggest that this is the only reason why our crime figures are multiplying, but I think it is not without significance <Col N="1561" /> that a growing proportion of crimes are committed by young people and that, though all the indications are that this was happening, our Ministers for Justice failed miserably to provide the accommodation necessary for the corrective training of young people. This is a serious blot on the Minister and his predecessors.  Personally, the Minister has had too little time to put it right, but there is the doctrine of collective responsibility and he has shared responsibility with the Government who have failed during the past ten or 12 years to provide the necessary accommodation for corrective training necessary for young people. We have seen, however, that some amelioration is to be provided in the new institution in Shanganagh.  We wish this project well and hope it will be the forerunner of a completely new approach to the correction of juvenile offenders.  It is only by their correction that we can hope to prevent them becoming mature criminals.</P>
    <P>If we do not take the necessary steps, irrespective of cost, even worse crime will develop in the years ahead.  It is very disturbing that we now have some 5,000 more crimes per annum than we had in the years of much greater social unrest such as the years of the last war.  I know that apparently the trend throughout the so-called civilised world is not dissimilar but we would hope that our land here would be spared some of the extremities of crime which have blotted less happy communities than ours.  It behoves us to accept the warnings which are written there in large figures of criminal activity and to take all steps necessary to correct them.</P>
    <P>May I say also that it is most unfair to our prison staffs to expect them to give of their best to the young people committed to their care in overcrowded and unsuitable buildings?  I am not unaware of the circumstances which led to St. Patrick's being used as an institution for young offenders. It was, as many Members well know, formerly part of the women's prison in Mountjoy Jail.  I somehow feel that an old nineteenth century building is not the best place in which to correct young offenders.  I appreciate that the <Col N="1562" /> new institution in Shanganagh is a departure from this old surrounding, but we need to get away from the atmosphere of an old Victorian building altogether if we are to give young offenders and those who seek to reform them a real chance.  I do not believe the overcrowded conditions in St. Patrick's have given that chance in recent times.</P>
    <P>It would be very churlish not to record our gratitude to all the staff&mdash; Governor, officers and warders&mdash;for the marvellous work they have done in extremely difficult circumstances in St. Patrick's.  It is an indication of the high standard of the personnel we have administering our prison service, and I share with others the hope that they will receive remuneration commensurate with their responsibilities and services. It is extremely encouraging that so many of the people who work in the prison service give of their services not only during their hours of duty but also after hours in the aftercare of prisoners.  They deserve to be very highly commended for this and I hope any applications which come from that quarter for improved conditions of service will be considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>On the question of prisons, I have spoken in the past and I shall speak again today about the need to have a different prison for road traffic offenders.  It is true to say that except in very rare cases the degree of moral turpitude of a motor offender is insignificant compared with the moral turpitude of the ordinary criminal.  It is wrong, therefore, to house in the same penal conditions some people who, in a moment of carelessness, mismanaged a motor car, and people who deliberately set about the commission of a crime, who deliberately and with malice aforethought set out to injure other people or their property.  It is costing £16 a week to keep a prisoner in jail.  Would it not be proper where you have some offender who has means of his own that he should be charged for the privilege of being kept in a State hotel?  I think it would be particularly appropriate in the case of motor car <Col N="1563" /> owners.  Perhaps they could be charged something higher and given more reasonable accommodation.  The main exercise in the imprisonment of road traffic offenders is correction and reform. The purpose of it is primarily to alert the wrong-doer to the seriousness of his misconduct, serious not only in relation to other people and their property but also to himself.  What we need are institutions on the Scandinavian lines in which road traffic offenders are obliged to attend schools of motoring so that they may learn the rudiments of road safety and come out from these places much better drivers&mdash; a means of safety rather than a menace to the community.  If we did that we would also be making available in institutions accommodation that could be used for people who are engaged in more notorious criminal activities.</P>
    <P>I notice that for the umpteenth time the Minister for Justice has promised legislation to reform some of the practices in the Registry of Deeds.  I am mindful of the fact that, as far back as July, 1967, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice also promised us legislation on similar lines which we have not got.  We know just how long it takes any Minister in the present Government to implement the promise of legislation. This month three years ago legislation was promised to reform health services.  We are still waiting. Several more promises have been given.  We have promises for each quarter of the years in between.</P>
    <P>On this occasion it is the same with regard to the Registry of Deeds.  The Bill concerning the practices of the Registry of Deeds in order to achieve urgent reform needs be no more than six paragraphs.  In my opinion it is inexcusable to delay this reform for so long.  I suspect what we are going to get is not a Bill to reform the Registry of Deeds but rather to meddle in and make a mess of it and to convert the reasonably polite Registry of Deeds into something inefficient like the Land Registry.  The Land Registry was created many years ago because it was said that the Registry of Deeds was slow and there was need to reform it. <Col N="1564" /> It was also said that the Registry of Deeds was too costly.  Since the Land Registry came into being each year the delays there extend into weeks and months.  Even in this, almost the fourth quarter of the 20th century, you can get a deed through the Registry of Deeds in two to three days while in the reformed Land Registry it may take a year.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy O'Malley's remarks about the Registry of Deeds what he said about memorials having to be inscribed in manuscript on parchment is, of course, true.  But, if the Minister for Justice acknowledged as far back as February, 1965, that all that is necessary to remedy that is to allow memorials to be typed on paper, there is no need for a three-year delay in having a Bill to authorise that particular reform.  That is unfortunately typical of what is happening in the Department of Justice. One hundred and one simple reforms which ought to be brought into effect are delayed because some people believe from their high positions that they alone have a prerogative to dictate to the legal profession and to those who work the systems and who know what reforms are necessary.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Justice if he would be good enough to let us know how soon we may expect the commencement of the building of the new Garda station at Rathmines. Rathmines is a suburb famous in song and story for graciousness of living. It is a sorry thing that the only wooden shack in that once salubrious suburb is the property of the Board of Works, to wit, the Rathmines Garda Station. The Gardaí had to be moved out of the old building several years ago because it was dangerous.  The only wooden structure in the township of Rathmines is the Garda barracks.  We were promised it would be replaced with a permanent building.  There is no sign of a permanent building on its way.</P>
    <P>Earlier we had a contribution from Deputy James Tully, which reminds me of his immediate bailiwick of Laytown and Bettystown.  During the summer months many thousands of people repair by car and otherwise to <Col N="1565" /> the famous Bettystown beach.  For many years a great deal of traffic obstruction occurred.  This year I was happy to see moveable &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs which were on an excellent blackboard and easel principle, only they were white with markings on them in black, directing people not to park in particular places.  I do not want to create any difficulty but it occurred to me that they were possibly not authorised by regulation even if very effective.  Their height was 2½ to 3 feet.  They had the effect of preventing parking and were much more effective than the signs with which we are all familiar, six to seven feet of a tubular pole with a round disc on the top.  These signs had the virtue that they could be very easily removed so that the &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; prohibition would not apply when there was no need for it.  One of the great drawbacks about the normal no parking prohibitions is that they apply to hours of the day when there is no need to apply them.  Because of the prohibition which applies during periods when there is no need for it people are inclined to hold the prohibition in contempt.</P>
    <P>The industrial difficulties affecting the police force in New York brought forth last week what I think is one of the most significant admissions to come from civic authorities anywhere for a long time: The Mayor of New York regretted the police strike because it resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of parking fines with consequential serious loss to the municipal revenue.  The main effect of extending the no-parking areas in Dublin has not been to relieve traffic congestion but has been to increase income to the State.</P>
    <P>It is high time to see that there should be no further no-parking areas in Dublin or elsewhere until such time as the State spends the money it is unfairly getting from motor car owners in parking fines on the provision of parking accommodation.  It does not matter whether the fault for not having sufficient off-street parking in Dublin lies with Dublin Corporation, the Department of Local Government or the Department of Justice; what is important is that all the money, which <Col N="1566" /> now runs into millions of pounds and which is taken by the State for parking offences, is not being used to relieve the problem the fines are supposed to alleviate.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Corporation some of us have already indicated that we will give no further approval to the erection of more no-parking signs.  Of course, notwithstanding our refusal, the orders can nonetheless be made.  However, I hope the day is not too far distant when that money will be ploughed back into the provision of off-street parking.  By that I mean not simply the use of derelict areas, pending redevelopment, but rather the erection of under-street and multi-storey car parks which are necessary to the life of any modern city.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I must complain about the non-enforcement of clearway restrictions.  During the last three months I have asked a number of people to observe clearways for me and from the reports that I have received it would appear that they never saw a clearway clear.  From time to time when individual complaints are made to the Garda about the number of vehicles parked on the clearways, steps are taken for the subsequent few weeks to ensure they are kept clear.  However, in relation to the clearways, as in relation to all other traffic matters, we find indifference.  The indifference of the Minister and of the higher up authorities is reflected in the indifference of the Garda Síochána to this matter.  At the moment the State is dealing with 97,000 parking fines per annum, amounting in fines to between £100,000 and £150,000.  Could not some of that money go towards the provision of accommodation which would keep our clearways clear and prevent people using, in desperation, the areas in which they are prohibited to park at the present time?</P>
    <P>We, as Members of this House have experienced great difficulty from time to time in endeavouring to reach Leinster House when coming through Molesworth Street.  Very often up to 20 cars are parked in an area in which parking is prohibited.  On my way to the house today at 2.55 p.m. there <Col N="1567" /> were no less than 21 cars parked in Molesworth Street under no-parking signs.  This is not an indication of a serious attempt on the part of the Minister to tackle the parking problem in Dublin.  The Minister for Justice will find on the files in his office several complaints from Members of this House concerning the parking regulations.  The Minister and his colleagues in the short time they will remain in office&mdash;they might go earlier than the Taoiseach wants to go if the Members are unable to reach the House during some critical Division&mdash; should see to it that the majority of road users have not to suffer through lack of consideration on the part of the few.</P>
    <P>Another problem affecting traffic in Dublin is one concerning the Carriage Office and the licensing of taxis.  In this city there are three times the number of taxis per head of the population that there are in similar cities abroad.  The Department of Justice have, with the Department of Local Government, shared responsibility for these licences to some extent but the Carriage Office is still the authority which licences taxis and I would urge in the public interest that a limitation be put on the number of taxis operating in Dublin.  I say it is in the public interest because, if there is a limitation on the number of taxi plates, it will be possible to enforce higher standards on taxis.  If there is not limitation in this respect there will be a continuance of the present undesirable situation in which the full-time taxi men, who are trying to make a decent living, have to face unfair competition from the pirates and the part-timers who have little regard for the reputation of the taxi owners and the taxi drivers and still less regard for the public that the genuine taxi men ought to serve.</P>
    <P>I would plead therefore that the Minister, with the Minister for Local Government, would tackle this problem once and for all.  The Minister has suggested that he has a great concern for the liberty of the individual and the right of every person to trade. I gather this is the reason behind his refusal to enforce in Dublin what is enforced in all other similar cities in <Col N="1568" /> Europe&mdash;a limitation on taxis.  However, as I will be pointing out later, the Minister seems particularly keen in his devotion to the idea of the liberty of the individual but this is one case where the rights of the public need to be protected and they can be protected by giving those people who are now in the taxi trade a reasonable living. By those people I mean the genuine people in the trade and not the pirates and the part-timers who are only available whenever the cream of the traffic is available and who disappear whenever there is any difficult traffic to serve.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about parking fines but I forgot to mention one incident which came to my notice and which I think should go on record.  Last year, a foreign visitor to this city, like many visitors, decided to chance parking his car in a no-parking area.  On his return there was an on-the-spot parking fine ticket affixed to his car.  The person returned to England without paying the fine.  He later wrote to the Garda station responsible for affixing the notice to the windscreen of the car explaining that he or she was a visitor.  The reply to the person was addressed to Mr., Mrs., or Miss as the Garda did not know the sex or the marriage status of the person concerned. This letter which went out from the Garda station in reply to the English visitor, stated that at the time of the affixing of the notice the Garda who issued the parking notice was not aware that the car was being used by a visitor.  It then went on to say that the practice in such cases was that the Garda asked the Motor Taxation Office to give information relating to the owner and, if the inquiry to the Motor Taxation Office showed that the car was owned by a car hire firm, the car hire firm was asked for a photostat copy of the hirer's agreement and this indicated the name of the person to whom the car was hired.  This solemn notice from the Garda Síochána notified this visitor that, if the photostat copy indicated that the hirer came from outside the jurisdiction, that ended the matter.  The notice had this little peroration&mdash;&ldquo;The moral: if you incur one on your next visit do not <Col N="1569" /> be alarmed.  Kind regards&rdquo;, and it was signed by a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>One can sympathise with the readiness and anxiety of the Gardaí to assist the tourist industry but it is going a little too far to say that any foreigner visiting Dublin can park indiscriminately. It may well be that some will try it on and get away with it.  Europe is very concerned about this.  Countries which are far more advanced in traffic regulations than ourselves are concerned and the day is not far distant when steps will be taken to ensure that the visitor will have to face the full wrath of the law like the native.  We hope that, when the Fine Gael Government take office in the early spring, these offenders will get no privileges.  They will be treated in exactly the same way as the natives.</P>
      <P>In Vienna these notices are more sophisticated than that of the kind member of the Garda Síochána.  There they affix to the windscreens of visitors' cars a notice pointing out that a traffic offence has been committed and that by so doing the offender has discommoded the Viennese and other people, and pleading with him not to do it again.  In our case there is not even a plea to the visitor not to do it again.  He is encouraged to try it on because he is told that, if he incurs another, he need not worry.  This is going too far.  It is indicative of the general attitude towards parking in no-parking areas.  It is a kind of game played by both the motorist and the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about the traffic problems in this city they will have to be tackled in a very effective way in the future and when I say tackled I refer to providing parking accommodation which will leave people with no reasons for parking in prohibited areas.  I am the first to admit that the harassed motorist can often be excused for parking in prohibited areas when the State which collects so much money is doing nothing to provide this accommodation. If the Government come to their senses and provide car parking accommodation <Col N="1570" /> then we will find less anti-social people in our community.</P>
    <P>I share with Deputy H.P. Dockrell his criticism of court areas in Dublin which oblige many people to travel from far away to the centre of the city and then travel again from the centre to the surburb of Kilmainham to get justice.  There appears to be little point in continuing the present haphazard court areas in Dublin.  I understood the Minister to say there will be reform in this connection.  There is one courthouse on every court day packed to the point where it makes not only the discharge of justice, but finding a seat, an extremely difficult task not only for the justice and the people involved but also for the newspaper men attending to report the proceedings and for several members of the public who have occasion to be there. Rathfarnham Courthouse is hopelessly inadequate for the population it now serves.  I am not certain what the population is but it is probably in the region of 100,000 people.  It was built when the population was not more than 7,000 or 8,000 people.  Any person who has had occasion to make application for a licence in the area would know how many thousands of times the population has multiplied since the first decade of the century.  It is intolerable that Rathfarnham court should be compelled to operate under the appalling conditions under which it is compelled to operate at the present time.</P>
    <P>I share with Deputy James Tully great disappointment that the Garda Band has not yet been resurrected.  It should never have been abolished.  It was outrageous to abolish it, but this fact is related to the equally foolish decision of transferring the Garda Training Depot from Dublin to Templemore.  The truth of the matter is, and the Minister acknowledges it in his statement, that the main burden of police work falls on the metropolis of Dublin.  What is happening?  Gardaí with no experience of urban life are being trained far away from the urban environment in which they will have to work.  They are brought to Dublin and have to try and deal with the sophisticated methods of criminals in <Col N="1571" /> the Dublin area.  The Garda Síochána Band was doomed because the Minister found out something they had not thought of in time&mdash;that they could not maintain the Garda Band in Templemore and that the cost of transporting it to Templemore from Dublin on the occasions when we had to use it was prohibitive.  We are the only civilised country now that has not a police band of its own.  Now we have to march to canned music when we have pageantry.  We have not real pageantry when we have not a police band.  This was a deplorable step; it is a reflection on the Government that they took it and a reinforced reflection that they did not do something to mend their ways.</P>
    <P>We have published in our Just Society policy something which we are sorry to say has not yet been stolen by the present Government.  If, in the closing days of their office, they were now to steal it we would not regret it.  We have recommended that probate fees be abolished.  This would be a reasonable reform and would be of greater benefit to the families of deceased persons than the vexatious Succession Act which was brought in to make a complicated world more complicated.  Fine Gael suggested that probate fees be abolished in estates where estate duty is not payable.</P>
    <P>It is not because I consider that they are the last problem but because I consider that they are the first deserving of our attention that I mention the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i>: I wish to raise the subject matter of Question No. 19 on the Adjournment because of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's reply and because this is something which concerns my constituency in a very particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the 1st April, 1967, a scheme known as the Rural Improvements Scheme was operated by the Department <Col N="1572" /> of Finance through the Board of Works and under this scheme lanes were repaired and drainage works carried out by way of a State grant with the assistance of a small local contribution. In 1965 and 1966 it was difficult to obtain grants under this scheme. Money was scarce and the stock answer was that the cash allocated for the year had been expended.  As from the 1st April, 1967, the Department of Finance washed its hands of the scheme and handed it over to the Minister for Local Government to be administered by him.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that being a local and rural affair and the Minister being in close touch with local authorities there would have been an improvement but there was not. Instead of improving, the position deteriorated and on the 1st April of this year there had accumulated in the Minister's Department a list of 112 cases from the constituency of County Cavan which had not been dealt with, 112 applications for grants to have lanes to the houses of the people of County Cavan repaired were lying unattended to in the Minister's office.  It would have cost about £70,000 to carry out the work involved in these 112 applications.</P>
    <P>Again, we were entitled to think that when the Minister accumulated that list of neglected applications in his Department he would have shown some concern about it but what do we find? We find that instead of increasing the grant and getting on with the work the Minister for Local Government as from 1st April, 1968, introduced and passed the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, again washing his hands completely of this scheme and scrapping the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister by the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, transferred, or purported to transfer, the scheme to the local authorities.  In other words, he handed over to Cavan County Council 112 applications from constituents of mine which he had neglected and the cost of carrying out the work involved in those applications according to Cavan County Council would have been about £70,000.  I have been vitally concerned <Col N="1573" /> about this problem since I entered this House.  I ascertained that the Minister had allocated £14,000 to County Cavan for the current year to cover this scheme and I protested and I told the Minister that I would continue to protest. As a result, on paper this allocation of £14,000 was increased to £30,000.  Following from what I have said previously this £30,000 would have been sufficient to deal with fewer than half the applications from County Cavan to repair lanes and dangerous bridges which the Minister had neglected.</P>
    <P>That was the position on the 1st April, 1968.  The people of Cavan concerned and very much affected by these impassable lanes hoped that under the new scheme to be operated by Cavan County Council, mark you, within a grant, within cash which was to be provided by the Minister, these lanes and dangerous bridges would be dealt with.  What happened?  Month after month went by and not one application was dealt with.  Instead, 251 more applications poured into Cavan County Council and instead of having 112 applications there now are 112 plus 251 or 363 applications.  The people could not understand why Cavan County Council were not getting on with the work.  It was discussed at Cavan County Council.  One would have thought that the Minister for Local Government who was responsible for neglecting this for a couple of years would have co-operated with the county council in clearing up the arrears and in dealing with the new applications, but not alone did the Minister, I regret to say, not co-operate with Cavan County Council in doing this vital work which so vitally affects the constituency of County Cavan but he obstructed the county council.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am being unfair to the Minister or saying anything that is untrue when I say that he obstructed the county council and made it impossible for them to carry out the work. That is why I put down this question today.  I said that the Minister obstructed the county council and made it impossible for them to carry out the work because this was a new scheme <Col N="1574" /> in County Cavan as in other counties. The county council had not the technical staff to carry out the work.  They had not the necessary engineers to survey the applications and to assess them and to prepare estimates.  The county manager could not get the staff.  The county manager then in August last, having done his best to obtain additional staff and having failed, made a very reasonable proposal to the Minister. He proposed that the work be done by the existing engineering staff of Cavan County Council in their spare time and that the engineering staff be allowed fees; in other words, that they be allowed overtime for doing overtime work.  The proposition was put up to the Minister for Local Government in August last.  That was four months after the Bill became an Act and after the scheme was thrust on Cavan County Council, but the Minister has not yet sanctioned the reasonable proposal of Cavan County Council and as a result not one of the 112 applications which the Minister allowed to accumulate in his Department has been dealt with.  Needless to say, none of the additional 251 which have come in since has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>As a result of the numerous applications and representations made to me I was forced to put down this question. On the list of applications awaiting attention in Cavan are a number of dangerous bridges and we know that a few years ago a grant was refused under a former scheme to repair a bridge and that when a young lad was driving a tractor across the bridge a short time afterwards the bridge collapsed. But for a miracle that young lad would have been killed.  The bridge was then repaired but there are more dangerous bridges now awaiting repair. I put down this question today:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will state (a) the amount of money finally allocated to County Cavan for the current year under the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, (b) the number of applications received by Cavan County Council under the Act, including those transferred from his Department, (c) the number of schemes which have actually been <Col N="1575" /> commenced by the county council since the Act came into operation and (d) the cause of the delay in attending to the applications received.</P>
    <P>I got this reply from the Minister: (a) £30,000.  That means that £30,000 was allocated: (b) 363 applications awaiting attention on 14th October, 1968; (c) none dealt with since the Act came into operation and (d) the Minister said he understood that the delay in attending to applications has been caused by local organisational difficulties in getting the local improvements scheme into operation.</P>
    <P>By way of supplementary question I asked the Minister if it was not a fact that the delay in getting the scheme going was due to the fact that the Minister had refused to sanction a proposal put before him by Cavan County Council as far back as August last which would solve any difficulties there were in getting the scheme going. The Minister replied: &ldquo;No.  The county manager has been instructed to make arrangements to carry out the works and is being given every assistance by my Department.&rdquo;  In that reply to that supplementary question the Minister had deliberately misled the House but he will not mislead the people of County Cavan because they may see and have seen in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of 18th October last, that the delay is due to the fact that the Minister refused to sanction the application submitted to him by Cavan County Council to approve of the employment of the existing staff on an overtime basis.</P>
    <P>The people of Cavan have read that in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> and know about it. Either the Minister has wilfully and dishonestly misled the House in that reply to my supplementary question today or he does not know what is going on in his Department.  The people of County Cavan will not accept as an excuse from the Minister that he was engaged all year on this wild scheme of trying to destroy democracy. They are not concerned with that but with the practical realities of getting a decent way of travelling to and from their homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> Apart from what appeared in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i>, I have in my possession a letter from the county secretary dated 21st October, 1968, in which he says that he has been directed by the county manager to refer to representations made by me regarding the carrying out of works under the local improvements scheme and to state that to date this scheme has not been implemented. He says:</P>
    <P>The council were unable to recruit engineers for the survey or preparation of estimates for works under the above scheme and in August last a proposal was submitted to the Department for the carrying out of the work by the council's existing engineers in their spare time on a fee basis.  So far this proposal has not been approved by the Department and consequently work on these schemes has not been proceeded with pending the Department's decision.</P>
    <P>The discussion in Cavan County Council was not confined to members of the Fine Gael Party or to Independents but members of the Minister's Party took part in it and members of the Minister's Party on the council say it is a disgrace that money has been collected and held by people and that these lanes will not be done.  We had a proposal by one Fianna Fáil councillor, seconded by another, calling on the Minister to approve of the county council's proposal to have these schemes examined by the existing engineering staff in their spare time and paid for on a fee basis.  That has been described by all members of Cavan County Council as a reasonable solution.</P>
    <P>Was the Minister not aware of that?  Does he know what is going on in his Department?  Is he concerned with this scheme which was ditched first by the Department of Finance on 1st April, 1967, and then by his Department on 1st April, 1968?  One would think that at least if the Minister was not prepared to do the work under his Department he would desist from obstructing Cavan County Council in their efforts to get on with it.  I take an extremely poor view of the reply to my supplementary question <Col N="1577" /> to the Minister today.  If it were in another Parliament and if the Minister were caught out in a piece of attempted deception like this it would have very serious consequences for him.</P>
    <P>I put it plainly to him that the delay was due to the fact that the county manager put a proposal to him in August last to solve the difficulty and get the scheme going and that the Minister refused to sanction that and this was the cause of the delay.  To this the Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo;; that the county manager had been instructed to make arrangements to carry out the works and had been given every assistance by his Department.  I am entitled to an explanation and I think the House is entitled to an explanation. Certainly the people of Cavan who live in these lanes and find it impossible to travel them are entitled to an explanation. So are the women who live in these lanes and have to wear wellingtons until they reach the road, leave their wellingtons in a house along the road and change into shoes then.</P>
    <P>Seven months of this year have gone and not a penny of this £30,000 allocated on paper to us has been forthcoming. The winter months are upon us and the Minister knows as well as I do that you cannot do this type of work in winter and that it will not be done.  Did the Minister ever intend that this money or any part of it should be expended this year?  Lest there be any doubt about it I understand Cavan is not the only county affected.  To clarify that position I shall have further questions down next month.  I understand this is the pattern all over the country and that this scheme has not been implemented in county after county because there is no cooperation between the Minister and the county councils and because the Minister expects the councils to do the impossible.  When the Minister's Department was operating this scheme the council engineers did not do the work; the Minister's engineers did it. How can he expect the county councils to do the work without the equipment and the necessary technical men?</P>

      <P>I should, first of all, like <Col N="1578" /> to correct some of the statements that Deputy Fitzpatrick made in this unnecessary question that he has raised here on the Adjournment.  The fact of the matter is, contrary to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has stated, that the allocation this year to Cavan County Council for the local improvements scheme is, as he should know if he has ever taken any interest in this matter, well above the average allocated to Cavan in previous years for special employment schemes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, but chooses to ignore, that the £14,000 which was notified originally was not an allocation but was merely an indication in advance of what Cavan might get on the basis of the overall allocation last year for employment schemes but, as Deputy Fitzpatrick knows but chooses to hide, in actual fact, because of the success of the measures taken by the Government to safeguard the economy, it was possible to allocate £30,000 to Cavan for this purpose, the total amount being provided by the Government for these very necessary schemes being £469,000 and on the basis of the average&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over the last few years, £30,000 was allocated to Cavan, much to Deputy Fitzpatrick's chagrin, because Deputy Fitzpatrick had himself well prepared for what he hoped would be an allocation of £14,000 and, of course, if Deputy Fitzpatrick's attempts to whittle away as much as possible of the allocation on administrative expenses were successful there would be even less work done with this whittling away being done on £14,000 rather than £30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, the Special Employment Schemes Office involved a separate headquarters and administration here in Dublin.  The changing of the administration of this scheme from the Special Employment Schemes Office to the local authorities was done in order to ensure that as much as possible of this money would be spent on actual work rather than on administration.  Obviously, it is Deputy Fitzpatrick's objective to try <Col N="1579" /> to ensure the opposite will take place. His objective is, obviously, to maximise the amount of this money that would be spent on administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to minimise the amount spent on actual work because, of course, the less of this work that is done the better it suits Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Fitzpatrick's sole objective is to ensure that as little as possible of this very important work will be done in County Cavan.  This is an attempt by Deputy Fitzpatrick to whittle away as much as possible of this allocation on overheads.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Special Employment Schemes Office administered these schemes prior to their being taken over by the Department of Local Government and in 13 counties the Special Employment Schemes Office engaged county engineers on an agency basis.  Cavan was one of these 13 counties.  The arrangement was that in these cases it was left to the county engineer to administer the schemes and he, in fact, did not employ extra staff to do the work but arranged with members of the county council engineering and clerical staff to assist him and for this purpose he made payments to his staff.</P>

      <P>When this work was transferred from the Special Employment Schemes Office to the Department of Local Government the local improvements scheme work became part of the normal functions of the local authority.  So that, strictly, local authority staff would not be entitled to extra pay for doing Special Employment Schemes Office work as their salaries are fully inclusive and the work is part of the local authority's functions from now on.  A special case has been made in the case of the counties in which the county engineers were formerly employed on an agency basis by the Special Employment Schemes Office and I am considering whether some exception should be made in these cases and I would hope to notify the local authorities concerned of my decision in due course.  But, as far back as August, 1967, Cavan County Council, in common with all local authorities, were notified of the inauguration of the local improvements scheme and they agreed to operate the scheme.  There was no mention of fees and Cavan did not raise the question of fees at all at that stage and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, it was not raised until August, 1968.  As I said, the allocation for each county is a fixed amount and any extra expenditure on administration can only be at the expense of the actual amount of work that it will be possible to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that in reply to a circular letter of 7th October, 1968, Cavan County Council said that they had incurred no expenditure so far and that no schemes were under way and staff difficulties were given as the reason for delay.  In fact, additional clerical assistance has been approved and the county manager has been notified that it rests with him to make such arrangements as he can to carry out these works.  This has been impressed upon him and if Cavan finds it impossible to utilise this money the only alternative will be to transfer it to other areas.  As far as my Department <Col N="1581" /> is concerned, the county council have been and will be facilitated in every possible way in this regard.  It appears that the only solution to the problem that presents itself to Deputy Fitzpatrick's mind is to increase the amount of this money to be spent on administration.  As I say, there is a special set of circumstances in the case of the 13 county councils in which county engineers have been employed on an agency basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give details of any circular letters addressed to local authorities in connection with the interpretation of &ldquo;service days&rdquo; for the purpose of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, relative to the 5-day working week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4th June, 1968, a circular letter was issued to each local authority advising them that in respect of periods during which the five-day working week was in operation in relation to any servant of the local authority, the aggregate number of &ldquo;service days&rdquo; recorded to the credit of the servant in any week should be increased by one-fifth for superannuation purposes subject to an overriding limitation of six service days.  This adjustment was necessitated by the effects of the introduction of the five-day working week on the limits of 200 and 300 &ldquo;service days&rdquo; provided for in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, in relation to the calculation of pensionable service.  These limits had been decided on the basis that local authority servants worked a six-day week.</P>
