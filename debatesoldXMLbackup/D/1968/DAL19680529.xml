      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the present estimated number of holders of merchandise licences in the counties of Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Wicklow, Carlow, Longford and Westmeath; and if he will give instructions for an official questionnaire to be sent to all holders of merchandise licences in these counties to find out (a) the number of merchandise licence-holders in these seven counties who carry livestock and (b) the number of livestock which they have carried individually from the date on which the regulations were changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the seven counties in question there are 214 merchandise licences of which 171 authorise the carriage of livestock. This capacity is in addition to that provided by CIE.  CIE inspectors and station masters attend the principal fairs and marts and arrange road/rail transport on request.  When the need arises they will issue on-the-spot authorisations to any lorry owner, whether licensed haulier or otherwise but without prejudice to the interests of licensed hauliers, to carry uncleared odd or final lots of livestock from fairs and marts.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the Dáil, I am keeping the whole question of road transport facilities for the livestock trade under review.  In addition the question will be considered by the study group which I have established to examine the desirability of further measures of liberalisation of road transport for reward.  The study group will be able to make inquiries in order to ascertain such information as may be useful in assessing the problem and the Deputy may be assured that this assessment will, as far as practicable, relate to what he has in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if the joint statement of agreed principles and intentions regarding cross-Border electricity supply contains any principle or intention implementing the typical principle enunciated in paragraph 2, page 26 of <i>Electricity in Ireland</i> to the effect that the loading of generating sets is so arranged that those with the cheapest fuel cost per unit of electrical output supply all they can regardless of ownership and the loading <Col N="164" /> of the less economical generating sets is arranged in order of merit so that the most expensive producers take only the peak loads or are used for generating reserve capacity; and, if so, what effect this policy will have on the turf burning stations and on the Arigna power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint statement of principles and intentions, to which the Deputy refers, provides for the drawing up in due course by the ESB and the Northern Ireland Electricity Authorities of a formal agreement governing the operation of the interconnected systems.  The essential purpose of the proposed agreement is a sharing of stand-by generating capacity to give improved security of supply with the same installed capacity.  The joint statement of principles provides that nothing in it shall be construed or operated in any way by either party which would be against its Government's fuel policy.  Accordingly, interconnection will have no effect on operating policy in respect of the turf burning stations or the Arigna power station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps to ensure the widespread use of hazard flasher units on motor vehicles in order to reduce accidents arising from broken down or stationary vehicles on the roadways at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to a device which causes all four amber flashing type direction indicators to be used simultaneously on a motor vehicle.  Article 49 (3) of the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, as amended by the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1967, permits the use of such a device on a stationary vehicle to indicate that it has broken down or to warn against danger.  However, I have not sufficient evidence of its value as a hazard warning to justify the mandatory fitting and use of this device on motor vehicles or the mounting of a publicity campaign advocating its use.  The matter will be kept under review however.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to disability and occupational injuries benefits as these are the only social welfare benefits not having a fixed day of payment.  Claimants to these benefits are required by regulations to furnish medical certificates of incapacity for work, which they may obtain and forward to my Department on the first convenient date after the commencement of the incapacity.  Normally some 9,000 medical certificates are received daily at the headquarters of my Department and in all but a very small proportion of cases cheques in payment of benefit due are issued on the date of receipt of the medical certificate. Deferring payment to a fixed date would not improve the position for the beneficiaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations for the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement commenced from the basic position that all quota restrictions would be removed on and from 1st July, 1966.  During the negotiations a postponement of two years was secured for the leather footwear industry.  Discussions have been going on between my Department and the footwear industry over the past two years in regard to the situation which was due to arise this year when the quota would be removed and be replaced by customs duties of 31.5 per cent on British footwear and 54 per cent on others.  It became clear during these discussions that the industry was divided on the relative merits of retention of quota protection or of allowing the Agreement to come into force. This division of opinion was emphasised when officials of my Department recently met representatives of the industry <Col N="175" /> to discuss the latest alternatives put forward by the British authorities, that is, (a) retention of the quota preferably on an increasing basis up to 1927 followed by an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 18 per cent which would be reduced by 1975 in three equal instalments, or (b) the operation of the AIFTA from 1st July, 1968.</P>
    <P>While the voting at that meeting indicated a preference for a quota, in terms of employment and production the two schools of thought were almost evenly divided.  In the absence, therefore, of a clear-cut majority opinion I decided to allow the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement to take their course.  This meant that a duty&mdash;31.5 per cent on British footwear and 54 per cent on others&mdash; would be substituted for the quota from 1st July, 1968.</P>
    <P>Following representations by the industry and the trade unions, I convened a meeting with each of these parties yesterday and I asked for the fullest possible representation of the footwear manufacturers.  At this more representative meeting with the manufacturers a vote was again taken and again, in terms of employment and production, it revealed that the industry was almost evenly divided in its views.  In all the circumstances I have decided to initiate further consultations with the British Government in accordance with the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we understand from the Minister when he says there was a division at yesterday's meeting that some were of the view that employment would be maintained at the present level, and an almost equal number were of the view that it would not be maintained?  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite as simple as that.  It is a question of weighing the short-term against the long-term prospects for the industry, basically whether the industry would do better by having a further period of up to to four years of quota protection and then be subjected to competition <Col N="176" /> with very little protective duty, or alternatively be subjected to competition with high protective duty now which would be gradually reduced.  It is a question of assessing the relative effects of those two proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what practical steps have been taken to provide, either in the short-term or the long-term, alternative employment for the people who are bound to be disrupted in their employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to say with certainty that there will be unemployment in the industry as a result of this.  No one can be quite certain. A lot, of course, depends on the availability of export markets.  It is a question of trying to assess which of the two alternatives is likely to cause less disruption in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it would be the height of folly to reject the offer made by the British Board of Trade to continue the existing quota for another four years, and that, especially in the light of the fact that many of our Irish footwear industrialists are not as yet ready and prepared for this sterner competition, the four-year period which is being offered by the British would come as a godsend and afford them an opportunity to strengthen their position, to modernise their plant and machinery and generally gear themselves for the sterner competition with which they will have to contend when the quota is abolished?  In these circumstances will the Minister keep that in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that it is not the responsibility or the function of the British Board of Trade to have regard to the situation of Irish industry.  The mere fact that an offer as such is made by the British Board of Trade does not automatically mean that it is in the interests of Irish industry.  The assessment of whether it is or not is a matter for us.  I have indicated that the assessment in this case is not an easy one to decide, and that if one were to continue the quota, it could well happen that the ultimate, the long-term effect on the industry <Col N="177" /> might be considerably more damaging than the immediate removal of the quota.  Obviously in the short-term, the easy course is to continue the quota, but in the long-term, that may not be the best solution.  As I have indicated in my reply, in view of the representations which have been made and the votes taken, although they reveal a very close division in the industry, I have decided to initiate further discussions with the British authorities to see whether something further could emerge that would be satisfactory to the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the discussions to which he referred which took place between his Department and the footwear industry there was a majority of 12 to five in favour of retaining the quota? Is that not a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to the number of firms, speaking from recollection, I think it was 11 to five, but the Deputy will appreciate that if one wants to get the views of the industry, the number of firms voting one way or another is not in itself representative.  One has to have regard to the amount of production and in particular the amount of employment in the industry.  On that basis the division was virtually 50-50.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that what will happen will be similar to what happened here in 1947 when footwear was dumped in this country with the result that the industry here was dislocated and there was widespread unemployment and redundancy? Is this not what the Minister will bring down upon our heads?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is what I want to avoid.  In 1947, to rehabilitate itself after the war years, the industry agreed and arranged that a great deal of footwear would come in here, duty free, on a quota basis.  That did very great damage.  I agree with the Deputy that that is so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen now is that the imports will be subject to quite a high duty which is the very opposite of what happened in 1947 when the footwear came in here free of duty.  That was the situation I wanted to avoid.  Deputy Treacy was a member of the deputation from the union which I met yesterday.  He is aware of the discussion that took place. I think he would agree that, at the end of the discussion, it would be true to say the views of the representatives of the union were that the quota might be the lesser of two evils but that they were not terribly happy about it nor absolutely convinced that one course was definitely more right than the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department discussed the matter with the manufacturers. It is unfortunate that some of them did not come to the meeting.  If they had displayed as much interest originally as they did subsequently, we might not have had to hold the meeting yesterday.</P>
      <P>The meeting yesterday was held over and above the normal consultation with industry and it yielded exactly the same results.  If the Deputy can get up and say that it is quite clear that what we should have done was to keep the quota and not the other then I would point out that half of the shoe industries do not agree with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other point I should deal with again in view of Deputy Fitzpatrick's insistence on it, although it has been dealt with several times already, is the reason why provision for the Constituency Commission is not in this Bill.  If the Deputy remembers, it was originally the intention of the Government to put these proposals, which are designed to give a more rational system of election, in the form of one proposition to the people.  At that stage there was a howl from the two Opposition Parties that this was far too complicated a matter for them to consider on the basis of one single proposition and in order to try to make it a little clearer for them we agreed to divide them into two separate proposals.</P>
      <P>This meant, of course, that since we will be asking the people to adopt these two proposals, there had to be a decision to put this question of the requirement of the Constitution to establish a commission into one Bill or the other.  It was deemed more appropriate to put it into the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill rather than into the Third Amendment Bill.  It would be silly to put it into both.  I think that if there is any particular importance attached to having the constituencies delineated by a commission rather than by the Government, the importance would be greater if a radical change were being made from the present system of multi-member constituencies to the proposed system of single-seat constituencies.  For that reason it was decided to put the provision for a commission into the Fourth Amendment Bill rather than into this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point to which I want to refer is that Deputy Cunningham, in speaking on this Bill, appeared to a certain extent to have misunderstood what I have said.  I pointed out that in the area of Dublin and the area of Cork Borough taken together, the electorate formed 56 per cent of the total population, whereas in the remainder of the country the proportion of the electorate to the total population is 61 per cent and that that meant that a vote in the rural areas generally, <Col N="188" /> if constituencies were divided strictly on a basis of mathematical accuracy of population per Deputy, would be nine per cent less effective in electing a Deputy than in the area of Dublin and Cork taken as a whole.  I pointed out that that was the position which Deputy Fitzpatrick and his colleagues in his own benches and in the Labour benches are trying to maintain for some reason.  I think Deputy Cunningham took this to mean that the difference was that the figures should have been 52 per cent in the Dublin-Cork area and 61 per cent in the remainder of the country but in fact it is 56 per cent as against 61 per cent.</P>
    <P>This would mean that, in general, the system which the Opposition are trying to maintain would result in the average electorate per Deputy in urban areas being 11,200, that is, in the Dublin and Cork areas&mdash;as against 12,200 in the rural areas.  I hope that when this campaign is in operation, Opposition Deputies will be prepared to explain to their constituents why it is that they want to maintain a position in which it would take more people in rural Ireland to elect a Deputy than in the urban areas.  Needless to say, in individual constituencies the disparity will be much greater if the Opposition campaign succeeds.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the present constituency of Dublin North-West the electorate, that is, the voters, comprise 50.96 of the total population, whereas in Donegal South-West they comprise 67.74 per cent of the electorate, so that if the present position, which requires constituencies to be delineated on the basis of the same number of the population per Deputy in each constituency, is maintained as a result of this campaign of Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Harte, Deputy P. O'Donnell and other Opposition Deputies, then we will have the situation that in the constituency of Dublin North-West the electorate per Deputy will be 10,206, whereas in Donegal South-West it will take 13,567 voters to elect one Deputy. In Donegal North-East where the electorate is 62.5 per cent of the total population it will take 12,518 people to elect a Deputy as against the 10,206 in Dublin North-West.  In the county <Col N="189" /> of Donegal as a whole, with an electorate of 65.1 per cent of the total population, the number of voters per Deputy will be 13,038 as against 10,206.</P>
    <P>I am just giving these figures for Donegal but they will be made available to the people for other constituencies also and I hope that both Deputy Harte and Deputy P. O'Donnell will be able to explain to the people of Donegal why it is that they want to have this differential in voting effectiveness given to the constituency of Dublin North-West as compared with the county of Donegal, and I hope that Deputy Fitzpatrick will be able to explain to the people of Cavan why it is that he wants to multilate the boundaries of County Cavan, although on the basis of the number of voters per Deputy, there is no reason whatever why that should be done because on the basis of the national average of voters per Deputy, County Cavan could retain its integrity as a three-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have the suspicion that the other points raised were raised merely for the purpose of delaying the progress of this Bill through the House.  Anything that was raised has been covered already, and since the answers to these things are already on the record, I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily by repeating them.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I certainly do not want to delay the House or to hold up the passage of these measures; I want to get them through the House and get them to the people.  The Minister spent four hours yesterday evening dealing with the Schedule to the Third Amendment Bill, going laboriously through constituency after constituency, pouring out figures prepared under his jurisdiction by the Civil Service in an effort to confuse, not to clarify.  When it came as far as the city of Dublin, which comprises the vast proportion of the population of this country, he dismissed it with a brush of his hand and said it was too complicated to deal with.  I simply made the remark when replying to him that I thought he had dealt rather casually with the city of Dublin.  In the <Col N="190" /> course of his further remarks yesterday evening before he reported progress, he promised, or indeed, might I say, he threatened, to deal with Dublin as he had dealt with the other constituencies. He stood up today to continue his reply, and he got back to Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and did not mention Dublin.  Yesterday evening I charged the Minister with introducing the Third Amendment for the purpose of gerrymandering, for the purpose of rigging our electoral laws and, with his majority in the House, of arranging constituencies to suit himself and to suit his pockets of supporters here and there in the country.  I made that specific charge against him, and I based the argument in support of that charge on the fact that the Schedule to the Third Amendment, with which we are dealing now, contains no provision for a commission to arrange the constituencies.  I challenged the Minister to explain to this House and to the country why he included in the Fourth Amendment a commission, with its shortcomings, to arrange the constituencies if proportional representation is abolished, and why in this Third Amendment he made no provision for such commission in the event of the Fourth Amendment being rejected by the people and the Third Amendment being carried.  I accused him, and I accuse him again now, of doing it because he knows that with a tolerance of one-sixth, he will have enough elbow room to gerrymander the constituencies in a way that will give his vote much more strength than it deserves.  The Minister tries to say that this Third Amendment is not an important one, that the change being made is slight.</P>

I say that is undemocratic and unfair.  I asked the Minister to explain to this House why he would not entrust the arrangement of constituencies to a commission consisting of three Government Deputies, three Opposition Deputies, and an impartial, independent chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am asking the Minister why he excluded that from the Third Amendment, and when I reminded him about it last night he said: &ldquo;Why did you not ask me a question and I would have explained?&rdquo;  Today when he stands up his explanation is that the change proposed in the Fourth Amendment is more radical than that in the Third Amendment, and that is why they put the commission into the Fourth Amendment and did not put it into the Third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows perfectly well&mdash; and that is why he is delaying this Bill through the House&mdash;that the Fourth Amendment has no hope whatever of being accepted by the people, but he has some sort of vague hope that he might get the Third Amendment through and he wants to retain for himself with his majority in the House the right to gerrymander, the right to carve up the constituencies in such a way as to give himself and his Party far more representation in this House than they are entitled to.  He wants by that measure not to stimulate interest in public life, not to stimulate political thought, but to kill it by this unfair gerrymandering of constituencies.  He wants to ensure that after the next general election he will have such a majority attained in this unfair, undemocratic, and grossly dishonest way that he will drive people out of political parties and create here a one-party dictatorship.  There is no fear of <Col N="192" /> that if the electoral system is preserved as it is at the present time.  There is no fear of it if the constituencies are fairly delineated.</P>
    <P>I intend to hammer at this obvious attempt by the Minister and the Government to hold on to what I refer to as the Minister's safety value in the Third Amendment.  He wants to retain to himself, with his majority, the right to arrange the constituencies, having given himself this one-sixth tolerance, which is entirely unnecessary and extremely dangerous, especially when in the hands of a political Party presided over by a ruthless, dishonest political boss in the person of the Minister for Local Government.  I intend to hammer at this particular aspect of this Third Amendment because it is by far the most significant provision in it.  If the commission had not been thought of, if it had not been mentioned, it would not have been so obvious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make just two or three observations on the Minister's very lengthy speech.  In the course of that speech, I could only extract one sentence with which I am in complete agreement.  He said that it was no part of the Government's or of Fianna Fáil's purpose in sponsoring the measure before the House to advance the political fortunes of Fine Gael.  I am in complete agreement with that.  Nobody but a fool would imagine that there was any purpose in bringing in this Bill in present circumstances other than to advance the political fortunes of Fianna Fáil.  Before I make my other observations, I want to clear up one matter in order that it be put on the records of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his observations, to which I took exception by way of interruption, the Minister stated that the judgment in the High Court, in regard to the further redistribution of constituencies before the next general election, came at the behest of Fine Gael.  He had, I am glad to say, the grace to withdraw the word &ldquo;behest&rdquo;, but at the same time he did suggest that because Mr. O'Donovan, the plaintiff in the action, and his solicitor, Deputy Ryan, were members of Fine Gael it was on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I want to place it on record that that action was brought on behalf of Mr. John O'Donovan because of his own intellectual conviction that the Bill was unconstitutional, in which he was upheld by Mr. Justice Budd.  He took the action at his own personal risk and if he had lost it, as a lot of people thought he was likely to, he would have had to pay the very heavy costs out of his own pocket.  There was no question of Party funds being involved. He brought that action as an individual believing that he was right, and subsequently he was proved to be right, but he took it at his own personal risk <Col N="194" /> and on his own personal conviction. Fine Gael had no hand, act or part in supporting him in that action by way of monetary contribution or otherwise. I hope I have laid that ghost for all time.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister reading extract after extract from various speeches made by Deputies from the several Opposition Parties here, pointing out the infirmities of the Constitution which led to the difficult situation which then existed as a result of Mr. Justice Budd's decision.  The Minister said that in introducing this Bill he was complying with the wishes of the Opposition Parties.  No statement which he made in the whole course of his long statement had less grounds for validity than that.  Everybody knows he is not bringing it in for that purpose, but, as I said, in order to further the political fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I gather that he stated that he was complying with the wishes of the Opposition Parties in bringing in the Bill and his object in reading extracts from speeches made by Deputy Norton and others pointing out the infirmities which existed in the Constitution and pointing out that something had to be done by way of amendment to the Constitution, was to suggest that this Bill was in conformity with the wishes of those who objected to the provisions of the Bill and the problem facing them as a result of the judgment of the High Court.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Bill, the very objectionable principle embodied in it is that certain sections of the community will, if the Bill gets the benediction of the people, have greater representation in the national parliament than other sections of the community. That is the fundamental principle: that is the objectionable principle. I challenge the Minister, with all his ingenuity, with all the resources he has and all the resources for misrepresentation at his disposal, to justify in any way the suggestion he made in the course of his speech that Deputy Norton, or any other Deputy who spoke in the way he quoted last night, in any way sponsored or suggested, or in any way gave their benediction to <Col N="195" /> that objectionable principle.  They pointed out that there was an infirmity in the Constitution as a result of Mr. Justice Budd's judgment, that there was a problem facing any Government in regard to the redistribution of seats. They never said that the problem was to be met in the way it is to be met in this Bill, giving certain citizens greater representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is flouting the principle of one man, one vote. There is nothing in any of the speeches justifying the suggestion the Minister made.  It was because of this that I rose to speak, to put this on the records of the House.  I would agree that there was a problem but the problem was such that it was a national problem requiring national consideration and a national solution, by agreement, if possible.  What the Minister should have done was to consult the various sections of the House and obtain their suggestions as to how the problem could be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I would have thought that if the Minister were really in earnest in his suggestion and not merely making the hypocritical statement that he was complying with the wishes of the Opposition Parties, he would have consulted them beforehand and that the people in all Parties could have availed of their intellect and experience in obtaining an agreed solution of that undoubted problem. We are faced now with this Bill which embodies that objectionable principle and it is wrong to suggest that the Opposition Parties were in agreement with that principle or that it was to comply with those wishes that this objectionable principle was embodied in the Bill.  I would have thought that consultation between the Parties was more desirable than ever in a Bill of this kind.  There was undoubtedly a constitutional infirmity to be solved and what the Government should have been doing was finding out the best <Col N="196" /> way of solving the problem and not adopting the procedure which they have adopted of bringing in this measure, intending to put the Bill through by their majority, without consultation with any of the Parties because their political interests might be affected by the embodiment of this objectionable principle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick in the course of his observations, to which I listened last night, made charges&mdash;undoubtedly they were well-founded&mdash;that the purpose of the Bill was to advance the political fortunes of Fianna Fáil and that the really objectionable feature of the Bill, apart from the fundamental objection to its principle was that, if the Government were fortunate enough, &mdash;we would say, unfortunate enough, from the national point of view&mdash;to get this measure enacted, then they would be in a position to rig the constituencies in their own favour and they would undoubtedly do so.  While I agree with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, I should like to put the matter on a more general and a sounder basis; I would say that no parliament should put into the hands of any government the powers that are enshrined in this Bill because no government should be put in the position of being tempted to rig constituencies.  I am not enough of a hypocrite to say that, if Fine Gael were in office, we would not attempt to rig the constituencies; we should be less than human if we did not.  Undoubtedly any government, faced with such a temptation, would naturally and inevitably endeavour to rig constituencies, within the law, of course, in their own favour.</P>
      <P>Those are powers that ought not to be given to any government as a matter of high principle, high principle with which this Government in office at the moment is in no way concerned.  That is what I object to; the powers in this Bill should not be given&mdash;first of all, to give people greater representation in the national parliament, abolish the principle of one man, one vote, and also facilitate, in order to achieve political advantage over political opponents, the power, the undoubtedly unjust and irrational power, of rigging constituencies in their own favour.</P>

      <Col N="197" /> These are the main objections I have to this Bill.  I mentioned them in the course of the speech I made on Second Reading.

      <P>I do not think any of us can say now what opinions my father, if he were alive, would hold today.  We can only project what we think he might think.  I certainly know that my father regarded this action by Senator O'Donovan as a mistake and he thought it would give rise to more problems that it would solve.  Actually that seems to be the position now and I should like to put that on record.  As a Deputy who represented a rural constituency and who had the interests of rural constituents at heart, he would not like the problems of rural constituents swamped in this House by the problems of urban-oriented Deputies; that is the position in which my father was, and I am sure that he would look with favour on a Bill which gives tolerance to rural areas and anyone who thinks otherwise is less than fair. We should speak for ourselves and not indulge in interpretations of speeches made by people who are no longer here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, much as I dislike interpreting Deputy Costello, or anyone else, I cannot sit here and listen to people trying <Col N="198" /> to lend the cloak of respectability to their arguments.  If Deputy Costello wants to quote, then he should have his facts right.  I was not here during the whole of yesterday.  Perhaps the Minister explained why he chose to base seats on the basis of population rather than on the basis of the electorate, but, looking at the answer to a reply given to a question put down by Deputy Collins, it would appear that, had this been fixed on the basis of the electorate, only 19 constituencies would have been affected by the 5 per cent tolerance, which was acceptable to Mr. Justice Budd, but, on the basis of population, 24 constituencies would be affected and it would obviously be much better if the basis had been fixed on the electorate.  Would the Minister like to explain the reason for choosing population rather than the electorate?</P>

      <P>When the Bill of 1961 was going through this House, Deputy Corish mentioned my constituency and instanced the fears he had at that time of the results of carving up portions of three counties.  I can assure the Deputy his fears at that time have been fully justified.  Remembering the shifting of population that has taken place since then, that change in the population means that every constituency requires revision.  I know from my own experience that the people in Westmeath and Meath feel out of it to a certain extent.  Most people would prefer to have this fixed on a county basis or on an administrative area basis. My opposite number in Fine Gael seems to have given up the ghost and handed over to Deputy L'Estrange.</P>

      <P>I know that Labour actually published a notice that the Senator in that area was to look after <Col N="199" /> Westmeath.  The question is: should this situation be allowed to occur in every constituency?  My advice is that we should have some consideration for the people and give them the proper tolerance.  It is not a very big one, but it is a fair margin and it would obtain in a number of constituencies.  It is a tolerance which would give the people the chance of keeping within recognised units.  The single-member constituencies would be the ideal.  I know that from experience because I live in the exact centre of the constituency I represent, Meath, Westmeath and portion of Kildare.  I am quite close to everybody.  In the multi-seat constituency, a representative could be living miles away and he could never be truly representative of his whole constituency and portions of his constituency would inevitably be neglected.  A typical example was the question in the last election of who would be the candidate for Longford-Westmeath.  When I was going around the constituency meeting delegates, I found that it was very difficult to get them to talk about their own candidature; they were more concerned about the Longford-Westmeath position.</P>
      <P>I would implore the Opposition to think twice about what they are doing in opposing tolerance and the single-member constituency.  I would ask them to give the people a chance to have administrative areas, such as county council areas.  Otherwise, these areas will be neglected.  There is sitting beside me here a colleague who is in much the same boat as I.  I imagine the position in Waterford would be the same as in my constituency.  If my colleague had not been elected there, that area would be completely neglected and the people there would have nobody to look after them.  The people have been used to administrative areas such as county council areas and like to have their TDs and county councillors all in one area.  It seems strange that in a local election a person would vote Meath or Westmeath while in a Dáil election he would vote Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider what would happen.  We have seen from the reply to the question <Col N="200" /> put down by Deputy Collins the number of constituencies that would be carved up.  Kildare is but one example.  There are others&mdash;Sligo-Leitrim, South Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the tolerance, even some of those areas that have been traditionally dual county constituencies would be able to have their own representatives.  Having had the experience of dealing with three counties in my constituency, I know how difficult it is and I also know the feelings of the people in these cut-away areas.  They would dearly love to have county boundaries retained as far as possible.  That is why I ask the Opposition to think twice about tolerance and the single-seat constituency and to give <Col N="201" /> a chance to the people to elect their representatives on a county basis.  If the single-seat proposal were carried, it would be possible to fit it into the respective counties but you would need tolerance in order that it would have a chance of working.  Otherwise, there will be tremendous carving up.  Mr. Justice Budd gave no great tolerance. In order to get 20,000 votes &mdash; the national average is 20,028 &mdash; there would have to be a great carving up and the people would not know how to get to their representative.  The people should have the say and they should be accommodated.  It is with that in mind that we are bringing in the two Amendments of the Constitution, providing for constituencies on a county basis and also that TDs will be accessible to the people they represent. In the case of most Members of this Dáil, the people do not travel that far in order to see them.  A Deputy has to go out to meet his constituents at the far end of his constituency and must have a centre or office in these places in order to give his constituents an opportunity of meeting him.  We are giving the people a chance to have a representative who is within easy reach of their homes.</P>

      <P>The choice which the Minister is offering the country is whether we are going to change from having a democratic Constitution to a geographic Constitution.  That is the simple situation.  This is done and all these arguments are produced, as Deputy John A. Costello said and as everybody knows, without any of us here saying it, in order to buttress the failing popularity of the Government Party, to try to effect a rescue operation, not upon Fine Gael, but upon themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From observation of the voting trends even in the by-elections which have been boasted of by the Taoiseach, by-elections which were due to the fact that, unfortunately, we lost so many colleagues in the last couple of years, it would seem obvious that the natural progress of events is reducing the strength of the Government Party and is making for greater strength in so far as the Opposition Parties are concerned. <Col N="202" /> I shall not go into the reasons for that.  It is, probably, to some extent true that there is a pendulum effect in operation in every democracy and a pendulum effect in operation in so far as every Deputy is concerned.  I should like to bring to the notice of Deputies who have been talking in this House as if in applying their minds to this problem they were thinking about their own little corner, that membership of this House is very transient, that we live by the most insecure and casual of employments.  There is no guarantee whatsoever of the three &ldquo;Fs&rdquo; for the TD.</P>

      <P>I was saying that the mistake is being made that Deputies&mdash; not all of them but too many of them &mdash;are looking at this whole Bill and have looked at it entirely as it relates to their own personal positions.  This is not as it should be.  We are here tampering with the fundamental instrument <Col N="203" /> of our liberties, the Constitution, which will affect not alone us for our short time in this House, and indeed upon this earth, but will affect the Irish nation for as long as it continues its existence, be that long or short.  The struggle for the nation to continue becomes more difficult with each year this Government exist.  Looking at it from the point of view of the general welfare and good, it seems to me there is inherent in the Schedule a departure from the principle of democratic representation, that is to say, all sections of the community having the right to equal representation in the Dáil based on their numbers, and with no section having advantage over another except in so far as they are numerically superior, that there are more of them in the country than there are of some other section.</P>
      <P>That is the basis and fundamental of freedom, and when we depart from it, we are proceeding along a road which may well wind up with the absolute domination of our whole nation's future by a small power clique.  That is the trend and it is something which should not be tolerated by Dáil Éireann.  Tolerance, they call it. Tolerance, how are you!  Tolerance for what?  We are asked to vote tolerance for dictatorship, for single-Party rule. That is what is being sought here, not tolerance as between the west and the east of Ireland.  We are being asked to tolerate something which is insufferable.</P>

      <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that Deputy Burke and I have pursued a policy of co-existence for over 20 years, long before he became a Member of this House, and when he on two separate occasions sought to intrude upon our privacy, he was repulsed in two successive elections.  Therefore, it cannot be said that I harbour any feelings of rejection as far as Deputy Burke is concerned.  On the other hand, I would suspect that the Minister might have secret longings to see him relegated to some other area so that the Minister might gain a greater assurance of being returned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see by the reports of the Minister's speech that he spoke about distribution and securing representation.  It would appear to me that the principle is to secure representation for depopulated areas at the expense of the urban and built-up areas.  In simple terms, that is nothing more than a robbing of Dublin <Col N="206" /> city and county in the main and other cities and towns in order to create artificial TDs for areas where people do not exist.  This may be supported by those Deputies who think that the Dáil is made for their convenience, and that the Dáil should be a kind of reflection of the physical configuration of the country, but that is not so.  In these times&mdash;and let us endeavour to drag the reactionaries who are pursuing this line into the Sixties and Seventies&mdash;it is people who count, individuals. More and more and more they are counting.  They used not to count of course when Government machines could deploy them at will to secure their own ends and marshal them in voting groups and blocks to secure the return of countless faceless men throughout the country.  That day has gone.  With the advance of enlightenment and knowledge, people are thinking more.  It is the people who must have a say in the election of members of Parliament and every individual, whether he be a farmer, a farm labourer, a road worker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This so-called tolerance seeks to rob him of that and create a special privileged clique, for no other purpose than to prop up in office a Government who are imposing themselves upon the people.  Let me say this.  No one enjoys a general election less than I do.  I do not regard a general election as something to look forward to.  I have had enough of them in my time to know that they can be an agonising experience, but my personal feelings do not come into it.  A duty is imposed upon us here when we become Members of the Dáil.  If we had a general election now or at any other time within the next 12 months, I have no doubt whatever that Fianna Fáil would not come back as the majority Party.</P>

      <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that he is not getting away with this pretence in which he has been indulging over the past several hours that this tolerance is for the good of the country.  It is not.  This tolerance, in inverted commas, which he talks about it simply tolerance of Fianna Fáil who, to my mind, do not really care about the people or where they live, so long as they themselves are in office, and the camp followers who will never be on the Front Bench, fondly though some of them cherish thoughts of such loftiness, know of course that their existence in this House similarly is predicated upon membership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a diminishing return because we are living in different times.  Limerick was an indication of that.  It is obvious that there is no support for this idea among the people. Unfortunately by even contributing to this debate, I am aiding and unwittingly abetting the Minister in his objective, which is to postpone the evil day.

A clearer indication of a bankruptcy of ideas could not be given.

      <P>I know Deputy Dunne's technique.  He accused me of trying to hit the headlines with something I said yesterday.  At least, if I said it, it was in order.  I do not try to hit the headlines by getting myself ejected from the House.</P>
      <P>On the question of tolerance, I know this question of mathematical accuracy which Deputy Costello was trying to deal with.  Let us get down to hard facts.  How are we to get this absolute mathematical equality?  Nobody has produced any answer there.  It is a physical impossibility.  It is also accepted in the Constitution that constituency boundaries must be revised on the basis of the population as ascertained at the last preceding census.  By the time the results of the census have been ascertained and published, they are already out of date.  Thousands of people have died.  Maybe hundreds of people have left the country.  Thousands of babies have been born.  You will not get mathematical accuracy in 1968 based on the 1966 census because a lot of people have been born or died in the intervening period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way to get mathematical accuracy, that is, by working on the electorate only, treating the <Col N="211" /> country as one constituency and voting on a purely Party ticket and not for individual candidates.  This is the system which has been practised in Europe and in many countries and which has consistently led to disaster.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of dealing with high-falutin' theory, we are trying to deal with the hard facts of life, one of which is that there is a tremendous variation throughout the country in the proportion of those of the population who are electors.  In certain constituencies, a high proportion of the total population are electors.  In others, it is a comparatively low proportion.  That is a thing which can throw out mathematical accuracy altogether unless you say that constituencies should be redrawn purely on the basis of the electoral list.  I can imagine the howl that would come from the Opposition if we were to suggest any such thing.  We should be told we were rigging the electoral lists, that we were bribing those employed to make up the electoral register.</P>
    <P>It is far more fair to base the constituencies on the population and not just on the electors because those constituencies should stand for more than four or five years and, consequently, you are basing them not only on the actual electors at the time but on the potential electors, those who will be electors during the ensuing eight or ten years.</P>

      <P>It has been said that the people have no wish for this Bill and, particularly, for the provisions of the Bill as set out in the Schedule.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that nobody outside this House is at all disturbed by the fact that there are wide discrepancies in voting strength throughout the country at the present day because nobody feels himself adversely affected in any way.  The only <Col N="214" /> reason we on this side of the House are concerned about it is because we know that, in itself, it would be a breach of the Constitution if we were to allow it to go to another general election.  We could not run another general election on that basis.  It has to be altered whether or not we like it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>He agrees with us, then, that nobody feels himself in any way concerned about it but we are concerned about it on the constitutional issue.  We must do it in some way.  We must amend the whole procedure in some way so that it becomes workable simply because mathematical accuracy for any period is a physical impossibility. We have, therefore, suggested a tolerance of one-sixth up or down to deal with the changes which will undoubtedly occur from time to time.</P>
      <P>Every sort of obscene motive is being attributed to us for doing this simply because there is no rational argument. Anybody who thinks it over quietly will find it obvious that you must have a certain amount of give and take to compensate for the different proportions in different constituencies of populations and electorates.  You must make provision for migration from the rural to the urban areas and for changes in population, births, deaths and so on.  We want a system which will give some stability in constituencies so that they will not be changed every five years.  It is far better, if possible, that constituency boundaries should be retained for, I would say, up to ten years or more&mdash; the longer the better, because the longer the period, the more chance there is of getting a community spirit in the area and a proper relationship between the electorate and the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter that should be dealt with on its merits and not simply by ascribing dirty motives to the Government. It is an entirely destructive attitude on the part of those who say this Schedule is completely wrong and malicious and so on.  If the Minister <Col N="215" /> has challenged them before, I challenge them again now: can you think of any other way in which to consider a realistic basis of forming constituencies which will not be of a very temporary nature only?  Can you think of any other basis which will take account of variations between electorate and total population?  I certainly cannot, and I think the Minister was perfectly justified yesterday in showing what would happen in the main country constituencies if his proposal were defeated.</P>
    <P>The urban constituencies are not as difficult in many ways unless you take them street by street or ward by ward. I do not think it will really worry city constituencies very much if there are slight alterations in their boundaries, nothing like the alterations in a country area, where a county boundary may be affected, because there is not the same close community spirit in any city as there is in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is challenged to do it, I am sure he can do it, but I do not think there is much point in going through the various Dublin city and county constituencies, Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown, and coming up with a lot of absolute facts.  That will not get us any great distance, but if the Opposition want it, I am sure the Minister would be only too glad to explain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have something which, to my mind, exposes again the incredible inconsistency of the Opposition.  We hear them saying: &ldquo;Let us get this matter to the country quickly; let the Minister stop talking.&rdquo; Now they are saying he should keep telling us what may happen, start going into suppositions.  How does that affect the issue?  The issue now before the House is whether or not we are to have <Col N="216" /> a system whereby the proportion of electorate per Deputy shall be maintained with a certain latitude for tolerance of one-sixth up or down, over or under the national average.  That is the only point at issue.  Whether a bit of Rathmines goes into Rathgar or a bit of Rathgar slides into Terenure will not alter the situation in the slightest degree.  It may be an interesting mathematical exercise, but if people are anxious to get down to the hard facts of what is before us, this sort of exercise is not very helpful.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this is the only workable scheme which has so far been put forward.  No workable alternative scheme under the Constitution has even been suggested in the vaguest outline and if the Opposition Parties are going to say: &ldquo;This is damnable, devilish and malicious&rdquo; and so on, let them, in the national interest, come up with some better scheme.  Even Deputy Lindsay had to agree that the old constituency system at present required revision.</P>

Therefore we have got to live with a certain amount of mathematical inequality.  We have always lived with it, and no member of the electorate to whom I have ever spoken has felt in the slightest degree prejudiced or unfairly treated by the way this has happened, even though at the moment the variation from the 16 per cent up or down is 45 per cent up in Dublin county; it is 30.55 per cent above the national average in my own constituency, and nobody is worried about it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are united on both questions, but it is the question of tolerance that is in this amendment. We know that the Opposition are divided on this question 50-50 and therefore there will not be a united effort.  The Deputies who have spoken over there are those who are opposed to this amendment.  The Opposition Members who are willing to accept the amendment have not spoken here so far, and we should like to have their views on this matter.  This question of tolerance is very important.  It is important from the point of view of giving stability to the various constituencies throughout the country.  It is also important from the point of view of ensuring that we shall have here an adequate rural representation.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the principle of one man, one vote.  Under the present system we have not got that.  In my own constituency, there is a glaring example of this.  The area of West Waterford that was taken into South Tipperary on the occasion of the last division of constituencies contains a population of roughly 11,000, in or about the population of the town of Clonmel.  The area of West Waterford has a voting strength of roughly 7,000 and the town of Clonmel, with roughly the same population, has a voting strength of roughly 5,000.  This is a glaring example, showing that the vote in Clonmel carries much greater weight than that in the rural area of West Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stability of constituencies is essential, and I am very conscious of this, coming from a constituency which suffered under the last division.  I know how the people of Waterford resented being taken out of their county and <Col N="221" /> attached to the constituency of South Tipperary; and how they resented the fact that Waterford was reduced from a four-seat constituency to a three-seat constituency.  If this tolerance proposal is not carried, they will be facing a further change.  We do not know what that change will be, but yesterday evening the Minister gave us some idea of what may happen.  He told us that under the Constitution the constituency of North Tipperary has not sufficient population at present to maintain three Deputies.  This could mean a further division between South Tipperary and North Tipperary, and there is the possibility that on this occasion South Tipperary would be reduced to a three-seat constituency in North Tipperary and that Waterford could become a four-seat constituency with portion of South Tipperary added on.  If that happens, I know the people of South Tipperary will not take kindly to it, and rightly so.  I would not like to see it happen.  I am sure Deputy Hogan across the way would not like it to happen; and I am sure my colleague, Deputy Treacy, would not like to see, for instance, the town of Clonmel going into County Waterford for election purposes.</P>
    <P>This would be altogether undesirable and it is in order to avoid something like that happening that we are asking the House, and will in turn be asking the people, to accept the tolerance proposal we are putting before them in this amendment.  A revision having taken place, it could happen that after the next census further revision would be necessary and we would have the ridiculous situation that the Deputies elected would not know where their future constituencies would be and that the electorate would not know who their future representative would be or in what constituency they would be for the coming general election. It is such a situation we want to avoid by having this proposal accepted.</P>
    <P>I am personally aware of the difficulties of dealing with two county councils, and I am a firm believer in the retaining of administrative areas and county boundaries.  I know how difficult it is dealing with two sets of county managers, county engineers, <Col N="222" /> county medical officers and officials, down to the very bottom of the list. This situation can make the work of a Deputy much harder.  The rural vote is an important one and I cannot see how the rural Deputies in particular are going to go back to their various constituencies and oppose this amendment. The people in the rural areas will not take kindly to it.  They believe they are entitled to adequate representation here.  The city Deputies may think they are courting favour with their constituents by opposing this but a lot of the people in the cities are first or second generation country people who have loyalties to their own particular areas and they would not like to see them denied the representation they are entitled to.  I believe we will get both amendments because we are united on this and because the Opposition are divided.</P>

      <P>In view of what has been stated by some of the Opposition speakers, I want to express my appreciation of the effort the Minister has made in placing before the Dáil the full facts regarding this Third Amendment.  On many occasions we have heard Opposition speakers stating that the Dáil is the place in which important matters should be discussed and that the Government should put their views before the people through the Dáil.  We had the Minister yesterday going to great lengths to explain the very intricate problems in order to show up all the implications of this Bill.  What did we get in return? Nothing but criticism from the Opposition benches for having done this.  The <Col N="223" /> pity is that public interest in the affairs of this House is not great and it is to be regretted that his speech will not be read by many people throughout the country.  If every citizen who will have a vote in the referendum took the time to sit down and read through his speech, there would be no doubt about the outcome of the referendum.</P>
      <P>Despite the lack of interest among the public in this, we believe, and I say this in all sincerity, that there will not be any great difficulty in getting this referendum through.  We are the people who are putting it forward and it is up to us to explain it to the people.  We have had nothing but negative criticism from the Opposition Parties.  If they want to present a negative case to this amendment, by all means let them do so.  We have a responsibility to the people and we are putting forward a proposal which we believe to be in the best interests of the people.  We want the people to decide on this issue, and that is why the Third Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, have been brought forward.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Norton, on television last night, stating exactly the same thing. He is giving an independent view.  As he is not now tied by the Labour Party, he can do so.</P>

We believe that a tremendous amount of study and hard work will have to be done by us.  The Opposition do not want the people to know what this is about.  They want to finish the debate so that the people will not know what it is about and will be left in the dark. As they know from our performance in the past, we will not allow that to happen.  We are interested in the future not only of the Party but of the country and of the people, whether they vote for us or not.  It is only too plain that the only interest Fine Gael and the Labour Party Members have is in their own individual seats and positions and the future of their Parties.  There has <Col N="224" /> been an effort made on the part of some Fine Gael Members to oppose these two proposals purely for selfish reasons.  That is quite clear and it is well known throughout the country. They could not deny now, if I put it to them, that the decision they made was defeated by one vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the time he took yesterday to put the full facts before us.  If it is true that the west of Ireland is to lose three TDs, if this goes through, that might not concern very many people, but, if there are three TDs fewer in one place, there will be three added in another place. I know the progression.  One can end up with a completely Dublin or Leinster-orientated East of Ireland Parliament and the rest of Ireland will be forgotten. Are we to arrive at a position when Ireland ends at Chapelizod?  So long as I am alive, that day will never come.  I will fight to the end to ensure that the people in the West, in the South and in Donegal are given proper representation here in our Irish Parliament.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a few short words since the last speaker, supported by the Minister, has brought into the discussion the question of the Fine Gael attitude.  I want to make it quite clear that the statement issued by the Fine Gael Party, after they considered this matter and <Col N="228" /> took their decision on it, conveyed that decision accurately and there were considerably fewer members of the Fine Gael Party who had reservations with regard to that attitude than there were amongst the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who voted for Deputy Colley as Taoiseach as against Deputy Lynch.  I should like to make that quite clear for the digestion, in particular, of the Minister for Local Government and Deputy Molloy.  So far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned with the particular measure before the House at the moment and with the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which we will be considering later, there is no doubt in the mind of anyone in this Party, and there need be no doubts in the mind of anyone in the country, that we are going to fight this tooth and nail and we are going to defeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already today, I thought I had dealt fairly comprehensively with this proposal, but a number of Opposition Deputies have asked me to deal with other aspects of it, in particular Deputy Fitzpatrick, who has demanded that I go in some more detail into the position in the Dublin area.  Deputy Fitzpatrick may not remember that I dealt with the situation in Dublin city and county as a whole and that I said it must be obvious, even to Deputy Fitzpatrick, who has taken no interest in the matter, that the ways in which the situation arising in that area could be dealt with were so numerous that there did not seem to be much point in my trying to go through all the different arrangements that might happen in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did, however, place on the records of the House the fundamental facts with regard to the Dublin area.  I gave the House the total population in accordance with the 1966 census.  I gave the total number of voters in the area in accordance with the 1967-68 register of electors.  I showed Deputy Fitzpatrick and any other Deputy who wanted to know, and who was prepared to take the trouble of reading yesterday's debate, that, on the basis of total population, the minimum number of seats for Dublin would be 38, an increase of four, whereas, on the basis of voters, the increase required would be <Col N="229" /> only two.  I compared that with the situation in the west of Ireland in an area stretching from Donegal to Clare, including the province of Connacht, where, on the basis of population &mdash; which is the basis the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are determined to retain &mdash; there must be a reduction in the total representation of the area from 33 to 30, a loss of three seats, although, on the basis of voters per Deputy, the reduction should be only from 33 to 32.</P>
    <P>The whole operation, therefore, of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in opposing this amendment to the Constitution, which we are putting forward &mdash; largely, as I showed in response to the unanimous demands of the Opposition Parties in 1961&mdash;is intended to deprive the people in the western part of the country of two seats to which they are fully entitled, even on the most rigid interpretation of this famous principle of one man one vote.  It is intended to do that for the purpose of giving to the urban area of Dublin an extra representation of two Deputies to which that area is not entitled in accordance with this principle.  I surmised that part of the reason for this campaign was that Fine Gael Deputies from rural areas had lately shown a tendency of wanting to transfer themselves from their rural constituencies to the city of Dublin.  Deputy M.J. O'Higgins is, we are led to believe, one of the four who have been mentioned in this regard.  Deputy Lindsay, is, admittedly, another.  There are also Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and, apparently, Deputy P. O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>Having shown that, I really thought that I had dealt sufficiently with the Dublin area.  There did not seem to be any point in going into the individual constituencies as they exist in Dublin at present because it must be obvious that those constituencies will have no further relevance if there is to be a revision of constituencies carried out now on the basis of the last census and on the basis of the Constitution as it is at present, that is on the assumption that this amendment will not be made because, obviously, the only thing that could be done in regard to the Dublin area would be to start afresh, to start right from scratch and deal with it in <Col N="230" /> the new.  There would be no question of a Dublin county constituency, Dún Laoghaire or Rathdown, Dublin North-East, Dublin North-Central, Dublin South-East, Dublin South-Central and Dublin South-West.  These constituencies just will not exist any more. We will just have to start afresh and draw up a completely new system of constituencies for the Dublin area.  As I say, there are numerous ways in which that could be done.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the first thing we would have to decide in regard to the Dublin area would be how that area will be affected by all the problems that will arise in the counties bordering on it.  I gave some indication yesterday of what these problems are and indicated that the solution of those problems might very well involve some adjustments with the county of Dublin.  That might be found to be &mdash; I shall not say the most satisfactory way of dealing with the problem &mdash; but the least unsatisfactory way, because, as everybody here knows, both Opposition Deputies and Deputies on this side of the House &mdash; only the Opposition Deputies will not admit it &mdash; the constituencies cannot be revised in a satisfactory way under the present system.  Even Deputy Costello admitted that there was a &ldquo;constitutional infirmity&rdquo;, as he described it here today.  I am not going back on history. Deputy Hogan seems to be surprised that Deputy Costello said that but he did say it today, just a short time ago. It was admitted by everybody, he said, that this &ldquo;constitutional infirmity&rdquo; was there and that it was not a reasonable thing that the Constitution should require these injustices to be perpetrated on a comparatively large section of the community throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I admit that this was rather surprising, particularly when we are told by other members of the Fine Gael Party that they are quite united on this matter and in view of the fact that Deputy Fitzpatrick has been for days here, both on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage of this Bill, making it apparent that in so far as he was concerned &mdash; and he is supposed to be the spokesman of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; the present constitutional requirement <Col N="231" /> is ideal, that it is democratic and that there is no need to amend it.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, obviously, in dealing with the situation in the Dublin area, the first thing that would have to be decided would be, for instance, whether the situation that arises in County Meath could be best dealt with by an adjustment with the county of Dublin or in some other way and, of course, the situation that will arise in County Meath is something that cannot be postulated definitely at present because what happens in Meath is dependent on what happens in Louth and what happens in Louth is dependent on what happens in Monaghan and what happens in Monaghan is dependent on what happens in Cavan.</P>
    <P>As I showed yesterday, nothing at all need happen in County Cavan, unless Deputy Fitzpatrick has his way and this amendment is not effected, because there is no reason whatever for any change in County Cavan as the number of voters in the county fully entitles it to its present three seats.  However, the unnecessary situation that Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to create in his own constituency of Cavan, the disruption that he wants to create there, the butchering of the county boundaries that he wants to cause in Cavan, will affect all these other counties and will be a factor that must be taken into consideration in deciding on the revision of the scheme of constituencies in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>County Meath, as I said, may be affected either by having to receive a considerable portion of the population of County Louth or by giving a considerable portion of its population to County Louth.  Again, it may be affected by receiving back from the Kildare constituency portion of the population of County Meath that was transferred to that constituency in 1961.  Another way in which County Meath might be affected would be in adjusting the situation of Longford-Westmeath.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say at this stage which of these situations will arise in the County Meath because it all depends on the way in which other constituencies <Col N="232" /> are dealt with.  One thing is certain, that there will be a problem to be dealt with there and one of the possible solutions of it would involve an adjustment of one kind or another with County Dublin, either by transferring part of County Dublin to a Meath constituency or by transferring part of Meath to a Dublin County constituency.</P>
    <P>Dublin is also bordered by the County Kildare and the same thing may happen with regard to Kildare because, although the present constituency of Kildare is, as I showed yesterday, within the constitutional requirements, just as Meath is at present, and there is no requirement in accordance with the present Constitution to revise either a Kildare or a Meath constituency, still, because of what Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to insist on happening in Cavan, the constituency of Kildare may well be affected also by this unnecessary chopping and changing.</P>

    <P>The other county which borders Dublin is County Wicklow.  As far as <Col N="233" /> I can see, that is one of the counties that is likely &mdash; but not certain &mdash; to escape change on this occasion but, of course, not on future occasions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in dealing with the Dublin situation, you would, first of all, have to base our approach on some assumptions in regard to County Meath and County Kildare.  Accordingly, no really definite indication can be given at this stage as to what would happen in the Dublin area, but the position there is that the population of the whole county of Dublin, including the county borough, is 795,047 people.  That of course is the figure on which in present circumstances representation must be based.  That figure includes new-born children as well as voters.  It includes all children in the different maternity hospitals, on census night, whether or not they ever see Dublin again for the rest of their lives. It includes pupils in colleges and visitors in hotels.  It includes aliens who have not got a vote here at all.  All these people must be taken into account in determining constituencies at present.</P>
    <P>That is what the Deputies opposite are insisting on.  That is what we will let their constituents know they are insisting on before this referendum is held.  That is the figure.  In accordance with that figure, the Dublin area must get at least 38 seats.  The number of voters there on the 1967-68 register is 446,781.  On the assumption that the same percentage divergence from the national average of voters would be permissible as in the case of population, this would require a minimum of 36 seats, not 38.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, who represents the constituency of Cavan, Deputy Collins, who represents West Cork, Deputy Hogan, who represents South Tipperary &mdash; all these people for some reason or other want to ensure that this area will be given two seats more than even the most rigid interpretation of this principle they have so frequently quoted requires.</P>

      <P>For some reason or other they want to deprive the rural <Col N="234" /> part of this country of at least two seats to which that part of the country is fully entitled, no matter how rigidly you interpret this idea of one vote equalling another vote in different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I think I know the people of Dublin as well as anybody else.  I was born and reared in the city of Dublin.  I am elected for a Dublin constituency.  I have no hesitation in going to any part of Dublin city or county and saying to the people there that there is no reason why a Dublin vote should be more valuable than a rural vote.  I know the Dublin people and I think they are prepared to accept that.  The Opposition Parties have got accustomed to the idea of treating the electorate, whether a rural electorate or an urban electorate, as being people incapable of appreciating such things.  We have not. We believe that they can appreciate this and that is why we continue to retain the support of the people.  I do not believe the people of Dublin want to deprive the people of rural Ireland of a right to which they are fully entitled.  I can well understand that Deputies like Deputy Lindsay who are in the process of leaving a rural constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then Deputy Lindsay's prospects of securing election in the new field in which he has chosen to serve are greatly increased. I want to point out that the figures show that this is an undemocratic thing <Col N="235" /> that the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party are trying to do.  I am quite confident both the people of Dublin and of rural Ireland will accept that.</P>
      <P>If this proposal we are making that the maximum permissible divergence from the national average of one-sixth over or below is passed and if it were utilised to the maximum possible extent in the urban areas, the absolute minimum representation that the Dublin area could receive would be 35, which would be an increase of one.  As I said, it is quite obvious it will not be possible to use this maximum divergence of one-sixth throughout the country as a whole, even if anybody wanted to.  It would not be possible to do it because for one thing you have not got the population with that great accuracy. You have it only for certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not one-sixth. It is one-sixth above or below.  That is one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said. Even if anybody wanted to use the minimum population per Deputy in every part of rural Ireland and the maximum population per Deputy in every more urbanised area, it would not be physically possible to do it. Therefore, the likelihood is, at the very minimum, if this proposal we have is passed by the people, the Dublin area will have 36 seats, which is exactly the number required, based on the national average of voters per Deputy.  Therefore this proposal will do no injustice to the Dublin area, for which the Deputies opposite in the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party express such concern. They say they are concerned that justice shall be done in the Dublin area.  That is what they pretend.  In fact, what they are trying to do is to ensure that there will be a differential in the voting power as between urban and rural areas.  I have already demonstrated that.  I know the Deputies opposite will try to conceal that but we intend to see they will not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I showed here that the percentage of voters in the population of Dublin North-West is 50.96 per cent of the population comprising the electorate <Col N="236" /> there.  If constituencies are to be as the Opposition want, if they are to be decided on the basis of strict equality of population per Deputy, this will mean that the number of voters per Deputy in the Dublin North-West area will be 10,206.  I pointed out that in Donegal South-West the percentage of the population comprised by the electorate is 67.74.  What the Opposition are trying to do is to arrange that there will be an electorate per Deputy in Donegal South-West of 13,567 as against 10,206 in the Dublin North-West area.</P>
    <P>Deputies may try to do what they like here.  I can assure them we will let the people know exactly what they are trying to do.  In the county of Donegal as a whole, for instance, the percentage of the population which the electorate comprises is 65.1.  What the Opposition are insisting on is that it will take 13,038 voters to elect a Deputy in that county as against 10,206 in the constituency at present described as Dublin North-West.  The amazing thing is that Deputies opposite are trying to maintain this position, and they have the effrontery to say that they are doing this in the interests of ensuring that votes will be equal in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The fact that Fine Gael Deputies are deciding to contest city constituencies instead of the constituencies that have elected them is one indication that officially, as a Party, they have decided to abandon the rural areas.  It did not need Deputy Cosgrave's speech in which he indicated that it is now the policy of the Fine Gael Party to reduce the number of farmers in the country to one in every 60&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is obvious that even if Fine Gael do succeed in eliminating all these family farms they intend to eliminate, those who will survive and eventually wind up owning farms with a minimum of 400 cows per farm will not be even a small percentage of the existing farmers, because few farmers <Col N="237" /> will be able to acquire the capital necessary to equip and stock farms of that size.  It is creating a new class of person altogether.  However, I do not think that arises on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I assume that when Deputy Fitzpatrick asks me to deal with the Dublin area he wants me to go through the Dublin constituencies as they exist at present and show what the position is.  As I have said, the figures have all been put on the records of the House already.  I know that the Fine Gael Party have been complaining about their lack of facilities for research.  It may be that it was with that in mind that Deputy Collins was so kind as to arrange to have the figures put on the records of the House.  They are there and available &mdash; they were given in reply to a question &mdash; to Deputies who want to know what the position is.</P>

      <P>The constituencies in Dublin have no further relevance because it is obvious that the change of population in that whole area will require a completely new approach after we have decided how the area is to be affected by the situation arising in Meath and Kildare.  However, since Deputy Fitzpatrick is incapable of reading the figures for himself and wants me to read them out specially for him, I will start off with the constituency of Dublin County.</P>
      <P>In the constituency of Dublin County, the population, in accordance with the 1966 census, is 145,903, and the number of voters on the register is 74,600.  In accordance with the High Court decision, such a constituency, if it were to continue, would have to have a minimum of seven seats allocated to it.  If the constituency could be considered in isolation, which it cannot of course, the matter could be dealt with by increasing the representation of that constituency by two, by making it to a seven-seat constituency.  That might be the simplest way to deal with it if it could be considered in isolation, which it cannot be because it is affected by all the other Dublin constituencies and by the situation in Meath and Kildare.</P>
      <P>No one can say at this stage exactly what will happen in the constituency of Dublin County but I have given the figures to Deputy Fitzpatrick which he is incapable of reading from the Official Report himself.  I have indicated to him that the proper representation of that constituency would be seven Deputies in accordance with the present requirements of the Constitution. If it could be considered by itself, it could be dealt with by taking those two seats which Deputy Lindsay unjustifiably wants to take from the Province of Connacht and giving them to the constituency of Dublin County as it exists at present, and no doubt we would have Deputy Lindsay contesting the constituency of Dublin County, and we would then have the benefit of two Mayomen contesting it.</P>

      <P>The position in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is that the population in accordance with the 1966 census is 104,582, and the number of voters on the 1967-68 register is 61,322.  Obviously that constituency in accordance with the present requirements of the Constitution, if it could be considered alone, if it would not be affected by other adjustments in other constituencies, would be entitled to five Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the 1966 census, the constituency of Dublin North-East has a population of 139,163 and the number of voters is 78,192.  This is, as Deputies may know &mdash; particularly those Deputies who have investigated the possibility of transferring themselves to the Dublin area &mdash; a five-seat constituency at present.  On the basis of the present population, like the constituency of Dublin County, it would be entitled to seven seats.  This is another area to which Deputy Lindsay, the two Deputies O'Higgins and <Col N="240" /> Deputy O'Donnell might direct their attention if this is not passed.</P>

      <P>I now come to another constituency which will not have the same attraction for Deputy Lindsay, the constituency of Dublin North-Central where the population in accordance with the 1966 census is 66,842 and the number of voters is 38,557.  It is a four-seat constituency but in accordance with the High Court decision, the minimum population required for a four-seat constituency is 76,112. This is one of the constituencies that have more representation than is justified by the present requirements of the Constitution.  It will have to be adjusted in some way.  It cannot be adjusted by a mere reduction in the number of seats because there would be too many there then, for three seats in accordance with the High Court interpretation of the Constitution. Therefore, it must be adjusted with some neighbouring constituency.  Obviously, this means, as I said already, that there is no point really in considering the constituencies in Dublin as they exist at present &mdash; the constituencies of Dublin County, Dublin North-East and so on &mdash; because they will be affected by a situation such as this.</P>
      <P>The constituency of Dublin North-West as it exists at present has a population of 81,841 and has 41,715 voters.  That constituency is a three-seat constituency at present.  In accordance with the present constitutional provisions, it requires additional representation.  It would be entitled to four seats as against the three there at present.  If rumour is correct, I think that is one of the constituencies in which the Fine Gael migrants or potential migrants are showing an interest.</P>

      <P>This constituency of Dublin North-West is entitled to four seats in accordance with the present Constitution.  This will be based on a voting strength per Deputy in the area of 10,206 as against 13,567 in Donegal South-West &mdash; and this is the democratic principle that Deputy Dunne, Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan and the rest of them are trying to establish, namely, that it should take over 13,500 votes to elect a Deputy in a scattered and mountainous rural area and a bare 10,000 votes in a built-up area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Fine Gael Party apparently agree with Deputy Ryan's contention that the trials and tribulations of a Deputy in covering his constituency from Rathmines to Kimmage are much more difficult and impose much more hardship on that Deputy than would be imposed on Deputy Harte in covering Donegal from the top of Inishowen down to Bundoran, or down through part of County Leitrim, which may be the position if this amendment is not effected.  It may be for that reason that the Deputies opposite want to have a smaller electorate per Deputy in the Dublin area than in those much more easily worked areas of Donegal and Kerry, the idea apparently being that to travel in and out of the Kerry peninsulas and around the McGillicuddy Reeks and the Sliabh Mis Mountains is a much easier operation than this fearsome journey Deputy Ryan described to us that he has to perform in visiting his constituents and travelling from Rathmines to Kimmage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency of Dublin SouthEast, as it exists at present, has a population of 65.608 and the number of voters there is 41,013.  That is a three-seat area.  Marginally, it would be in excess of the permitted number of population per Deputy at present. Therefore, this would be one of the constituencies that require adjustment in accordance with the present constitutional requirements.  The population, however, is not such as to call for another Deputy.  Accordingly, it could <Col N="242" /> be dealt with either by being added to a part of some other constituency or by part of that other constituency being incorporated in it.</P>
    <P>The population in Dublin South-Central is 90,687 and the number of voters there is 53,295.  That is a five-seat area.  There would be surprise if this is one of the areas Deputy Lindsay has been investigating, because the minimum population required at present for five seats is 95,140.  Therefore, this constituency would obviously have to be altered, either by losing a seat and having portion of the area transferred to some other Dublin constituency or by having portion of some other constituency added to it and retaining its present representation.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the only realistic way to deal with the whole problem in the Dublin area would be to start afresh and to ignore the existence of any constituency whatever in the area and to start on the basis of the total population of 795,047 and draw up a completely new scheme of constituencies.</P>
    <P>Dublin South-West has a population of 100,221 and the number of voters there is 58,097.  This is a five-seat area. It is one of the few constituencies that are within the present provisions of the Constitution.  Fourteen out of the 38 constituencies comply with the present constitutional requirements and this is one of them.  It is not a constituency that can avoid dismemberment because of that because the constitutional requirements in the rest of the Dublin area will inevitably also affect Dublin South-West.  The possible result may conceivably be that the journeys Deputy Ryan will have to perform in order to get from one part of his constituency to the other may be even more hazardous and make more demands on his stamina than his present stupendous task of travelling occasionally from Rathmines to Kimmage.</P>
    <P>That gives Deputy Fitzpatrick the information he requires to visualise the position in the Dublin area, and the problems there will be in deciding on the new scheme of constituencies if this amendment is not passed.  His idea of <Col N="243" /> what may happen is as good as mine but, as I pointed out, he would, first of all, want to decide on how the situation in Meath and Kildare would be dealt with and work on from there. The fundamental thing about it, at any rate, is that this area as a whole has at present 34 seats.  The western area of Donegal to Clare, including the Province of Connacht, has 33 seats.  If the amendment we propose is not made, this area must have an increase of four seats and the western area must have a decrease of three seats.</P>
    <P>However, if a revision were based on the number of voters, the increase in seats in this Dublin area would be two &mdash; not four &mdash; and the decrease of seats in the western area would be one &mdash; not three.  The spurious claim of the Opposition Parties that their opposition to this proposal is on the basis of their desire to ensure that in every part of the country a vote will be of equal effect in electing a Deputy is shown to be a spurious claim by this fact, that what they insist on is that there will be two more seats than are required by that principle in the Dublin area and two fewer seats than are required by that principle in the rural area.  It exposes this as an attempt by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to deprive rural areas of the country, and the rural parts of Dublin also, of their due representation.  This is a deliberate attempt by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to perpetuate the injustice that resulted from the Fine Gael manoeuvre in the courts in 1961, to perpetuate that situation and to ensure for evermore that an urban vote will be of greater effect in electing a Deputy than a rural vote.  It is part of a vendetta&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The judgment of the High Court was to the effect that the Article of the Constitution did not permit this to be done and as a result of that, as I have shown by quotations from many Opposition speakers in 1961, it was the view at that time of all sides of this House that this requirement of the Constitution which had now been interpreted by the authority which is laid down as being the competent authority to interpret, constituted an injustice on the people of the country.  Deputy Costello here today admitted that.  There was what he described as a &ldquo;constitutional infirmity&rdquo;. He implied that there was some other way in which that could be rectified <Col N="245" /> but he studiously refrained from indicating any way in which this injustice which the Constitution requires to be perpetrated on the people, can be rectified other than by giving the Oireachtas reasonable scope to avoid this injustice; in other words, by giving them reasonable scope in regard to the proportion of population per Deputy in different areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When this Bill was being discussed on Second Stage, while welcoming it and feeling that it was a measure that was needed at the present time and in the circumstances prevailing, I expressed a certain amount of <Col N="248" /> concern about section 4.  In that section the Minister takes complete control over the operation and development of fishery harbour centres.  While this is necessary, as I say, at present, the Minister might find himself in the position later on, when things improve and when the idea of co-operation among fishermen is developed to the point to which it should be developed, to bring in a co-operative to do this type of work and to hand over the authority which he now seeks in this section.  It may be that the next section leaves the door open for him to do this.  I am not quite certain about that, but I should like to feel that it is possible.  I can see a situation where it might be much wiser not to have this type of work carried out by the State but to let it be carried out by a co-operative organisation or by some other local interest.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether he considers that he can divest himself of these powers if he thinks it safe and wise to do this at a later date when things settle down in certain fishing harbours that have not been settled for a long time and when people really get working together on this job.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A reference in this Act to a person shall include bodies corporate or unincorporated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an idea that this is covered in the Bill, but I wanted to make sure it is covered.  I have a vague recollection that in some previous Bill I put in something like this as a safeguard.  I am sure there is a definition Act, which was not available to me as a reference when I was trying to amend this Bill.  I wanted to show particularly that co-operative societies were included in this word &ldquo;person&rdquo; and that they could not be excluded, because co-operative societies have a very important part to play if this Bill is to be the success we all hope it will be and if we are to arrive at the point where the whole business of selling wool and the preparation for the <Col N="251" /> selling of wool, is to be conducted in the manner in which it should be and in such a way that the producer will get the maximum prices for his wool eventually.  It is simply because of my concern to ensure that co-operatives came under the heading of &ldquo;person&rdquo; that I tabled this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether in fact this is right because I think he will agree that it is important that they should not be left out.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual.</P>

      <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  On the establishment day there shall be established a body to be known as An Chomhairle Olla (in this Act referred to as An Chomhairle) to perform the functions assigned to it by this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  An Chomhairle shall consist of a chairman and eleven other members.</P>
      <P>(3)  The provisions of the Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to An Chomhairle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> When studying the Bill to see how I felt it should be amended, I found that it was necessary not only to change section 12 but to bring it forward, because at this point we start allocating responsibilities.  This amendment deals with section 12 particularly, in which the Minister sets up a body with a maximum of 11 people and which could have as few as six.  There is no magic in my suggestion that it should be 12.  When I sat down to consider the various bodies which I felt had a contribution to make to this whole scheme and to the entire organisation of the wool business, its production, presentation, grading and marketing, I arrived at the point where we would have at least 12 people.  I feel sure that the Minister will see no objection to any of these.</P>
    <P>We should know in advance that producers particularly would be well represented on this body because their wholehearted co-operation is essential at every point, from production to manufacture, if this scheme is to be a success and if it is to achieve the objectives for which it is being brought in.  I want to see full producer involvement and for that reason, in amendment 26, I have set out the way in which this body should be composed.</P>
    <P>I propose in my amendment that the members of An Chomhairle shall be appointed by the Minister as follows: two members selected and appointed by the Minister, one of whom shall be chairman.  It is essential that the Minister should have this sort of contact with An Chomhairle Olla in order to know how it is operating and in order to have a measure of control over what is happening, because the Minister has final responsibility.  Two people, one of whom would be chairman, would be in a position to keep him well informed of everything that was taking place in this important body.  Two members then should be nominated by the pedigree sheep societies.  There are a number of pedigree sheep societies and they should be entitled to at least two people on this board.  That is a personal view.  Outside of the pedigree sheep societies, you have the Combined Sheep Farmers Association and a number of other bodies very much involved <Col N="253" /> in and concerned with sheep and wool and the least they should have is two members directly nominated by them. It is also proposed that two members should be nominated by the wool trade. It is extremely important that their views should be heard and that they should be there to inform producers about what the market held and why it was important to observe certain standards and to go to the trouble of producing wool in a certain way, and also to be able to put the consumers' point of view.</P>
    <P>I also propose that one member should be nominated by the manufacturers. This is also important.  From the sales end, I thought it was extremely important that one member be nominated by An Córas Tráchtála because a considerable amount of sales and promotional work will be called for.  We could not look to any better group than Córas Tráchtála to supply a member for this particular purpose.  I also suggest that one member be nominated by the IAOS.</P>
    <P>It is a little unfortunate that nowhere in the Minister's Second Reading speech did he mention the co-operative societies or co-operation in this whole scheme of trying to find a more efficient and effective way of handling, grading and marketing wool.  The co-operative societies have an important part to play in this scheme and should be entitled to at least one member.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that one member should be nominated by An Foras Talúntais.  A considerable amount of research has been undertaken by An Foras Talúntais into the production of high-class wool and they have quite a contribution to make, on the production end particularly.  It would be wrong to exclude them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest one member to be nominated by the National Farmers Association.  This is the only organisation not concerned solely with sheep or wool which I have included but it is a national organisation, the largest national farmers organisation we have, and naturally sheep and wool are of concern to them.  It would help this Bill very considerably, and help the legislation and the aims and objectives behind the legislation, if before it was <Col N="254" /> enacted, it was known that this sort of membership made up the body that was now going to take a new look at the whole business of producing, presenting and manufacturing wool.  A new confidence would be generated as a result of the very names of these organisations.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I put forward this amendment.  I trust the Minister will see his way to accepting it.  I have deliberately used &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;selected&rdquo; by the Minister in order to avoid any suspicion of political motivation.  This is the way it should be done.  This is the way in which we will get this body working in such fashion that they will take a real interest and know all the reasons why, particularly the producers, they should be doing various things.  A great deal of the inferior production, handling and grading is due in large measure to the fact that people are not convinced it will pay them to go to trouble.  In many cases they do not know the reasons why it is important to go to trouble.  The only way to educate them is to have them really doing the job themselves, with, of course, all the guidance and assistance necessary.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  By giving representation to the various bodies mentioned by Deputy Clinton, one will have a truly representative Comhairle and a Comhairle effective in successfully carrying out its functions.  Córas Tráchtála is entitled to representation; similarly, the IAOS is entitled to representation. As Deputy Clinton pointed out, the co-operative movement has an important role to play in wool marketing, as well as the other aspects of agriculture, and co-operation lends itself very satisfactorily to this type of operation. If my memory serves me correctly, there are one or two successful examples of local co-operative societies engaging in the buying and marketing of wool.  I would be very much in favour of granting representation to the IAOS and Córas Tráchtála for these reasons.  The wool will have to be exported.  A market will have to be found for it.  Finding markets is the <Col N="255" /> precise function of Córas Tráchtála.  As far as Foras Talúntais is concerned, as Deputy Clinton pointed out, our Agricultural Research Institute is engaged in a great deal of research not alone in relation to sheep production but also in relation to the technical aspects of wool production.  A board drawn from the various bodies mentioned here would assure success. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing, in my opinion, to be gained by tying down membership to a fixed figure. Any variation in membership will have to be done through the medium of an order, which will come before the House.  The House can then discuss the order and, if there is anything improper, there will be an opportunity of changing it.  We are about to embark on something new and there is a danger that we might create unnecessary difficulties for ourselves by tying down.  We might be working against the best interests of the Comhairle.  The Deputy mentions a few bodies &mdash; CTT, the NFA, the IAOS, the pedigree sheep societies.  The latter could be quite difficult because the choice might be too wide.  A good many groupings would be involved, groupings in which there is no real federation of the various elements involved.  This could pose the problem as to which element should legitimately represent some particular aspect of sheep production. There should be representation but designating them specifically could lead to difficulty.  The non-national element from an organisational point of view might cause a great deal of trouble.</P>
      <P>There are, too, omissions.  I am sure they are not intentional on the part of Deputy Clinton, but his inclusions rather highlight his omissions. The ICSMA are not mentioned despite the fact that they were represented on the Wool Improvements Committee, from which this document emanated. We have the NAC.  It does not seem to merit consideration for membership either.  There may be other bodies but these two come to mind immediately.</P>

    <P>Again, the question must be posed as <Col N="256" /> to whether those nominated by particular organisations may not tend to have their allegiance to the organisation rather than to the board.  If their allegiance is to the organisation nominating them, then the board would find itself in second place.  Where does the allegiance lie?  This is one that I do not think we can readily get away from.  It is fairly clear at this stage from operations of existing boards that this is a big question and one to which there is no easy answer and which would make me hesitate, regardless of any other consideration, to go with Deputy Clinton, even though he has given a well-reasoned argument for his view.  Certainly, this overall question would make me hesitate to agree with him on the composition of this board or comhairle and, indeed, would make me question now and in the future the idea of nomination to such boards in so far as operations under my Department are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to be able to say that we can accept all of these amendments and any consequential amendments that may follow, but, as I say, the tying down to a specific number would be wrong.  It would create difficulties that we cannot foresee at the moment.  To tie it inflexibly to a fixed number is in itself wrong.  As to the question of designating organisations who will of right nominate persons to represent them, this unfortunately appears to have been the practice in other boards up to now rather than to have somebody selected by an organisation to act in the best interests of the producers concerned, in this case, the sheep producers, on the board and in the interests of the board.  This is the big question that I query here and after which I have the biggest question mark in regard to amendment No. 26.  To nominate people and to give them this right merely to copperfasten is the idea that Deputy Clinton has.  He suggests that by so doing we would ensure their co-operation.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is the benefit of the sheep producers of this country.  Any and all of the bodies that have been mentioned both by Deputy Clinton and myself have the <Col N="257" /> interests of these producers at heart, some of them to a greater degree than others, no doubt, but if this board or Comhairle is in the interests of these sheep producers, then the interest is common with all of these other organisations and we do not necessarily have to have them as organisations represented by right of nomination on this Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The biggest reason I have against it is, as I say, in regard to the question, where does their allegiance ultimately lie?  Is it in the functioning of the board in the best interests of the sheep producers or in the interests of the organisation from which they themselves have sprung and by which they have been nominated?  If the representatives are not playing the tune that that organisation likes, even from a purely organisational point of view, then their days on that board are numbered; they will be taken off and replaced by somebody with different views.</P>
    <P>This is something that we have to be quite careful about.  On reflection, Deputy Clinton will probably appreciate that this difficulty is already emerging in other established boards that have been composed in somewhat similar manner to that which he proposes for this Comhairle.  These are the reasons why I feel I cannot accept the amendments in the manner in which Deputy Clinton has brought them before the House and which he has argued for in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's attitude to the amendment. I think I did say initially that there was no magic in the figure 12.  I might explain that I sat down to amend this Bill on Thursday evening when we were supposed to have it on the following Tuesday and it did not come. I agree that I did not, perhaps, give it all the care and thought it merited, but nevertheless, off the cuff, I listed all the organisations that I felt had an important contribution to make to this scheme.  I certainly would not like to see the Minister tied to the figure 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says there is this great difficulty about people being nominated having allegiance to the body that <Col N="258" /> nominated them rather than to the board.  He says that that presents a difficulty for him.  I know it does.  What I see wrong about the Minister's argument is that he has not told us what is the alternative.  As soon as the Minister himself selects the members, and that seems to be the only alternative to nomination, everybody will start howling that they were selected for political reasons and not because of the contribution they can make to the board.  That allegation will be howled here and everywhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to see confidence in this measure.  I agree with the Minister that what is being done here is for the benefit of all concerned.  We want to make that seen more vividly.  We want the people to understand it.  For this reason I should like to see a guarantee of greater producer representation. There is no such guarantee in the Bill. The only thing the Minister ties himself to doing is to give three representatives to the producers and three to the trade.  That gives me the impression that that is the sort of balance the Minister has in mind.  I think that is not a fair balance.  Not only do I think it is not fair but I think it is not good for the legislation.  The people who have by far the most important contribution to make to the success of the scheme are the producers.  First of all, they will produce the wool and if it is possible to improve quality by breeding or any other means, they will be responsible.  When it comes to the shearing of the sheep, the rolling of the fleeces, the presentation of the wool and all the various things that need to be done to get a quality wool on to the market, the producers are all the time involved and are the important people.  They are the people who have to be convinced and who have to realise why it is important to do all these things and that it is to their benefit to do them.</P>
    <P>For that reason, and that reason only, it is wise to name in advance the organisations, to name the various people that the Minister will put on this board.  Otherwise, suspicion will enter in.  We do not want to go over it now but we have seen this before and we have seen it not working before. <Col N="259" /> I greatly fear that it will not work again.  I know the Minister wants it to work and I want it to work.</P>
    <P>There is quite an important job to be done here.  There is no alternative. It may, as the Minister says, work out in such a way that you will get this feature that the nominees will feel that they have more allegiance to the body that nominated them than to the board but, in the long run, certainly, they are both the same thing.  I would say that in the short term perhaps they might have to take steps in the board that might not be very popular with the producers, let us say, but in the long term it would be of benefit.  I can see this sort of thing arising but this can be got over.  I do not think it can be got over better by the Minister simply selecting persons who he is satisfied have a contribution to make. I do not think it is a satisfactory arrangement.  As we have seen, it has not worked out in the past.  If we are going to adopt the same attitude in this legislation, I am afraid it will not work well in this case either.</P>
    <P>I have no particular reason for favouring any particular organisation.  The Minister says that this difficulty is insurmountable inasmuch as there are quite a number of sheep breeders who are not organised and asks how do you get nominations from them.  I should like to remind the Minister that the same difficulty arose in the formulation of the scheme for setting up the board of An Foras Talúntais.  There you had a group of various organisations with the right to nominate one, or perhaps two, breeders.  I think it has worked out well.  It is something along that line I am proposing, that, where you have not the entire group organised, it should be possible to get as near total organisation as possible, and to tell them to get together to nominate somebody. Or where you want to leave it to two or three organisations &mdash; take all the breeding societies, for instance &mdash; tell them to get together and select two. That is quite a possibility.  We have the precedent for it.  It has been done in the case of An Foras Talúntais. That is how its membership was formed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, may I take Deputy Clinton up on the latter part of what he says?  There is nothing to prevent me in circumstances that might seem suitable saying to any of those organisations: &ldquo;Give me a man&rdquo; or &ldquo;Give me two men&rdquo;.  I am not precluded from doing that by the manner in which this Bill is drafted.  But what I am saying is that I do not go with the idea that this must be done by legislative right and that they must get it regardless of how they may see their allegiance in the future.</P>
      <P>For instance, if a matter of some importance came up &mdash; unfortunately, this is emerging elsewhere &mdash; something unpopular from a producer's point of view, you have the producers' organisations with the right to nominate their representatives on this council.  What else could those nominees do except act in the interests of the organisations which put them there, regardless perhaps of the overall best interests of the board whose aim is to help the sheep-breeders in the long-term overall situation? If a responsible decision has to be taken, the nominee of one or other of the producer organisations, who are there by right, will not necessarily give their allegiance to the interests of the board as a whole to achieve the board's long-term purpose but rather will act on the short-term benefits that may accrue from their action or lack of action on the Comhairle to their own organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that must be guarded against rather than catered for. We must get back to the fundamental question.  This has to be said over and over again and I say it in all seriousness: far too many of us in recent times tend towards the idea that you elect the Government, put Ministers in charge of Departments and, having done that, the whole process seems to be to give the workings to somebody else to do for you.  I must say I do not agree with that.  I believe in taking the raps and the credit.  But I insist on getting both, not just leaving the credit to those who can act one way when the wind is at their back but who blame somebody else if the wind changes. This right of nomination can have just that sort of outcome.  In the last <Col N="261" /> analysis, whether this Comhairle succeeds or not it is my responsibility here; but I do not have to remind Deputies it will be held to be my responsibility if it fails.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the composition of the Comhairle is of prime importance to me as a member of the Government doing the job I have to do.  I do not believe in shelving that and passing it on to other people merely for the sake of placating people at a particular time if the long-term end-product is not a better Comhairle.  Quite honestly, I do not think this right of nomination makes for a better Comhairle.  It is not because I want to keep people off the Comhairle I do it.  I do it with my eyes open on the basis that we do not seem any longer to have full regard to the fact that the Government are elected by the people to do a job for the people and that I, as a member of that Government, have this particular job to do and have undertaken to do it with the aid of the members of this House.  I propose to do it and this is the way I believe it will work best.</P>
    <P>Since I as Minister for Agriculture will carry the responsibility for the success or failure of the Comhairle, it is only right that I should have the freedom to have a board of ten, six or 16 if I so wish, that it should not be written in that it should be 12, 11 or 14, that I should be able to choose in any circumstances that might arise, having given it the fullest consideration, the people I regard as capable of doing the best job in the interests of the wool producers.  This, I think, is what we should be doing and it is what I am asking the House to do.  But that is not in any way to say that I may not, after the wisest counsels have prevailed, go to the various organisations and say to them: &ldquo;I want one of your body nominated to me so that I can put him on this Comhairle.&rdquo;  This may well be done.  I would not attempt to say until we have got down to the actual composition of the board, if this measure is enacted by both Houses.</P>
    <P>It is for these overall good and grave reasons I feel I cannot go with Deputy Clinton on this matter and accept these amendments.  However, I would like it to go out, lest the contrary might be <Col N="262" /> understood to be the case, that my reluctance to go with these amendments should not in any way be taken by any of these organisations as any reflection on them or on their ability to provide suitable people from their membership.  But through this Comhairle we will be seeking the co-operation of all of those bodies.  It is in their interest and the interests of their members that we and the Comhairle should get that co-operation.  They should remember all the time that my main task here, just as the other Ministers have theirs, is to try to help agriculture and the farmers of this country. They should try to get rid of the idea I am over here fighting against the farmers.  This is a myth that has been built up.  The sooner it is exposed the better, not alone for me, but for the farmers themselves.  People have been misled into the belief that you have to have somebody to fight against the Minister for Agriculture instead of helping him to fight his corner with the Government and in the Dáil to get the most for the farmers out of what is going.  We find the farmers in some organisations taking it on themselves to fight the Minister as if he were the enemy of the farmers.  I hope this is emerging as the myth I know it to be.  I would like to go on record as saying it is in fact a myth.  Nothing I have said here should add to that belief which has been spread around here recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the over-all responsibility the Minister carries for the development and welfare of the agricultural industry generally, but I part company with him completely when he says he must reserve the right of direction of all this to himself.  We all know we have boards in existence at the moment with the type of autonomy I seek in this amendment.  I think even the Minister could not deny that they are doing good work.  If he does deny it &mdash; and he seems to deny it because of his statements&mdash;it is tantamount to saying that the boards in existence at the moment which have this autonomy are not doing very fine work.  I disagree with that entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why this attitude has grown up that there must be a group to fight the Minister is that the <Col N="263" /> Minister is not trusting the producers down the line and is not prepared to say: &ldquo;There, it is your job.  Go and do it.  I will give you all the facilities to do it.  I will give you all the help and all the co-operation I can.&rdquo;  That is different from the Minister's attitude: &ldquo;I will tell you what to do.  You must do it this way.  It is in your own interest. We should have your co-operation. We demand it.  We are out for your good.&rdquo;  I do not think he will ever get it that way.  I say in all sincerity that that is the wrong approach. You will not get co-operation that way. The Minister should be prepared to repose confidence in bodies of this kind and give them this type of responsibility and authority.  I do not think he will get them to be yes-men, men he can direct from the top.  That type of bureaucratic control will not work in Ireland.  That is my personal view. It applies to this measure, the same as it would apply to any similar measure. You will not get results the way the Minister seeks to get them.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the Minister is sincere in believing that he has a responsibility for the farmers, the producers and everyone connected with agriculture, that they should see he has a responsibility to act in such a way for their benefit, and that they should do exactly what he directs from the top.  I do not think this will get co-operation.  It never will and it is a great pity the Minister cannot see it.  Let him by all means not confine himself to 12.  Let him have authority and let An Chomhairle Olla have authority.  If they see that a particular organisation is working against the best interests of An Chomhairle Olla as a whole, they should have the power to recommend that such people should be dropped.  I think there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that you will not get this sort of allegiance to a particular organisation working against the long-term interest and the overall interest of the scheme as a whole.  If the Minister rejects this idea and takes it all on his own back, it will never work and he will be killing the scheme before it starts.  This would be a great disappointment to me as I see a great need for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that should be put on record is that what we are now proposing to do is something which was open to all the organisations to do for years past. Again, without picking out anyone or reflecting on them, they did not do it. Now that we are proposing to do it, Deputy Clinton's idea is that we should give them statutory rights, although in certain circumstances an organisation might be working in a purely sectional or local interest, or might even be political, rather than in the interest of the over-all wellbeing of the board. That would be the wrong way to start it.</P>
      <P>It is also true to say that some of our existing boards which have enjoyed almost complete autonomy are now seen to be breeding dictatorship which Government Ministers are accused of but never indulge in.  Members of the House on all sides will agree in their own minds, if not openly, that this is in fact so, and that the perpetuation of that sort of dictatorship without real responsibility to the public which we all have in Opposition or in Government is not a development we should encourage to any greater degree than is necessary.</P>
      <P>In regard to the numbers, while I am thinking of something around ten or 11, when Deputy Clinton started to enumerate them himself he found he needed 12, and it may well be that I will be forced up.  In any board or group of this nature, I have the greatest reluctance to expand the numbers if it is possible to do the job with fewer members.  I do not think a growth in the size of any of these bodies adds to their effectiveness.  Rather I take the reverse view.  The smaller you keep a group of this nature, the much better work they are likely to do, and they are likely to do it more expeditiously. While I am thinking of around ten, I may have to settle for 12 or 14.  I would prefer to have seven or six or even five rather than ten, 12 or 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we are not taking something away from anybody.  We are doing a job that could have been done by a collection of organisations or by individual organisations.  It is because it has not been done, and it did not appear likely that it would be done, <Col N="265" /> that I am in this House at the moment proposing to do it this way.  When we get what I am proposing into operation, if we find at any stage on the advice of the Comhairle or from the observations of others in the House or outside it that there is a better way, and if legislation is needed, I will be the first to come to this House to seek to have a change made if it is seen to be in the interest of the sheep producers. I have no hesitation in saying that.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing may not be the ultimate and this type of organisation may not be the best, but at the moment, in my estimation, it is the best, and if we find that we need a change, I will certainly come back to the House and say: &ldquo;Right; we want to make a change.&rdquo;  I can give that undertaking to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has responsibility in this matter, but it is overall responsibility.  He is responsible to supplement the efforts of the people concerned but not to supplant them.  That is what the Minister is setting out to do.  He says you cannot set up a board and give it this type of autonomy without having the sort of undesirable dictatorship which the Minister says exists in certain boards at the moment.  I am not aware of those boards where this undesirable dictatorship exists.  We have boards doing an excellent job.  They need independence. It appears to me that if they offend against the ideas of some people, they are described as dictators simply because they feel it is necessary to do something in order to accomplish the work they were set up to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Minister is going to insist on this.  He will again handpick all these people.  He says it is quite on the cards that he will say to one organisation: &ldquo;Give me a man; give me a representative.&rdquo;  If the Minister selects these people, how can he claim that because he selects them, he will have no trouble, that they will have no allegiance and no mind of their own, and that their only interest will be the board for which he selects them?  You will always have people who will feel they have an allegiance to <Col N="266" /> a certain group and must take a certain stand when matters concerning the organisation as a whole come up for discussion.  If an organisation nominates its own person, at least that person will be putting forward the view of the organisation.  Otherwise, he will be representing no one but himself in the last analysis.  It is important to have a representative board.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should tie his hand to the 12 I mentioned.  I said there was nothing magic about 12. The Minister speaks of flexibility and says the number could be increased to 14.  If the body composed of those various interests can all sit down together and say, for instance, that a certain individual is acting against the better interests of the organisation and recommend to the Minister that he be dropped, surely that obviates any possibility of such board going off the rails and wrecking the organisation?</P>
    <P>The best way to wreck the organisation is to say, at the start, something like this: &ldquo;I am the Minister.  I have the responsibility.  I have to do this job for the farmers.&rdquo;  The Minister has over-all organising responsibility but he should help the people to help themselves rather than direct every move they make.  His attitude should not be: &ldquo;This must be done in this way.&rdquo; With such an attitude, no organisation will be satisfactory and no scheme will be satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not just my idea.  This arises, almost in its entirety, from a report by people chosen for their knowledge and for their valuable experience.  They reported to a degree that brought about this legislation.  It is being rather too detailed or probably naïve for Deputy Clinton to say that this is not good enough, that, as Minister for Agriculture, I have overall responsibility and that I should merely make available the means and allow the others to do the job.  This is a very important tail-end of the job &mdash; to try to do a better job.  We do not propose to tell people how many sheep they could keep and how and where they should keep them.  We are not directing or commanding the people.  We are merely filling a gap that has been known to the producers for many long <Col N="267" /> years.  We are trying to help to fill that gap to help those producers to get a better return from their sheep and their wool.</P>
      <P>If a Minister selects a person on the basis of advice and because of that person's knowledge, experience and work on a board such as this &mdash; incidentally, these members will not be paid, as distinct from members on some boards &mdash; is it right to say that such person will not have a mind of his own whereas a person would have a mind of his own if he were selected by a popular ballot of the members of an organisation of varied interests &mdash; not necessarily sheep &mdash; and sent there by right of law to act for them?  Which of the two types of selection is the more likely to produce a free agent and a person more likely to give of his best knowledge and advice?  Taking the one with the other, the Minister's selection and the manner of that selection will produce a far freer agent than the man who is selected and sent in with the tag of the organisation he represents, and so on.  Undoubtedly, the interplay of the organisation's politics will have a bearing on the actions of such a person from time to time.</P>
      <P>If the Minister makes the selection, the persons do not depend on any organisation for being there.  Such persons are not paid by the Minister or the Government to attend and are selected for their work and knowledge. Naturally, such persons will be free, as they will be told, to exercise that freedom and to utilise the collective knowledge of all of them to the greatest advantage in pursuing and helping the progress of the sheep breeders, feeders and producers of this country.  I say that the people whom any Minister selects in these circumstances are far freer agents than is likely, to be the case if they are nominated, selected and backed by any organisation.</P>
      <P>It is as well to mention that undoubtedly there will be Fianna Fáil people on this Comhairle.  Why should there not be?</P>

It is just as crazy to say that, because a person is a Fine Gael supporter, he should not be a member on a board.</P>
      <P>People who participate in politics, no matter what Party they may support, are more likely to be interested in the national work than people who try to get the best of both worlds by paying a few bob to Fine Gael this week and a few bob to Fianna Fáil next week&mdash;and they will not leave out Labour, either.  I much prefer people who say they support Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil because undoubtedly such people take an interest in the running of their country. No matter what political group they may come from, they are likely to be the most interested and to be willing to give of their time to the greatest degree in the national interest &mdash; and therefore to make the best board members.

      <P>I am not questioning the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> or the <i>bona fides</i> of any particular Minister in relation to this board, but, taking the matter from the point of view that a board is now being established which is intended to operate for some time to come in circumstances which neither the Minister nor any member of this House can know may come into being or into existence, we are establishing machinery here according to the Bill the Minister introduced which not only will give the Minister, and the Minister alone, the power of appointment but will give the Minister power to remove, and power to remove without any explanation, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not question the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister.  I do not doubt for a moment that he wants the kind of board of which he has spoken, that he wants people of independent mind who <Col N="269" /> will be interested in the matter and who will be prepared to talk out.  I think he is right in that.  However, the Minister does not know how long he will be Minister.  He does not know who will be Minister some time in the future when this board is in existence and when these powers are there. Whatever the desires of the Minister may be, there might be a different approach from the point of view of the people appointed, if they find themselves in a position where first, the only person who can appoint is the Minister and secondly, the Minister can remove them from office simply because he decides to do so without explanation or reason for any whim of his own.  So long as the dual powers remain with the Minister, the sole power of appointment and unfettered power of removal, it would, to my mind, be easy for a Minister in the future to have a board which would be completely acquiescent and quiescent and completely subject to whatever views he might wish to have prevail upon them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton's amendment No. 26, as he has explained, is designed not to weaken the board in any way but to provide that interested bodies, parties or associations will have the right to nominate to the board.  The appointment will still be the appointment of the Minister but if the Minister wants to get a board which, in addition to being an active and interested board, interested in the problems with which it is to deal, is also to be representative of the sections of the community concerned with these problems, then it seems that the way to get that kind of board is the way Deputy Clinton has suggested in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that if he handpicks individuals, they are only interested in expressing a personal view and that they are not speaking for any large group?  They are just individuals, perhaps levelheaded ones and perhaps people who have a good deal of personal knowledge, but it is important to satisfy the largest possible number in this kind of thing, if we are to get their co-operation. You will not get their interest <Col N="270" /> by simply telling them what is to be done.  They or their organisation must feel that they are doing it themselves and you must give them all the assistance and co-operation that is necessary to get the whole scheme working like this.</P>
      <P>The Minister's idea is that there should be a balance of half and half. This is indicated in his section 12 &mdash; not less than three of the trade and not less than three producers.  I should like to hear what he has to say about this.  Does he think this is fair to the producers?  If he sets up a board on the lines indicated in amendment No. 26, he is bound to get a balanced board.  It is not so varied in its composition that you can get any one organisation that can have the effect he anticipates, that they can upset the long-term interest of the board which is really to get a better price for wool. both for individuals and for the country, and perhaps, in addition, to get more of the wool produced here manufactured here.  To get a better price is the main aim, and I do not think that the aims of such a body can be upset if you have a board on the lines I indicated with, perhaps, a couple of more in addition, as the Minister said. I do not think you can get any such thing as one group or organisation upsetting it in the way the Minister anticipates.</P>
      <P>The Minister should know that even though he carefully handpicks these people, he will have trouble with some of them.  A certain amount of trouble is inevitable.  I believe that in spite of what the Minister has said, we have boards organised on these lines in the country at present.  Everything they do may not please the Minister.  No board working as it should work will please everybody, but, on the whole, tribute should be paid to them.  They are doing an excellent job.  It is wrong to say that a dictatorship is being set up in these boards simply because they are composed along the general lines we are advocating in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am disappointed because this is a continuation of an attitude that I do not believe will ever succeed with our producers, an attitude of imposing policy from the top.  You must <Col N="271" /> not demand allegiance or that these people shall serve but you can ask them to help themselves.  That is one of the reasons why, as the Minister complains, nothing was done through the years where there was a job to be done.  All these people mentioned now did not come in and do it.  They did not get together.  It is a reflection on the leadership that existed here through the years that it has taken so long for the person with the responsibility, the Minister for Agriculture, to induce them to come together, to give them all the facilities to come together and do this important job for themselves.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matter very fully, I believe this is the best way to set about getting the best board to do the best job.  I can assure the House that I am not blind to the possibility that by selecting men myself, I am going to get yes-men. I do not want them.  They are of no use to me if they are yes-men.  I hope that these people will be brought together in order to deal with the problems which we foresee they will meet and problems that will have to be overcome, and ten or 12 yes-men agreeing with the Minister for Agriculture or somebody else, obviously is not the answer and would not provide any answers to the problems which they are being appointed to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want it to be clearly understood that it is not yes-men I want.  I want people who, because of their knowledge and experience, are likely to be useful and who are prepared to give time without being paid for it to tackle the job in its various aspects in a particularly detailed way, whether at the production end, the local buying and <Col N="272" /> grading end and the utilisation of wool for home manufacture&mdash;this could be an aspect of it &mdash; and those who have to go out and find markets outside for our wool.  These are the people I must seek and get to operate as free people, with freedom to do what they collectively think is the best thing.</P>
    <P>The idea that if they do not do what I like them to do, I will drop them and put on somebody else is completely out.  If I or any Minister had to drop one or two or three of these people, we would do so for only one reason&mdash; unless we were daft &mdash; and that would be because by their actions or lack of action, attendance or performance, they were not contributing to the over-all good of this particular business.  If they were contributing, a Minister would be daft to drop them because they would be doing their job in the best way possible, and that is the whole purpose of setting up this body and asking the House to give it legislative authority.  To drop people because you do not like them or for some other reason is not &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  If they are doing their job, they stay, and if they are not, they are entitled to be dropped. This is something you could not do if they were nominated people because you would be offending not only the people who might be dropped but the whole organisation.  It could be taken as a personal affront by every member of the organisation that their man was dropped, and, of course, it would not be because he was no good&mdash;that would never be admitted.  It would be because his politics were wrong; the Minister does not like them, and so he knocks this fellow and disrupts the whole organisation.</P>

I do not want to start the old battle all over again, but I did ask the Minister to comment on the sort of balance that was indicated in the set-up he suggests here and to express a view on it.  He has not done that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This three-three balance, three to the trade and three to the producer.  If this is not the sort of balance that appeals to the Minister, why does he safeguard his position by stipulating not less than three of the trade and not less than three of the producers?  Is it because a certain section of the group that produced this wool report made this sort of suggestion about which there was not general agreement that the Minister is adhering to it?  I think the Minister will agree that the representation in the group that produced the report was pretty well lopsided in favour of the trade.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about the balance or what really are his ideas in relation to the composition of this board.  It is a mistake to keep it a secret prior to bringing in the legislation.  That is the best way not to get co-operation and not to get confidence in the measure.  The Minister should declare himself now and say what he is going to do.  I am sure he has his own mind made up as to where he is going to get the people who will form this board, because this is a piece of legislation which has been contemplated for some time and, indeed, is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I seem to have avoided that; it certainly was not intentional.  The Bill says not less than three of each.  It does not mean that it will be three of each. It could be five of one and three of the other, but there will not be fewer than three of either.  As regards having my mind made up, quite candidly, I have not my mind made up about the detailed representation or the groupings that may be assigned to this body. This will come, if and when we get this measure through the Dáil and the Seanad.  Possibly as time goes on, as we sit here, we will be thinking more and more of it, but until we get a little further, there would be little point in being specific or in attempting to be specific, because we are only starting the Committee Stage and there is a fairly long way to go, judging by the number of amendments I see here.</P>

      <P>If I gave the Deputy all the amendments he has here, then he should be here and I should be over there.  However, there is the problem that the people did not agree to that, so I am in a fix in that regard.  I do not like going against the voice of the electorate in matters as grave as this. I have not my mind made up.  I have not a pre-selected team, if that is what the Deputy is wondering.  In the Bill it is three-three.  That is put in to give an assurance to the House that there will not be fewer than three traders and three producers.  However, this does not imply that the balance will be three-three, four-three or five-five. The assurance that there will not be fewer than three is put in the Bill for the very reason the Deputy has been mentioning, that we require the co-operation of both sides.  Much good it would be to get it from the producers if we did not get it from the traders on whom we must rely to continue to expand and to give us the best of their knowledge in order to benefit broad trading interests as well as sectional interests.  Likewise, we must show that the producers are entitled to minimum representation; they may get <Col N="275" /> more.  The final composition of this Comhairle remains to be seen.  Only time will show whether it is to be three-three, four-three or four-four: I cannot say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not envisage the desirability or the possibility of having a great degree of cooperative selling of wool in the future? In that case you would have the situation where the producers and the sellers would be one and the same interest. Whereas the Minister says it is no use having the co-operation of the producers if you have not got the co-operation of the trade on whom we are dependent to sell this wool, I think the traders are very much dependent on the producers.  They would have no trade, were it not for the fact that this wool was produced and produced in such a way that the traders could sell it.  There is far greater importance attached to the producer than to the trader, and it is disappointing that the Minister seems to persist in this attitude that we must have this. He does not say exactly that, but he says it is very important that this sort of balance should be in existence.  I do not intend to stand up again, because there is only the one thing to do.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not recognise that the producers are the most important people and that they represent the larger number in this whole business.  If we had not got them, we would not have a wool trade.  It is the producers who get the worst end of everything.  That is why they should have more representation than the people in the trade.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if the people were nominated by the various societies not only would it offend the individual but the society, if one were dropped.  Surely it is in the interest of the society and the producer that they pick the best men?  If they do not, then the society are not acting in the interest of the people they are supposed to represent.  If you get to that situation, you might as well give up.  Deputy Geoghegan from Connemara may like to sit behind the Minister and interrupt, but he should remember that there are far more producers in Connemara than wool buyers. I am all in favour of giving people in the trade a fair deal but let us be fair to the producers.</P>

How many there will be along with the three is something about which I have no preconceived idea.  We want to keep it in this way for the moment.  In order to disabuse anyone who has the feeling that we are writing down the producers, I should point out that we would not be here except for the producers.

      <P>I understood the Minister to argue earlier, and to a great extent I agreed with him on this, that generally speaking, the smaller the committee the better.  He is inclined to cavil at the suggestion contained in Deputy Clinton's amendment that the number might be 12 rather than 11, an increase of one.  As I recall it, he argued that the smaller your committee the better and if you could have five, six or seven rather than ten, 11 or 12, all to the good.  Am I misrepresenting the Minister's mind on this?  If I am not, the position seems to me to be that the Minister, having a preference for a small committee is tied under the Bill as proposed to a committee of seven, a chairman and six ordinary members, at least three of whom will represent or be drawn from the trade and three from the producers.  If the Minister's inclination is against a bigger committee, does it not seem reasonable for the House to assume that the logical outcome is that if you are to have a committee of seven, a chairman, and six others, the others are going to be divided equally as per the Schedule here, as between the trade and the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument advanced here, which would be catered for in the amendment, <Col N="278" /> is that greater representation should be given to the producers. Without prejudice to that, and I think it is a sensible amendment, I appreciate the Minister's point of view with regard to the size of committees.  I have heard it said, and the Minister might be attracted to this point of view, that the ideal committee is a committee of two, with one absentee.</P>

    <P>(f)  to consider methods of securing the maximum use of home produced wool by manufacturers in the State; and</P>
    <P>(g)  to carry out the functions in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 13 in which the functions of An Chomhairle are set out and must, therefore, be considered in conjunction with it. Section 13 provides:</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle shall have the following functions, namely:</P>
    <P>(a)  to advise the Minister in relation to the fixing of grades, price increases relating to quality and price reductions relating to defects, to be used, paid or deducted in respect of the purchase of wool from producers;</P>
    <P>(b)  to advise the Minister in relation to the fixing of standards to be applied in relation to the registration of registered buyers;</P>
    <P>What we seek to do is to put An Chomhairle in the position of not just advising the Minister about all these things but actually going out and doing these things.  We seek to give them the responsibility of deciding not only what the standards and the practices should be but actually carrying these into effect with all the necessary power and responsibility.  It is a great mistake to have all this roundabout unnecessary traffic.  If we set up a body like An <Col N="282" /> Chomhairle, without giving that body power and responsibility, how can we hope that the body will function?  If they have to put up their hands and say: &ldquo;Please, teacher&rdquo; before they do anything, that will not be a good thing.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why An Chomhairle should not have the responsibility of fixing grades, deciding price increases relating to quality and price reductions relating to defects? Surely they must be in a position, if they have any function at all, to make this sort of simple decision?  If they are responsible for the scheme, they are the people who will know because it is from them the Minister will get advice; if they do not know their job, they should not be part of the membership of An Chomhairle.  If they are the people who know their job, why not then and there give them the authority to do these things?  Why should they have to come back to the Minister and ask if they may do them?  I cannot understand the mentality behind this.</P>
    <P>Again, they are to advise the Minister in relation to the fixing of standards to be applied in relation to the registration of registered buyers.  Does the attitude of the Minister imply that he is not prepared to accept their advice?  Why are they in existence? If the Minister is prepared to accept their advice, why not let them carry that advice into effect without asking the Minister if they may do it?</P>
    <P>The next function is:</P>
    <P>(c)  after consultation with the Minister, to fix a code of practice to be observed by wool exporters;</P>
    <P>This is a pretty intricate field and we do not want to give them sole responsibility in this.  We will let the Minister come in because this is a matter that could require consultation with the Minister.  It is international and here the Minister's advice would be extremely important.  They can still consult with the Minister, but give them the power to do things.  Subsections (a) and (b) are the particular places in which I think it is all wrong for the Minister just to expect these to be a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; body, to provide him with all the advice but to do nothing themselves unless he comes down and directs them to do something.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Amendment No. 5 deals with section 4 which provides for the prohibition of unlicensed business of exporting wool.  Surely this body, if it is sufficiently qualified to advise the Minister on everything that has to be done for the improvement and development of the wool trade, are the best people to decide as to whether certain people should or should not be allowed to export wool.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the application for and conditions of registration.  Subsection (1) sets out:</P>
    <P>(1)  On the application, in such form and containing such particulars as the Minister may direct, by or on behalf of a person who proposes to carry on the business of a buyer of wool the Minister may, at his discretion, register the person in the register as a registered buyer.</P>
    <P>Surely, the only people in a position to have discretion about this matter are the people dealing with the trade from production to exportation and that is An Chomhairle Olla?  It is totally wrong to take the discretion away from the body that is qualified to advise the Minister in the exercise of his discretion? That is the most foolish procedure imaginable.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the grant of licences for carrying on the business of exporting wool.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the cancellation, revocation, suspension and restoration of registrations or licences.  The Minister has no direct dealings with the people in the wool business, either in production or marketing.  The organisation that has direct contact, that knows what is happening and on whom the Minister depends for advice should be free to decide whether or not there should be cancellation, revocation, suspension and restoration of registrations or licences.  If this is done by the political head of a Department, everybody will be in a position to say that the Minister did not like the colour of a man's eyes and withdrew his registration; that, politically, a man is not right and, therefore, should not be registered as a buyer, that it would be a good thing to get him out of the way <Col N="284" /> and get in another man because many clients will be coming and going that he will be able to influence in one way or another.  I am anxious to get out of the Bill this question of leaving the legislation open to this type of suspicion. As long as it is open to this type of suspicion, I do not think there will be co-operation or that you will get a responsible body of men to join this organisation if they are merely to be a group that will do only what the Minister says should be done and if all the power and responsibility is reposed in the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the keeping of a register.  Surely it is not the Minister who will keep the register?  The obvious body to keep a register is the body that is in touch with the people, that knows the people, that knows with whom it is dealing.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position to argue in favour of the retention of all these powers and responsibilities by the Minister considering that the Minister is dependent on this body at every stage to advise him.  If he does not accept their advice, he has no confidence in them and that should not be so.  If he accepts their advice, why not allow them to go ahead and do what they advise?  That would be the sensible thing to do if we want a business organisation.  Otherwise, we will have all the cumbersome procedure and the ties and restrictions attached wherever there is a tie-up with the Civil Service.  Business people can do their business directly.  That is the big advantage.  They do not have to go around in circles.  They can make their decisions on the spot.  If they have to ask the Minister's permission, he may give it directly but, if he is busy, he may not do so.  If there is a by-election in progress, he may not give it for a month.  This is the kind of procedure we want to get out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will show good sense in this matter. I know he is interested in this legislation. He made a very good speech here on its importance.  We are trying to improve the Bill.  If it is suggested by persons on the Government benches that we have nothing to contribute and <Col N="285" /> that any proposal we make will not be accepted, that shows a great weakness in the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of amendment No. 4 lies in relation to the principle in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  The set-up under the Bill as introduced by the Minister &mdash; and in saying this I am not doubting the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister or of the Department &mdash; and the entire structure of the Bill is to concentrate into the hands of the political head of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries the power to say whether or not a person will be allowed to earn his livelihood as an exporter of wool or as a buyer of wool. No matter how well administered legislation of this sort may be, I do not think it will be accepted by the people generally, any more than the same type of proposition was accepted by the people in relation to the Marts Bill that there should be concentrated in the hands of the political head of a Department power to grant or refuse permissions, licences, applications to register and so on, the granting or refusal of which may in fact be vital to the livelihood of those concerned.</P>
      <P>We have in section 3 of the Bill the provision that:</P>
      <P>If, after the day mentioned in section 5 (4), any person,</P>
      <P>(a)  carries on the business of a buyer of wool and is not registered in the register, or</P>
      <P>(b)  uses as his place of such business any premises other than those in relation to which the person is registered in the register,</P>
      <P>the person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in respect of the business of a buyer of wool, the position is to be, if this legislation is passed unaltered, that an offence will be committed unless that person is registered.</P>
      <P>Then we go down to section 5 to see the establishment of the register and section 6 contains the provisions regarding the application of the conditions of registration.  Subsection (1) of section 6 provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the application, in such form <Col N="286" /> and containing such particulars as the Minister may direct, by or on behalf of a person who proposes to carry on the business of a buyer of wool the Minister may, at his discretion, register the person in the register as a registered buyer.</P>
    <P>Here we have this concentration of power, which is contained in subsection (1) of section 6, in the hands of the Minister, that the Minister and the Minister alone may at his discretion decide whether or not a person who applies for registration as a buyer of wool in the register established under section 5 may be registered.  It is already provided in section 3 that if a person carries on the business of a buyer of wool without registration, the registration depending on the discretion of the Minister, he will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The first major point that this amendment of Deputy Clinton deals with &mdash; I am talking now about paragraph (g) &mdash; is in relation to this question of the buying of wool and the concentration of that power in the hands of the Minister.  Deputy Clinton is not suggesting in his amendment that this should be a free for all.  He is not suggesting it is not right to regulate this matter and to regulate it in the manner suggested in the Bill by the establishment of a register and by laying down minimum requirements which must be met before a person can become registered.  What he is suggesting is that instead of the power being concentrated in the hands of the Minister, it should be dispersed and vested in the board which is also being established under this Bill.  Therefore, under the amendment the responsibility is being removed from the Minister and being vested in the board which is directly concerned with this whole wool and wool marketing business.  I think that is a reasonable suggestion.</P>
    <P>The next matter which to me seems to be of fundamental importance relates to the question of the exporting of wool, the business of the exporter of wool.  Here we have the same general structure in the Bill.  Whether or not a person is to get a licence under the Bill to carry on the business of exporter of wool again is to be <Col N="287" /> dependent entirely on the Minister. Again, the suggestion contained in the amendment is that instead of leaving that responsibility on the Minister, instead of concentrating that particular power in the hands of the Minister, it again should be dispersed and should be vested in this board which should be and, I am sure, would be, concerned to deal with the wool business in the best interests of the producer and the trade.</P>
    <P>Apart from those particular points, the earlier paragraphs of the amendment from (a) to (f) again by and large simply represent a transfer from the Minister to the board of functions which the Minister himself has proposed in the Bill should be the function of the board.  Anyway, with the exception in some of them that Deputy Clinton has explained &mdash; that instead of enabling the board to act purely in an advisory capacity, Deputy Clinton suggests that they should have authority and discretion to implement their own decisions and not merely to advise the Minister &mdash; with the exception of endeavouring to give this type of authority to the board, there is no objection, there is no collision, so to speak, between Deputy Clinton and the Minister with regard to the functions proposed to be performed by the board.  In section 13 the Minister takes the view that the board should be merely advisory, that it should merely have the right to advise the Minister in regard to (a) the fixing of grades and price increases and (b) the fixing of standards.  Deputy Clinton suggests in relation to those two matters that instead of merely giving advice, the board should have direct authority to fix grades and to fix standards.</P>
    <P>To my mind &mdash; and I think the Minister may find that this is also reflected in the minds of others &mdash; the vital importance of this amendment and the vital distinction between the Minister's position, on the one hand, and Deputy Clinton's position, on the other lies in the application of this amendment to sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 and, by reason of the application of the amendment to sections 5 and 6, it brings its application <Col N="288" /> also to bear on section 3 of the Bill, which is the section which provides that after a particular date, unless a person is a registered wool buyer, he cannot act as a wool buyer without committing an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assures us that the members selected for this board would be men who knew their job, men who were to a great extent dedicated and who would have the interests of both the producers and the trade at heart.  If so, why does he not let them make decisions?  I see one grave danger in what the Minister is suggesting.  We could arrive at the situation in this whole wool business which we have in regard to planning permission, where the final say about everything would be with the Minister, with, whether true or false, charges of corruption and bribery over every decision taken.  The Minister assures us he will have a board of dedicated men, men of integrity, men who know the wool trade backwards.  It seems to me to be quite senseless for him to take the decision upon himself.  These men know the wool trade.  Every Minister for Agriculture will not know the wool trade.  Indeed, some of them do not know a sheep from a donkey, but that is neither here nor there.  The Minister should leave these decisions to the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister assures us that it cannot be said that the members of the board are picked for their political affiliations, but it will be said.  If every decision is left to the Minister and someone is refused registration, it will be said he was the wrong political colour, or did not subscribe to Taca. This will be said, and that is the danger.  These things will go to the Minister and will rest on the Minister's desk until he has time to clear them. This is cumbersome and slow.  The farmers are treated badly enough, without leaving these things sitting in the Department of Agriculture until the Minister gets around to them.  I cannot see the point in the Minister's insistence that he should have all the power vested in him.  Deputy Clinton's amendment is reasonable and should be considered.</P>

      <P>May I say at the outset that I think Deputy Clinton is trying to pull the wool over my eyes?  In effect, to accept Deputy Clinton's amendment would be to set up An Chomhairle Olla as the registration and licensing authority instead of the Minister. An Chomhairle will be acting in an advisory capacity.  The Wool Commission and the Improvements Committee saw merit in the fact that the Department should supervise the grading of wool and that the staff should be supervised by the Department, and the Bill met them by being so drafted.</P>
      <P>Kites were flown here.  Deputy Clinton by subtle innuendo moved around the Marts Bill but never mentioned it.  We all remember the terrible tragedies and horrors and nightmares which were mentioned here about 12 months ago in the discussion on the Marts Bill.  It was said that it would work to the detriment of all and sundry in the livestock trade.  We have seen it in operation and in no case has there been a suggestion of a license being refused for political reasons.  In fact, it has worked in reverse.  It has worked to rationalise the marts industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister's intention in this Bill is to rationalise the wool industry and improve the lot of the producer, the trader and the purchaser.  We must have one standard of wool.  It must be the best, and by working in some slipshod fashion, we certainly will not have that.  I see no merit in allowing this responsibility to move from the Minister.  In other industries, such as the dairy industry and the bacon curing industry, he has exactly the same powers as are sought here.  Going back to the earliest days of the State, Ministers for Agriculture have found it incumbent on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he might find the advantages to be gained by An Chomhairle, as proposed to be constituted by the Minister, at variance with his own personal wishes for the betterment of the entire farming community. I do not think that if the Minister retains powers which have been customarily retained by the Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers, it will make one whit of difference to the successful operation of An Chomhairle Olla.</P>
      <P>Grading standards will have to be fixed.  The Minister will take the advice of An Chomhairle.  They will be acting in an advisory capacity.  As regards registration, I have no fears on that point.  Any Government would be ill-advised to set out deliberately to put people out of business.  As in the Marts Bill, there will be a time factor. People who are already engaged in the business of wool buying will be allowed to continue, and if their premises are unsuitable at the moment, they will be given ample time to make them suitable and acceptable for the purposes of registration.</P>
      <P>We cannot accept Deputy Clinton's amendment on general grounds.  This amendment could bring about a position in which the Minister could be prevented from carrying out his responsibility for the welfare of the agricultural community.  If he allowed statutory powers to go out of his control, he might find himself at variance with people who were not working in the best national interests.  Surely everyone must appreciate that this is in the national interest of the wool industry, and not a sectional interest on behalf of anyone?  It could happen in the years ahead that someone serving on An Chomhairle Olla might for one of a number of reasons be inclined to put forward his own personal interests.  It is the function of any Minister, and particularly the Minister for Agriculture, to protect the agricultural community.  By retaining these powers, he is reserving to himself the equipment and armament to do so.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can get in on this again. What I am saying is that the Minister has insisted on retaining the right and power to select this board.  He selects them because of the confidence he feels in them.  Having selected them, he has no confidence in them any longer.  That is the end of the confidence because he is not prepared to give them any responsibility or power.  I think it is deplorable to make the type of suggestion we heard the Parliamentary Secretary make about people handpicked by the Minister.</P>
      <P>One of these amendments relates to section 6.  We read:</P>
      <P>the Minister shall be satisfied that the premises together with any plant or machinery therein to be used by the person for the weighing, grading or storage of wool are suitable for each of those purposes having regard to the maximum quantity of wool likely to be handled in the premises at any time.</P>
      <P>Surely the only people who will have the responsibility of looking at these premises and advising the Minister in regard to them, and the machinery there, are the members of the board. What is the position if they have not sufficient experience to know whether or not it is good enough to qualify?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is making a bottomless argument.  Consider the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>the said premises, plant and machinery comply with the requirements of any regulations made under this Act and applicable thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has no intimate touch with these things.  He cannot accept the advice of this board unless he has confidence in it.  If he has confidence in it, <Col N="292" /> he should repose in it a certain amount of responsibility and authority.  It is bound to be a board of yes-men.  I believe that, from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, it is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that there will be divided responsibility for the wool trade in this country from now on; that the Department will be responsible for the employment and supervision of the staff, that the board will have other responsibilities and that the Minister himself will have other responsibilities. What is everybody's job is nobody's job.  We shall find ourselves back in square one.</P>
    <P>I had hoped this would be a good measure which would assist our wool trade.  I fear it will be a fiasco because of this divided authority and divided responsibility.  If anything goes wrong, one will blame the other but it cannot be pinned on any particular group. The Minister insists on handpicking them.  Having said he wants to be responsible for the people he handpicks, why does he not throw it open to them and say: &ldquo;Do the job; you know better than I do in this matter&rdquo;?  I should be big enough to say it in this particular instance.  The Minister should say to them: &ldquo;Go ahead.  You know the improvements which are needed. I shall give you all facilities to make investigations into any matter you are doubtful about.  Set up the organisation and carry it through and do not come back to me asking ` Can we have your advice on this point?' &rdquo;  Can the Parliamentary Secretary not see for himself that no case whatever can be made for setting-up a board and giving them neither power nor responsibility and whose only function would be to advise the Minister in a limited sort of way and hope he will accept it even though he has no confidence in them from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has missed my point in relation to the argument on the last portion of Deputy Clinton's amendment when he cites, as an example, the Marts Act and says the fears expressed were groundless, that it is operating very well, and so on.  When I argued <Col N="293" /> against the concentration of power such as this in the hands of the political head of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, my argument and my objection are not of personal application either to the present Minister or to any particular Minister. It is one of general application on the broad principle of the undesirability of concentrating such powers in the political head of a Government Department.</P>
      <P>Politics being what they are, people throughout the country having different political views, people being divided into supporters of different political Parties, I do not believe you can get the confidence that is needed to operate successfully, in the long term, measures such as this if you concentrate powers of that description in the hands of a Minister who is the political head of a Department.  It is quite irrelevant to my argument to say that such and such an Act contains similar powers and that it has worked.  That may be because of the particular Minister who is in office.  It may be because it is accepted by the people in the particular trade.  However, that need not necessarily be so all the time.</P>
      <P>So long as the powers are there in a Bill, they can be used by a Minister in years to come in the way that that particular Minister interprets them and desires to use them.  My objection is one of general principle to concentrating powers of this sort in that particular manner.  It does not matter who the Minister is or who his successor will be.  Last year, it was the Marts Bill: now it is the wool trade.  The argument is on general lines.  On these grounds, I do not think it is good to legislate in that way.  I object to the provisions of this Bill for these reasons, as I objected to the provisions in the Marts Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned that people who had been selected to work on that sort of committee may later be dropped.  That does not mean that the Minister himself might favour it.  It is somewhat like the selecting of players for a football team and their subsequent performance on the field.  The comhairle will be established <Col N="294" /> for the betterment of the wool industry.  In a football team, the selectors pick the players they consider best.  If, in the course of the game, they find that some players are lethargic or have not the capacity then undoubtedly they would change some of the personnel of that team.  The same could happen to any board as at present constituted. There is no question of snubbing people, and so on.  People will be selected from the point of view of their knowledge and their capacity in relation to the wool trade, be they producers or buyers.</P>
      <P>I see nothing peculiar in following the recommendations of the committee for improvements in the wool trade as regards standards, grading, and so on. As the registering authority, the Minister would perform that function and, in these respects, the Comhairle would act in an advisory capacity.  I see nothing peculiar in his accepting their advice.  I see no conflict of approach there.  I do not accept that there could be any conflict of approach.</P>
      <P>If the buying and export of wool is to be controlled by legislation, as the Bill proposes, it seems clear that the execution of the control should rest with the Minister, as it does in the case of other Acts affecting agriculture.  In regard to what was said earlier that he did not have confidence in An Chomhairle Olla &mdash; this suggestion was implied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Minister would be perfectly entitled to take and heed their advice.  I see nothing sinister in the fact that he retains the power of registration, and in fact holds the ultimate power of An Chomhairle Olla for himself, since he is the person selected or nominated by the Government to act and work in the best interests of every sphere of agriculture, one of which happens to be the wool trade.  I see nothing sinister in the fact that he should guard jealously the <Col N="295" /> rights and responsibilities placed fairly and squarely on his shoulders.  If he were to hive off some of these responsibilities to any other section or to any board, it would be a retrograde step.  How often do we hear criticism of the fact that Ministers have no function in the work of semi-State bodies?  We are often told that we should have retained control of the semi-State bodies so that we could more readily account for them to this House.  Every elected Member should guard the rights of this House which are sacrosanct and which need to be guarded as to who is to render an account to the public at large and particularly to the farmers in regard to their particular end of the business activities.  I see no merit, nor can I concede that there is any merit, in accepting these amendments by Deputy Clinton.</P>

      <P>No.  That was precisely the point Deputy Clinton made when moving the amendment. It was agreed that we discuss them together and take separate decisions. In fact, it would be possible, as will be appreciated now, to discuss amendment No. 5 to section 4 regardless of the decision on amendment No. 4. We could still ask that An Chomhairle should be referred to in section 5 rather than the Minister.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, here representing the Minister, how &ldquo;As soon as may be after the passing of this Act,&rdquo; the Minister shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, set up and maintain a register to be known as the Register of Buyers of Wool.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us soon what An Chomhairle Olla is going to do and what it cannot do, because its functions are so diminished and so small that it does not deserve to be in existence at all. Surely the normal functions for this responsible body, as we hope it will be, should be to keep a register of wool buyers and to set up such a register themselves, and they naturally would have to deal with application for registration? Perhaps the Department deals with applications for registration, but the Department cannot register people or refuse to register them until they are advised by this body.  This is part of the divided responsibility that just will not work or will work only in the clumsiest possible fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes on to indicate the various things that shall be entered in this register and the following particulars are specified: the full name, address and description of the person registered as a registered buyer; a description of the premises.  How can the Minister give a description of the premises?  I assume that it is An Chomhairle Olla that will inspect the premises, and if they are going to advise <Col N="298" /> the Minister, he will be working on secondhand advice.  They are the only people who would be directly involved and who would be in a position to decide who should or should not be on the register.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) says: &ldquo;Such other particulars as the Minister, in the circumstances of any particular case, considers relevant.&rdquo;  This is what I call a particularly dangerous statement to write into legislation.  If the Minister does not like the colour of John Murphy's eyes, that can be a particular case.  He can be singled out and the Minister can insist on a whole lot of extra particulars in his case.  It is wide open to this type of victimisation. It may not happen &mdash; I hope it never will &mdash; but it is open to that.</P>
    <P>I have two main objections to these provisions.  First of all, the only people who should keep the register and decide what should be in it are the people who are going to do all the inspections and all the investigations, not the Minister himself.  He will be acting on information at second hand, and this is the ridiculous aspect of it. Then there are these special circumstances being decided by the political head of a Department.  What is the case for special circumstances?  These are the powers I want to hand over to An Chomhairle Olla, and I am opposing the section because it certainly does not measure up to what I think it should measure up to.</P>

      <P>Registration here is aimed at nothing sinister.  We are not trying to put anyone out of business. Traditional buyers will not be refused the right to be registered, on the understanding that they will, if so required, equip their premises or make them suitable.  This was implied in other legislation passed in this House, that there would be victimisation.  I am surprised at Deputy Clinton constantly harping on this matter of victimisation. They say that suspicion haunts the guilty mind.  I certainly would not accuse Deputy Clinton of being guilty of prejudice, but I think he over-emphasises the idea that any other person or persons would be so guilty. Any Minister or any officer of the Department, or any other Department for that matter, would not deliberately set himself out to deny anyone his right to make a living.  At the same time we must &mdash; and nobody is more aware of this than Deputy Clinton &mdash; protect the standards of Irish wool, which have not been the best in the past.  If we want to gain a foothold in the ever-competitive world wool market, we must have one quality only, the very best we can produce.  This will not be got by any pleasantries passed here or <Col N="300" /> anywhere else.  It will be achieved only by the introduction of a code of standards, and surely it will be the principal function of An Chomhairle to ensure that these standards are set and maintained.  The Minister and the officers of the Department will be acting only in co-operation with An Chomhairle in ensuring that the standards set by An Chomhairle will be maintained.</P>

The Minister might decide that he did not like the colour of John Murphy's eyes and that would be &ldquo;circumstances of a particular case&rdquo;.

      <P>A register has to be set up and the Minister prescribes certain particulars which must be entered into the register, the names and addresses, sufficient particulars to describe the premises and so on, and then we have this omnibus clause, which is obviously intended to cover anything else that might occur and <Col N="302" /> which the Minister might not have listed already but which might be relevant for the purposes of the register. Normally, one would expect that this would read &ldquo;such other particulars as the Minister considers relevant&rdquo;.  If it read like that, it would cover anything the Minister considers relevant. By putting it that way, it is of general application and the same rule will be applied to every entry in relation to the register.  It will be the same for everyone if it is &ldquo;such other particulars as the Minister considers relevant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asks what is the objection to retaining the words &ldquo;in the circumstances of any particular case&rdquo;.  Surely it is up to him to make the case why it is necessary to put in those particular words when the sub-paragraph contains sufficient without them to deal with cases on a universal, general basis?

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

Surely it would be better to have provision made to cover these rather than to be compelled possibly to put people out of business altogether or give them no opportunity of converting what may be unsuitable premises into suitable premises?  The more sinister fears of the Deputy can be allayed by the knowledge that the register will be open for inspection during office hours at the Department so that there cannot be any peculiarities in particular cases.</P>

      <P>I can see that the Minister might make a case, normally speaking, that he would only require on the register a person's name, address and premises, but, if there is an application in with a local authority for planning permission, and it has not been granted, he would want that noted on the register; he would want it noted that the premises are subject to planning permission.  I could understand it if that were the kind of special circumstances the Minister might have in mind; he would <Col N="305" /> want to make sure that the entry on the register was not going to be taken as presupposing that some consent&mdash; for example, Land Commission consent&mdash;was needed or permission from some other Department of State was going to be granted automatically because of the entry on the register. If there were a case of that nature put up here, we could consider it. There might be something in it, but, as it stands, there does not seem to be any necessity at all for these words and all we are doing is settling the particulars to be entered on the register and there does not seem to be any reason why they should not be the same for everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 5, to delete &ldquo;may, at his discretion&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here, again, we see no reason why this discretionary power should be held by the Minister.  This deals with the application for and conditions of registration. The section provides:</P>
      <P>On the application, in such form and containing such particulars as the Minister may direct, by or on behalf of a person who proposes to carry on the business of a buyer of wool the Minister may, at his discretion, register the person in the register as a registered buyer....</P>
      <P>We want &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.  We hold in this case, as in all cases, that the people should know in advance what the conditions are for registration, what they should do, what they should measure up to, and it should be the same for everyone.  All should have to comply with the same conditions and measure up to the same standards&mdash;minimum standards, minimum equipment, minimum accommodation&mdash;below which they must not go.  They may go above.  But everyone should know where he stands.  It is deplorable that the political head of a Department should be in a position to lay it down that something is at his discretion: &ldquo;I do not like that fellow. He really has everything but he votes Fine Gael.  He was very prominent in the last election.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not going half as low as certain people have gone.  It is totally wrong to have this at the discretion of the Minister.  A whole list of conditions is set down under subsection (1) before the Minister registers any person but one is not told the conditions under which a person will not be <Col N="307" /> registered.  That discretion is retained by the Minister.  This is the big stick, the weapon over the applicant's head and, if the Minister does not like him, down the stick will come.  Why should we not know in advance why this discretion is necessary?  The same discretion is written in in relation to the granting of a licence for carrying on the business of exporting wool.  Surely an exporter of wool should know that, if he does not measure up to certain standards, he is not entitled to be registered as an exporter of wool?  If he does something wrong, he should lose his licence.  Nowhere in the Bill is it stated that he will lose his licence.  If wool is exported under specification, the exporter should lose his licence, but there is no provision to that effect.  Yet, the Minister has discretionary powers to continue giving an unreliable exporter a licence to export wool.</P>

      <P>Exactly, and he has no obligation to give any reason and there is no appeal.  The Minister has sole discretion.  Why is that necessary? We have had this before on several occasions.  There is no convincing reason that anybody can advance as to why this should be retained. Therefore, we have the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it and looking at things in the first instance, it would appear that there is tremendous merit in Deputy Clinton's amendment but he does not rule out all the possibilities and this is why discretion must be left to the Minister. If the amendment were accepted, the effect would be to compel the Minister to register anyone who satisfied the conditions set out in section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal case, a person who did satisfy fully all these conditions would be registered but there is a very real and positive danger that at some stage in the near or in the distant future someone would come along, a firm, individual or cartel, and <Col N="308" /> monopolise or tend to monopolise the entire wool industry.  If the Minister were obliged to register everyone who fulfilled all the normal conditions there would be no way of safeguarding the market against such a monopoly. By having this discretionary power&mdash; and the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives him this&mdash; there is such safeguard and he will be able to control the affairs of wool buying and selling and protect against would-be monopolists even though they may have satisfactory premises and competent staff.  Such a monopoly, as the Deputy appreciates, would more than likely depress&mdash;it would aim at depressing&mdash;wool prices here and you would have, as you have in England, this confused situation.  I do not think that, on reflection, Deputy Clinton will press this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that quite a short time ago, on the previous amendment, he said that there would be so many buyers in the country it would not be possible for An Chomhairle Olla to get around them.  Now we have reduced them to one.  It is now a monopoly of one. That is the great fear and this is the great safeguard being put in here because of a monopoly of one.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not making a case there?  I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to subsection (4) of section 6 which reads:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a person who carries on the business of a buyer of wool and who, immediately before the passing of this Act, carried on that business, shall, if in relation to the premises in which such business is so carried on or any plant or machinery therein, any regulations under this Act and applicable thereto are complied with, be entitled, on payment of the prescribed fee (if any), to be registered in the register as a registered buyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There the Minister ties himself to giving this man a licence.  He ties and binds himself.  That is not a capital sin.  I agree with that.  If it is not a <Col N="309" /> capital sin to bind himself in subsection (4) of section 6, if certain conditions are fulfilled, to give a man a licence, surely the same should be open to anybody who is capable of doing a good job of selling wool?  You may have a case of a first-class co-op which might be set up by a farmers' organisation which the Minister did not like and the Minister would use his discretion and say that he will not give a licence. That is too bad.  This is legislation that is extremely undesirable.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary telling us why it is possible for the Minister under a specified set of conditions in subsection (4) to bind himself to giving a licence and will not bind himself anywhere else.  He wants this little hammer that he can use or this little carrot that he can hold out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, either deliberately or unwittingly, minister-prets the Minister.  The Minister is merely holding discretionary power, not as a carrot or a hammer to induce or coerce, but rather to protect the interests of the wool trade of this country.  While the Deputy quite rightly adverted to the fact that I did mention that there were a large number of premises at present in the country, he must concede the point that we are living in the era of monopoly and take-over and joint firms moving in and not only Irish firms but foreign firms could well be attracted if they found that there was an easy killing to be made here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It could well be the case, if they got a complete monopoly of the market.  The Deputy is aware that no business, trade or industry is so vulnerable as the agricultural community are to the activities of cartels. The Minister must, in fairness both to himself and the farming community, retain the discretionary power to protect the interests of the wool trade of this nation and anyone who advances a theory whereby he would be disarmed of this discretion would be <Col N="310" /> doing a disservice to the agricultural community.  Certainly, I would not credit Deputy Clinton with having that in mind.  I appreciate that he does not intend to work against agricultural interests here.  For that reason I would expect that he would withdraw this amendment.</P>

They should know in what dimension they are wrong.  There is nothing in this to indicate what these dimensions are except that there is a set of conditions here that an applicant must fulfil before he will be registered, but there is no similar set of conditions in which he is going to refuse.  He shall have regard to them but he shall use his discretion just the same.  I cannot see a case made for it on any grounds so far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (3), it is to be noted the Minister, where he <Col N="312" /> proposes to reject an application, must tell the applicant the reasons.  That surely should allay Deputy Clinton's fears?</P>

      <P>That is not the same thing.  It does not say the grounds on which the Minister may refuse.  It simply says that having refused, the Minister shall state his grounds.  The burden of Deputy Clinton's complaint is that people do not know in advance the grounds on which the Minister may refuse other than the fact that the Minister is not satisfied under (b) (i) (ii) and (iii), but people do not know what other grounds might be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given one example of what might be a reasonable case for rejection.  The fact that the Minister would have to state afterwards why he rejected any application is a guarantee that it would not be for a frivolous reason, nor would it be one which he as Minister could not justify in the public interest.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Clinton will concede that no Minister would place himself in the invidious position of refusing an application for some harum-scarum reason but that he would have some valid and cogent reason for doing so?  The fact that he has to state afterwards the reason for his refusal is a guarantee that it would be a good and valid reason. I cannot anticipate all the peculiar cases that might arise, if indeed any arise.  Certainly the Minister would not go out on a limb to refuse a genuine and justified application without good reason.

      <P>Might I put this to the Parliamentary Secretary? If this section were reframed in another way, if there were an effort to write into the section the grounds upon which a Minister might refuse an application, even if there were an omnibus reason such as in section 5, it would be preferable to this.  I did not hear the entire of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks and I probably misunderstood him.  He seemed to me, when he was arguing about the necessity to have this discretion vested in the Minister in order to protect the wool trade and the producers, to argue that the reason for the discretion&mdash; and I thought he meant the sole reason for the discretion&mdash;was because we were living in an age of the take-over and so on and that it was necessary to protect our own people against the possibility of take-overs.</P>
      <P>If that is the reason behind it, it would be very easy to write that into the Bill and to put down in subsection (2), as one of the matters about which the Minister must be satisfied before he gives a licence, the fact that there is no question of a monopoly being established.  If there were other reasons of equal importance that the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary felt would justify the refusal I do not see that there is anything against writing those into subsection (2), listing them and at the tail-end of the list if necessary, if the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or their advisers felt there was something that might be listed, I would think then that even the inclusion of an omnibus clause such as &ldquo;for any other reason which to the Minister or to An Chomhairle seem reasonable&rdquo; or something of that sort would be preferable than leaving it in this vague way where there is no substantial guideline laid down other than the vague generality of Ministerial discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly weigh in with Deputy O'Higgins if I could think of all the devious routes people would eventually discover. There is no doubt that people out to get around regulations seem to be much more adept at discovering all the ways <Col N="314" /> and means than those who try to protect normal relations and standards and even legalities.  No matter what legislation is introduced people will find some easy way out of the regulations as such.  Leaving it to the discretion of the Minister is the safest way to ensure that no matter what route is taken or what subterfuge is adopted, if it does come to light, it can be halted straight away. I do not think anyone in this House or outside it could elaborate all the devious ways that could be adopted by any person desiring to depress the price of wool or gain advantage for themselves, or even decry the wool industry of this nation for peculiar reasons.</P>

      <P>Again the discretionary powers are given here.  At line 39 we see &ldquo;at his discretion grant or refuse to grant a licence.&rdquo;  Here we have the same sort of argument.  If I want to get a licence to export wool, I know there are certain conditions which will normally have to be fulfilled.  Before I make that application, I must set up, so to speak, as an exporter.  This involves considerable expense of one sort or another.  Before I embark on this expenditure, I am entitled to know that if I do certain things and comply with certain conditions, I am then entitled to a licence.  That is what is really in our amendment.  We are looking for nothing more or less.  Section 7 leaves this so open that after going to all the expense and all the trouble of making the necessary arrangements, the Minister may use his discretion and say: &ldquo;No, you do not qualify; we cannot give you a licence.&rdquo;  I think this is a very objectionable section and it should be amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to the fact that, quite apart from the discretion in section 7 in regard to the granting of a licence, <Col N="316" /> there is also in subsection (4) a provision that the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, amend or revoke a condition attached to a licence, and you have in subsection (3) the provision that the Minister may, at the time of the granting of a licence under this section, attach to the licence such conditions as he shall think proper and shall specify in the licence.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, that, while this is perfectly reasonable, and while no very great objection will be taken to the idea of the Minister being entitled to attach conditions, provided there were some general guidelines as to the circumstances in which the conditions would be attached; if such guidelines are there in relation to subsection (4), there should be spelled out in the section the particular circumstances in which the Minister may revoke or amend or vary the conditions attached to the licence.</P>
      <P>The point I am making in relation to subsections (3) and (4) is that people will not know where they stand unless the Minister is prepared between now and Report Stage to amend this in some way which will give definite guidelines to people as to the particular circumstances which will require to be in existence before (a) conditions are attached or (b) conditions are altered or varied.</P>

      <P>This amendment speaks for itself.  Section 9 provides that, if certain things happen, the Minister shall appoint a person who is a practising barrister of at least ten years standing to hold an inquiry.  I hold very strongly that a practising solicitor of ten years standing would be just as well qualified to do the same job and he might cost a bit less.  That is the only point. There will probably be no objection to the amendment.  I imagine the Parliamentary Secretary will at least be empowered to accept this amendment on behalf of the Minister.  It is so obvious that a solicitor of the same number of years standing would be equally well qualified.</P>

      <P>Is it seriously advanced that this House should accept a position merely because the Government are advised by the parliamentary draftsman that the usual thing is that inquiries should be conducted by barristers?  That does not seem to me to be any adequate reason why a particular precedent should obtain for all time.  Surely we have not arrived at the stage here where the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary are simply going to take what is dished up to them as precedents without applying their own minds to it and without being prepared to have a fresher look at it?</P>
      <P>I could understand and excuse the Minister's coming into this House with the Bill in this form because that is what he is advised but, when an amendment is seriously moved by Deputy Clinton, I do not think it is an adequate answer to say: &ldquo;This is what we are advised is the precedent: this is what the parliamentary draftsman tells us has always been done&rdquo;. I do not think that that is an answer to an amendment of this sort.  Surely some fresh thinking is required?

He can exempt any friend of his, for any reason that he does not have to give.  Surely this is the type of legislation that is most undesirable?</P>
      <P>We have the political head of a Department putting himself in the position that, regardless of anything written into this measure, seeing somebody he wants to befriend, he can say: &ldquo;To hell with this Act.

      <P>It seems to me an atrocious provision to write into any Act.  Certainly, the fact that a similar provision is in the Livestock Marts Act does not justify it.  It pinpoints the danger of what I referred to a few minutes ago&mdash;the question of what is or is not a precedent.  We make our precedents as we go along.  If we use this sort of provision as a precedent in the future&mdash;apparently we are agreeing <Col N="321" /> to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that the precedent is in the Marts Act&mdash;there is nothing at all to prevent the Minister for Local Government, the next time he is introducing a Road Traffic Bill, from putting in a section to say that &ldquo;the Minister may, as he thinks fit, grant exemption from the provisions of this Act to any particular driver or classes of drivers or for any particular vehicle or classes of vehicles.&rdquo;  I think the Government are opening the door to a very dangerous type of precedent.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Parliamentary Secretary says that these particular types of businesses, such as skein wool and that kind of thing, are what are in question here, but that is not clear and there is no reason why it should not be written into this section, once that is the kind of provision the Government want.  Remember, the phrase used in section 10 is &ldquo;in relation to businesses of a particular class....&rdquo; This whole Bill up to now has been concerned with two businesses, the business of buying wool and the business of exporting wool, and it would seem to me that anyone reading this Bill would automatically assume that the businesses referred to in section 10 are either the business of buying or the business of a wool exporter.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us in effect that is not so.  Why not write into section 10 just what is meant?  Why have this general provision that is going to lead to confusion particularly as we were already in the Bill talking about dealing with and thinking about particular businesses, or classes of businesses, because the two are separate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>While those of us associated with the boot and shoe industry were well aware that the whole question of the continuation of protection was subject to review under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, and while we were also aware that negotiations were proceeding for some time with the British Board of Trade <Col N="324" /> and with the manufacturers concerned on the possible abolition of the quota and its replacement by a duty likely to be implemented on 1st July this year, nevertheless the rather cavalier fashion in which the Minister made his announcement without regard to the majority wishes of the trade and, particularly, without reference to the unions concerned, was a cause of dismay.  This news was received with shock and indignation by the unions concerned and, indeed, by a large section of the employers in the trade.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that before the Minister made such a pronouncement fraught with such serious repercussions for all concerned, he would have had regard to the majority views of all parties concerned, that he would in particular, have called in the unions whose duty it is to serve the interests of the workers, because it is the workers who will suffer as a result of any relaxation of protection.  The employers concerned can obtain for themselves golden handshakes, but it is the workers who will be thrown on the industrial scrapheap as a result of the Minister's decision.</P>
      <P>The fears of my union in respect of the abolition of the quota are very well founded.  Our fears are based on our sad experience in 1947 when the quota protection was removed and a huge consignment of footwear, mainly from Britain, amounting to some 2,000,000 pairs, was dumped in this country in the space of a few months.  The dislocation of the industry at that time was appalling, and there was widespread unemployment and short-time working in almost every shoe centre. We had to wait for a new Government and a new Minister for Industry and Commerce to come into this House to put back the barriers of protection and afford the industry an opportunity of picking up the threads of economic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is taking an unnecessary risk by the abolition of the quota; it is a retrograde step.  It is all the more astonishing that he should opt for the abolition of the quota at a time when the British Government have indicated their willingness to continue the quota system for another four years.  One would imagine that the Minister who is <Col N="325" /> responsible for the welfare of this industry would grasp this generous offer with both hands.  He must be aware that it is an acknowledged fact within the trade that the quota system is the most effective system of protection, and it represents, I contend, the view of the majority of those directly interested in the trade.</P>
    <P>The unions concerned are unanimous in their belief that the abolition of the quota will have disastrous consequences. I am sorry the Minister sought to misrepresent the views of my union officers, whom he met yesterday, in his reply to supplementary questions here today by implying that the unions were in some doubt as to the right course to adopt.  He certainly misconstrued a statement made by one of my union officers to the effect that the acceptance of the quota was the lesser of two evils.  Lest there be any doubt in the mind of the Minister, I want to place on the records of this House the views of the president of my union, Mr. Paul Alexander, expressed by telegram. I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25th May last which reads:</P>
    <P>Mr. Paul Alexander, President of the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers Union sent the following telegram to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Colley, yesterday: &ldquo;On behalf of 5,000 members of the unions engaged in the footwear industry, we protest strongly against your disastrous decision not to accept British Government quota offer.  Your decision can only lead to large-scale unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is pertinent to point out from the same paper of the same date that the meeting from which Mr. Alexander supposedly sent this telegram was a meeting in the Imperial Hotel in Cork which was convened by the shoe manufacturers of Cork city, the Lee Boot Manufacturing Company and the Cork Shoe Company.  I understand this meeting was attended by no less a personage than the Taoiseach himself.  I am sure the Taoiseach conveyed to the Minister the unanimous view of the Cork manufacturers and the President of my union, that the abolition of the quota was fraught with the most disastrous consequences for their trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> We contend that the abolition of the quota will expose our manufacturers to most unfair competition and the possibility of dumping on a large scale, bringing with it economic and social ruin to thousands of our fellow workers.  There are some 6,000 workers directly involved in the manufacture of footwear in this country; and there are also some 2,500 workers engaged in ancillary trades.  The Minister will have to have regard to the fact that he is trifling with the livelihoods of some 35,000 people.  There is no doubt in our mind that if the quota is abolished, industrial graveyards will result and thousands of our fellow workers will lie dead upon the economic battlefield before the battle between the tycoons of the British and Irish footwear industry is ended.  Crows may be flying through factories where now are employed hundreds of workers in remunerative employment and it may well be that some of these factories will be utilised as depots, store houses, for British footwear, whence they will be transported and sold.</P>
    <P>The Minister cast doubts on the wisdom of accepting the British offer of retaining the quota for another four years.  I should like to disabuse the Minister about that.  If he applies a simple arithmethical exercise to the quota figures, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the duty which he proposes to implement and of which he seems to be greatly enamoured, he will find that the quota of 165,000 pairs per annum fixed at present constitutes a mere three per cent of the domestic consumption. Even if that quota were to be trebled to 495,000, it would still constitute a very small percentage of the domestic user.  It would fall far short of the millions of pairs we had in &ldquo;Black 1947&rdquo; which could come in and most likely will, by reason of the tariff system.</P>
    <P>All that the British or foreign manufacturer has to do is conform with the duty which is now laid down, a duty of 31.5 per cent, or 3/5d per pair, reducing to by 4½ per cent or 9d per pair until it disappears in 1975.  The huge combines in Britain and on the Continent will be able to overcome this duty, especially this diminishing duty, <Col N="327" /> relatively easily and we can expect inroads to be made on the Irish industry in coming years if this is to happen. A duty of 54 per cent or 9/- per pair on non-British imports will not deter the giants of Europe from availing of our small market.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to think that the Minister bases his decision on this matter on the views of the manufacturers only without proper regard for all interested parties, and in particular the unions. There are some 25 shoe factories in the country, some of them controlled by one firm only.  Are 20 men to be allowed to decide the destinies of 6,000 workers directly employed and 2,500 in ancillary trades?  Are 20 men to be allowed to decide the fate of some 35,000 people?  This is a negation of industrial democracy.</P>
    <P>The employers concerned would be very foolish to think they can survive the power of the British and European giants in the shoe industry.  Some industries in Britain and on the Continent, of which I have some knowledge, could supply the needs of our market by a few weeks production and given any loophole, could wreak havoc on the industry here.  If the Minister is in any doubt about the views of the workers, he should consult the unions for their views.  Are the workers to be sacrificed on the altar of the Free Trade Agreement or on the altar of monopolistic capitalism?  Are they to have no say in regard to the future of the industry to which they gave the best years of their lives?  I hope the Minister will come down on the side of the vast majority concerned in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have striven to show the Minister the desirablity of availing of these precious four years for the continuation of the quota in order to afford industrialists the opportunity of gearing themselves to meet sterner competition effectively and to carry out the process of adaptation and modernisation which is badly required.  The Minister seems to convey the impression that what he is doing will confer a benefit on the boot and shoe industry.  The boot and shoe industry have always enjoyed free trade with Britain, and at the same time, had protection.  The Minister <Col N="328" /> must realise that as the barriers of protection go down, inroads will be made into the industry and unemployment, redundancy, short time, will be the order of the day.  The Minister will also appreciate that this decision emanates from the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement which, we were told, was to prepare us for entry into the Common Market.</P>

      <P>It is no use pretending, as some people have been pretending, that this is a clear-cut issue and that the obvious advantages for the industry lie in one direction and that in the other direction lie nothing but chaos and ruin for the industry and that nobody in his sane senses could think of following it.  Apart from the fact that I hesitated for quite a while before deciding in which direction I thought the best interests of the industry lay, it is true, as I indicated to the Dáil today, in response to questions, that the industry itself is divided virtually 50-50 on the merits of the alternative courses.  This should make it quite clear that the decision in this case is not an easy one and that nobody can be quite sure which is the right decision, if there is a right decision, or whether it is a question of one being better than the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy in the course of his <Col N="329" /> supplementary questions today, and again on the Adjournment Debate, has endeavoured to convey the impression that the members of the union whom I met yesterday were quite clear in their minds and had no hesitations and no doubts as to what was the right course, and he has quoted from a telegram, published in the newspapers, which was sent to me by Mr. Alexander, the president of the union, and he has quoted correctly from it.  I would suggest that it is very easy for people to panic, especially if someone is trying to make them panic, and to make exaggerated statements. However, in the calmer atmosphere of the discussion which took place yesterday, the members of the delegation from the union saw clearly that there were merits on both sides.  They were looking at it, and rightly so, from the point of view of their members and their members' interests.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Treacy said what he did and quoted that telegram, I should like now to quote from a note made at that meeting yesterday by an officer of my Department.  I saw this note only this evening about six o'clock; it corresponded with my impression of what had happened yesterday.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the meeting the Minister asked the trade union representatives if they were satisfied that the long-term interests of the industry would be best served by retaining the quota.</P>
    <P>There are then some notes about what was said in reply and then the notes continue:</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated his question and Mr. So-and-So, one of the officers, with some diffidence and reluctance, said that they thought that keeping the quota would be the lesser of two evils.  This seemed to be accepted by all present.</P>
    <P>That phrase &ldquo;with some diffidence and reluctance&rdquo; is important because that was my own impression and it was arrived at independently by the official who made the note.</P>
    <P>This attitude reflects great credit on the union representative because it is not in my opinion helping the position at all to suggest that the issue here is <Col N="330" /> quite clear cut.  The long-term interests of the industry and of the workers engaged in it may well be better served by not continuing the quota because, if the quota were to be continued for a period of four years, at the end of that period, the industry would then be subjected to competition at a relatively low rate of protective duty, whereas now the rate of duty would be relatively quite high and would enable the industry to withstand the competition very much better than it could in four years time under a low tariff.</P>
    <P>One of the essential things to grasp in this is that the issue is not whether, on the one hand, there should be a tariff instituted now or, on the other hand, whether there should be a quota for an indefinite period.  Deputy Treacy, I think, spoke of the quota as being the best form of protection for the industry.  This might be true if it could be carried on indefinitely, but the reality of the situation is that the maximum period for which the quota can operate is four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, at the end of that four years, the duty would be substantially reduced and it is in the light of that that the decision must be made.  The easy decision in this case, and the one that would certainly be the most popular with many people, would be to continue the quota for a period of four years, but I am not so sure that it would not be an irresponsible decision, having regard to the long-term interests of the industry and the workers in it.  I am not saying that either way this is quite clear; my whole point is that it is not.  It is, in fact, misrepresenting the position to suggest that anybody can be absolutely certain that one way will be chaos and vast unemployment and the other will be some form of E1 Dorado.  That just is not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred, as he did earlier today, to the position which obtained in 1947.  I want to say again that his version is incorrect.  What happened in 1947 was that substantial quantities of footwear were allowed into the country, under an expanded quota, duty-free.  That is the point&mdash;<Col N="331" /> duty-free.  That is the very situation I wanted to avoid because, if we impose a quota for another four years, at the end of that period footwear can then come in here almost duty-free and the danger is that the 1947 situation will be repeated.  It is to avoid that very situation that I considered applying the tariff instead of the quota.</P>
    <P>The fact that an offer was made by the British to allow the quota to continue for another four years must be viewed realistically in the light of our interests and one can only assume that, in making that offer, the British Government was having regard to the interests of Britain's manufacturers.  I do not say that the interests of both sets of manufacturers are mutually exclusive, but the mere fact that the offer was made by the British is of itself no reason why we ought to accept it.  Indeed, since the British Board of Trade is very effective in looking after the interests of its own manufacturers, there is every reason for our having some doubts about it and looking at it again and again from our point of of view.  I say this without any disparagement of the British Board of Trade; they are doing their job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy also said that, even if the quota were increased to, I think he said, 400,000, or more, this would be a better situation than abolishing the quota and operating under the tariff.  I am not at all sure that that is so; in fact, I am almost certain it is not so.  I know there are one or two manufacturers who voted for the retention of the quota who would feel that any extension of the quota would be damaging to them because it would mean shoes coming in on their particular market free of duty and had they known this was to be the situation, they would have voted for the tariff rather than the quota.  I know this is so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the Free Trade Area Agreement.  He went through the ritual; it is ritual now for members of the Labour Party to say all our ills are due to that Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This one certainly is: this is the backlash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="332" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that under that Agreement our exports have been going up enormously to the extent that the trade figures for January and February of this year show industrial exports up by one-third on the corresponding period last year, which was itself a good year, and this represents new jobs and good jobs for our workers.  The Labour Party should remember that when they attack the Agreement.  This is what it means and the workers engaged in export industries are conscious of that.  The Deputy may be making a political mistake when he attacks the Agreement.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I got the impression that Deputy Treacy has not much hope for the future of the footwear industry.  One feels certainly that he thinks it is going to disintegrate, that it is going to disappear without a quota anyway.  I believe that some elements in the footwear industry are quite efficient and some are not.  Of one thing I am certain: if it is featherbedded, it will do no good in the future.  I am also certain that there are sufficient people among management and workers with the right outlook to ensure that the industry will do well, given the right conditions.  I have faith in the future of the industry.  There is, in my view, too much lack of faith on the part of a number of people who have been agitating.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the Dáil today that I have already entered into further negotiations with the British authorities in this matter and I hope something reasonably satisfactory to the industry as a whole will emerge from these negotiations.  I have indicated that what was available so far was not satisfactory to the industry as a whole; they were divided on it.  But, whatever emerges, if the industry is to succeed in future and if the workers are to continue in employment, certain elements have got to improve enormously.  I think Deputy Treacy would agree with me on that.</P>
