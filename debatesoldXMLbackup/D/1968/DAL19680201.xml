    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing last night with the purchase terms of local authority houses.  I had pointed out that more than 78 per cent of rural houses had been vested already and that more than ten per cent more had vesting applications pending.  I had gone on to deal with the position applying to <Col N="176" /> urban houses and had dealt with the 1953 circular under whose terms urban houses could be disposed of.  I had mentioned that there was another circular issued in 1956.  This circular provided, as an alternative to the terms specified in 1953, that the Minister would be prepared to approve of the sale of post-1946 houses for their original all-in cost, reduced by the amount of the appropriate State grant that would have been paid if the houses had been provided by persons for their own occupation, or by the amount of the Transitional Development Fund Grant where one was paid.</P>
      <P>Of the urban houses provided up to 31st March, 1967, schemes under the 1953 and 1956 circulars applied to 23,014 houses.  As I have said, of these, only 7,100 had been sold up to that date and it is estimated that a further 2,000 houses will be sold during 1967-68 on foot of applications to purchase received by the local authorities prior to 30th September, 1967, which was the last date for receiving applications.</P>
      <P>The Association of Municipal Authorities passed resolutions which indicated that with the rise in prices and the tendency for local authority rents to remain static, these minimum terms gave very low sale prices.  There are, in fact, instances of houses sold under the sale schemes to tenants being resold by the tenants fairly soon after purchase for three, four and five times, which was fairly normal, and in some cases for up to ten times the price paid for them to the local authorities. The valuation by the Valuation Office on certain houses proposed to be included in sales schemes in urban areas indicates that the prices proposed were often as low as one-ninth or one-tenth of the current value of the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it surprising that some Deputies are so completely irresponsible and so unconcerned with the magnitude of the housing problem as to advocate the continuance of this improvident dissipation of valuable housing stock. It was because of this experience that houses were being disposed of at giveaway prices; and on 23rd December, 1966, I notified local authorities that it was not intended to approve of further schemes for the sale of urban <Col N="177" /> houses on the terms laid down in the the 1953 and 1956 circulars, but tenants of houses to which existing schemes applied were given up to 30th September, 1967, to apply to the local authorities to purchase under the schemes if they so wished.  That was a period of slightly more than nine months.</P>
    <P>In respect of urban houses, terms for their sale under section 90 of the 1956 Act, which I have indicated I will be prepared to approve in purchase schemes made by local authorities, provide for a discount from market or replacement value of two per cent for each year more than five years during which the tenant has been in occupation of a local authority house, subject to a maximum discount of 30 per cent.  Nobody can claim that these terms are less than generous to the tenants concerned.  At the same time, I think they are also fair to the other people who are involved.</P>
    <P>This means that a tenant in a house that is valued at £1,800 can purchase it for £1,260 if he has been in occupation for the requisite period.  As I say, I am satisfied that those terms will present a fair balance as between the tenant wishing to purchase his house and the local authority which provided it and which must continue to provide houses to meet the needs of those without adequate accommodation.  The local authority represents the general ratepayers and the taxpayers for whom Opposition Deputies at the appropriate time, that is, the time they consider appropriate, show such great concern.</P>
    <P>I may say I provided that capital receipts from the sale of houses must be used to finance the construction of further houses either by the local authority directly or by private builders with the aid of grants and loans from the local authorities.  There will thus be no net diminution as a result of sales in the local authorities' ability to deal with the housing needs of their areas.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that in calculating sale prices an allowance should be made for the amount paid by the tenant in rent.  This suggestion will not stand up to examination.  It must be remembered that substantial <Col N="178" /> annual subsidies are paid for every local authority house built.  The rent usually does not cover even the loan charges on the capital from which the construction of the house was financed, not to mention maintenance and administrative costs, which are borne by the local authority.  In fact, the argument could be advanced that the longer the tenant has been in the house, the more subsidies he has received and the price of the house, if he wishes to buy, should therefore be adjusted upwards rather than downwards according to the length of his tenancy.</P>
    <P>The terms which have been circulated to local authorities are based, as I said, on the desire to be fair to the tenant genuinely wishing to purchase the house for his own use and at the same time, ensuring that the local authorities do not dissipate at the expense of the ratepayers and the taxpayers the stock of houses which has been built up by them with such trouble and expense over so long a period and which are required to accommodate persons genuinely in need of housing.  If local authorities do sell under the present terms, the terms I have approved under the Housing Act, 1966, then the sale price will make a fair and reasonable contribution towards the cost of building another house to replace that which has been lost from their stock.  I think this is a sound principle and I am quite satisfied that the public generally will agree that the terms are fair to all the different people concerned in the sale of a house, the person purchasing the house and the people who have contributed to its construction and maintenance, the ratepayers and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>With regard to assistance for private housing, the Opposition have again in this debate endeavoured to make it appear that little or nothing is being done and here again the facts are completely contrary to what has been alleged.  The fact is that all local authorities are at present accepting loan and grant applications for new houses and a record sum of at least £7.5 million will be spent by local authorities for this purpose in the <Col N="179" /> financial year 1967-68 compared with an actual payment of £4.62 million in 1964-65 and £6.75 million in 1966-67. In addition to that, all building societies are at present accepting loan applications.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the fact that the basic grant of £275 had not, they said, been increased since 1948. At the same time they complain that those grants were made irrespective of income or in other words, as Deputy Treacy says, without an odious means test.  Presumably a means test in respect to the payment of housing grants would be an unodious test.  Since the State grant was fixed at £275 this grant has been doubled for persons in need of housing by the provision enabling local authorities to pay supplementary grants.  Most authorities do in fact pay those grants.  In addition to that doubling of the grant for those people whose means indicate they require more assistance towards purchasing a house for themselves, the grant scheme has been extended in a number of other ways such as the provision of higher grants for serviced houses in areas without piped water supply and sewerage, special grants of up to £300 for elderly persons' accommodation, special grants of up to £450 for small farmers and others in rural areas.  Of course there are supplementary grants available from local authorities also. The scheme has been extended by the introduction of essential repairs grants for older houses in rural areas, which are not capable of economic repair, but which can, by the carrying out of what we call essential repairs, be made reasonably habitable for a period of time which it appears will be likely to be as much as they will be needed for and in cases where the provision of a completely new house would appear to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been extended by the grant of up to 50 per cent of the cost for experimental or prototype houses.  We have the introduction of dower house grants for farmers who surrender their own house to a member of the family or certain other persons, the introduction of grants for flats in <Col N="180" /> buildings of three or more storeys, the introduction of a site subsidy of £150 payable to local authorities for each developed site sold for private building and the introduction of grants for major improvement work to local authority houses.  There have been many other modifications and improvements in regard to the provision of assistance for people providing their own accommodation.</P>
    <P>I think then it can be shown, contrary to what the Opposition have been alleging, that there has been considerable improvement with regard to grants for the building and improving of private houses since the present amount of the State grant of £275 was fixed.  As those improvements have been mainly oriented towards those who were least well able to meet the costs of providing their own house, they are, of course, of no interest to the Opposition Parties.  The value of the assistance for which a person building a house may qualify under those and associated aids would be up to £1,080 in a rural area and up to £990 in an urban area.</P>

      <P>This is made up, in the case of a house in a rural area, of a State grant of £450, of a local authority grant of £450 and rates remission which on average amounts to a total sum of approximately £180. That makes a total of £1,080, the maximum amount of assistance being available in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The State grant in urban areas is normally £275 but, in certain cases, it can go up to £285 and a local authority grant to the same amount is available.  In general, the rates remission in urban areas amounts on average to £270.  In addition, there is the special site subsidy of £150 available in the case of sites which are provided by the local authority for private housing. This makes a total of £990 when the grant at the rate of £285 is available or, as it is in most cases, up to £970.</P>
      <P>In addition to this assistance which the State gives &mdash; the State being, of course, the pockets of the people&mdash; there is also a substantial range of grants available for the reconstruction of a house and for the installation of piped water and sewerage.  As for reconstruction, a person can qualify for up to £140 from the Department of Local Government and £140 from the local authority by way of grant in addition to a reconstruction loan, free of formalities, of up to £200 from the local authority, making £480 in all.  It is important to remember that, in addition to the impressive level of housing output to be reached this year &mdash; at least 11,700 houses &mdash; at least 11,000 reconstruction grants will be paid this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person improving his own house can also get up to £75 from the Department and up to a further £75 from the local authority for the installation of water and sewerage.  The amount <Col N="182" /> paid out in grants by the Department has risen from £342,000 in 1948-49 to nine times that amount, or approximately £3 million, in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>As regards the income limit of £1,200 for eligibility for local authority house purchase loans which was fixed in June, 1965, there has been one wage round, the tenth round, of £1, since that date.  A sum of £1,200 is not a very high figure but it is in fact considerably more than the average earnings of workers in transportable goods industries.  It is equal, roughly, to the maximum of the clerical officer scale in the Civil Service and in State-sponsored bodies.  In fact, the average income of borrowers from Dublin Corporation is less than £900 a year.  The present loan limits, that is, the limits of the actual loans themselves, were fixed also in 1965 at £2,700 in the Dublin area and in the county boroughs of Cork, Limerick and Waterford and at £2,500 elsewhere.  I think the £2,700 limit is reasonably adequate to cater for houses selling for prices in the region of £3,500, as I propose to show.  With a loan of £2,700, with a State grant of £275 and a supplementary grant from Dublin Corporation of £206, a deposit of £319 makes a total of £3,500 and in present circumstances, I do not think that is really an excessive deposit.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence available that either the upper limit of the loan or the income limit have inhibited building. On the contrary, it is clear that the demand for loans, even within these limits of income and the loan itself, is extremely high.  In present circumstances, it is necessary to get the best return in housing units from the available resources in order to encourage the building of modestly-priced houses.  I do not want to be taken as stating that there is not a case worth considering for the raising of these limits, or indeed for the raising of the grants, either, but it is a fact that, even with the record amount of money which it is now possible to provide for this purpose, there is no difficulty in having all this money taken up in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is obviously desirable that the <Col N="183" /> total of money available should be spread over as many separate dwellings as possible.  My colleague, Deputy Clinton, was particularly critical of the upper loan limit which he declared was completely unrealistic for house purchase loans in the Dublin area. The fact is that the number of loan applications on hands in Dublin county and city has risen from £871,000 to £1,147,000 between 31st March and 31st December last.  Payments in these nine months have been £1,337,000.  This indicates, I think, the measure to which the loan scheme, which Deputy Clinton claims is unrealistic, is, in fact, being availed of.</P>
    <P>I am glad to state that Dublin County Council have at last relaxed the residence qualification for supplementary grants for new houses in the county.  This will reduce the burden on people who are building their own houses.  As Dublin Deputies know, the majority of people building or purchasing houses in the county area were, up to now, disqualified on residence grounds from the scheme of supplementary grants.  I have sanctioned a loan of £1 million to enable the county to finance their extended grants system. In so far as private housing generally is concerned, I should like to point out that the number of grants for new houses in the Dublin area allocated by my Department in the nine months to 31st December, 1967, was 100 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.  Obviously, then, despite what Deputy Clinton says, the present range of assistance and the conditions under which it is made available are not, in fact, inhibiting the purchase of houses. However, that does not mean that I should not like to extend it.  It is obvious that the full amount of money that the community is able to provide for this purpose is, in fact, being taken up under present conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to private housing, I agree that in many cases the difference between the price of the house and the total of the maximum loan that is available and the grants from the State and local authority is too much for many people to bridge and this adds to <Col N="184" /> the local authority housing problem and may prevent people who are anxious to purchase their own homes and undertake the outgoings from doing so.</P>
    <P>I have shown that deposits required for a house costing £3,500 represent reasonable value at that price where a person qualifies for the supplementary grant and I think it is still feasible to try to encourage the production of houses at this figure.  I have no doubt that reasonable houses can be produced at this figure or less.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of houses selling at this price which are not value for the money.  When a house sells at this price which is value for the money and a person qualifies for the supplementary grant, that is what the deposit would be.  We have had a lot of talk about the cost of sites as an element in the high cost of houses.  I do not want in any way to minimise this.  I pointed it out before Opposition Deputies took it up.</P>
      <P>The cost of the house is made up of different factors, such as labour, materials, land, rising standards, and the cost of sites.  Labour costs which comprise one-half the cost of the actual building of the house are fixed by processes which are well known and I do not think anybody wants to interfere with that.  The cost of materials is largely determined by factors which are outside our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to housing is in fact that demand exceeds supply and in these circumstances, it is hardly surprising if all concerned try to benefit themselves financially from this position.  I would be surprised if builders' profits are not maximised but they have to be related to the price obtainable and this is affected to a certain extent by the <Col N="185" /> amount of grants and loans which can be got.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for the view that this factor helps to keep down the price of houses.  Is it not possible if these were increased in present circumstances that the increases would go in the main to increasing profits?  I do not think there is any point either in pretending that building workers also do not try to get and often succeed in getting more than the negotiated wage and this is not blameworthy when it appears that employers are making large profits.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies pointed out, land prices are also as high as it is possible to obtain.  However, although this is so, it is not correct to say that land prices comprise the biggest proportion of the cost of houses.  In many cases, however, the site cost is the factor which just puts a house outside the scope of a person who is able and willing to undertake the repayments and the other outgoings on a purchased house. I fully agree that if this is not the biggest factor in the cost of a house, it is the least justifiable one and the one it is most desirable to tackle.</P>
    <P>Land which normally has an agricultural value only becomes building land because of the provision by the local authority of water and sewerage services.  These services are provided by the community as a whole for the benefit of the community and for the purpose of making it possible to provide homes for those without them and of making it possible to establish undertakings providing employment for the people.  They are not provided in order to make it possible for a few fortunate individuals to make large and completely unearned fortunes. These people contributed no more than the other individuals in the community to the provision of the services and it seems intolerable that the rest of the community should have to see these exorbitant profits made from their investment and the solution of the problem for which the investment was made being thereby rendered more difficult.</P>
    <P>This seems so obviously wrong and so manifestly against the common good that I can quite understand that people <Col N="186" /> find it hard to believe that it cannot be dealt with in a simple and obvious way.  Unfortunately the obvious and apparently simple solution to a problem is not always constitutionally possible according to the interpretation put on it by those deemed to be competent to interpret it.  This is sometimes surprising and disconcerting to the layman.</P>
    <P>I have been working on the obviously unjustifiable prices obtainable for land in which investments are being made by the community and I still hope to provide a solution.  When and if I do succeed in doing this, I do not worry about fingers being burnt. In the meantime, we encourage local authorities to purchase serviced or serviceable land in advance of their requirements, both for local authority houses and for private houses.  A new site grant of £150 per site is now available for sites for private houses provided by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Although land has changed hands at astronomical prices in the Dublin area and although individual sites in the Dublin area have, and still are, costing as much as complete houses were costing a few years ago, the fact is that Dublin Corporation have acquired and are acquiring substantial acreages at comparatively reasonable prices.  When I say comparatively reasonable prices, I do not mean to imply that I consider even these prices to be reasonable prices, but they are reasonable compared with what has been obtained in other cases.</P>
    <P>In the very near future as a result of these purchases the Dublin Corporation have been making they will be able to make available sites to private individuals and groups, and indeed to small builders also, and this should make an impact on the present position. It is my aim that they should acquire a pool of land for this purpose, and I will have no sympathy for anybody who paid unreasonable prices for this commodity as a speculation and finds that he has burned his fingers.  It is an undesirable practice in the first place, and I will not worry if such a person finds he has made a mistake.  The huge expansion <Col N="187" /> in building has made developed land scarce, and there is obvious urgency about drainage schemes in the Dublin area and in other areas also.  One that springs to mind is Galway.  No doubt one satisfactory solution for the community as a whole whose investment creates building land would be that only land in public ownership should have access to those services which the public provided.</P>
    <P>Land being purchased by local authorities in such circumstances for housing purposes obviously would not have the present inflated values since it would not have access to the services. In present circumstances, however, the most effective way to tackle the evil of high site costs is that being followed &mdash; the acquisition of a pool of land by the local authority and the provision of extra sewerage capacity to increase the quantity of serviced land.  This will eliminate the present position of scarcity which makes it possible for avaricious people to obtain these outlandish prices for land and thereby frustrate to a certain extent the intention of the local authorities in making the investment in water and sewerage which changed this land from agricultural land to land suitable for housing purposes and other development purposes.</P>
    <P>We have had during this debate complaints with regard to delays and frustrations which were alleged to be involved in the submission of documents and plans by local authorities to my Department in connection with housing schemes.  From what I heard it is clear that the Deputies making these complaints either have no knowledge of or are deliberately choosing to ignore the changes made in the procedure in recent years.  It has been made clear to housing authorities that, provided a proposal is properly documented, only one full submission at sketch plan stage is necessary.  This submission is necessary to ensure that the prescribed standards are adhered to and that the scheme is designed on economical lines.  The submission at tender stage is largely formal, provided <Col N="188" /> the tender does not exceed the approved estimate by more than ten per cent.  But this submission also is necessary because of my overall responsibility for the cost of the national housing programme, and because it is the Government who have to provide the capital for it, and because the supply of capital is not and is never likely to be unlimited.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for regular consultation between technical and administrative officers of housing authorities and the Department.  I have recently clarified the requirements of my Department in regard to the technical examination of schemes and made it clear once again that the local authorities did not have to come to my Department for approval to acquisition in the case of sites by agreement and that only one full submission of documents at outline planning stage was necessary.  I am satisfied that the control exercised by my Department over a capital expenditure of £29 million by local authorities is as light as possible, consistent with my responsibilities to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It seems that no matter how often I say it or write it, some Deputies just will not accept the fact that I exercise only the minimum controls which I have mentioned.  Most of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter are members of local authorities. Apparently they just refuse to understand the position and prefer instead to pretend to believe that no change has been made in the procedure, although in fact, as members of local authorities, they must know what they say is not true.  A number of Deputies described a rather fanciful procedure of documents being sent by technical officers of local authorities to the technical officers of my Department and being sent back many times.  The facts are that this does not happen except in the most exceptional and justifiable circumstances.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, it is at least two or three years, and sometimes up to four years, from the time the initial decision is made to build a housing scheme before actual building can start.  Therefore the figure for the <Col N="189" /> actual number of houses built in any period are not in themselves an accurate measure of the housing progress achieved in that period and do not present the full picture.  But, just in case Opposition Deputies think that even on this basis the performance of the Fianna Fáil Governments can be made to appear in bad light, I want to disabuse them of this notion.  Even if performance is to be assessed on this inaccurate basis, the figures show that 288,627 of the approximately 700,000 separate dwelling units in the State were provided since 1922; that is, 41 per cent of existing dwellings have been provided in the space of 45 years.  Fianna Fail have been in office for 64 per cent of that time and during that period 72 per cent of these 288,000 odd houses were built.  When it is realised that the Fianna Fáil periods in office included the period of the Economic War, the period of the Emergency or war years and the even worse circumstances of two postCoalition periods when they took over a badly rundown economy and when it is realised the two Coalition Governments took over a sound and expanding economy, it is clear that the Fianna Fáil Government succeeded incomparably better than the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that in their two post-war three year periods in office the Opposition did no more than use up the Fianna Fáil land, plans and money.  When these were used up, the Coalition Governments, the building industry and the housing programmes of the local authorities collapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the housing problem is not solved and I do not expect to see it completely solved.  As houses will continue to become obsolescent, standards will continue to rise. The population is now increasing because the level of economic activity in the country is able to maintain an increasing <Col N="190" /> population.  Consequently the replacement of existing houses and additions to our housing stock will continue to be necessary.  But I do say we are within sight of eliminating the cases of gross overcrowding that have been a feature here since the British days and were a legacy of government by an outside country.</P>
    <P>The progress made has been mainly by Fianna Fáil or under programmes initiated by Fianna Fáil.  We arrange each year to devote the maximum feasible amount of our increasing resources to this important work and we take care to ensure that these resources do increase.  As the Taoiseach indicated, according as the economy expands, our housing effort will be intensified until we have reached the goal we have set ourselves of a home for every family in the country, irrespective of whether they can afford to pay for it or not.  Following the slight recession in 1966-67, there is, as I have said, every indication that our target figure of 12,000 to 14,000 houses per annum by 1970 will in fact be achieved.  Allocations of grants for new private houses by my Department were 50 per cent higher in the nine months to 31st December, 1967 than in the corresponding period in the previous year.  In so far as local authority housing is concerned, the number of houses started in the first six months of the financial year were 128 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of the preceding year.  As Deputies know, the big Cork and Limerick National Building Agency schemes will commence in the near future.  Deputies who do not like to face facts have been saying that anything can be done or proved with statistics.  I should like to see these Deputies working on these figures for a while.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution, Deputy Treacy displayed his typically irresponsible attitude in the ridiculous allegation that the Government are lavishing money on office blocks, luxury flats and skyscrapers.  I have the quotation here.  It is from column 1410, volume 231, of the Official Report of 5th December, 1967, and it says that the Government are lavishing money <Col N="191" /> on office blocks, luxury flats, and skyscrapers. Of course, Deputy Treacy knows that this is not true.  Perhaps he would indicate where these things are that the Government have been building. Office blocks have been built; some blocks of flats which could be described as luxury flats have been built; and at least one skyscraper has been built&mdash; but not by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Office blocks have been built in this city, and some blocks of flats which could be described as luxury flats, and there is one skyscraper I know of, but none of these things was built by the Government. I have no great objection to the flats; I have no interest in them either.  I would prefer to see capital for housing spent more economically.  I would prefer to see it spread over a greater number of housing units, but most people would agree that different standards of accommodation are inevitable in any type of society, even in the type of society which Deputy Treacy and his colleagues have lately been told they want to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the office block construction I, personally, resent, because it appears to me to be a bit extravagant in our circumstances, but I cannot see that there is anything much can be done about it.  I appreciate the fact, of course, that very many workers in the city who work in offices have at present to work in completely unsuitable conditions, and unlike Deputy Treacy who considers it a crime to <Col N="193" /> provide better circumstances for them, I consider that these workers have the right to look forward to more suitable working accommodation.  At the same time, the housing problem is such an urgent one that I would like to see the maximum possible amount of capital made available for its solution, and for that reason I would prefer if the office buildings being provided were not on such a luxurious scale.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Treacy's charge that the Government have been &ldquo;lavishing money on skyscrapers,&rdquo; I may say that I know of only one building which could qualify for this description, and the Government are not concerned with it in any way. Some of Deputy Treacy's colleagues were critical with regard to planning approval that was obtained for other office buildings in the city, but they have been strangely silent in regard to this particular case.  Perhaps they would apply their minds as to how this proposal with 100 per cent coverage and with no provision for off-street car parking got through.  Who was responsible for this &mdash; the Minister or the planning authority?  And who put on the pressure?  However, while it is, of course, criminal to allow better accommodation to be provided for other office workers, this building has the great virtue of providing the utmost luxury and prestige for a special category of office workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;paid trade union officials who will, of course, be exempt from the conditions of the classless society and who, unlike other office workers, are entitled to nothing but the best from the point of view of luxurious office accommodation. Therefore, this building must be judged by other standards, both planning and financial.  If workers find housing conditions difficult, they will, at least, have the satisfaction of knowing that their paid officials are working in comfortable and luxurious surroundings and that their contributions made over the years have been used to provide this splendid and ostentatious <Col N="194" /> structure which appears to have been designed with only two purposes in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At least the other buildings Deputy Treacy and Deputy Dunne complain about remunerate their capital, but there was only one purpose for building this completely uneconomic structure, prestige.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there has been in the debate a number of adverse criticisms of the building of office blocks, both in the context of the demolition of existing houses and of the urgency of the housing problem and the consequent desirability of using as much of our capital resources as possible for its solution.  I want to repeat that there is no one in this House who resents as much as I do the squandering of comparatively scarce capital resources on this kind of building at a time where there are so many families in urgent need of housing.  Whether these buildings have been built as monuments to certain people or not, they are still using up capital resources that could have been used for what I consider the more urgent need of housing.</P>

      <P>Again, in the case of organisations like the organisation which built the only skyscraper we have in this city who, because they have an assured income do not have to worry about remunerating the capital they spend, desirable though it may be from the social point of view and in the interests of the less well off sections of the community, it just is not feasible to prevent such an organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, while I cannot prevent this undesirable expenditure on luxury office blocks and skyscrapers, I will certainly do anything I can to discourage it, that is, of course, where it is unnecessary.  In places like Athlone and Castlebar, the construction of office blocks is not only socially but also economically desirable because, in my opinion at any rate, the cost of providing for increased population at smaller centres is likely to be much less than the frightening expenditure necessary to cater for the prospective increases in the Dublin region if present trends are not reversed.  It is not just the Dublin sewerage system that must be increased in capacity to cater for expansion.  The road system in the city is just barely capable of continuing the present traffic not satisfactorily, but in a manner that just permits activity to continue, and it is clear that the mere building of another bridge or two across the Liffey will not be sufficient to provide for further increases in the volume of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the projected increase in Dublin cannot be diverted to other more suitable and more desirable areas, it will, it seems to me, be necessary either to prohibit private cars in the city, or to embark on colossal expenditure in acquiring and demolishing good property in order to provide a new road system in the city and surrounding areas.  This expenditure and the provision of the necessary infrastructure <Col N="198" /> for a development of Dublin city that is undesirable in itself, is something sarily involved in making the arrangements which would be called for by such development is badly needed for other more essential purposes.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the provision of office blocks and houses and on the expansion of water and sewerage services in the places I have mentioned and other provincial centres is economically justifiable even if there were not a social need to revitalise those areas.  The office blocks are necessary to enable the Departments concerned to function and their provision in these places will leave so much less scope for undesirable investment in the Dublin area.  The houses, will, of course, make a corresponding number available to help in the solution of the Dublin housing problem and whatever expansion of water, sewerage and road services is necessary is likely to cost much less than in Dublin.  These initial steps towards decentralisation are taken not merely to help in the development of other areas but to help to prevent Dublin becoming an unpleasant place to live in and an incubus on the country's economy.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the development and promotion of regional industrial growth centres is justifiable not only because of the desirability of preventing completely lopsided development, but also because it is cheaper to provide the essential services for this development in smaller areas than in Dublin.  Regional planning studies have been completed in the Dublin and Limerick regions and are proceeding in the other seven regions into which the country has been divided.  The completion of these studies is an urgent matter because when they are all available it is on the basis of these studies that decisions with regard to centres in the different regions will be made.</P>
    <P>Another thing that came in for some unjustifiable criticism was the question of regional water supply schemes and sewerage schemes.  Again, I should like to start by quoting <Col N="199" /> the nation cannot afford.  The huge amount of capital that would be neces-ported at column 1402, volume 231, of the Official Report of 5th December, 1967.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to point out that the cost of the schemes so planned amounted to £36 million and he alleged that because it was not possible to do all this work in one year, all this planning was wasted.  Of course that is nonsense.  The sensible approach is obviously that which has been adopted, namely, to pick out the most urgent sections of the scheme and select the schemes that will be of the greatest advantage to the community as a whole and to establish an order of priority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy also referred to this matter and at column 1418 of the same volume he said:</P>
      <P>I earnestly appeal to him to reconsider his attitude in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder can Deputy Treacy be really serious when he describes as a personal attitude the necessary tailoring of the programme of regional water supply schemes to the amount of capital it is possible for the community to provide? Does he honestly think that all that is necessary to produce money is the will <Col N="200" /> to produce it?  Does he expect people to believe this even after the Coalition performance which arose directly from the Government's irresponsible neglect of the fundamental necessity to ensure that the community was able to provide the finance for the State's current and capital programme?  The fact is that capacity to provide capital is proportional to the national income and therefore it depends on the state of the economy.  It should be obvious then that economic undertakings cannot be starved of capital necessary for development without producing the type of disaster that the Parties opposite produced when they gaily dissipated the resources left to them by Fianna Fáil and when they went as near as possible to wrecking the country's finances irretrievably.  I repeat what I said when dealing with housing that the most foolish thing that could be done by anyone who really wants to improve social conditions would be to devote all the capital it was possible to come by to social purposes only and thereby make it impossible to continue the programme.</P>
    <P>There is one advantage in all the changes that Deputy Dillon has made during his career, that is, he supplies us with an inexhaustible stock of quotations on practically every subject. In regard to this dispute between Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Treacy as to when the regional water supply schemes started&mdash;Deputy Fitzpatrick agrees that they started in 1959 but Deputy Treacy maintains that they were there until this Government came into office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to quote Deputy Dillon.  Speaking on 22nd November, 1962, at column 1641 of volume 197, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much troubled about this whole question of piped water supply.  I heard a Deputy from Kerry announce today that for a restricted area in Kerry a piped water supply had been formulated, the capital cost of which was £2,500,000.  He went on to say that the rates are already almost £3 in the £ and he foresaw some difficulty in accepting this proposal.  I am, I am quite convinced, as radical as any Deputy, but surely there is some sanity left amongst us.  Does anybody who knows rural Ireland, and the way the houses are situated there seriously believe that an effective way of bringing water supplies to the <Col N="202" /> houses of rural Ireland is by laying mains along the main road?</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>If we are to build water mains along every main road in Ireland, we will leave a blister on the rates, a blister of very formidable dimensions.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>Surely we can get a sane approach to this whole business... Outside of Bedlam, would anybody propose to lay down on all the roads in all these areas water mains which, according to the calculations of the Deputy from Kerry, are liable to involve a capital cost of £2,500,000 for one very relatively small area covering an area of 25 miles around the shortage of supply?</P>
    <P>I think that in 1962 Deputy Dillon was the current Leader of the Party to which I think he still belongs and I think we could say that his attitude to regional water supplies at that time fairly represented the Opposition attitude to the scheme when it was getting under way originally.  This is the scheme about which they now pretend to be so enthusiastic.</P>

      <P>Outside of bedlam, said the man whom Deputy Dunne is trying to defend, would anyone consider such a scheme?  Deputy Treacy, speaking on this year's Estimate, alleged there was no money available for water or sewerage.  He said these schemes were grinding to a halt, that there was a complete close down on water and sewerage.  It might be better to ignore a speaker who just says what suits him, whether true or not, but it might do Deputy Treacy some good if I show him just how foolish his statement was.  I have a list of the schemes which have been authorised this year&mdash;water and sewerage schemes which were released in the current year.  It is a long list.  The total value of the schemes is £3.7 million.  In addition to these water schemes, there are miscellaneous projects to a value of £1.4 million which have been sanctioned for the same period.  These include fire brigades, sanitary conveniences, libraries, bridges, abattoirs and so on.  To my mind, they involve a considerable amount of money.  Needless to say, I should like to have been able to provide more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list is a long one but the only way to nail the type of misstatement which has been made in relation to the facts is to give the facts.  For that reason, I propose to read out the list for the benefit of Deputy Treacy. Deputy Treacy particularly asked me to give an answer to this matter and because Deputy Treacy is, as far as I know, the official spokesman for his Party on this matter, I think I should comply with his request, particularly <Col N="204" /> because he alleges that there has been no money for these schemes this year. Contrary to what he says, this is a long list of schemes authorised this year, the total value of which is £3.7 million.  I shall now read the list:</P>

The Minister is, I suggest, with great respect to the Chair, abusing the privileges and rights of the House by taking up so much time reciting facts and figures which could be supplied by him by documentary means.

      <P>I submit, without fear of contradiction, in respect of sanitary services, piped water and the like, no progress whatsoever has been made in the past few years.  The situation with most local authorities has been absolutely static.  All our hopes for the extension of piped water and the provision of sanitary facilities have been completely disillusioned and come to a grinding halt because of the inability of the Minister's Department to provide the necessary money.</P>

No rational Government, having regard to the intrinsic worth of piped water for the home, the farm and industry, would consciously hold up or withdraw moneys or frustrate the efforts of local authorities to proceed with these essential services.  If there is an answer to it, let us have it when the Minister is replying.</P>

Out of that they found it possible to allocate to the Department of Local Government £29 million. The country is just not in a position to do all these schemes together.  As I said, £3.7 million of works have been authorised this financial year as far as 31st December, 1967.  I do not think this is as Deputy Treacy says, &ldquo;no money&rdquo;.</P>

Some of them may be completed in this financial year, some of the smaller ones; some may be completed in the next financial year, and some may go on for longer.  The north Dublin regional water scheme, for instance, will go on for quite some time.</P>

      <P>It is proceeding satisfactorily. All the money will not be spent in the one year.  It is not physically possible for contractors to do all the work in one year.  The total amount of money which will actually be spent on sanitary services in this year is £3.5 million.  That will be spent in the following way.  The financing of further work on schemes already in progress at the beginning of the year will take up £2 million.  These new schemes I have mentioned to Deputies will, it is expected, only account for £.7 million in the current financial year. But there are miscellaneous services projects which were not specifically referred to and I did not give Deputies detailed information with regard to those.  We expect approximately £800,000 will be spent on those schemes in this year, some of which have been started this year and some of which have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme of regional water supply is a programme started, as Deputy Fitzpatrick admitted, by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy Treacy tried to convey that it was stopped by the Fianna Fáil Government. Because we are continuing to take care of the country's economy, the result is that the capacity of the country to finance this type of improvement will increase.  This reversal of the Opposition's previous attitude and their sudden interest in and concern for the extension of regional water schemes is a little bit disconcerting. At the same time, it is a welcome conversion to the proposal to provide these improvements on an increasing scale for the people of the countryside. Regional water schemes already constructed <Col N="220" /> or in course of construction amount to approximately £9 million. That is a considerable effort for the community in view of the fact that we also have such urgent problems as the housing problem to which a total of £25 million capital is being allocated in this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the amount of money allocated to new schemes in one year is not equivalent to the amount of the money that would be spent on these schemes in one year. That applies to housing, to water schemes, sewerage schemes and to expenditure on the roads.  It is, in fact, possible for the total expenditure in any year to increase without there being any increase in the amount of the value of the new schemes that are authorised to start.  As I pointed out when I was opening the debate, the cost of regional schemes either already constructed or in the course of construction amounted to approximately £9 million.  I also said at that time that it would be unrealistic to expect that a programme of this magnitude could be undertaken in simultaneous operations having regard to all the other demands on available capital resources. I think it was reasonable to expect Deputies to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could also have pointed out that such an amount of work could be carried out only by diverting contractors and men from the important work of housebuilding.  Although the building and construction industry has been revived after the Coalition disaster, its capacity is not unlimited, and quite apart from the question of finance, there is a limit to the amount of work which it is physically possible to undertake at the same time.  In the circumstances of £36 million worth of plans being submitted, I think I did the obviously sensible thing in asking the county councils to review their regional schemes so as to identify the more urgent schemes or sections of schemes in order that these can proceed to the construction stage as early as possible having regard to the <Col N="221" /> availability of capital.  I am satisfied that the Government have given every evidence that the importance of their overall programme for the provision of adequate supplies of piped water for rural areas is fully appreciated.</P>
    <P>This programme, adopted, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said in 1959 was, as he will probably remember, a three-pronged one under which it was intended that the sanitary authorities and private enterprise would share in the work.  The programme was that where appropriate sanitary authorities would provide piped water on a regional basis to serve large areas, while at the same time groups of neighbours would combine to provide themselves with piped water with the aid of the substantial grants that are available from my Department and from the local authorities; and that, finally, where appropriate, where neither of these other schemes were appropriate, individuals would provide their own piped water services, again with the aid of State and local grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt when Deputy Treacy gets time he will digest it.  Contrary to the wailing of Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Treacy and their colleagues, there has been considerable progress under all these three schemes. As I have indicated already, regional schemes have been constructed or are under construction, at a total cost of £9 million, while the number of grants to groups or individuals has risen from approximately 900 in 1959, when this programme was embarked on, to almost 6,000 in 1966.  I think that shows substantial progress.  We have not reached the end of the programme, and, just like other aspects of Local Government, it probably will be some time before we can complete the programme in regard to extending water supplies.  However, I am satisfied that we can show considerable improvement in regard to all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> The question of planning and planning appeals was raised on this Estimate. It was raised again yesterday on a Private Members' Bill, and was raised on the Taoiseach's Estimate before the Adjournment.  I know that there is little hope of getting Opposition Deputies to take a more responsible attitude, but I want to point out again that the Planning Act does not abolish the right of private property which is guaranteed by the Constitution; it merely delimits it, as is permitted by the Constitution when the common good requires that this be done.</P>
    <P>I assert, therefore, that it is not valid to assume, as is assumed by these people, who without any knowledge of the issues involved, pontificate on planning problems which have not been decided to their liking, that the only thing to be taken into consideration is the real or imagined amenity that they enjoy from the undeveloped state of somebody else's property.  It is an important consideration, but it is not the only consideration.  I believe I must consider whether the loss of an amenity of one kind or another outweighs the other considerations to such an extent as to justify prohibiting the owner of the property from utilising the property in the manner he desires.  I fully realise that there are people who become infuriated because other aspects than the one that interests them are taken into account, but this cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I have tried to take account of these two principles which are involved, and I intend to continue to do so in making my decisions.  I have available to me the best technical advice obtainable, and while I do not claim to be infallible, I have no qualms of conscience regarding any decisions I have made.</P>
    <P>I quoted some figures in regard to town planning appeals when I spoke on the Taoiseach's Estimate, and I think it is necessary to mention them again here.  During the period from 1st April, 1966, to 31st March, 1967, 1,298 appeals were disposed of.  Of these, 237 were allowed; 339 were allowed subject to conditions; 420 were <Col N="223" /> refused; and 302 were withdrawn. When I say that 237 were allowed, and so on, I want to point out that the term &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; means that the permission that was sought was granted; that the term &ldquo;refused&rdquo; means that the permission that was sought was refused.  Therefore, it is not possible to say in how many of these cases the decision of the planning authorities was altered, since these cases could occur under either heading.</P>
    <P>Some appeals would be made by third parties against permission that planning authorities have granted, whereas other appeals would be made by the people who put forward the proposition to the planning authority and whose proposition had been turned down by the planning authority. Obviously, then, some of the cases in which the permission was granted would be cases in which third party appeals against decisions of the planning authority were rejected, or in which the decisions of the planning authority were upheld, while some of those who are listed under the heading of being refused would be cases in which such appeals by third parties against permission granted by planning authorities were upheld.</P>
    <P>In any case, it is a fact that in quite a number of cases decisions made by planning authorities are altered in one way or another on appeal.  As I said before, this obviously gives scope for the type of allegation certain opposition Deputies love to make.  Deputy Cluskey, however, is not satisfied to confine himself to cases that have, in fact, been decided by way of appeal. He has to resort to invention in order to satisfy his desire to make irresponsible allegations, and this deliberate falsehood has been repeated by certain newspapers, and by certain television critics.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1609, volume 231 of the Official Report of 6th December, 1967, Deputy Cluskey said:</P>
    <P>In Lower Mount Street and also in East James Street, Dublin, property has been acquired by a company <Col N="224" /> known as Dunkerrin Estates and they have acquired several houses which were structurally quite sound and were not classified by the health authority as unfit for human habitation.  People had lived in these houses for a long time and they had been kept by the previous owners in reasonably good repair until this company acquired them to develop office blocks.  They acquired the property, having received permission for its redevelopment from the Department. As a result, 11 families in Mount Street alone have been rendered homeless.</P>
    <P>Now this statement, as no one knows better than Deputy Cluskey, is completely and absolutely false.  It is typical of the whole Opposition attitude, and of the attitude of certain dishonest journals, and of certain television critics who are employed, apparently, for this purpose.  This attitude is a deliberate attempt to get the public to believe that all planning applications are decided by me, when they know that only a small percentage ever come before me or my Department. Only about seven per cent of all planning applications ever come before me, and it is incorrect and untrue for people to allege that the Minister for Local Government has any general right to override decisions of planning authorities, as has been alleged by a certain person on RTE in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The facts in regard to this particular case, which Deputy Cluskey describes as a company which acquired property having received permission for its redevelopment from the Department, the facts are that on 25th August, 1965, outline permission was given by the planning authority, which is Dublin Corporation, of which body Deputy Cluskey is an illustrious and, I have no doubt, active member.  Permission was given on 25th August, 1965, for the office block, and no appeal was made to the Minister against that permission. Therefore, contrary to what Deputy Cluskey says, no such permission was given by the Minister.  In fact, since Deputy Cluskey is a member of Dublin Corporation, the planning <Col N="225" /> authority. and raised no objection, it would be much more accurate to say, that permission was given by Deputy Cluskey than to say it was given by me.  Certainly, he was a party to the granting of permission, whereas I had no hand, act or part in it.  It is a malicious falsehood then to say I had, as is being said by Deputy Cluskey and other people who have access to means of communication.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the granting of permission for this office block, which I had no opportunity to prevent if I wanted to, on 26th February, 1966, aproval was given, by Dublin Corporation again, to detailed plans for the proposed office block.  An appeal against that approval of the detailed plans was lodged on 9th March, 1966, not by Deputy Cluskey, naturally, since he was a party to granting the permission. The grounds of the appeal were purely technical points with regard to light and so on affecting adjoining houses.  I rejected this appeal on its merits.</P>
    <P>The principle had already been settled by the outline permission given by the corporation which could not be altered by me.  I had no power at any time to interfere with that permission. The decision had been made and at no stage was it objected to or appealed. In fact, not even when the appeal on the actual structure itself was made, was it brought to my notice that there was any question of families being displaced.  I was not entitled on this appeal against the details of the structure to rule out the proposal in principle, because outline permission had already been granted and was not appealed to the Minister by anyone, nor was it looked upon as being in the least objectionable by any member of Dublin Corporation, including Councillor Deputy Cluskey.</P>
    <P>So the proposal to replace these homes in Lower Mount Street and in East James Street by an office block never at any time came within my jurisdiction, but it did come within Deputy Cluskey's justification and at the relevant time he concurred in the decision of the planning authority.  He makes this completely incorrect statement <Col N="226" /> in order to try to shift his responsibility on to me.  I should also say that the area in question is zoned for office development, again by the planning authority of which Deputy Cluskey is a member, and not by me.</P>
    <P>Another indication of the irresponsible manner in which Opposition Deputies deal with this question of planning is what Deputy Hogan had to say with regard to the proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the Corporation zoned the area for local authority housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it is zoned as an area for office development by the planning authority.  Deputy Hogan had some criticism to pass with regard to my decision in relation to an appeal against permission granted by the planning authority for the erection of an hotel in close proximity to the Rock of Cashel.  My decision in this case apparently did not meet with Deputy Hogan's approval, and I must say I can understand that possibly it might not.  I think it did not meet with the approval of the people of Cashel generally, of all political persuasions, I might say.  There was a considerable amount of local pressure to have this allowed.  I agree that in this case there were strong arguments for and against the proposal, and although the proposal appeared quite simple to the people of Cashel and to the public representatives, and although it appeared quite simple, although with different aspects, to bodies like Bord Fáilte and An Taisce, I found it quite a difficult case to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan made the allegation that this case was decided in order to suit the interests of an existing hotelier in the town of Cashel.  This he knows is not true.  He omitted to refer to the fact that Bord Fáilte and An Taisce were parties to the objection to the proposal and this has been generally <Col N="227" /> ignored by those who like to make irresponsible allegations in connection with these matters.  My own opinion was that this was a typical case in which I would be condemned with bell, book and candle if I had allowed the proposal and concurred in the decision of the planning authorities.  The same people who knew from newspaper reports of all the political pressure which it was attempted to exert on me by every political Party and by Cashel urban district council to allow this proposal and who were poised gleefully waiting to pounce when the decision which they so confidently expected was made so that they could swoop in with allegations they had already prepared and held in cold storage, withheld any comment whatever when they heard the result, which was disappointing to them, that the proposal was disallowed.</P>
    <P>They were not really interested in the planning aspect of this thing; their only real interest is the scope that the decisions made in these matters provide for their slanderous allegations.  These people never refer to cases like this because they cannot manipulate them to promote the type of allegation which is their stock in trade and, therefore, it is of no interest to them.  Their interest disappeared once this particular proposal was turned down.</P>
    <P>This was not an easy case to decide. Although people on both sides took different views, they all thought it was a very simple case.  In my opinion, it was not a case of black and white.  I went down to the site myself and considered the matter for some time before I made up my mind.  The considerations of the importance of the proposal to the economy of the town of Cashel which Deputy Hogan mentioned were, in my opinion and, contrary to what the self-appointed pundits think, important ones and not to be lightly brushed aside.  I did not brush them aside: I considered them and finally decided, with certain qualms, I agree, that even the comparatively slight interference the proposal would cause to the Rock of Cashel as a spectacle was not acceptable. I want to make it clear that the fact is that while I agree in this case <Col N="228" /> with the views of bodies like Bord Fáilte and An Taisce, my agreement with their views is not automatic.  I do not think that there is no other aspect to be considered in these matters than the aspect with which they are naturally concerned.  I agree that their views are relevant and should be considered but they are not the only things to be considered and I believe that I am required to consider all other aspects.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made in this case by Deputy Hogan, that it was the interest of the existing hotelier that was uppermost in my mind, is typical of the Opposition's dishonest approach.  If the application had been granted, the allegation would obviously be that it was the other commercial interests that had prevailed over the national interest.  I think it is clear that Deputy Hogan had a good each-way bet.  He could make allegations no matter which way I decided this appeal, but in fact, in case Deputies are interested in the truth, all the pressure that it was attempted to exert on me was all one way.  Every political Party, as far as I could see, wanted me to allow this proposal and I did not do it.  This is known but because their only interest is in throwing mud, it was ignored by the craw-thumpers whose only real interest is the scope these matters provide for that activity.</P>
    <P>I have said that it was with some misgivings that I made the decision and, as I pointed out at the time, I was largely influenced by the fact that Bord Fáilte guaranteed that there was a suitable alternative site available.</P>
    <P>I have no such doubts about another case which has been mentioned here and which is currently the one which is mainly activating the minds of the professional protesters and RTE entertainers and of course which has been taken over by some of the Opposition as part of their scurrilous campaign.  I already mentioned that the Constitution guarantees the rights of private property. The Article of the Constitution goes on to provide that the State may as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  This <Col N="229" /> is what the Planning Act does.  It is my view that it does not withdraw the rights of private property; it merely delimits them with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot do more than that.  It is my experience that practically all, if not all, planning appeals involve something of a conflict between these two things, the rights of private property and the exigencies of the common good.  In the exercise of planning control, an effort should be made to reconcile these two considerations if possible, and if this does not prove possible, then the decision has to be made on the basis of which of the two principles seems most important in the particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>As I said, some people base their approach to these matters on the assumption that the only consideration is the amenity that they enjoy from the undeveloped state of somebody else's property.  My attitude is that while this is a relevant consideration, a very relevant one, it is not the only one and whether I am right or not I believe it would not be in accordance with the Constitution to neglect to consider what is the fundamental right of private property and consider whether the exigencies of the common good are in the particular case sufficiently important to refuse permission for the development sought.  I do not see that I am called upon to justify my decision in this case, the full facts of which were presented to me and fully considered by me before I reached a decision. However, since I am replying to the debate and since this has been mentioned, I propose to give some of the facts which have been skilfully concealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mountpleasant Square is an open space in so far as it is not built up but it is not open to the public.  It is privately-owned by a lawn tennis club, composed of young people who are members of a minority religion.  It consists of a space containing some <Col N="230" /> tennis courts and a pavilion which has been partly destroyed by fire.  It is surrounded by some trees and bushes and by an iron railing.  It is dominated by an obtrusive and ungainly advertisement hoarding and portion of the iron railing is backed by an unpainted wooden fence which was apparently erected to prevent people from looking in.  It is not available for the use or enjoyment of the public but it is an open space in a built-up area and it provides a certain amount of public amenity for those who appreciate such things.</P>
    <P>It may be correct to say that even without their knowing it, it provides an amenity for those who do not pay any attention to it.  This amenity value has been grossly exaggerated.  The proposal to use some of this site for a petrol station, which came to me by way of appeal, was from a private individual but there was a submission made by the owners of the property. Their case was to the effect that the club were not in a sufficiently strong financial position to provide for their members the modern amenities they demanded, to provide defence against trespassing and against wanton damage which the existing conditions in the area require.</P>
    <P>They pointed to a current claim against the local authority for malicious damage amounting to £400 in respect of the burning of their pavilion. They also pointed out that they had been unable to deal with the problem of the dumping of rubbish, as they alleged, by people in the adjoining flats and that they had received from the public health authority notices requesting them to abate the public health hazard resulting from this dumping and to ensure that it was not repeated.  They pointed out that they had tried other ways of raising finance and that they had come to the conclusion that the only way to maintain the space in proper condition and to provide reasonable facilities for their members was by the sale of a small portion of their property for a commercial use.  At this point the road is particularly wide.</P>
    <P>The decision I made in this case <Col N="231" /> provides adequate safeguards.  The conditions are:</P>
    <P>Detailed plans to be submitted for approval should include a revised layout and should indicate any advertisement or advertisement structure to be incorporated in the development and should provide for the removal of the existing advertisement structure on the frontage and the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in conformity with such plans and such conditions, if any, as may be attached to any approval granted by a planning authority or in the event of appeal by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As a result of this decision there will be a certain loss of public amenity but the loss will be very small.  There is no question of the public being denied the use of even a small portion of open space to which they formerly had access.  The loss is merely that of a small portion of open space which is privately owned and enclosed and which will now be built on.  The loss also involves the removal of some of the bushes or trees which were formerly available as a visual amenity to those who appreciated them but which obscured the view of the open space at least as effectively as will this proposal.</P>
    <P>This loss of amenity will be at least partially compensated for by the removal of the present ugly advertisement hoarding.  The professional protestors pretend that the whole open space is to be built up though they must know that is not so.  I am satisfied the loss of public amenity, if any, will be slight.  I do not know if the facility for a rubbish dump is regarded as part of that amenity.  As against this, the tennis club concerned will be able to provide reasonable facilities for their members.  They will be able to maintain the open space in a neat and tidy manner in contrast to its present unkempt and dilapidated condition and to provide better defences against trespass, vandalism and the health hazard involved in the dumping of garbage.</P>
    <P>The public will lose a certain minimal <Col N="232" /> amount of visual amenity which will be partly compensated for by the tidier appearance of the far bigger portion which will remain, while the young members of the club will acquire the practical amenity of greater recreational facilities necessary in modern times and of the rebuilding of the pavilion which was damaged by fire.  I have no doubt my decision is a just one, taking account of the legitimate interests of the owners and also the interests of those who believe that they are so infallible and indeed so incapable of error in their assessment of the exigencies of the common good that there is no need to enquire into any other aspect than that which immediately comes to their minds.  I also have no doubt that when the slight loss of public amenity is compared with the substantial increase of practical amenity which will accrue to those who have access to this open space, there will be a nett increase of amenity in the area due to the fact that the space will fulfil its function more adequately.</P>
    <P>A certain smear campaign has been started in this case by a journal which specialises in such activities.  A great deal of the criticism voiced, apart from being one-sided and biased, is based on a complete misconception of my functions as the authority to decide appeals.  I have not been given any general function to override the decisions of local planning authorities. Whether this is said in television programmes that purport to be authoritative ones, or in other places the fact is that it is only seven per cent of planning applications that the Minister comes into at all.  There is no excuse for the lack of knowledge that has been displayed.  I can well imagine the hubbub and furore there would be if there was no appeal against decisions made by local planning authorities.</P>
    <P>The television programme to which I have referred dealt with the allowing of an appeal against a refusal of an application for a petrol station in a small country town but, not being concerned with presenting a balanced view there was of course no reference to the allowing of another appeal against the decision of a local planning authority to which I have referred here <Col N="233" />&mdash;the building of a hotel near the Rock of Cashel.</P>

      <P>Those who pontificate on these things know and are only interested in one side.  Their only interest is to utilise those things for the furtherance of the type of propaganda that is their stock in trade.  In fact, their whole case is based on the assumption there is only one side to those problems. This particular case has been exaggerated and deliberately distorted for ulterior motives and it has been dishonestly presented to the public and the fact that there are other considerations has been maliciously concealed.  I reject the arrogant claim that I am <Col N="234" /> entitled to consider only one aspect.  I find I have many difficult decisions to make in regard to planning appeals.</P>
      <P>A case in point is when appeals are in respect of some development area scheduled as an area of high amenity, such as Deputy Geoghegan mentioned, where Galway County Council has an objective to preserve the shores of Lough Corrib.  This is obviously a worthy objective.  Places like this are important tourist amenities and valuable national assets but when a proposal comes up for let us say the erection of a bungalow in an area such as this by a Dublin businessman or a foreigner there is usually a question of hardship involved in refusing it. Behind the scenes in most of those cases is an uneconomic smallholder who has tenaciously refused to emigrate and who has managed to survive mainly because the State has been able to raise his income from the smallholding to the level of unemployment assistance which is the lowest of our social welfare services.  In practically all those cases, I uphold the decision of the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the objective of preserving the scenery, preserving the national asset, and bodies like Bord Fáilte and An Taisce, when this is done, glow with a sense of work well done but it is in those cases that I have grave misgivings and qualms of conscience when I know I have to administer a body blow to a smallholder who will not understand what is involved when he sees the only chance he has ever got, or is ever likely to get, to improve his position by the disposal of a small plot of what to him is useless ground taken away from him.  He does not understand this when he sees the county council and the Minister for Local Government refusing him.  The only thing he sees is that this is the only chance he has ever got to improve his lot.  The reason for refusing him does not make sense to him.  I have to agree in those cases that it is not feasible to allow such proposals because the eroding of the amenity of such places is an imperceptible process and it is not possible to say that even two or three houses would be all right in such circumstances but that <Col N="235" /> four or five houses would be too many. To the people who are still living in those areas of high amenity, it naturally appears that the decision to prohibit them from obtaining some value for what to them has been useless ground means putting the interests of well off holiday makers first and that it is a case of preserving scenery for outsiders by condemning the owners of the land that constitutes this scenery to a permanent standard of living at unemployment assistance level.</P>
    <P>I can remember two such cases in the Killarney area recently which I had to turn down because of the planning advice given to me.  I delayed a long time before bowing to the inevitable and turning them down, but I certainly can understand the feelings of the people who owned the sites concerned. I could not hope to get them to understand why this decision had to be taken.  Obviously there would be no point in talking to them about the gross income from tourism and the contribution it makes to the national economy.  I am, of course, aware, as I have said, that there is this viewpoint that questions such as whether an uneconomic holder in the west of Ireland drawing unemployment assistance should be allowed to make some profit out of a small portion of his holding or whether a struggling young people's club which desires to provide facilities for its members should be allowed to do so are not relevant to a planning application. While I disagree with this view, I do not deny the right of these people to try to promote their opinion that only strictly technical considerations may be taken into account.  I do, however, claim that it is, to say the least, presumptuous to assume, as they do, that no one has the right to disagree with them.  I fully agree it is desirable, legitimate, and in fact essential for the community to set themselves planning objectives, but I think if a minor deviation will be of substantial benefit to an individual smallholder or as in the case I have been speaking about to a club which is doing good social work, and if it will only cause a minute diminution, if any, of public amenity, <Col N="236" /> then it is justifiable to permit such slight deviation.  As I said before, life must be a simple matter for people who can see every problem, no matter how involved it may be to others, as black and white, and who automatically assume that anyone who dares to differ from their views is at best stupid and ignorant, but more likely evil and corrupt.  I cannot dismiss those matters in such a simple way and at the risk of offending those people I insist on considering the case before me.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is an appeal at all is an indication there is a difference of opinion and always between technically qualified people.  I have no recollection of ever having dealt with cases in which architects, engineers or planners did not put forward the case against the decision of the planning authority.  Those things are just the same as law cases in which eminent counsel give their respective clients diametrically opposite advice. If they did not, there would be no work and no pay for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and some other Deputies asked what is the position in regard to the proposal involving the utilisation of the bed of the Grand Canal to augment the Dublin sewerage services.  I find it hard to understand why he should ask this question.  I think the position has been made absolutely clear.  The Government decision has been announced.  I have indicated to the Corporation that the temporary closing of the Dublin city section of the canal for the purpose of laying sewerage pipes and restoring the canal has been agreed in principle.  This means that the canal will be closed temporarily while the necessary work of laying the sewers is carried out.  If that does not explain it to Deputy O'Higgins, I cannot help him any further.  Obviously the closing cannot be temporary unless there is a re-opening.  This information has been made public and as I say, if it is not clear to Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy <Col N="237" /> Dillon and all those other people who are increasing the revenue of the Post Office by sending post cards to all and sundry all over the country, I cannot help them.  If they have no better way of occupying their time then they can continue with their activities.</P>
      <P>Personally, I agree with what has been said about the amenity and the tourist importance of the Grand Canal. While the canal was built for purely utilitarian purposes and is not now needed for that purpose it is an integral part of Dublin.  There is no doubt that the city would not be the same without it and that it constitutes an amenity which would not be replaced if it was lost.  There are strong arguments for its retention.  The Government decision on the matter is quite clear.  I understand that the City Manager has instructed the City Engineer to proceed with the design of the scheme and that, to assist him in this task, consultants have been engaged.  Naturally, no firm and detailed estimates of cost are available pending the receipt of technical reports.  However, there is a good idea of what it will cost and what any alternative would cost.  It is clear that there is not in fact any alternative.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to devote much time to the spurious campaign against the Grand Canal Scheme.  There is no intention to close the canal.  The Government decision is clear.  Permission is granted for a temporary closing and it cannot be temporarily closed unless it is to be reopened.  The canal is to be restored after this essential work of laying a sewer is completed. This is known to all concerned.  Therefore, the campaign, which purports to be against the closing of the canal, is, in actual fact, against its temporary closing for the purpose of making a badly-needed area of land available for housing by servicing it in the only way in which it can be serviced within the resources that are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This addition of land is an urgent one if people without houses are to be provided with them within a reasonable time.  The provision of this necessary serviced land inevitably involves a temporary loss.  This loss is of two <Col N="238" /> kinds&mdash;(1) the small number of people who use the Dublin section of the canal for recreational boating will be without it for approximately three years during which time they will have to travel by land as far as Inchicore; (2) those Dublin people&mdash;and that is by no means all of the citizens of Dublin (and visitors)&mdash;who appreciate the visual amenity of this stretch of water will be without it for the same period. three years.  This is a loss but I do not think it is a very great loss since it will be only a temporary one.  It will be felt by a comparatively small number of people.  On the other hand, the benefit to the community as a whole will be very great indeed.  I have no doubt whatever that the decision that was taken was the proper one.  I cannot conceive of any Government with the people's interests at heart taking any decision other than the decision to make this necessary area of serviced land available for the necessary relief of the housing problem in Dublin in view of the fact that it involves only a temporary loss of amenity which will be felt by comparatively few people.  I do not know what Opposition Parties hope to gain by assisting in this campaign. I agree that as far as I can see, on this as on other issues they do not all seem to be taking the same line.  In this debate, a number of them took the line that this service should not be provided.  The campaign and the decision that is demanded by these protesting groups is definitely a demand that this developed land be not made available for the relief of the serious housing problem.  As far as I am concerned, the grant of that demand is just out of the question.  I consider it an indication of a very selfish attitude of mind that a vociferous minority are not prepared to accept a purely temporary loss of amenity&mdash;a recreational amenity in most cases&mdash;in order to enable people without houses to get them.  I have no sympathy whatever with their attitude.  There is no question of a permanent closing.  I have not time to indulge in the nonsensical windmill tilting in which these people are trying to engage because apparently they have nothing better to do.  I can see no point in reiterating the decision <Col N="239" /> or in endeavouring to explain it to people who have already made up their minds to believe what they want to believe and have no intention of changing their minds.</P>
    <P>We had again on this Estimate some comment about the actual amount of allocations from the Road Fund to different local authorities.  This was dealt with in the same exaggerated and inaccurate way as were other matters. Deputy Fitzpatrick apparently sees something Machiavellian in announcing cuts in Road Fund grants&mdash;as he says&mdash;on the eve of local elections.  It shows the irrational nature of the whole Opposition approach&mdash;to attack without reference to facts, to say anything whether or not it makes sense.  I can understand that if I announced increases in the Road Fund allocations on the eve of elections and particularly if it was possible to show that these were not justified by the revenue position then I can understand being accused of using this important aspect of local government as an election gimmick.  But apparently Deputy Fitzpatrick's brief is to attack everything whether or not what he says makes sense.  Therefore, in this debate, he categorised the announcement of cuts in Road Fund grants on the eve of the local elections as an election gimmick.  I find it difficult to follow his reasoning in this.  Is he suggesting that we were not trying to win the local elections, that we were deliberately dragging our feet, because he and his colleagues went on, in this debate, to try to make it appear that so far from cuts being necessary, increases should and could have been given.  I do not think that it is realistic to suggest that I made cuts when increases were appropriate and that I did it on the eve of an election and that this was done not because it was necessary due to the revenue position, due to the state of the Road Fund, but that it was done for the purpose of winning an election. Indeed, if that is what Deputy Fitzpatrick considers good election tactics, it is no wonder that his Party is where it is&mdash;or is he really trying to suggest that we were trying to lose?</P>
    <P>I think the fact is that Fine Gael are <Col N="240" /> just incapable of appreciating responsibility in Government.  They are incapable of appreciating that a Government could do such a thing, could reduce the Road Fund allocation on the eve of a local election.  They did not do it when they were in a similar position, when cuts were obviously in order and obviously required if the Road Fund was to be safeguarded from bankruptcy.  Deputy P. O'Donnell who was then Minister for Local Government, and Deputy Sweetman, who was then the Minister for Finance, did authorise increases in Road Fund allocation at a time when the situation obviously required that the allocation should in fact be cut.  Not alone that but at the same time Deputy P. O'Donnell co-operated with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, in abstracting from the Road Fund a sum of £500,000&mdash;half a million&mdash;on the eve of an election in order to attempt to balance the faked budget that was introduced for election purposes at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that on the 20th June last year I dealt with this matter in some detail.  Although on that occasion I know that Opposition Deputies refused to listen, still if they are interested the facts are available in the Dáil Report for that day.  I pointed out at that time that it was true that the estimated income of the Road Fund for 1967-68 was greater than the actual income for 1966-67 but that it was necessary that the Road Fund allocations, that is the allocations in respect of new works for 1967-68, had to take account of all the factors, including the growth in commitments consequent on a short fall in revenue in 1966-67 and the fact that a substantial amount of work remained to be done, and paid for, under grants allocated prior to this year.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in regard to other matters of Local Government, water schemes and so on, the value of the work that is authorised to start in any year is not an exact measure of the amount of money that will be spent in that year because there are schemes that started in previous years still in progress and, in fact, the work authorised to be started will not all be <Col N="241" /> finished in the financial year but it is the total of work in progress and new work that has to be related&mdash;if the Government are wise&mdash;to the amount of money that it has been possible to get from the community for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that it was not realistic to make comparisons between the allocations made available this year and those made available last year unless this was borne in mind. There are always delays associated with land acquisition, the preparation of plans and specifications and sometimes in the placing of contracts.  As a result, it is inevitable that the full amount of the allocation will not be spent in the financial year and because of this allocations notified in a particular year are not an exact measure of the actual expenditure on roads in that year.</P>
    <P>It is my responsibility, and a responsibility I accept, to preserve a reasonable balance between the total volume of grants paid for road works and the amount of grant payments on foot of such work.  The actual amount available this year for payment of grants is estimated at £8.9 million against £8.4 million last year, but the work done in different local authorities will consist of a combination of new works to be started and existing works which are now in operation.  The whole question of financing the work on the roads is a complicated matter, and it is dishonest for Opposition Deputies to endeavour to equate exactly the work to be done in any one year with the allocations notified for that year.</P>
    <P>I think Opposition Deputies would like this Government to do what they did, to make allocations without any reference to expenditure because, they know, that is what they did.  If this were done the Road Fund would quickly become insolvent as it did under the Coalition Government.  I do not intend to do this.  Obviously what has so enraged the Opposition is the fact that once again in this instance the present Government on the eve of an election has acted responsibly when the tactical political considerations <Col N="242" /> which actuated the other Government in similar circumstances would have suggested a different approach.  The Opposition knew that they would have taken the short-term view and that they would have taken the chance of doing what they did before, by allocating more than they could hope to pay out; that they could once again have acted in a way that would inevitably bankrupt the Road Fund, as they did before.</P>

I was here for prayers at 10.30 a.m. I remained for a few minutes and I then went to the Committee on Public Accounts and when this was over I came back.  I am sorry; I understand the Minister referred to water schemes in my constituency and I sincerely hope he will give the money we require.</P>

      <P>I gave certain information which Deputy Treacy asked of me on the 5th of December, 1967 and the members of Deputy Treacy's Party who were filling in for him during his absence at the meeting the Deputy mentions did not seem to relish the information I was giving at the request of Deputy Treacy, to the extent that Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> tried to frustrate that information by calling repeatedly for a quorum and disrupting the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If there was any reference to the paucity of representation on the Labour Benches and the absence of Deputy Treacy it was not made by me and was due to the repeated calls Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> made for a quorum.  I gave the information because Deputy Treacy asked for it and I regret he did not find it possible to be here to hear it.  I suggest to him he might read it in the Dáil Debates.</P>

      <P>As I was explaining to Deputy Treacy, when Deputy L'Estrange interrupted, if Deputy Treacy had found it possible to be here, I am sure he would have agreed <Col N="244" /> that the information I gave for the special purpose of facilitating him did in fact contradict his opinion in regard to the matter of sanitary services, piped water and the like and that it did show, contrary to the impression he had, that progress was being made and that it was not factual to state that the extensions of piped water and the provision of sanitary services had come &ldquo;to a grinding halt&rdquo; since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Since he was not here to digest the information&mdash;I am not going to read it out all over again&mdash;he should read it some time for himself. We are proceeding with a reasonable amount of momentum taking into account the awkward fact Deputies opposite do not like to take account of &mdash;the capacity of the community to provide money for these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is under-ground you put these, and they are going under ground.  The sum of £9 million is the value of the work either constructed or in progress.  I do not want to repeat myself just because of the fact that Deputy Treacy's duties as a Member of this House, the same as other Members, required him to be elsewhere this morning.  I am aware of the fact that Deputy Treacy and other Deputies were disconcerted by Deputy Fitzpatrick's unwillingness to listen to the information Deputy Treacy had requested and that they were also performing these important duties.  As I was saying in regard to the question of Road Fund allocations, what has infuriated the Opposition is the fact that on the eve of an election the Government acted responsibly.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister calling a reduction of £127,800 in the grants to Cork County Council as dealing with the Road Fund responsibly? The Minister should be aware that a number of workers have been rendered redundant at present.  He has disrupted the whole structure of road grants in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Murphy's duties had permitted him to be present he would realise that is exactly what I have been saying.  Although the revenue to the Road Fund had increased, because of the fact that commitments had reached such a high level the responsible thing to do, even though there was an election approaching, was to relate the amount of the new allocations to the amount of commitments and taking into account the revenue available to the Road Fund in the coming year.  I was dealing with the allegation by Deputy Fitzpatrick that I cut the Road Fund grants at a time when increases were appropriate on the eve of an election as an election gimmick.  I am sure Deputy Murphy would not agree with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>The only available information on emigration from individual counties is that derived from the periodic Censuses of Population, taken in conjunction with registrations of births and deaths.  This relates to net-emigration, i.e. the excess in the number of emigrants over that of immigrants, in the intervals between censuses.  It should be noted that the figures for net-emigration take into account all movement into or out of each county, whether to or from some other country or whether due to transfers within the State from one county to another.</P>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the net-emigration from each county during the inter-censal period 1961 to 1966.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>These restrictions, as well as all the other regulations affecting various other activities and persons, were imposed in the interests of farmers as an essential precaution against the introduction and spread of foot and mouth disease.  As I have already announced, I am keeping the whole position under constant review and I shall consider and announce appropriate modifications as soon as I am satisfied that this is justified in the light of the disease situation in Britain.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the grave hardship that is being caused to many small farmers at the present time, due to the fact that they have commitments such as rates, rent and shop bills to meet?  In view of the fact that greyhound racing is now being allowed, would the Minister not see his way to allow the sale of cattle at our sales yards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some of the things that Deputy L'Estrange mentions.  However, it is all too easy for Deputy L'Estrange and others to start clamouring now for relaxations. Unfortunately I do not consider that we are yet in the position when we can freely relax all of these things, much as I should like to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must realise that the fact that a cattle dealer <Col N="252" /> can go into a farm in Cork and travel from there to Westmeath, Mayo, Donegal and all around the country, is a source of greater danger than allowing local farmers to bring their cattle into local sales.  Surely the dealers travelling from farm to farm could spread the epidemic, if it came here, quicker than anyone else?</P>

      <P>I understood from a statement by the Minister some nine or ten days ago that he was to make an announcement this week regarding relaxation so far as the holding of marts and fairs is concerned. I am sure the Minister is aware that this is a serious problem for farmers who take cattle to the marts and know they must sell, irrespective of whether the price is satisfactory or not.  The Minister should be aware that there is a general demand for a relaxation in regard to the holding of fairs, and particularly for flexibility in regard to the return of cattle from marts when satisfactory prices are not obtainable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate, and I think they certainly did appreciate earlier, that it is no pleasure to me to continue these restrictions.  It is not unknown to me that various categories of our people have suffered hardship and that there has been considerable disruption of trade.  It is also not unknown to me that there is still danger there, and I am not prepared to leave ourselves open to it any more than I have done up to the moment. We can only relax further as the passage of time and the information of the incidence of the disease in diminishing numbers indicates.  As soon as that time comes, it will be a pleasure to me to make these relaxations.  The House will appreciate that I have nothing to gain, whatever I may have to lose by these restrictions.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say in what circumstances he would be in a position to give the all clear signal? If there is no fresh outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain for x, y or z days, does it mean there will be an all clear from him within a week, two weeks or three weeks after that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we said earlier on, that the restrictions would continue until there was a clear three-week period from the last outbreak. However, since then some relaxations have been announced without our having waited for this clear three-week period.  The reason for this has been rather forced upon us by a measuring of the existing dangers still there; in other words, the risk we may be incurring and the accumulation, as it were, of hardship growing with the passage of time.  We have not been as clearcut as we were earlier because of the way in which the disease is inclined to smoulder, with no case one day, perhaps one case another day, and perhaps four cases another day.  This has changed our outlook.  We have not insisted on three clear weeks because of the impact this has on many people. We have had to weigh the disadvantages and the hardships against the diminishing risks, and there is still a risk.</P>

      <P>While there has been a welcome reduction recently in the incidence of foot and mouth disease in Britain the position is still such that the risk of the disease being introduced to this country remains, and constant vigilance by all concerned is essential.  Too hasty a withdrawal of the regulations which were designed to guard against the introduction or spread of the disease in this country would therefore be unwise.</P>
      <P>At a press conference on 25th January I was able to announce certain modifications in our regulations which I considered to be justified in present circumstances.  The possibility of further easements, including the easement of the regulations relating to the sale of livestock, is being kept under constant review having regard to day-by-day developments in Britain and appropriate action will be taken as soon as it is considered safe to do so.</P>

Even now Deputy Murphy's outline of what has been going on for the past 20 odd years does <Col N="261" /> not take into account that under the Free Trade Agreement a bullock became qualified in two months instead of three which is a very important consideration.  The second thing of significance in the Free Trade Agreement is that 25,000 tons of our meat get the subsidy that would have been paid in Britain and is brought back here to enable us to pay our producers. That is new and it applies also to some degree to lamb and mutton.  It has been a very useful thing for us and it will continue to be useful.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>When a decline in pig production seemed likely in 1966, steps were taken to stimulate output by the introduction of the Farrowed Sow Scheme, and later by increases in the guaranteed minimum prices for pigs.  As a result of measures taken by the Government and of the high level of pig prices for some time past it is expected that an upward movement in production will take place in the current year.  This expectation is supported by the June 1967 livestock census and a limited pig count carried out in September, 1967, both of which showed very significant increases in the number of sows and gilts-in-pig.  As regards the position in western counties the June 1967 livestock census showed that pig numbers in Connacht were higher than in June, 1966.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister explain the marked reduction in pig numbers which, according to the latest figures, was in the region of 180,000?  Is he not aware that it was the consensus of opinion on this side of the House that we should endeavour to encourage farmers, particularly smallholders, to get into the pig industry in order to supplement their ordinary incomes, and would he not agree that that policy has failed?  How <Col N="266" /> can we make it succeed?  There is an obligation on the Minister to devise some alternative means that will be acceptable because this would play a big part in the development of the western countries.</P>

In so far as what we can do to try to get them up is concerned, I have mentioned a few of the things we are doing and which are having some effect.  I also want to let the Deputy and the House know that in a particular way I am seeking to find out whether there are any means by which I can bring about a revival, to a much greater degree, of pig production in the western countries as a whole.  I should love to find the solution to this.</P>

      <P>Devaluation has not, so far, appeared to have had any marked effect on the general level of farm production costs.  While imported feed and fertiliser will be dearer, it is not possible at present to make any reliable assessment of the overall future effects of devaluation on farm costs generally because of the variety of factors involved, including the native content of farm inputs, the level of pre-devaluation stocks, normal fluctuations in world prices resulting from the supply-demand situation and the possibility of resort to cheaper sources of supply.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, devaluation should be of some benefit to agriculture by improving market prospects in certain countries which did not devalue their currencies and also possibly in Britain where our competitive position should be improved compared with other food exporting countries which have not devalued.  The whole situation is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the rates of grant at present available outside the pilot areas and Gaeltacht areas in the western counties under the Land Project and the Farm Buildings Scheme are reasonable.  The maximum grant payable under the Land Project is in fact higher in the western counties than in the rest of the country while many of my Department's other schemes are oriented in favour of small farms which, of course, are largely concentrated in these counties. As, no doubt, the Deputy is aware, I intend to introduce very shortly an incentive bonus scheme for the benefit of small farmers who are prepared to undertake the planned development of their holdings under the guidance of their agricultural advisory officers.</P>

      <P>The purpose of doing this in this way is quite sensible.  The scheme is a pilot area scheme to begin with and by its very name it shows that we are trying things out on a limited scale.  A parish in each of 12 counties was chosen originally to which we gave incentives of up to 50 per cent for various farm jobs and enterprises.  Now, after some years of experiencing how this small pilot area scheme was getting on, and of evaluating to some degree what was done and of what seemed capable of being done, the very wise step of extending it, not too rapidly, was taken.  This was done this year and it is the way to prove that what was done on a small scale will be capable of being done on a larger scale.  It will only be after some experience of this larger pilot area operation that we will be in a fair position to evaluate the total benefits or ills of any of the schemes which may have been operated there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="271" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that the fishing fleet fishing out of Cobh Harbour have to lie up unable to sell their catch; and if he will take steps to attach some luggers to the fleet to take fish to the British and continental markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no difficulties in transporting herrings to the British market.  As regards continental markets, it is the practice of the buyers or their agents to make their own arrangements for the transport by lugger of the herrings they purchase and it would not, therefore, be my function to provide for such transport.</P>
      <P>I am aware that boats recently landing herrings at Cobh were for a time operating on a self-imposed daily quota because some of the continental buyers had sent their luggers elsewhere for herring supplies.  This is one of the normal hazards of unexpected herring landings.  Heavy landings of herrings at Cobh have not been a feature in previous years and it is understandable that continental buyers could not have anticipated the availability of herrings there this year.  The fishermen concerned accept this position. Some additional luggers have, however, arrived at Cobh in the past few days and the fishermen have been able to relax their own restrictions on herring landings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 31 of those boats are only able to go out two or three days a week, due to the fact that they cannot sell their catch.  Over the six weeks up to date they have caught roughly 4,000 cran of herring per week for export.  They are being taken out by two Dutch luggers and a German one at £4 a cran which comes to £96,000 and if they could have turned out their full catch during those past six weeks, it would mean £100,000 or £150,000 more to them.  In view of the fact that Fisheries is the only Department in this country that has not given any increase in export during the past 12 months, would he not consider that the loss of £100,000 in export to those people over six weeks is a pretty heavy thing and there is every appearance of that continuing <Col N="272" /> for the next month or six weeks?  They have now discovered the best fishing in this country in Cork Harbour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I understood then was that some weeks ago the fishermen themselves not having an outlet for all that they might be able to catch, created a self-imposed restriction on the amount that each boat might land, of 75 cran or something per boat, and that this worked for some time&mdash;at least it kept things under control&mdash;and that two additional luggers then arrived and that this restriction was removed.  It would appear as if, though these have arrived in addition to the one that had been there which was inadequate&mdash;there are three now instead of one six weeks ago&mdash; there still is difficulty in the movement of herring catches.  I understand that there are in the south-east a couple of buyers who are boycotted in other waters and are being boycotted in this particular port who have orders which they have not filled and would be prepared to fill them from Cobh but this boycott applies to them there as well. I do not know whether it would solve all the problems or not if there was no boycott or whether the three luggers now available are sufficient or not.</P>

If Cobh is as good a fishery as Deputy Corry asserts it is, and I sincerely hope it is, then the suddenness with which this fishery began to produce will have made itself felt and buyers from abroad who might be going elsewhere seeking fish will come to where they know they are and will buy from them as they need them.</P>

We had it in Castletownbere, Passage and Cobh in addition to Dunmore East.  Surely the Minister will agree that the Department should take note of this position in view of the reasonably good price prevailing and help to find a market for the full catches of the fishermen.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that the site referred to was scheduled as open space in the approved layout for Walkinstown housing scheme, that approval was given subsequently to the provision, on the site, of a parochial hall and ancilliary buildings but that this project <Col N="287" /> did not proceed, that the ecclesiastical authorities have recently applied for portion of the site for a parochial house, that the corporation are at present examining the question of utilising the balance of the site and that they intend to clear and level it in the coming financial year.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities, in submitting proposals for any large housing scheme are required to make provision for essential community facilities.  It is not always practicable, however, to insist on such facilities being provided at the same time as the dwellings, because many interests may be involved.  Delay in providing urgently needed housing accommodation could result from such insistence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no avoidable delay in introducing it.</P>
      <P>While I have no wish to minimise the problems of Dublin housing, I find it hard to appreciate the basis for the Deputy's reference to a crisis.  I should perhaps remind him that in November, 1956, the Corporation in their Housing Review estimated their total housing need then at 17,950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass said we had too many houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corporation's approved waiting list now has 5,410 approved applicants on it and there are a further 4,662 applicants who have not yet been passed as eligible for re-housing by them.  The corporation's own assessment of their accumulated housing need is 8,518 dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interval between March, 1957, <Col N="289" /> and the present, the corporation have built or made available to tenants from their existing stock approximately 18,000 dwellings and have approved applications for a further 6,000 loans approximately, to help persons buy their own houses.  At 31st December, they had a further 6,191 houses under construction, in tender or at planning stage, in addition to 658 applications on hands for house purchase loans. These figures do not, of course, include the very substantial numbers of houses provided or being provided in the city and county by persons building or buying their own houses, with the aid of loans from building societies assurance companies, banks and other institutions.</P>
    <P>To enable the corporation to carry out their programme the Government have made available to them in the period from March, 1957, approximately £42 million for the construction of houses and for house-purchase loans and supplementary grants.  This sum includes the corporation's capital allocation in the current financial year of about £8.86 million approximately, or three times their expenditure on housing just over four years ago.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government provided £1.126 million last year to subsidise the rents of corporation houses. This sum is additional to the £1.164 million which the corporation themselves spent for the same purpose from the rates.  The total amount for subsidies in the current year will be substantially higher.</P>
    <P>Capital and housing subsidies are provided for other local authorities, to whom the Deputy refers, in the same way as for Dublin Corporation. In fact, the overall provision for housebuilding, loans and grants in the State capital budget in the current financial year is of the order of £25.63 million&mdash;or substantially more than has ever been provided by any Government for housing, as the Deputy will see by reference to the reply to Question No. 69.  In addition, the overall provision for rent subsidies for local authority housing in the current financial year is estimated to be of the order of £6.5 million, including £3.5 million <Col N="290" /> provided by the State and £3.0 million from the rates.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me add that with an estimated 11,700 private and local authority houses to be completed in this financial year, the Government are well on the way to achieving the target of 12,000 to 14,000 houses a year announced by them in 1964.</P>

    <P>(1)  The figures in column (2) comprise both private and local authority dwellings. They include an estimated 350-400 dwellings provided annually without the aid of grants or by conversion of existing dwellings.  Separate figures for flats are not available.</P>
    <P>(2)  The figures in column (3) represent total capital investment in the building, substantial improvement and reconstruction of dwellings, excluding site acquisition costs.  Separate figures for investment in <i>new</i> dwelling are not available; such <Col N="293" /><Col N="294" /> investment would comprise new-house loans made by building societies, assurance companies and local authorities, new-house grants and moneys raised by way of bank accommodation and by personal savings and deposits, etc.</P>
    <P>(3)  The figures in column (4) for house-purchase loans by local authorities include small amounts for the purchase of previously-occupied houses.</P>
    <P>(4)  The figures in column (6) comprise capital expenditure by the State on housing grants and by local authorities on their own housing and on house-purchase and reconstruction loans and supplementary grants.  For the years 1963/64 to 1967/68 inclusive, capital expenditure on housing&mdash;of about £1.0 million to £1.5 million a year&mdash;by the National Building Agency, Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. is also included. </P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware <Col N="297" /> of the unsatisfactory position of some 16 tenants who have houses built by the National Building Agency in Blarney, County Cork; if he is aware that the tenants have been in occupation of these houses as from June, 1966; that they applied for and were granted loans from the Cork County Council in August, 1966; that the County Council's solicitor wrote to the National Building Agency for registration of title in December, 1966, in January, 1967, in June, 1967, and in January, 1968, and that to date they are still awaiting title so as to pay the loans to the tenants who applied; and if he can take any steps to compel the National Building Agency to furnish title and to compensate these tenants who are still dependent on bridging loans from the banks.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the position regarding the houses provided by the National Building Agency at Blarney in 1966, which are being financed with the aid of loans from Cork County Council.  I understand from the Agency that their solicitors have now forwarded the necessary leases to the purchasers for completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in regard to the final apportionment? Through the negligence of the National Building Agency, those people have lost two years of their period of repayment. Who will repay them for that loss?  The council were ready to give them loans on the production of title. Will the Agency refund that money to those people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

These advances were made to meet capital expenditure on industrial housing pursuant to section 6 of the National Building Agency Ltd. Act, 1963.

Interest is paid in full on all such sums from the date advanced by the Exchequer and arrangements are subsequently made for the repayment of capital on an annuity basis.  In making advances the Minister for Finance has regard to the object of the Agency to provide housing in connection with industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands (a) the acreage now in the hands of the Land Commission in County Sligo for distribution, (b) when this land or lands will be allocated, (c) the number of farms offered to the Land Commission but not accepted and the reason why, (d) the number of farms reported to the Land Commission for acquisition in County Sligo in 1967 and the number acquired, and (e) whether the Land Commission office in Sligo has sufficient staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>Replies to the various parts of the Question are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  the area of arable lands on hands of the Land Commission in County Sligo at present is 900 acres.</P>
      <P>(b)  It is not possible to indicate when this land will be allotted but there will be no avoidable delay.  The necessary local enquiries preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.  During the last three complete financial years the aggregate area allotted in County Sligo was 3,200 acres&mdash;and it is expected that for the current year it may be possible to achieve a total allotment of some 1,200 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  During the financial year 1966-67, the number of holdings in County Sligo which were offered for sale to the Land Commission but were not <Col N="309" /> accepted was ten, comprising 270 acres. The determination of lands to be purchased is reserved exclusively to the Commissioners and decisions must necessarily be governed by the particular circumstances of individual cases. Generally it can be said that where properties which are offered for sale to the Land Commission are not accepted the main reason is that they are not considered suitable for land settlement purposes.  If the Deputy is interested in any particular property, I would suggest that he communicate direct with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>(d)  During the financial year 1966-67 the Land Commission had inspections made and reports obtained in respect of 32 properties in County Sligo containing upwards of 1,300 acres.  The total intake of land for the year was 1,000 acres comprising 39 properties.</P>
    <P>(e)  For organisational purposes Counties Sligo and Leitrim form one inspectorate area.  There are at present nine inspectors in the area and I hope that it will be possible to strengthen the staffing of the area in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of allottees is a matter exclusively reserved <Col N="310" /> to the Commissioners.  I have ascertained from the Land Commission that an application on behalf of the family referred to in the question was fully considered in competition with other applications received, but that it was found impracticable to provide them with an allotment, having regard to the numerous claims of the other competing applicants.</P>
      <P>In deciding as between applicants the Land Commission have to take a variety of items into account, but I would not wish to comment on or openly compare, across the floor of the House, the private affairs of individuals who might be easily recognisable.  I can say, however, that in the division of land&mdash;all other things being equal&mdash; preference is given by the Land Commission to married applicants who have families to support.</P>

More reliable figures in this regard will be available after the Act has been in operation for about six months.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>I must make it clear that all workers in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts are included in the main Redundancy Payments Scheme.  This has been done with the approval of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The reason for it is that, even amongst classes of workers for whom a special scheme may ultimately be introduced, there are substantial numbers of workers who can benefit under the main scheme.</P>
      <P>To date I have established two committees, consisting of representatives of workers and employers and representatives of my Department, to examine the feasibility of special redundancy schemes for building workers and dock workers.  The committee dealing with building workers met on seven occasions and the committee dealing with dock workers met twice, but no agreement has so far been reached on proposals for a special scheme in either case.</P>
      <P>I have received no request from either workers or employers to have a special scheme prepared for any other class of workers.  I would, of course, be prepared to consider such a request if it were made to me.</P>

      <P>Ireland is one of the countries where, under the new United States programme, investment will be permitted at 65 per cent of the average level in 1965-66.  The United States <Col N="318" /> authorities have indicated that projects involving an annual investment of less than $100,000 will not be affected and that special consideration will be given to problems arising in relation to work already in progress and to commitments under binding contracts.  It will also be possible for United States firms contemplating investment here to use funds raised outside the United States. I am hopeful, therefore, that the programme will not have any significant retarding effect on the expansion of our economy.</P>

Appropriate representations are being made to the United States Government with a view to confining to a minimum any adverse effects such restrictions may have on Ireland's income from tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wholesalers who are accountable for wholesale tax are chargeble at the rate of 5 per cent on their receipts from wholesale sales. The tax is levied on the total amount received, including any additions to prices made for tax; and the wholesaler would, therefore, have to increase his pre-tax prices by approximately 5¼ per cent to recoup him for his tax liability.  The increase may be passed on to the retailer as part of the price charged; and, subject to the price <Col N="322" /> control arrangements, the retailer may adjust his prices to recover his increased costs.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any excessive price increases which are attributable to wholesale tax.  If the Deputy has evidence of any such increase he should bring it to the attention of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the way the question is framed, I think it is well to point out that the Moy drainage scheme is being carried out primarily for the benefit of the farmers concerned and that it has brought a great improvement to the lands affected. Inevitably some damage to riparian land has resulted from the deposition of spoil, etc., and all such claims are investigated and compensation is paid where genuine loss can be proved. Many such claims have already been settled but there are about 200 still outstanding and they will be dealt with in due course.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that conditions are as represented by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Camlin river is the main river of the Longford catchment area and could be dealt with by the Commissioners of Public Works only by means of a comprehensive drainage scheme for that catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The Longford catchment is listed for treatment under that Act but present commitments and the extent of the drainage problem throughout the country make it impossible for me to say when it will be reached.  The Shannon navigation installations do not affect the levels of the Camlin River at Longford town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware there was grave flooding there recently?  Shops and houses in the town of Longford were flooded with sewage, due to the fact that this river backed up.  Is he aware that a few years ago when the sluice gates were broken down by the flooding the flooding itself went down at the rate of an inch a minute and that at one time where acres are now flooded people used to have meadows and tillage?  Surely somebody must be responsible for the present situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not suggest to the Board of Works that the sluice gates be lowered?  As I said, when they were washed away previously, the flood <Col N="333" /> went down immediately but later the gates were replaced.  Eighty per cent of these people affected in Longford are real small farmers.  Surely they are entitled to better treatment than this? They will have to pay their rates at the end of March.</P>

I understand that the latter provision is operative at present.  The public refreshment room is open to all persons, including legal practitioners, who are in attendance at the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>The arrangement made by the contractor is based on competitive tenders sought in the public press by the Commissioners of Public Works for a letting of the public refreshment room and ancillary accommodation. No subsidy is paid or payable, and I have no information as to the profitability or otherwise of the undertaking, or of any portion thereof.

      <P>As on 26th January, 1968, charges had been preferred in courts in Donegal against 80 persons for breaches of the regulations, of whom 45 were convicted.  The total amount of the fines imposed was £162 5s. 0d., of which £89 10s. had been paid by 26th January.</P>
      <P>The Garda have reason to believe that breaches of the regulations were committed in Donegal by 15 other persons who were not prosecuted because they had left the jurisdiction before they could be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there were two cases in County Donegal of a kind that also arose in other parts of the country&mdash; they involved school children in England&mdash;where there was reason to believe a technical offence was committed but in relation to which the Attorney General had given a general <Col N="336" /> direction that prosecutions could not be justified because those concerned had reasonably believed, from the terms of an official press release, that they were exempt under the regulations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that bus-stops at Infirmary Road near the Victoria Hospital and Blind Asylum in Cork in close proximity to a pedestrian crossing are dangerous and are the cause of much delay to traffic inwards at peak hours; and if he will take steps to have the bus stops re-sited.</P>

      <P>A chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána, being an authorised officer under the Road Traffic Act, is the person whose duty it is to decide whether a particular bus stop is an undue hazard or obstruction to other traffic.</P>
      <P>The chief superintendent in Cork does not regard the location of the bus stop in question as an ideal one, but the same can be said for many other bus stops and a compromise has to be accepted between the need to cater for the convenience of bus passengers on the one hand and the possible effect on other traffic on the other hand.</P>
      <P>However, a review of the position has to be undertaken as a result of recent changes in traffic flow in the area and it is possible that this bus stop may be changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his Department have informed the ESB that contractor meter readers will not be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts; and if in view of the grave hardship involved he will take the necessary steps to have this decision withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will reconsider his Department's ruling that employment of ESB meter readers is not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>A question as to the insurability under the Social Welfare Acts of the employment of persons by the ESB as part-time meter readers was raised some months ago, the contention being that they were independent contractors and, accordingly, not employed under a contract of service.  Following inquiries, a deciding officer recently decided that the employment was not insurable but one of the meter readers concerned has appealed against that decision.  When the formalities relating to the appeal have been completed, the case will be referred to an appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the decision of the appeals officer in the case may be interpreted as affecting all other meter readers similarly employed, it will be open to any meter reader involved to request <Col N="343" /> a decision in his case and, if dissatisfied, to appeal against it.</P>
    <P>Appeals officers and deciding officers are statutory officers appointed in accordance with sections 41 and 43 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to decide, <i>inter alia,</i> questions as to whether an employment is insurable under the Acts.  I have no power to interfere with their decisions but any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of an appeals officer may appeal against it to the High Court but only on a question of law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> Is there any provision in the Act that the Minister will take the action so that the expense will not be put on the applicant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. It is open to the aggrieved person to appeal to the court on a question of law.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> Is there not provision in the Act for the Minister to take proceedings, so as to avoid putting the expense of the proceedings on the applicant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have that examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if there was a request from somebody to have this investigated, or did the initiative come from his Department? Is he aware that over the years since these people have been stamping their cards, a peculiar position has arisen.  A number of them have drawn benefit, but quite a number of them have being paying contributions over the years and have drawn no benefit; now when they would be entitled to old age pensions or some other benefits, they have been deprived of them because a test case, apparently, was taken by the Department.  Would the Minister say if he considers this is a fair way of dealing with something like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear this has been going on between my Department and the ESB for some time, taking each case on its merits. <Col N="344" /> The insurability of particular employees is laid down in the Schedule to the 1952 Act, and, as far as I see, each case would be dealt with on its merits, because the duration of the employment, the question of its permanency, the question of a contract of service, these are the things which actually determine whether a person is insurable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the ESB have notified all the employees, that is, contractor meter readers, that as from 1st January, they will no longer have their insurance cards stamped?  This is as a result of a decision given by an inspector of the Department of Social Welfare.  In the circumstances, would the Minister have the matter investigated, because it does appear as if, on one case, a decision relating to all these employees is being made, not as the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say the ESB notified all the employees. They may have notified all their temporary meter readers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>All the employees referred to in my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those meter readers who are employed in a temporary capacity, not under a contract of service, because it is defined in the schedule to the Act what an insurable person is.  In this case the deciding officer decided that a particular person was not insurable.  He was actually an applicant under the Occupational Injuries Act.  He has appealed and we are taking this decision as a test case. I think this is quite a good basis for any further decisions that may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, would the Minister ensure that the ESB will continue to stamp the cards of the employees I have referred to in the question until the final decision is given.  Surely that is a reasonable request. Otherwise it will mean that the stamping of the card will have stopped and there will have to be a fresh application and a fresh appeal made by each individual employee with consequent <Col N="345" /> upset to both the Department and the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather consider it necessary only to suspend, until this case is decided, any decision on the application for a refund made by the ESB in respect of contributions made.  The question of stamping cards is only a matter of a few weeks.  They could be stamped in arrears if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If these people are out of benefit now, it could affect them at a later date.  Could the Minister say why the ESB should send out a circular to employees informing them that their cards will not be stamped if, as the Minister says, the matter has not been finally decided?  I can give a copy of the circular to the Minister if he wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is finally decided as far as we are concerned until the appeal is allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They can stamp cards as much as they like until they want some benefit, and then they are not entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that students travelling by CIE who were in an age bracket 16 to 19 years have had this age bracket for the reduction in fares abolished and are now included <Col N="346" /> in a higher-priced age bracket from 16 to 21 years; and whether he is further aware of the deterring effect of these increases on students wishing to pursue secondary education; and whether he will provide the necessary funds to ensure that the transport costs of these students will not be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the alterations to CIE's fare structure which were effected from 1st January, 1968, involved a considerable increase in the season ticket charges for school-children, but I have no function in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the company has decided to modify the impact of these alterations and to reduce student season-ticket fares as from Monday next, 5th February.</P>
      <P>Students in the 16-19 age bracket will now pay approximately three-fifths of the adult fare.</P>
      <P>The transport scheme being operated under the aegis of my Department ensures that every eligible child living three miles or more from the nearest post-primary centre is provided with free transport to that centre.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that some pupils of their own volition travel to centres other than the one nearest to their homes.  I could not accept any responsibility for the travelling expenses of such pupils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that in relation to a school (details supplied) CIE has engaged a taxi firm to provide transport in substitution for a similar entirely satisfactory service which was provided for years by another taxi group, without giving that group any opportunity to tender for the continuation of the service; and if he will have steps taken to restore the operation of the services to the taxi group which gave every satisfaction in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The day to day administration of school transport services has been assigned to Córas Iompair Éireann.  Accordingly, my Department has no connection with <Col N="347" /> the selection of contractors for these services.  I understand, however, that the present contract for the service in question was placed by CIE on the basis of the lowest tender which had been received by the manager of the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that. As the Deputy is aware, we have the county meetings initially at first, and perhaps two or three times more and then the final meeting and an outline of what the Department consider should take place in a certain educational authority is expressed by my representative there.  The local educational interests express their views and may indeed go against what we in Dublin might feel.  They have the local pulse and information and knowledge, and they may put up quite sensible counter suggestions.  We would then submit further proposals.  To answer the question, in the final analysis, I would have knowledge of this.  The manner in which this was done was unfortunate, I agree.  It would have been better if there had been some consultation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final analysis, I would certainly be prepared to consider any such appeals.  It is only fair to say I would be very loath to change these decisions because, in the main, these people have local knowledge. There are instances where possibly appeals might be necessary.  In that case I would be quite prepared to consider any appeals.</P>

The Government have already provided valuable facilities to encourage the establishment and development of industries in all areas.  It is for private enterprise to take advantage of these facilities and local interests should do their best to encourage private enterprise to set up industries in their own areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Only two factories were in production on the Waterford Industrial Estate on 31st December, 1967.  Therefore to give the number of persons in insurable employment on the estate on that date would, in effect, be to give information about employment in individual firms.  It is not the practice to do this.  It is estimated that when the estate is fully developed, employment will be provided <Col N="359" /> there for some 2,000 persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously told the Deputy, I am keeping in close touch with Potez Aerospace Ltd. in regard to making its facilities at Baldonnel available for sub-contracting work for manufacture of aircraft components. Since sub-contract work commenced, employment at the factory has increased substantially and the company has successfully completed initial contracts.  I am not in a position to say anything further in the matter at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility of aeroplanes being made there but it seems to me that in the short term, the prospects lie in the sub-contracting field.  Employment which in the early stages of last year was 40, at the end of the year, was 150 and should increase fairly substantially from that figure in the coming year, if everything goes according to plan.</P>

      <P>I can only go by the number of complaints, but I think the number escaping the net is small as far as I can see.  The Deputy will be aware that we issue regularly lists of items on which increases have been <Col N="369" /> authorised.  If people have been making increases in prices that have not been authorised, it is relatively easy for the shopkeepers to check on this and report to the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the date on which a bridge order was made in respect of the bridge linking Haulbowline Island with the mainland; the date on which construction of the bridge commenced; the date on which is was completed; and the total amount involved in the construction of the bridge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy in referring to a bridge order has in mind an order made by the Minister for local Government under the Local Government Act, 1946.  The question of such an order did not arise in respect of the bridge linking Haulbowline Island with the mainland since no part of the bridge is on public property.</P>
      <P>The construction of the bridge is regarded as having commenced during the last week of September, 1964, when the preliminary work on the site was put in hands.  The bridge was completed ready for traffic, on 21st July 1966.</P>
      <P>The total amount involved in the construction of the bridge, including all the necessary ancillary works, was £318,842.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that at times during the winter months the demand for admission of children to Dublin hospitals is liable to rise and so cause difficulty in meeting requests for admission. I do not accept the suggestion in the Deputy's question that the need generally in Dublin for in-patient treatment of children is of such proportions that it is necessary to increase substantially the accommodation for children in the City hospitals.  The more reasonable approach to the problem, and it is the one I am pursuing, is to secure more effective use of the diagnostic and treatment facilities which are available, both out-patient and in-patient.  The short-stay hospitals generally have been asked to study ways of improving their capability of dealing with the growing demand for consultant care in the light of an analysis of the position which had been made in my Department.  In relation specifically to children's accommodation in Dublin a census of long-stay patients was taken in December and it is hoped when the results have been studied, to arrive at a better integrated organisation of the care of such patients with consequential improvement in the availability of accommodation in short-stay acute hospitals.  In association with the Irish Medical Association a detailed study is being undertaken shortly of the out-patient service in the Dublin hospitals including the children's hospitals.  This should provide the basis for an improvement in the arrangements for out-patient services and contribute to an easement of the demand for in-patient care.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's request for information on children's accommodation and occupancy in the different hospitals, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate the statistics with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the source, nature and extent of the obligation on maternity hospitals to care for infants and, in particular, the position in relation to a young infant who becomes ill subsequent to release from the maternity hospital, but within six weeks from birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 of the Health Act, 1953, provides that health authorities shall make available medical, surgical, hospital, specialist and nursing services for infants up to the age of six weeks whose mothers are eligible for services under the Act.  The relevant regulations, that is, the Maternity and Child Health Services Regulations, 1954 and 1964, specify that hospital services in such cases may be provided by the health authority either in their own hospitals or in those operated by other authorities with whom they have made arrangements.</P>
      <P>Maternity hospitals provide care for the infants born in these hospitals and also for the mothers.  If an infant should become ill while in the hospital the necessary treatment would be provided there or in a children's or other appropriate hospital.  Two of the Dublin voluntary maternity hospitals also operate regular arrangements for a home care service given by hospital nurses for city mothers and their infants following their discharge from hospital.</P>
      <P>In the particular situation of an infant who falls ill following discharge from a maternity hospital and requires treatment in hospital it is a matter for medical judgement in each case as to the particular hospital which would be appropriate to deal with the case. Some maternity hospitals have special units to which sick infants recently discharged might safely be admitted for treatment.  Owing to the risk of the introduction of infection other maternity hospitals and units do not re-admit infants who have been discharged and in such cases the sick infant should be referred to a children's, infectious diseases or other appropriate hospital.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in fact, there is considerable difficulty in getting an infant under six weeks of age into a hospital if the child has left the maternity home? There have been many cases in which the home medical adviser has been unable to get such a child who is critically ill into hospital because the hospitals maintain that it is the responsibility of the maternity home until the child is six weeks old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any contribution is made from public funds to voluntary hospitals in relation to the provision of taxi services for patients; if so, whether such hospitals are obliged to invite tenders for the provision of such services; and, if not, if he will impose such an obligation in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants are paid from the Hospitals Trust Fund to voluntary hospitals in recoupment of their revenue deficits.  These grants are based on accounts submitted to and examined by the Hospitals Commission. I understand that the expenditure included in these accounts in respect of taxi services for patients is very small, and I do not consider that the matter calls for intervention by me or in the matter indicated in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as a general principle where public funds are involved that tenders <Col N="378" /> be invited from people who are in a position to provide the service?  If the Minister agrees with this principle, how can be defend the practice which has arisen in some hospitals of not putting out for tender taxi and transport services and, in fact, of giving preferential treatment to particular firms without inviting others to tender at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it depends on the size.  The figures given here are £358 a year for Crumlin Children's Hospital, £140 for Cappagh, £280 for Temple Street and £382 for the Eye and Ear Hospital.  It is hardly worth mentioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Minister confined his reply only to those hospitals?  I was not dealing only with children's hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It says here that the cost of taxi services is not shown separately in the accounts furnished to the Hospitals Commission.  Telephone inquiries made by the Commission to a few of the larger Dublin hospitals show that the amount spent on the transport of patients by taxis is a very insignificant part of the total expenditure, and then it gives those four examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inquire into the position?  A Dublin hospital has a taxi rank immediately outside it.  If the staff are unable to get a car from the firm which has been chosen by the Board of the hospital, they send a message to the rank outside or telephone it.  On many occasions the taximen have offered services and transported people and then on presenting their bill, have been told that it would not be paid as they were not of the firm with whom the contract existed, or with whom an arrangement existed.  Surely that is the kind of thing that should not be encouraged where public funds are involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a taximan said to me in New York once &ldquo;Sue them for it&rdquo;.  Surely the taximen must be paid.  They were refused payment by the hospital?</P>

      <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners are shortly to announce a competition for a number of permanent dispensary doctor appointments including a permanent appointment for the vacant dispensary post at Nobber.</P>

    <P>A general practitioner service for <Col N="380" /> patients in the Nobber District is being provided by the doctor from an adjoining dispensary district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will remember that this matter was raised on a number of occasions last year.  A deputation from Nobber visited him with a view to impressing on him the necessity of having a doctor appointed.  I am aware that it is not easy to get a doctor there for some extraordinary reason but what I want to know is; a promise was made apparently that the restriction which is applied to filling vacancies, that is that they are confined to existing dispensary doctors, was to be removed in this case. An advertisement bearing this was to be inserted in the newspapers some time last October or November.  I should like to know if in fact that was done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, yes.  This is an open competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that that advertisement never appeared, despite the fact that the Minister and his officials promised that it would and that the result is that no effort was made to implement an arrangement which would have in my opinion, solved the problem.  As far as the neighbouring dispensary supplying the service is concerned, is the Minister aware that the lady who is doing the dispensary service has more than enough to do in that dispensary and that the position down there is becoming impossible?  The fact that there is no dispensary doctor here over the year seems to be a little bit odd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the term &ldquo;non-nursing personnel&rdquo; relates to the various wage-earning grades such as porters, attendants, domestics, caretakers, boilermen and so on. Traditionally, the wages and hours of work of these grades are related to the conditions obtaining locally in similar employments and health authorities may decide these matters without my specific approval.  For this reason particulars of local wage rates and hours of work are not normally furnished to my Department, and I do not consider that the assembly of such a large and complex return would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that when some local authorities recently indicated that they proposed to raise wage rates to rates which they considered to be the local rate the Minister's Department refused to sanction such increases?  If the <Col N="382" /> Minister says that he has no responsibility or nothing to do with the increases and that it is a matter for the local authority, would that be indicated to the county managers so that this matter will not arise again.  It is very difficult to find out what the local rates are but when local rates are decided on and notified to the Department they have indicated that they would not be prepared to agree to granting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Donegan</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will introduce legislation to amend section 15 (2) of the Health Act, 1953 so that (1) yearly means of a married person be taken to be one-half of the amount remaining after deducting from the sum of yearly means of the person and spouse an allowance for each dependent child of such person or of the spouse equal to the current tax-free child allowance and (2) where the yearly means of a person are derived wholly or mainly from farming, the yearly means shall be deemed to be twelve hundred pounds where the rateable valuation of the farm or farms and buildings is £60, this criterion to be applied proportionately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to sponsor an amendment of section 15 of the Health Act, 1953 on the lines suggested by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Under existing legislation, approximately 90 per cent of the population are automatically entitled to hospital and specialist services under the section in question while, in addition, health authorities have power, in their discretion, to provide such services for persons not so entitled in cases where undue hardship would otherwise occur.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I consider that it would be quite unreasonable to contemplate and extension of these services, as suggested by the Deputies, to include, for example, married couples, with no children, having an income of almost £2,400 a year and farmers, in similar marital circumstances, with valuations of £120.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the question is concerned primarily with those who nominally may have a large income but who have a large number of dependent children who naturally make considerable in-roads in that income and having regard to the Government's acknowledgment that it would be desirable to fix certain limits, will the Minister consider this proposal whenever he introduces comprehensive legislation dealing with health matters?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to his question of 28th November last.</P>
      <P>The consultations referred to, on which the details of some parts of the legislation will depend, are not expected to be completed for some little time yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give a guarantee that the immense necessity to reform the health services and the system of financing them will not be postponed to facilitate the Government's spurious effort to interfere with the electoral laws?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might confine himself to health matters when he is raising supplementary questions about this very important matter.  It seems the Deputy is incapable of dealing with anything without dragging politics into it.  I gave an undertaking that I would re-examine the entire structure of the financing of the health services during the course of this year. I intend to honour that undertaking, no matter how much Deputy Ryan may try to make things difficult for me, including issuing public statements in which he discloses information which he was given privately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The County Wexford Health Authority are not yet in a position to provide dentures for all the people who are entitled to such a service because of a shortage of dental staff.  The health authority have of necessity to allocate the major portion of available dental resources to the treatment of school children and preference is then given in the provision of dentures to certain people in the lower income group who on medical grounds are entitled to priority treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the three wholetime dental surgeon posts approved for County Wexford is still vacant and the Local Appointments Commissioners were unable to recommend a candidate for the post from a recent competition <Col N="390" /> held by them.  Until sufficient dental personnel are available it will not be possible to provide a denture service for all eligible adults in the lower income group in County Wexford.  A limited denture service is being provided at present for certain people in the lower income group who, on medical grounds, are entitled to priority treatment.</P>
    <P>I have recently reviewed the conditions of service of public dental officers and as a result of my review the conditions have been further improved. I am hopeful that the new conditions will attract suitable candidates for the vacant posts in the public dental service.  A fresh competition, under the new conditions, will be held by the Local Appointments Commissioners shortly and I hope that the Wexford post will be filled as a result of this competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question of restrictive measures in relation to smoking in public places, the policy to date has been to rely on education and persuasion rather than compulsion and prohibition.  As I have already announced, I intend bringing more and more to public notice the health hazards from cigarette smoking. I am also considering general policy and in the meantime commend the good sense of theatre owners who apply a no-smoking rule during performances, and I would like to see not only cinemas and stores, to which the Deputy refers, but restaurants, food premises and other establishments following this good example.</P>
      <P>On the question of restriction of advertising, certain restrictions on advertising cigarettes were in fact agreed with the manufacturers in 1964. A code of standards in relation to all such advertising was drawn up at that time.  I am considering further restrictions in connection with my decision to intensify the campaign against smoking.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider having a regulation made that any advertising of cigarettes or packets of cigarettes should contain a warning as to the danger involved in cigarettes smoking?  Particularly in view of the way that cigarette advertising is used on television, would he consider it necessary that something should be done to counteract it?  It might have the desired effect if there were a warning as to the danger of cigarette smoking.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the numbers of permanent farm employees, temporary farm employees and tractors for each rural district are not available for June, 1967 as the agricultural enumeration for that year was carried out on a sample basis covering approximately 60 per cent of district electoral divisions.  Estimates have however been prepared for each county and are given in reply to the previous question.</P>
      <P>Particulars at the rural districts level are available only when a full enumeration covering all holdings is carried out.  It is expected that the next such enumeration will be in June, 1970.</P>

      <P>The regulations made by me so far under section 57 of the Redundancy Payment Act, 1967, do not enable officers of my Department to require employers to prepare and keep records. Experience of the operation of the Act will show whether such a provision is necessary.</P>
