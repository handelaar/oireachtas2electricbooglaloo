    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of his recent reported statement in New York following his meeting with the Rumanian Foreign Minister relating to Irish relations with eastern European countries, Ireland will now proceed to formalise her trading relations by protocol agreements and by other means as advised by the Irish Exporters Association to correct the export-import imbalance with those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of developing exports to East European countries is under active consideration in the appropriate Government Departments. If it emerges from this examination that trade agreements would be likely to secure any substantial increase in our exports to these countries, the Government would be prepared to consider entering into negotiations with them.</P>
      <P>So far as the establishment of formal diplomatic representation in these countries is concerned, the position is as stated by the Minister for External Affairs on 22nd February, 1968, in reply to a question in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach explain why our trade with eastern European countries shows a <Col N="1214" /> very sharp adverse balance?  How is it that we cannot get these people to buy as much from us as we buy from them? The trade is very much against us and can that position be rectified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The great bulk of our imports from these countries are certain primary products which we find it to our advantage to import in order to ensure that manufacturers and others who use these products can be competitive.  On the other hand, we find it very difficult to get these countries to take the kind of goods we have to export to them.  That is one of the matters that is under continuing examination by the appropriate Government Departments and also by the Foreign Trade Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is his intention to meet representatives of the other neutral countries who have indicated an interest in participating in the EEC, to ensure that in common with such countries Ireland may ensure her neutrality in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, besides Ireland, only three countries which have applied for membership of the European Economic Community and these are members of the North <Col N="1215" /> Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  I see no useful purpose to be served by attempting to co-ordinate policy with States which have not applied for EEC membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not an interest in the EEC in such countries as Switzerland, Sweden and Finland and should we not therefore, since we hold it as part of our policy to be militarily neutral, consult with them to see how we can preserve our neutral stance?  Would it not be wise to meet them to see what can be done to maintain neutrality in any united Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interest in countries like Switzerland and Sweden in the EEC but, unlike us, they have not applied for full membership. We have, and as full members we would have a full say in the development of political policy and they would not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Each of the research projects to which the Deputy refers is undertaken by the professor concerned in the field of his own studies.  The results are offered for circulation in open scientific literature.  They do not in any way affect our attitude to proposals put forward in the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that our posture in the world as an honest broker of peace is a sham when we have university colleges under military contracts to one of the big military powers?  Is it not rather ridiculous when we are proposing peace resolutions that we should be in this position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a completely wrong estimate of the present situation.  It does not require any help from us to enable the great powers to destroy half or even the whole world. To a large measure now the concentration is upon getting protection from these terrible weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that universities take funds from various organisations that want a piece of research carried out, and, as I said, the concern of most governments is to get protection and not to employ these terrible weapons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he has noted the deteriorating condition of <Col N="1217" /> the Nigerian-Biafra conflict; and if he will make a statement relative to the safety of Irish nationals and their property in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only too well aware of the situation in Nigeria and am most anxious that a cease-fire should be arranged as quickly as possible and with a view to the negotiation of a stable peace.  I am glad to note that in the last few days there have been reports that Mr. Smith, the Secretary General of the British Commonwealth, who brought the parties to the talks in Kampala is busily engaged in exploring ways to bring the two sides back to the conference table.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of our Irish nationals in Nigeria&mdash;almost all of whom are missionaries&mdash;remaining in the Eastern Region, the Deputy will be aware from previous statements and, in particular, from my statement of 22nd May that we have done everything possible to look after the welfare of Irish people in all parts of Nigeria since the crisis began.  In May, 1967, when the situation seriously deteriorated we sent the secretary of the embassy in Lagos to the Eastern Region to make contact with the 600, or so, Irish citizens in that region and to assist those of them who might wish to leave.  He stayed there continuously for several months after the outbreak of hostilities and left only when all Irish citizens who wished to return home had left the area.  He was the last diplomatic officer to leave the area.</P>
      <P>The property of some Irish citizens was damaged during the conflict but we have no details as to the amount of the damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, as the Deputy is aware, an ambassador in Lagos.  I suppose he might ask for permission to visit the area in which the conflict is still threatening, but he might be refused permission.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that if we have an official representative in a country, one of his functions is to protect nationals as far as possible?  Would the Minister not give a direction to our ambassador in Lagos that he should ascertain the up-to-date position with regard to Irish nationals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is his duty to do so as far as possible&mdash;as the Deputy put it.  Within the bounds of possibility we have, in fact, done everything to protect Irish nationals in all parts of Nigeria and, thank God, none has been killed, although this war has been going on now for over a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions with the interests concerned have been taking place throughout the year regarding intake and drying facilities for wheat next harvest.  I am satisfied that all possible steps are being taken to ensure that intake will be completed smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state if there are any extra facilities this year as compared with last year?  He will, no doubt, appreciate that the crop has considerably increased this year as against last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we understand at the moment&mdash;this is subject to final evaluation&mdash;the increase will be in the order of 18 or 19 per cent. This could possibly throw up on the basis of last year's yield anything up to 50,000 additional tons of wheat.  As against that, the number of drying points that will be open, according to our present arrangements, will be 93 as against 58 at the start of last season. The drying capacity will, therefore, be increased by about 407 tons, I think it is, per hour and I feel that this, added to the fact that an additional 54,000 tons storage capacity has been provided as against last year, enables us to approach the coming greater wheat harvest with a fairly good prospect that it will be handled in a fairly smooth manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate if he is hopeful that this extra storage and these drying facilities will be available in time because, and I say this in no spirit of criticism but as a matter of fact, it does seem difficult to foresee how they can all be ready by 1st September?  It takes time to build and time to instal machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite well aware of that, but I think the Deputy and the House are probably aware that we started last season with 58 drying points open but later quite a number of extra drying points were brought into operation.  At the moment there are additional drying points in existence and these, added to what were in use last year, will bring the total number of drying points to 93.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if any progress is being made to overcome the backlog of housing requirements in this country; and, if so, when such backlog will be eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy or anybody else to think that the &ldquo;backlog of housing requirements&rdquo; is a static figure which can be reduced or eradicated simply by building a given number of houses.  The demand for houses is dynamic and, as experience here and elsewhere shows, the greater the degree of development within an economy the greater generally is the demand for houses&mdash;resulting from obsolescence of the fabric of the buildings, increases in the number of households, and the rise in standards which ensures that houses acceptable in one generation are regarded as substandard in the next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was for this reason that the Government's current housing objectives <Col N="1225" /> were not expressed as being the construction of a given number of houses to eradicate a backlog.  They were expressed as the approximate doubling of output to a level of 12,000 to 14,000 houses a year, between 1964, when the objectives were published, and 1970.  In the last financial year, 12,017 houses were, in fact, produced and output in the current financial year is expected to be of the order of 13,000 houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the backlog of houses is not being reduced in any way by the Government's programme and, for that reason, would he not consider the need for a greater expansion of housing, not only in the city of Dublin but over the whole country&mdash;every-where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this is not a question of a backlog.  It is a question of a continuous generation of new demand. The target that was set by the Government for 1970 has already been reached and, as I have pointed out to the Deputy, is being expanded in the present year.  It is obvious that the amount of housing activity that can take place in any particular year depends on the level of economic activity in the country as a whole.</P>

As regards the final part, the purpose of Civil Defence is to mitigate as far as possible the effects on this country of warlike weapons, including nuclear ones, which might be used in a future war; Civil Defence activities by my Department include the overall planning and direction of Civil Defence, the provision of equipment, particularly radiac instruments, and the operation of a Civil Defence School; activities by local authorities include the recruiting and training of <Col N="1231" /> volunteers and the preparation and development of Civil Defence schemes for their areas.</P>

      <P>Ireland's subscription to the IMF is 80 million dollars of which a total of 45 million dollars approximately has now been paid in gold and foreign currencies.  This part of the subscription may be described as our investment in the Fund as it is the amount that can be drawn virtually on demand and without interest charge.  The balance of the subscription has been paid in Irish currency and is held by the Central Bank as agent for the Fund.</P>
      <P>In January, 1966, Ireland purchased from the Fund for Irish currency, foreign currencies to the value of 22.5 million dollars.  The Irish currency in question has since been repurchased. These transactions were in the nature of a borrowing and repayment of 22.5 million dollars.</P>

      <P>The accounts of the Central Bank for 1967-68 which were presented to the Dáil yesterday show that the Legal Tender Note Fund held gold valued £3,097,699 at 31st March, 1968.  The balance sheet of the General Fund includes an amount of £10,879,251 under the heading &ldquo;Other assets&rdquo; and I understand that these assets consist mainly of gold.</P>
      <P>As regards the effect of the devaluation of 18th November, 1967 on this country's reserves, there was an increase in terms of Irish currency of one-sixth in the value of gold and of dollar balances and securities held by the Central Bank.  There was no change in terms of Irish currency in the value of sterling reserves.</P>

The balance is due to the fact that in the early part of last year, issues for supply services to the Pay-master-General's Supply Account were less than the actual expenditures on these services because the Account had the temporary use of funds which were awaiting application in redemption of debt.</P>

      <P>We discussed all this in the debate on the Bill in this House in recent weeks.  Every time the Government bring in progressive measures of this kind this arises.  A start has to be made and a start is being made from this year on.  As I have mentioned in reply to the question, a substantial amount of money, £1 million, would be involved in making this retrospective.  There is the added social injustice that would arise in regard to the boys and girls who <Col N="1249" /> did not go to university over the past few years because they could not afford it.  What is being suggested is that we should extend the scheme so as to subsidise the boys and girls whose parents could afford to make the initial decision to send them to university.  If we were to extend the scheme to the boys and girls who could not afford to go, the cost would be far more than £1 million.</P>

      <P>Because of the non-application of these grants to the training colleges and the number of trainee teachers who will now be in a position to avail of a university education, is it intended to have a new scheme of grants which will enable them to go to the university?  Otherwise, the standard of the teachers will naturally be low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is that economic circumstances forced many people into teacher training.  The standard has been in the region of 5.3 honours per person, more than twice the standard in every other European country.  Due to the economic circumstances boys and girls were forced into teacher training who otherwise would have gone on to the university. They will now be able to go on to the university under our higher grants scheme.  The future of the teacher training colleges is wrapped up in the proposals for higher education which we will be announcing shortly.  It is proposed to integrate the training colleges with the university system and that there will be a type of degree as a teaching qualification.  This problem will not arise from September 12 months.  We hope that the curriculum will be devised before that.  The fees for a girl trainee are £100 per year and for a male trainee £105.  There is a substantial contribution of £300 which is paid by the State.  This figure of £105 covers everything in regard to training, the college and the digs.  We <Col N="1251" /> must remember that a girl gets £100 and a boy £105.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I reported progress in this debate, much has happened. Deputy Cosgrave declared that he is, after all, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and that he intends to remain so.  Indeed, on the last day I urged him to speak out, and I do so again.  I believe that the public are entitled to know what the Leader of the Fine Gael Party thinks of PR and the multi-seat system.  They would like to know whether he has changed his mind and now favours the retention of PR, or whether he still believes in the superiority of the single-seat straight vote method.  He is the only Party Leader who has failed to make known his views to this House on this important issue.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand how he can claim to be the Leader of a Party and refuse to speak, and refuse to lead.  Leading a Party consists of more than running the Party machine. Behind a Party stand the people who support it.  They have the right to know the Leader's views, where he stands, what he stands for, and what he believes in.  Is it morally correct for the Leader of the Fine Gael Party to mislead the public by remaining silent?  In this Bill before us we have a most important issue.  If he finds that his private conscience clashes with Party policy, he must choose.  Heretofore, whatever faults may have been laid at his door, his integrity has never been questioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in this House, and outside it, that he regarded single seats as the more important aspect of the Fourth Amendment and that the method of voting was of lesser importance.  To substantiate what I say, I should like to quote what he said on 11th June, 1968, as reported at column 863 of the Official Report.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I think this principle of establishing one man one vote is important also, while I fully agree with Deputy Norton that, important though it is, the importance of getting rid of the evils of multi-member constituencies and getting the advantages of single-seat constituencies is greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is just one example of the numerous occasions on which the Minister made it clear where he stood. On this, at least, the Minister and I are in full agreement.  I stated that I believed the public are ready and willing to accept the single-seat constituencies but at present I do not believe they are prepared to accept the straight vote.  In the course of his reply, the Minister stated that the only advantage of my amendment was expediency, that I had merely given an opinion and that I had failed to substantiate it.  In the last debate, he repeated this no fewer than nine times <Col N="1258" />&mdash;so, presumably, if there are some means of substantiating my assertions that the public will not accept &ldquo;the single-seat and the straight vote&rdquo; at this time, the Minister will be prepared to accept my amendment.  It is the only conclusion I can come to, when the Minister says nine times he agrees with my choice of priorities but that I fail to substantiate my case.  This being so, the next step is to prove what I say. On this, I contend that the onus of proof surely rests with the Minister.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 781 of the Official Report, volume 235, No. 6, 11th June, 1968, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In fact, there does not seem to be any way of discovering this except by means of the referendum.</P>
    <P>I dispute this.  Has the Minister never heard of market research?  This is how commercial firms proposing to introduce some new products to the public discover in advance whether or not the public are prepared to buy.  No competently-run firm would dream of launching a new product without intensive comprehensive market research. Because of the high costs and prestige involved, failure could result in a change of employment for the director concerned and, indeed, possibly for the whole board of directors.  I suggest the Minister is now in a similar position. It is his duty to know or to find out&mdash; and that research is his responsibility, not mine.  He has the staff; he has the Department, and he has the resources. He should make use of them.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to come in here with his proposals ill-prepared and to confess that he does not know.  Are the Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators as well as the Fianna Fáil cumann secretaries incapable of collecting information from the public and of relaying it to the Minister or has the Minister failed to consult the grass roots of his Party?  I suggest the Minister ought now to have second thoughts.  It is still not too late to change his mind without any loss of face.  By making it clear that he regards the single seat as the primary issue of this Bill, he has carefully kept his options open.  I suggest he should now consult the grass roots.  I <Col N="1259" /> am confident they will substantiate my point of view on this matter.  This being so, I suggest it is his duty, irrespective of his personal feelings, to be big enough to change his mind and to give the people what they want, namely, the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that the people are entitled to strong government but strong government alone is not enough.  It must also be good government.  I feel that, by accepting my amendment and giving the people what they want, the people will get both strong and good government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this Bill proposes, in effect, to ask the people to do two things: (1) to obtain for themselves the very obvious advantages of single-seat constituencies; and (2) to rid themselves of the disadvantages and, indeed, the dangers of multi-member constituencies.  It also proposes to get rid of a discriminatory system of election and to establish for the first time here the fundamental democratic principle of one man, one vote.  Both of these things are important.</P>
      <P>I have agreed before and I agree again that, in so far as I am concerned, I consider the first of these things the more important but the second objective is also important.  I think that, broadly speaking, Deputy Norton appears to agree with the Government's view.  The reason for this amendment appears to me to be perfectly clear.  Deputy Norton believes we would be more likely to succeed in obtaining the advantages of single-member constituencies and of getting rid of the disadvantages of multi-member constituencies if this proposal of the transferable vote in such circumstances were incorporated in the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out how unjustified this system of the transferable vote is, particularly in the context of the single-seat constituency.  Deputy Norton must admit that this is merely his own opinion, that the acceptance of the unjustified system of election in the <Col N="1260" /> single-seat system would make it more likely to obtain the advantages of the single seats.  This is merely Deputy Norton's own opinion and I have not seen any evidence to justify it.  As I said before, I only know one way to find out and that is by counting the people's votes in a referendum.</P>
    <P>The debate on this amendment has proceeded for some time and there is no reason to believe, for instance, that that element in the Fine Gael Party, the majority of one which is opposed to this proposed reform of our electoral system, would be any less opposed to this reform if it incorporated this unjustified system of the counting of the people's votes.  It is quite obvious that this is the spineless section of the Fine Gael Party and there is no evidence to show that the minority in the Fine Gael Party who have some confidence in the future of the Party would be any more successful in convincing them to adopt Deputy Norton's suggestion that any other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That cannot be said for either of the Opposition Parties, particularly not for the Fine Gael Party.  Our concern in this matter is for the country and our duty seems <Col N="1261" /> quite clear, that is, that we should give the people the opportunity of providing themselves with the most democratic and most effective system of election and of representation.  Personally I think it is a pity that that minority in the Fine Gael Party which think on similar lines find themselves in the minority.  We know that these people are there and the people of the country know they are there and it just so happens that they are outnumbered by those Deputies who have no faith in the future of their own Party and who can see no prospects for the future except in circumstances that are conducive to the formation of Coalition Governments after the elections have been held.  We have no reason whatever to believe that it will be impossible to put the views before the people.  We have always had faith in the intelligence of the people to see the merits of the proposals being put before them and we have not been disappointed.  We believe that they will see the advantages that will come from the system we propose.  In so far as this particular proposal about the actual method of voting is concerned we have faith in the people's sense of fair play and in their recognition of the rightness of the principle of one man, one vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have demonstrated, and no one has attempted to contradict it, the unfairness of this system of the transferable vote, particularly in the context of the single-member constituency.  I have shown that it is based on the pretence that it gives a second chance to people who fail to elect their candidate. That is a fraudulent claim.  It is only some people who are given a second chance and some a second and third chance, and indeed some a second and third chance and as many chances as there are candidates in the field, while others in exactly the same position are given one vote and one vote only, so that it is clearly a discriminatory system.  There is the example of the two most recent by-elections in which the system operated. In Wicklow, this extra consideration was only given to less than half of those who failed to elect their candidate while in East Limerick, this consideration <Col N="1262" /> was given to only slightly more than half of the people who found themselves in that position as a result of this system.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have always had confidence in the people's ability to understand complex issues if they are properly put to them.  Despite the fact that up to this only one side of the case has been put, we have confidence in our ability to put the facts before the people and we have every reason to believe that the people will on this occasion decide to get rid of the many disadvantages of the multi-member constituency, of the evils of the system, and ensure that the dangers inherent in the system will be avoided.  At the same time, they will establish for themselves the fundamental democratic principle of one man, one vote, with the same treatment being given to every man's vote which is inherent in every democratic system.</P>

      <P>Up to recent years the main tune of Fianna Fáil was made up of adverse comments about a part of Ireland which has been severed from us, if I might use the term, that is, the State known as Northern Ireland.  We had lectures in this House from Fianna Fáil about this and I remember during the term of the inter-Party Government, questions being put from that side of the House asking us what we were doing to help our brethren in Northern Ireland who were suffering so much as a result of the electoral system that obtained there, as a result of which minority groups were not getting fair play.  We were asked to help to rectify that position by focusing public attention on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened?  These boys over here purely for selfish motives, seeing that the electoral system in Northern Ireland held the Unionist Party in office, and held many Unionist members in their seats without even contesting an election, decided in 1959 &ldquo;Could we in Fianna Fáil not emulate their example and bring about the same position here?&rdquo;  As a result the system which they condemned so loudly, the system our respected first citizen of the State today condemned so much during his period in this House as Leader, was proposed here <Col N="1263" /> early in 1959 or late in 1958 by Fianna Fáil.  If Fianna Fáil were right in 1959, if they were right in 1968, in trying to change the electoral system, then they must admit now that Northern Ireland was right in 1920, right in 1930 and right in 1940 and we were wrong in condemning the electoral system there.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said this is an important issue, a live issue, and there will have to be a decision on it in the not too distant future.  It is a live issue and the Opposition Parties, Labour and Fine Gael, asked that the next &ldquo;Politicians&rdquo; programme be devoted to this issue, to PR versus the straight vote.  What did Fianna Fáil do?  The people who are trying to enlighten the country on the advantages of the single vote system turned that proposal down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They said the next programme would be prices and incomes.  Fianna Fáil want to bluff the people and they are endeavouring to stifle discussion on our television system so that some of the people, at <Col N="1265" /> any rate, will not be conversant with what they have in mind.  I think everyone knows what they have in mind: it is not the salvation of the country but the salvation of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>In support of his contention that the straight vote is the best system, the Minister said we had Deputies coming in here on the eighth, ninth and tenth counts, and, judging by the way he said it, one would think that these Deputies had no right at all to be here. Every Member elected to this House has been duly elected in accordance with the electoral system that obtains. Mark you, if I were to follow the Minister's example in this, I would ask myself what position did the Minister find when he was trying to get in here first. I use this merely to illustrate my point. The Minister found that he could not become a Member of Dáil Éireann in a three-seat constituency, simple as the system is for electing Members to this House.  The Minister has told us there is no trouble getting in under the present system; that is one of the principal arguments he has against the system. Were it not for the fact that Deputy Seán Dunne was unfortunately not a candidate in 1957, the Minister would not have got in here at all, but, having got in in 1957, he took good care to enlarge the constituency from three to five seats in County Dublin in order to ensure that he would remain here.  Is that not a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in other circles? Did not the late Minister for Education when he was Minister for Health tell us about another system in operation, a system we can take as a parallel to what is sought to be done here.  He told us.  God be good to him, that, in his opinion, and this is supported by the present Minister for Health, Deputy Flanagan, that dispensary patients throughout the country should have a choice of doctor.  That is supported by all Parties.  If, for any reason, disagreement arises between a patient and a doctor, that patient has no one to go to for medical aid.  A choice is vital.  The same position obtains in Dáil Éireann. Not less than three Members represent any constituency.  If a constituent approaches a Deputy and does not get satisfaction, he has at least two other <Col N="1266" /> Deputies to whom he can put his case. Surely that is a much better system than having only one representative?  I hate to reflect personally on anyone, but the Minister for Local Government has a most abrupt manner, and if he were the sole representative of a constituency, I shudder to think how his constituents would fare, unless his position was so weak that he had to curry favour with the people.  I shudder to think of the position of Labour or Fine Gael supporters going to the Minister for help or advice on any problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no need to go today because they have Deputy Dunne and Deputy Clinton. The Labour Party believes, and it was the belief of Fianna Fáil up to recently, that the present system of election to Dáil Éireann is the best system and the most effective system it is possible to devise and no mathematician, no matter who he is, could devise a fairer or a better system.</P>
      <P>The Minister is rather worried that Fianna Fáil members have to compete against one another in constituencies, but, if there is some wrangle going on between the Minister, for instance, and some of his Party members in County Dublin, that is their own affair and they should settle it outside of his House.  If we look at what happened in Northern Ireland, when the Prime Minister resigned some years back, he represented a part of the county of Enniskillen and, in 40 years, he had to contest only one election.</P>

That is happening in a number of other constituencies in Northern Ireland.  Is there any reason to assume that it would or would not happen here?</P>
      <P>Here is the position as I could see it if Fianna Fáil were in power in a single-seat constituency: Unless you toed the Party line, unless you joined the cumann, unless you obeyed orders from headquarters, if you were a man of affluence, unless you paid up your money to Taca, you would find yourself and your family discriminated against.

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy.  The Deputy, of course, in making reference to single-member constituencies, is aware that a decision has been taken by the House.  We are now on the amendment by Deputy Norton, the straight vote as against the transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on the amendment by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton's amendment sets down single-seat constituencies.  At first, the Minister told us his only worry was single-seat constituencies.  If that was his only worry, why not accept Deputy Norton's amendment?  Does it not propose single-seat constituencies?  The lesson learned from Wicklow and from Limerick East ensured that the Minister would not accept Deputy Norton's amendment.  He had two recent lessons on what would happen under Deputy Norton's amendment.  It is clear that the Minister's case or the Government's <Col N="1268" /> case that what they mainly want here is single-seat constituencies is not soundly based.  If that was what they required, then Deputy Norton's amendment would give them that.</P>
      <P>For 50 years, since the foundation of this State, the multiple-seat system has served us very well indeed.  The number of seats obtained by the three major Parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; is on a par with their voting strength in the country.  In fact, Fianna Fáil do something better than their percentage support in the country would warrant.  Anyone who will calculate the percentage of votes given to each Party and the percentage of seats obtained by them in the various elections since the State was established cannot but assert that the system is fair.  It is giving fair representation in accordance with the support the various Parties have in the country.</P>
      <P>Why, then, should Fianna Fáil change?  That is another claim they are making.  Since 1959, unfortunately, due to the opposition amongst the Opposition Parties, Fianna Fáil have been able to hold on to office.  Why should they change?  I think they are changing now because they know their strength is declining.  They have got a taste of that quite recently.  They know the time is not far distant when Fianna Fáil will no longer be able to get anything near a majority of the Members elected to this House under the fair system we have at present.  Seeing that that is likely to occur, they are endeavouring now, for their own political ends, without any thought at all for the people or how it would react on them, to bring in this new system so that in constituencies where you can expect to get 37 to 40 per cent of the votes you will get your man elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This exercise of endeavouring to change what the people gave their verdict on less than nine years ago is, to my mind, wanton waste of the time of the House.  We have been discussing the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution day after day here when business of a much more urgent nature is awaiting discussion.  We are told that the referendum will cost more than £100,000 so far as official funds are concerned.  Everyone knows that it will <Col N="1269" /> cost many times that sum when one calculates the time of public men, the time of Party agents, political agents, postage, cards and every type of propaganda that can be issued, particularly by the Government Party.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any knowledge of what the people are thinking, he would be wise to anticipate their verdict. It is quite easy to anticipate what the verdict of the people will be.  In Dublin and from Donegal to the Mizen Head peninsula, the people do not want this electoral reform.  They are quite satisfied with the present system of electing Deputies.  Why put them to the expense?  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he were to heed the advice tendered to him and to the Government by some newspapers and by many public organisations, even, perhaps, of Opposition Parties, and even by some of his own backbench Members &mdash; men of commonsense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This question is being put to the people in the hope that it will benefit Fianna Fáil.  Now that Fianna Fáil know that they have no hope of getting it through, I again appeal to the Minister to abandon this proposed referendum, irrespective of the loss of face that may entail for himself and the Government. There will be a much bigger loss of face when the votes cast in the referendum are counted in the various constituencies.  The Government will suffer a defeat from which they may never recover.  If that should happen, the country will be none the poorer.</P>

We are against Deputy Norton's amendment because it is not possible within the amendment to operate the fair and effective system of proportional representation that has served this country so well and so effectively since 1922.</P>
      <P>I also made it clear that I am against subsection (2) of Part II of the Schedule which says that the members shall be elected on the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote.  I am against that and this Party is against it because that provision does not recognise majority rule, within the very words of the subsection, which says that the members shall be elected on the relative majority.  Relative majority means something less than majority.  We believe in majority rule and have always believed in it and I am violently against the proposal in subsection (2) of Part II of the Schedule on these grounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Party, or some of them, are pushing this proposal through the House and will endeavour to push it through the country in order to try to secure a far greater percentage of seats in this House than their share of the votes of the people entitles them to.  The evidence is here, as an independent and impartial survey carried out by independent people has shown, that if Fianna Fáil get their way they hope to secure after the next election by means of this so-called straight vote, but which is really known as the spot vote, 95 seats in this House for less than 40 per cent of the votes in the country.  That is what they have in mind.  That is what they are up to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also put it on record, and I wish to repeat it, that I am against this proposal to introduce the straight vote because it has been denounced, and denounced effectively, in the report of the Committee on the Constitution which reported in December, 1967.  I put it on the record here the last day I spoke that, although there were six <Col N="1271" /> Fianna Fáil Members of the Oireachtas on that Committee and although it is presided over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there is not one argument in the report of that Committee in favour of the single non-transferable vote which the Minister now proposes.  There are several arguments &mdash; I read them out the last day &mdash; against the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>I note that, although on last Tuesday Deputy Andrews promised to come into this House on last Wednesday and defend this proposal and explain the attitude of himself and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Party on this Committee, he has not spoken since.  I do not know whether Deputy Andrews knew &mdash;I am sure he did not, because he is a Deputy for whom I have the highest regard &mdash; that this House was not going to deal with this matter last Wednesday. But we are dealing with it today and I wonder will Deputy Andrews come in and explain why neither he nor any member of the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Party put forward one argument in this Committee set up by this House in favour of the proposals put forward by the Minister and why he and his five colleagues sat there and listened to arguments being put forward against the Minister's proposal for the non-transferable vote and did not contradict.</P>

The former Taoiseach said that that proposal was as dead as the dodo, that the people had decided on it in 1959 and nobody would have the neck to put it before the people again.  But there was a proposal put before that Committee.  The proposal was Deputy Norton's proposal for a single-member constituency with the transferable vote.  Those who opposed it were the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and they advanced several arguments against it.  They said it lent itself to the wasted vote phenomenon.</P>

That is why I know a great many of the Deputies sitting opposite me also oppose it.  That is why I know that the people of the country will reject it and reject it quickly when it comes to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the view that this debate over the past couple of months has been a waste of time or money.  I regret the attitude of some Members of the Opposition Parties making it seem as if Fianna Fáil are in this House imposing something on the people of the country against the people's wishes and, as Deputy Murphy said, that they were defending democracy from the Fianna Fáil Party while the opposite surely is true when you have the Government giving the people an opportunity of making a choice.  That is all it is.  Nobody else can do it except the people.  This House cannot do it.  We are asking the people to choose between different systems of election.  The people should regard themselves as very lucky.  I heard a debate on television the other night&mdash;whether it was &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; or not, I do not know&mdash;when a very prominent member of an Opposition Party spoke about the virtues of PR and mentioned two countries where it has worked successfully, Italy and Belgium.  Of all places, it seems odd to talk about Belgium and Italy as examples for us to follow here when we know that these countries have not been able to form a government for the past couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the way this matter is being discussed.  It is said here that Fianna Fáil are doing this for the salvation of Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil Party have done fairly well under the present system.  No unbiassed person would believe they would not continue to do fairly well under any system.  The point was made that they would be able to <Col N="1275" /> get an overall majority with 37 per cent of the votes under the straight vote system but that also goes for any other Party if they can convince the people that they have a better policy than Fianna Fáil.  I appreciate the position of some members of other Parties who believe the straight vote system is the best system.</P>
    <P>I am a backbencher and my voice may not count very much, but I want to say this because it is contrary to what has been said so often: I do not know one member&mdash;and I do not think I have missed a Party meeting held every Wednesday for the past couple of months&mdash;in the Fianna Fáil Party who has said that the straight vote is not the best system of election.  That is my word on it.  I do not know whether it will be carried or not.  I think I heard Deputy Norton say the same thing when he introduced his amendment.  It is the duty of everybody in the House to give the people a chance to examine the matter objectively, not because it will make Fianna Fáil strong or Fine Gael weak.  I suppose we cannot help reacting as members of Parties.  We should rise above Party and the people should be given an opportunity of choosing the best system.</P>
    <P>We were told about conditions in the North but these are not due to the straight vote, as everybody knows, but to the fact that you have pockets of the population where you can tell beforehand how people will vote, and because of this and gerrymandering you can have two seats in one division and one seat in another with twice as many people.  That is not done in any part of this country or any other country I know.  It certainly could not be done where I come from because we could not segregate the people into different Parties.  The attempt to compare the proposed system with the system in the North is completely false and is intended to confuse the issue.  I deplore the confusing of the electorate.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the papers normally every day and it amazes me to see that the PR system is being boosted.  I am not against having them say anything they like in favour of it. Deputy Norton's amendment has been <Col N="1276" /> praised in some of the papers and much said in its favour but I have not seen one paper or one writer in a national paper saying anything good for the straight vote and the single seat.  That amazes me, seeing that it has been used in Britain for quite a long time and at least they have stable government there.</P>

      <P>Some people think that the <i>Irish Press</i> is a Party paper; perhaps the Deputy is proving that it is not.  I want to say, in conclusion, that the time we have spent on this debate will not be wasted if we can convey to the people that the decision they make will have a tremendous influence on the future of this country.  This is one of the most fundamental issues ever put to the people.  Talking of 1959 when the existing system was&mdash;I will not say rejected&mdash;retained by a small majority, it must be pointed out that many people have come on the register since 1959. When we have bodies of people all over the country asking that those aged 18, 19 or 20 should get a vote, surely people who came of age since 1959 are entitled to make a decision now?  There can be nothing wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing can be more democratic than giving the people their choice and making it as objective as possible and giving a fair chance all round and not to say: &ldquo;You must not do that because it will make Fianna Fáil too strong&rdquo; or &ldquo;You must not do that because the Labour Party will be wiped out.&rdquo; These things do not happen.  Any Party with a policy to which the people will subscribe will eventually become the Government.  I know this about the Irish people: if you were the best Government any country could have, they would still give the other fellows a chance after ten years or so.  They would not leave you there in perpetuity. We should cut out the attributing of motives to one Party or the other.  By all means, use every argument you can <Col N="1277" /> in favour of PR as we know it&mdash;and there are many in favour of it.  You can use every argument in favour of Deputy Norton's amendment but at least give a fair indication also of the benefits and stability of the single seat and the straight vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It amazes me that Deputy Healy, who is usually so levelheaded, should put as a sensible proposition that the Fianna Fáil Party are not forcing this proposition down the throats of the Irish people, and particularly that he should do it on such weak ground, on the consideration that there is a new electorate now and therefore that the proposition must again be placed before the people.  If we are to proceed on this basis, must we do it every time a new register is brought out?  Must we do it every two or every five years?  Is the country to be faced with the suggestion that in order to enable the new electorate to make up their minds as to the type of electoral system they want to have, we shall go through this drill religiously every eight or nine years?</P>
      <P>This is a ridiculous proposition.  It is quite plain that the people have spoken on two occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with an unequivocal voice on the subject we are now debating again and on which it is proposed to spend about £100,000 of the taxpayers' money.  It is quite plain that there is no need for this exercise and that Deputy Healy is speaking a great deal of nonsense in suggesting that this is not a political Party measure by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I know that members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench have suggested that this is in aid of the Fine Gael Party and that backbench members of Fianna Fáil have suggested to the members of the Labour Party that it is in aid of the Labour Party. Deputy Healy knows as well as I do that this is purely a political measure aimed at the heart of the Labour Party and also aimed at the Fine Gael Party in the belief held by every member of Fianna Fáil that if they get this measure through the electorate, they will come back with close on 100 seats <Col N="1278" /> out of the 144 in this House and that Opposition of the type they meet now will be banished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>My complaint has always been, not that we have got too much Opposition but that we had no Opposition worth talking about.  I do not fear Opposition and I do not long to have an enormous Fianna Fáil majority here.  My concern is simply to see a system introduced which will guarantee as far as possible that after a general election, a Government can be formed automatically without any backstage huxtering or negotiating away from the public view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett says there is no need for this at the moment but it cannot apparently be said often enough that by the time there is need to do this, it is already too late.  This has been the experience consistently all around Europe, that too late governments have said: &ldquo;We must now try to amend our electoral system&rdquo; but they have never been able to do it.  They have tried in various ways to introduce what some countries call a reinforced proportional system, a system which gives no representation at all to any Party which does not poll a total of, say, 15 per cent over the whole country. They are trying to nibble at the proportional system, but they have never been strong enough to get rid of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General de Gaulle made a good shot at it the last time, and he went as far as the people would let him go, because he had seen in his own country precisely the dangers to which we have already referred consistently on this side of the House, the danger of multiplicity of Parties, of splintering of Parties, of inability to form governments, the people forget all too quickly that until one man came in and got a grip on the country, there were governments going in and out in Paris so quickly that you could hardly see them.  It was a matter of &ldquo;whose turn is it next to be prime minister?&rdquo; until the whole situation became crazy and very nearly disintegrated completely. We have had the situation in Greece where cabinets were collapsing with such appalling frequency that eventually even the Greek Government stated <Col N="1279" /> that they would have to resign and did resign because they were unable to get electoral reform, and after the collapse of cabinet after cabinet, the army took over as the only guardians of law and order in the country.</P>
    <P>As an Army man myself, I do not distrust the Army as an institution for the job which it was set up to do, but I would not tolerate for a moment the setting up of the Army staff as a cabinet.  That is no reflection on the Army staff.  They are very good at their own job, but I do not trust Army men taking over the political direction of a country.  It has never succeeded in the past, and I see no reason why it should succeed in the future.  There is this danger in the background, but by the time the danger becomes obvious in your own country, you have already lost the battle, and you cannot recover.</P>
    <P>We must get a system before it is too late where we can have a guarantee of the formation of a government.  I cannot see for a moment how Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Barrett and a few others can say that it would be quite improper for Fianna Fáil to have the majority of seats in this House with only 40 per cent of the votes, as if it was only Fianna Fáil who could ever hope to get 40 per cent of the votes.  I agree very much with Deputy Healy that this defeatism on the part of Fine Gael is quite incomprehensible.  At the last election Fine Gael polled 34.1 per cent. It is not a very long haul from 34.1 to the 40s.  They never polled very high even in the so-called heyday of the Cumann na nGaedhael Party.  In the first election they got only as high as 39.2; in 1927, they got 34.9; in 1932, they got 35.3; but through their own fault they have never been able to command more support than that in the country so far.  If they had a little more dedication to their job and if a greater number of them were more professional politicians, they would get a lot more than 34 or 35 per cent of the votes.</P>
    <P>I want to speak perfectly honestly: I am not looking forward to an indefinite prolongation of Fianna Fáil power.  I have been in the House 11 years.  I served on the Opposition <Col N="1280" /> benches for only one day until we elected a new Government.  There is a lot to be said for an occasional change of Government.  We have got to be able to show the people that if the Government do not meet with approval and do not retain the confidence of the people, there is an alternative government ready and willing and able to take over.</P>
    <P>Under the proportional system, that simply cannot happen in the foreseeable future.  It would need such an avalanche of votes in favour of Fine Gael and Labour that unless the whole Fianna Fáil Party went sheer, stark, staring mad, it is impossible to believe that there could be such a swing of votes.  However, under the direct vote system in the single-seat constituency, if Fianna Fáil were to lose the confidence of the people to any extent, they would face defeat at the next general election.  As matters stand, we have had 11 years continuously, 30 out of the last 36, so that it is obvious that under the present system Fianna Fáil are almost guaranteed for all time.</P>
    <P>We had the views of the Labour Party on the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme that a coalition would be the greatest gift to Fianna Fáil that ever happened.  Deputy Michael O'Leary stated that the last coalitions had been an enormous benefit to Fianna Fáil because they had in themselves been such a disaster and had led to severe losses by the Labour Party.  That means that there is no chance of a coalition, and there is no chance under the present system of Fine Gael getting such an enormous swing of votes in their favour that they could come in as a single Party government.  Under the new system as it will be and I have every confidence it will be, Fianna Fáil will be more vulnerable than ever in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not look forward to the replacement of the Fianna Fáil Government by another, but it is desperately dangerous to have a situation where people are saying, as they have said to me: &ldquo;We do not particularly like Fianna Fáil, but who else is there?&rdquo; That is the thing which gives rise to apathy and to a complete loss of confidence in the whole democratic parliamentary system.  The result is <Col N="1281" /> inevitable, and sooner or later we will suffer it unless we get this through.</P>
    <P>In no other sector of society is this complicated and cock-eyed system used.  It really is quite unique.  No other country in the world has ever adopted it.  Various European countries tried a proportional system but no one tried ours.  I have no hesitation in saying that the straight relative majority vote method is the most easy to understand and in the end the fairest reflection of public opinion.  The person who gets in can represent himself only, and his own Party.  As I said earlier in the discussion on Deputy Norton's amendment, you cannot have a proportion of one Deputy.</P>
    <P>I have always felt at the back of my mind that there would be something basically dishonest if we said to the electorate that we were retaining PR and that we would have single-seat constituencies.  It is far more honest and straight to come out in the open and say we are having single-member constituencies and the only way to vote for single-member constituencies is by the straight vote.  We do it in every other election.  Fine Gael do it in their Party elections of officials.  The Labour Party, the trade union movement, the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;we all use the straight majority vote.  Why on earth should we go to these vague theorists and ask for help to devise a system which confuses, and results in the country facing the danger which is facing Belgium of being without a government at all?</P>

      <P>To get back to the danger of a lack of government, as Deputy Healy has said, in Belgium it is 5½ months since they had a general election and they are only now beginning to try to form a government. In Italy it is nearly two months since they had a general election and they are still trying to form a government. In Germany there is the appalling position where one coalition has broken up and the only alternative coalition is a coalition of the two major parties who hate each other very bitterly but could form a coalition of 450 seats with a total opposition of only about 40.  That is the sort of situation which drives people to the barricades.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was speaking on another occasion about the danger of people losing confidence in the system. With the single-member constituency where the straight vote is used, the people in the constituency will know precisely where they stand.  They will vote for their man and it will be clear that he got the highest number of votes for him and the lowest number of votes against him.  Therefore he wins.  Nothing could be fairer than that.  If we do this in every other election, I cannot see for the life of me why we should not do it here.  The only thing which gave concern was whether we should take this all in one step or do it step by step.</P>

I nail my colours to the mast on this quite definitely, as I have done before.  PR in a single-seat constituency is a contradiction in terms.  Consequently I am absolutely in favour of the straight vote system.  This will give a guarantee of the formation of a government at all future general elections. It will also contribute towards building up an alternative government waiting in the wings to take over at any time the confidence of the people is lost by the existing government.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to allow any situation to develop, if I can stop it, where the government of the country is handed over to a group of people carrying on policy-making on the basis of a fair day bargain.  A fair day bargain in the open is OK, but a fair day bargain behind closed and locked doors is intolerable to my mind. At a general election the people are electing a government and they are entitled to know what each Party stand for, and they are entitled to know that if one Party get in, they will stick by their guns, carry out their policies and take the blame or the credit for what transpires, instead of the wretched business when a coalition collapses of everyone saving: &ldquo;It was not my fault; the other fellows let me down.&rdquo;  Those are the things which lead people to the barricades and lead them to say that <Col N="1285" /> parliamentary democracy is an illusion. Under this system, we have small constituencies where Deputies will know their area and know their people and be known by them and where, at each election, there will be a clear decision with the alternative of change at the next election.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt in my own mind, and never had, that this is the best system and now I shall do everything in my power to ensure that we get a thundering majority: we missed it last time by only two per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sylvester Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the merits and demerits of this referendum. In my opinion, there is only one argument that should matter, that is, whether what is proposed is in the best interests of this nation.  I maintain we should not allow our judgment of the issue to be clouded by personal factors, namely, whether we would be returned to this House, individually, or not under a changed electoral system.  I am convinced the proposals as put forward by the Government are the ones which are in the best interests of the nation.  I am convinced the single-seat straight vote system is the ideal system for this nation just as it is accepted as the ideal system for most civilised countries, although some of them may not yet have aspired to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Opposition speakers refer to the recent by-elections.  I notice that the ones most favoured by the Opposition were the Wicklow and Limerick by-elections.  In both of these elections, it is true to say that the results were achieved by a very slender margin and, accordingly, they should <Col N="1286" /> not be used as conclusive evidence by either side.  I should like to refer to the other by-election, namely, Clare.  Here, Clare presented a totally different picture, as we all know.  Fianna Fáil had a majority in the first count of something around 6,000 over the other Parties.  When I was declared elected, the distribution of my surplus took place.  The sole purpose of this exercise was an attempt to save the deposit of the Labour candidate.  This proved a futile exercise, as we know.  Even though he needed only 1,300-odd votes to save his deposit, he failed to do so.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, I heard a Deputy use the Clare by-election in an attempt to bolster up his case.  Deputy Seán Dunne very quickly interjected with the remark that there was a long shadow over Clare.  I agree with Deputy Seán Dunne that there is a long shadow over Clare but it is over the Labour Party in Clare.  Anyway, it is also assumed by those who were present at the count that both the Labour and Fine Gael vote, if properly examined, would prove that 50 per cent was non-transferable.</P>
    <P>Being a western county, and as the western counties are the counties very much involved in this referendum, surely Clare should be used as convincing evidence that the western counties are entitled to a hearing and that there is a very strong case for the Government's proposals in this referendum for the western counties?  What it would mean to Clare, if the referendum failed, would be that a part of northeast Clare would have to join Galway; in other words, it would have to go into a totally different Province.  Definitely, to go into a different Province would not be very acceptable to these people.  I feel quite sure that when the occasion arises, when the referendum is put before them, they will vote overwhelmingly for the Government's proposals, as I am sure will the counties all over the west of Ireland.  They have no intention, I am sure, of allowing their representation to be interfered with just for the purpose of satisfying some of the Dublin constituencies.  So, when the occasion arises, I feel sure the western counties will give their answer and support the Government. <Col N="1287" /> I feel sure also that the people in the Dublin constituencies from these western counties will make their presence felt when they go to the polls and will support their relatives and their own people throughout the West and so retain their present representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  He does not do that.  I merely want to deal with a couple of points made, first of all, by Deputy Stephen Barrett who based his argument against the proposal in the Bill on what is really a fairytale and a fantasy composed by two eminent television personalities who did not understand the matter.  When trying to forecast the future, on the basis of the results of the last local elections, they predicted that, if proportional representation were abolished, Fianna Fáil would get 100 seats.  That would assume that electoral opinion was distributed uniformly throughout every district in this country.  So, where Fianna Fáil were strong in one particular district, they would be strong everywhere&mdash;which, of course, is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An average does not mean a general uniformity but these eminent television personalities assumed it does.  So, on the basis of how the votes were being cast at the last municipal election, they came out with this fairytale and fantasy that, if proportional representation were abolished, Fianna Fáil would win 100 seats.  But an average is not, as I said, a uniformity.  It is a measure of uniformity but it is not in itself a uniformity.  On the contrary, it is the result of widespread differences, of differences which may be widely apart in an area, widely separated in locality, widespread, however, in certain economic sectors.  Therefore, it is quite wrong to do as these gentlemen did, to proceed to apply to the whole country a certain average of results when the system of election was radically to be changed.  One simple <Col N="1288" /> example will indicate the fallacy in the matter.</P>
    <P>If proportional representation is abolished, there is not any doubt about it&mdash;I have no doubt about it whatsoever&mdash;that the position of the Labour Party in our large centres of population will substantially improve: they are likely to get several more seats in Dublin than they have at the moment. The same will, no doubt, apply in Cork and, to some extent, in Limerick and Waterford.  If we assume that uniformity in electoral opinion prevails throughout the country we get the absurd situation on which Deputy Stephen Barrett has based his case against the amendment now before the House.  Therefore, as I say, it is entirely fallacious.  If you look at it in a concrete way and realise there are very many more Labour voters and supporters in the city of Dublin, as the last election showed, than there are in Clare where my colleague, Deputy Barrett, was recently returned triumphantly, then you will see why the Labour Party are not likely to get as many seats in districts like Clare if PR is abolished but they are certainly going to get more seats in the urban districts.</P>
    <P>Similarly with Fine Gael, who have their own strongholds throughout the country too.  These strongholds are submerged under the existing system of the multi-member constituency.  They do not appear and they are not visible in the ballot boxes except when you are witnessing a count.  They are not visible in the figures of the count because they are merged in the mass of votes.  If we had single-seat constituencies, there are certainly in the city of Dublin certain localities which would definitely return a Fine Gael member almost in any circumstances, just as there are other districts in Dublin which would return Fianna Fáil members.  Therefore if we abolished PR, there would not be such a change in the composition of this Dáil at all.  There certainly would be a greater majority in favour of the Government than there is now, but it would be only marginally greater.  It would prevent a system whereby you might be ruled by a minority with the tolerance of a certain number of Independent Deputies, or by the tolerance of the principal Opposition Parties in this <Col N="1289" /> House, as happened before.  That is very bad from the point of view of the public's interests but it is the situation which has obtained here on several occasions.</P>
    <P>For instance in 1932, the Labour Party could have put us out but they did not want to face an election.  There was a hugger-mugger and they were discussing it in their councils.  They discussed whether those who supported them would tolerate their giving support to a Cumann na nGaedhael Government.  They put us in but only because they had no alternative and it was not from any great sympathy because we saw what that sympathy amounted to, when in 1948 a really critical situation arose.  In 1937, the Fianna Fáil Party had not got an overall majority but we became a tolerated Government without any real Opposition because they were afraid to put us out and therefore they allowed us to go on.  As a Government, however, we had neither the strength nor the authority which would allow us to put through the programme we had in mind.  Just as in 1932, it required the election of 1933 to give us the strength to fight the Economic War, just so in 1937, it required the 1938 election to pull us through the World War.  In 1943, we had an election and we came back again as a tolerated Government without any real Opposition, until there was a snap division here, and despite the anxiety of some people not to win that division, they did win it and they gave us the general election of 1944.  We then came back with the authority to put a policy through.  We had the policy of strong and, shall I say, sophisticated neutrality which brought us through the war without losing us the goodwill of a great number of people whose antagonism might have been very dangerous to the freedom and prosperity of the country.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that exists at present under PR, that you are likely to get that sort of Government and that sort of situation in which you will have no real Opposition, as we have experienced on several occasions.  On the other hand, if you abolish PR, if you have the single-seat constituency <Col N="1290" /> with the straight vote, then a different situation will be created and you will have a Government with authority behind it and an Opposition with the ambition to try to get it out and one that may be strong enough to get it out because it will tend to be a united Opposition.  You have not got that situation now and you cannot get that situation under PR.  At present you have Fine Gael anxious for office and you have the Labour Party no less anxious for office, as naturally is their right.  They want office in order to put through their policy just as Fine Gael want office, but I cannot say that it is in order to put through their policy because no person knows what that policy is.</P>
    <P>The policy of Fine Gael is now undergoing a period of gestation and it all depends on whether they can have this liaison with the Labour Party which will enable it to produce some fruit from that marvellous womb.  That is the situation we have now due entirely to PR.  You have two divergent Parties with no common association or link between them and they are now bargaining, or at least one of them has made overtures, improper overtures, to the other and the other, being a nice girl, is tending to turn shyly away saying: &ldquo;No.  I cannot listen until I know what you have to offer.  If the offer is sufficiently tempting, then I will listen to you.&rdquo; Let me say that this is no fantasy of my imagination.  One of the shrewdest and most highly respected members of the journalistic profession, the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i>, has made it quite clear that there are some members of the Labour Party whose virtue is more frail than others and who are quite prepared to accept these overtures and enter into, shall we say, an irregular association. You now have one Party which at the last election produced a policy for a just society&mdash;one day I may have the opportunity to examine that &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; in detail but I am not going to try to do it this evening&mdash;and you have the other Party lately converted to socialism, and now the matchmaker, the kibitzer, is trying to make a match and saving that there are some members of the Labour Party who are quite <Col N="1291" /> prepared to do a deal with Fine Gael and there are some members of Fine Gael who are quite prepared to do a deal with the Labour Party and actually going as far as to outline the conditions of the settlement.</P>
    <P>You are trying to find some sort of way in which you can unite yourselves in opposition to Fianna Fáil otherwise than on the sterile basis on which Fine Gael have acted ever since we came into office, a hatred of Fianna Fáil and all they stand for and for all they have done for the nation.  You are an Opposition without any real sense of direction of where you ultimately want to go and therefore you are a weak Opposition.  If we had this other system, then the Opposition would be much stronger.  You would have a strong Opposition, strong because they would be united in purpose and in a sense of fidelity to one another and to the Party to which they belonged rather than the situation in which you are now.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in wanting office because, if you are in politics, you are in politics in order to give effect to some principles you hold and for which you are prepared to make real sacrifices and, therefore, there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking office and nothing to be ashamed of in holding office; the only thing about it is that, when you get office, at least you will have a common cause and a common principle to fight for and do not, as Deputy Booth has reminded us, put yourselves in the situation in which you were during the first Coalition when there was no loyalty uniting you and when every Cabinet Minister was out for his own aggrandisement, for his own political aggrandisement.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to say this in relation to what I have already said; this proposed merger is also based on another fallacy.  First of all, as I said, it is really a marriage of incompatibles, a marriage within the forbidden degrees of kindred, because it is really a marriage or miscegenation where the blood counts are completely different. There is not any possibility that such a marriage would last because of the incompatibles which you are trying to <Col N="1292" /> merge with each other.  And you are assuming that this can be done because you can control the votes of those who hitherto supported you as independent Parties.  You are assuming this merger can take place and you will come back into office by reason of it.</P>
    <P>Let us look at that a little bit realistically.  You are assuming that Irish voters are dumb driven cattle, that the Fine Gael voters will vote as Deputy Liam Cosgrave tells them or Deputy Michael O'Higgins will tell them, or that they will vote as Deputy James Tully tells them or Deputy Brendan Corish will tell them.  The Labour and the Fine Gael voters, you think, will do this.  You think that they are just two herds whom you can drive together and then drive the whole lot on, but that is not the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the result in Wicklow.  I have already pointed out in the newspapers that so far as the East Limerick result was concerned, there were 1,600 odd votes &mdash;1,690, I think&mdash;Fine Gael transfers, 1,690 transfers from Fine Gael voters to Mr. O'Malley, to the Fianna Fáil Party, and there were 1,965 voters who did not transfer at all.  That is the element with which you have got to deal. Similarly, in Wicklow you had&mdash;I will give the figures&mdash;after the fourth count there, Mr. Kavanagh of the Labour Party had 6,797 preferences; Miss O'Neill, representing Fianna Fáil, had 10,343; and Mr. Timmins of Fine Gael had 8,728.  Now on the transfer of Kavanagh's votes&mdash;this is the real revelation, I think, to those who think that this merger will mean that, if you two Parties come together we will go out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the transfer of Mr. Kavanagh's votes, of these 6,797 votes, there went to Mr. Timmins 3,868, making him 12,596.  To Miss O'Neill there went 1,707, making her <Col N="1293" /> poll 12,051 and there went to nobody 1,222 non-transferable votes.  So there you are.  So 1,707 votes went to Fianna Fáil in spite of Labour's admonition to vote for Fine Gael and, in spite of their leaders, 1,707 Labour first preferences went to Fianna Fáil and 1,222 Labour voters would not vote for Fine Gael despite all the admonitions of Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Corish and all the rest of them.  Now, therefore, you see, this idea that the two Parties, if you merge, will turn us out is just a pure hallucination.  What will happen is&mdash;I hope you will come together well before the election and hammer out your disputes and your disagreements well before the election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But, if you take the other line, and Fine Gael come out on their own policy and leave the Labour people alone and Labour do the same, even on the non-transferable vote, you will come back at least with a secure and solid Party behind you and you will not have to be looking around your shoulder to see which of your colleagues is going to stab you in the back.</P>

Deputy Murphy was making a case here and he was immediately ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle even though he was far closer to the point than Deputy MacEntee was here a few minutes ago. Deputy MacEntee conveniently forgot one particular period.  He referred to the dangers of a minority government supported by a group of Independents. Then he copped himself on and moved away very quickly from that because his Government were such a Government; they made a bargain and we can see the results of that bargain yet. Deputy Booth need not go very far to see the results of the bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents the result of a careful reassessment by Government of what should in current circumstances be the level of remuneration of the various branches of the judiciary.  It proposes to increase, with effect from 1st April this year, the salary of the Chief Justice from £6,360 to £8,000; that of judges of the Supreme Court from £4,950 to £7,000; that of judges of the High Court from £4,400 to £6,000; that of judges of the Circuit Court from £3,640 to £5,000; that of the President of the District Court from £3,190 to £4,500; and that of Metropolitan and provincial District Justices from £2,690 and £2,520, respectively, to a new flat rate of £3,750.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a provision empowering the Government to increase judicial salaries in future by orders which will be open to the disapproval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the main point, that of salaries, it has been clear for some time that a fundamental reassessment of judicial pay was necessary for a number of reasons.  The most important point, perhaps, is that the present salaries fall considerably short of those required to enable the various members of the judiciary to maintain the status and independence which should attach to the important positions they hold in our society.  Further, it will be generally accepted that the Government, in selecting persons for appointment as judges, should be able to call on the services of the most suitable legal practitioners, and, also, that persons so selected should be able to accept appointment without serious financial sacrifice.  The Government have been aware for some years that <Col N="1296" /> the present level of judicial salaries is an obstacle when suitable appointees come to consider accepting an offer of judicial appointment.</P>
    <P>In the matter of status and salary levels, the judiciary are to a large extent <i>sui generis</i>, and no accurate comparison can be drawn between judges and persons employed in other sectors of public employment.  The present inadequacy of judges' salaries arises from a tendency over the last 20 years to equate them with other groups; even on that basis, it is quite clear that the judges have been given too little and too seldom, with the result that they have lost a considerable amount of ground.  The present measure is intended to bring the salaries of judges up to acceptable level, and also has regard to the fact that the last increase was granted in 1964.</P>
    <P>So far as Circuit Judges and District Justices are concerned, I should like to emphasise at this juncture that the Government, in reaching their decision as to the amount of the proposed increase, have taken into account the contemplated increase in the jurisdiction of these two courts. Legislative proposals on that subject are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  The new salaries set out in the Bill must, therefore, be regarded as covering any increase in jurisdiction that may be conferred on these courts.</P>
    <P>I may also draw attention to the fact that the salary proposed for District Justices involves the abolition of what I may refer to as provincial differentiation.  Up to now, the Dublin metropolitan justices and the Cork city justice have been paid more than their provincial colleagues; the present differential is £170.  Forty years ago, the arrangement whereby persons in public employment working in the provinces were paid less than their colleagues in the large cities, was fairly common both in this country and elsewhere. Over the years, this adverse differentiation has been gradually reduced or abolished in other spheres, so that it can now be said to be virtually non-existent.  The Government have accepted that there is no merit in retaining differentiation.  The proposal <Col N="1297" /> that all District Justices should have a common salary has the support of the District Justices Association, which is representative of all the justices.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the District Court, I may also mention that the Government have approved the making of arrangements for a general close-down of sittings during the month of August.  Adequate provision will, of course, be made, by way of &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; sittings in each district, to cater for criminal cases and especially custody cases.  The close-down during August will not operate until 1969.</P>
    <P>The closing-down of the District Court for a month during the vacation period will facilitate the public generally and also improve the efficiency of that court.  The general pattern over the years has been that few cases are listed during August, and that applications for adjournments are frequent on the grounds that one or both of the parties, or their legal representatives, or witnesses, are absent on holiday.  The professional bodies concerned are in favour of the August close-down.  The close-down will also facilitate the taking of annual leave by District Justices, and at the same time ensure the holding of scheduled sittings throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second provision in the Bill.  This provides that any future increases in judicial salaries may be granted by Government Order, instead of by Act of the Oireachtas as heretofore.  It will, however, be necessary for the Government to lay before the Dáil a draft of any such order, and if the Dáil disapproves of the draft Order within 21 sitting days, the order shall not be made.  In this way, though the procedure is being changed, parliamentary control by the House over any increases in judicial salaries is being preserved.</P>
    <P>I think that most Deputies will welcome this change.  The Deputies who have been in the House for any substantial period cannot but have noticed, even in the case of an uncomplicated Bill, the substantial interval which for one reason or another elapses between the time the Bill is introduced in the Dáil and the time it is finally passed. Deputies with experience of Government <Col N="1298" /> will recall the various formalities and delays which inevitably occur between the formulation of legislative proposals and the introduction of a Bill in the Dáil.  There is no reason why judicial salaries should not be dealt with by Government order, subject to Dáil control as I have indicated, and this is what we propose for the future.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposing any part of this measure. Whether it is popular or unpopular to say it, it must be recognised that the judiciary in this country must be paid adequately, that they have a status to maintain and that the maintenance of their status and, particularly, of their independence, is essential and that members of the judiciary must be put into a position where they are adequately paid by the State.</P>
      <P>So far as the present Bill is concerned, I am not at all happy about the additional provision that has been inserted, which the Minister apparently expected would be greeted with open arms by Deputies, that is, the provision that in future increases in judicial salaries should be made by ministerial order and will only be discussed in the House if someone puts down a resolution to annul the order.  I think that that, in effect, is what this particular section means.  To my way of thinking, in any event, although a certain amount of unpopularity has to be faced by Members of the House here when they decide to adjust salaries in the income bracket of the people concerned in this Bill, nevertheless, it is better that we should face that situation, that we should discuss openly here in the House the reasons for the increases when increases are granted.  I do not relish the idea that in future this will be done merely by Government order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister is right in assuming, as he does in his statement here, that that provision will be welcomed by Deputies.  He is correct when he refers to the delays that for one reason or another may take place between the time of the introduction of a Bill and the time a Bill is finally passed.  On the other hand, that situation, if it were likely to create any <Col N="1299" /> hardship, can very easily be adjusted by making the increase, if necessary, retrospective either to the date of the introduction of the Bill or at least to the date of the passing of the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>On balance, the Minister is right to do away with the differentiation between what you might call metropolitan and country district justices.  I can only talk in a particular way of the court of which I have personal knowledge.  The work done in the Dublin metropolitan district is certainly very onerous.  It is continuous work.  They are sitting virtually all the year around.  Had the Minister decided to maintain the differentiation, I would not have been inclined to dispute with him about it because I know from experience the amount of work required to be done in the Dublin metropolitan district.  I would have thought that that was in itself a justification for some differential, but by and large I think it is better that there should not be a salary differential between the holders of offices of equal status.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the District Justices Association approved of the abolition of the differentiation. It was worth while for the Minister to make the point that the increases now being recommended have been taken into account in connection with any increase in jurisdiction of the lower courts.  I do not intend to branch out into a discussion of the desirability or otherwise of increasing the jurisdiction. But it is simply a fact which the Minister has mentioned and which is worth noting&mdash;that if there is to be a distinction in the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts, the increases now proposed are intended to cover that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is the appropriate occasion or not but at some stage the Minister might consider the possibility of reviewing the position of some of the members of the Bench who have since retired on pensions which nowadays one must regard as inadequate.  Whether it is going to be possible at any stage to do something about increasing those pensions to a satisfactory level is something the Minister might turn his mind to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are not opposing these increases.  We feel that to get the best people to do the job it is necessary to pay them adequately.  It does appear to us that with the present system of appointment and with the salaries being paid at present, the best people for the jobs are not available, are not willing to accept them or not being asked to accept them.  If the improvement made in the salary scales now does attract a better type&mdash;I am not criticising the present incumbents&mdash;if it does encourage the top men to accept, then it would be well justified.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of matters I would like to comment on.  One of them is in regard to the age at which many District Justices are appointed. Deputy O'Higgins referred to the man who is retiring and because his period of office was relatively short, does not get an adequate pension.  He gets the worst of both worlds.  Perhaps this increase in salary will encourage younger men to take up the job.  Somebody said it was a lonely job.  It must be.  These people are asked to take responsibility and decisions which none of us in this House would be anxious to take.  They have to be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.  They have to live up to a standard which their present salary does not enable them to do.  It is just too bad if we have the situation where a District Justice has before him for some offence or other a trader to whom he owes a substantial sum of money for the simple reason that the justice's salary is not sufficient.  They should receive adequate remuneration so that they will be independent and able to give independent decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience some years ago of having my car broken into outside my office.  A suit taken from the cleaners was on the back seat and this was the object of the attack.  The person who did it was subsequently arrested by the Guards and taken to court.  With a member of the staff of my office, I went to give evidence.  Believe it or not, both the girl who was giving evidence and I were made to feel as if we were the people before the Bench and not the gentleman in the dock.  In fact, that District Justice said it was I and people like me who were <Col N="1301" /> responsible for crime in Dublin.  I was a Member of this House and he had the audacity to say that.  Quite obviously, the man should never have been on the Bench if that was his general attitude to crime.  If this increase in salary ensures that these people do not find their way there and that people who are fully competent and able to do the job properly are sent there, the Government are doing a good job in making this proposition.</P>
    <P>All round me there are lawyers&mdash; with apologies to Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins&mdash;but, speaking as a layman, I want to say that at present so far as civil law is concerned, even most serious cases may take years before reaching the courts.  The question of production comes in here.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he either make arrangements whereby the judges will have more sittings or longer hours or that more judges be appointed.  It is simply ridiculous that a constituent of mine can say to me: &ldquo;I am owed £7,500 and I am two years trying to get the people who owe it to me into court.  In the meantime I have been declared bankrupt by somebody else for the sum of £250.&rdquo;  That situation is ludicrous.  I would suggest to the Minister that he attempt to have cases dealt with more expeditiously, particularly civil cases.  If that is the experience of other people&mdash;and I have met one or two with similar complaints &mdash;something must be done about it.  I would ask the Minister to look into it and see if there is some way he can remedy it.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the system of appointment.  I do not think it should be a grace and favour appointment. I do not know how it should be done but so long as we have a situation in which it can be said that there is no point in going to court because the man who will be trying you is a bitter political opponent, it is not right.  I have no evidence that such a situation has affected the judgment in a case but the fact that it could be said that it could affect the judgment is wrong, no matter what Government are in power.  That situation should not continue and there should be some other <Col N="1302" /> system of appointment rather than by the Government in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The introduction of this Bill at present seems to be an admission that the salaries now paid to members of the judiciary at all levels are inadequate and have been inadequate, according to the Minister, for a considerable time.  The Minister gives as the reason for the inadequacy the fact that these salaries were coupled to other groups. I accept that salaries have been inadequate for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the point I want to make.  It follows that certain members of the judiciary, particularly members of the District Court bench and the Circuit Court bench who have retired, have retired on, and are being paid inadequate pensions.  In this Bill we are providing a substantial sum to remunerate serving members of the judiciary and I do not complain about that, but we should do the decent thing and be just to those who have served in the judiciary through the years on inadequate salaries and now exist on very inadequate pensions.</P>
      <P>I go further than my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, who asked the Minister to turn his mind to this matter at some future time.  It will be done too late then because these men are advanced in years and time is important. We very often tend to do the right thing here by the serving official. I hope it is not because he is a force to be reckoned with, having an organisation behind him which can press his claim.  At the same time, we are far too prone to forget those who have given good service and have retired.  Therefore, I strongly appeal to the Minister as a matter of urgency, now that he has recognised in this Bill that members of the judiciary have been badly treated in the past and have retired on inadequate pensions and will not benefit from the Bill, to do justice by them and to do it at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take certain pleasure in noting that the Minister has abolished the difference between the metropolitan and provincial District Justices because, as a Member of the Seanad when the last proposal for an increase <Col N="1303" /> came before the House, I advocated strongly that the differentiation should be abolished and the then Minister for Justice, who is now Minister for Finance, would not accept my proposals and put up a strong case against them.  The record will show that I went out of my way to demonstrate that the provincial justices really had a more onerous task to perform than metropolitan justices because the metropolitan justices usually have the same type of case day in, day out, whereas the provincial justice may be dealing with an involved smuggling prosecution today and a case of company law or some other involved legal point tomorrow.  I am glad that has been recognised and that the differentiation has been abolished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that it is proposed to increase the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts. Some years ago the jurisdiction of the District Court was increased from £10 in tort to £50 and from £15 in contract to £50.  We all know that meant nothing because of the change in the value of money.  I think it would provide for less expensive administration of justice if the jurisdiction of both courts were increased.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the present Minister for Justice will be able to persuade his Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Finance, that retired members of the judiciary have a grievance that cannot be dealt with in years to come but must be dealt with now if justice is to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill.  It is, of course, quite correct for Members to refer to the loss of purchasing power of the salaries enjoyed by these men.  I notice that in 1924 the first Chief Justice had £4,000 a year and the President of the High Court had £3,000.  High Court Judges had £2,500; Circuit Court judges had £1,700; Principal Justices had £1,200 and others £1,000.  If one relates these salaries, having regard to the difference in the purchasing power of money, to present day salaries, it will be seen that the amounts are far <Col N="1304" /> less than they were then and there was no corresponding increase over the years.  It is true that for many years particularly due to the difficulty of getting legislation for this class of public servant through the House, the judiciary have been trailing behind other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents not so much an increase to a particular class but rather a re-assessment of the whole position in accordance with present day standards. It is unnecessary for me to point out to the legal men present the unreality, in this day and age, of a salary of £2,500 for a District Justice who must have ten years experience before he is appointed, when Dublin firms are advertising for young boys still wet behind the ears, newly having received their parchments, and offering them £1,500 to £2,000.  Of course, as Deputy Tully rightly points out, it would not be right that these men, due to financial stringency, should be in debt to people appearing before them in their courts.  I regard the District Courts as the most important courts in our land, because they are the poor man's courts, the courts that are used in the main by most of our people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As far as the proverbial law's delays are concerned, the proposed increases in jurisdiction, which will be substantial&mdash;I do not want to go into them now&mdash;in both the District and Circuit Courts will greatly ease any of the law's delays.  I do not accept, incidentally, that we still have the position of &ldquo;Jarandyce and Jarandyce&rdquo; as far as the law's delays are concerned.  It may well be that in many cases it is due to the cases not being ready by the parties themselves or by their legal advisers rather than to the overcrowding of our courts.  At all events, one of the matters being considered by the Committee concerned is the expedition of Court work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For comparison purposes, I should like to put on record two sets of figures.  It should not be forgotten that the men in this salary bracket are subject to very substantial tax liabilities. The rough-and-ready figures I have here in respect of the judiciary indicate that the Chief Justice would <Col N="1305" /> be paying over £3,000 a year in taxes; the Supreme Court judge, approximately £2,500 in tax; a High Court judge, approximately £2,000; a Circuit Court judge, approximately £1,500; and the President of the District Court or a District Justice, about £1,000 in tax.  I mention these figures lest some members of the public might be under the same illusion as they are in regard to Deputies' allowances, that they are free of income tax.  These gentlemen are not free of income tax or surtax and are liable to the full rigours of the law as administered by the officials of the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
    <P>The most realistic comparison that could be made would be with the courts in Northern Ireland.  The figure being paid to the Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland is £9,375; to the Puisne judges of the High Court, £8,125; to the County Court judges, £4,400&mdash;and I might point out that his jurisdiction is far less than that of our Circuit Court judges&mdash;and the Resident Magistrate of Belfast is in receipt of £4,225.  Therefore, it will be seen that in all these comparable offices in Northern Ireland they enjoy substantially higher salaries than the members of our judiciary.</P>
    <P>While Deputy O'Higgins is not too happy about the changes that are being made by way of dealing with this matter in the future by order, I think it is the more sensible way.  Part of the reason why all this business has to be re-assessed now is the cumbersome machinery involved in introducing special legislation, and the fact that these people could not be dealt with when status or other increases were being given to other sections of the community.  In Britain, for instance, they do it by order, but in a different way.  The Government tables a motion in the House approving the order to increase judicial salaries; [Deputy O'Higgins may be in error on this]. What will happen under the new procedure is that the Government will table to give whatever they have decided upon.  That draft order will be laid before the House for 21 sitting days, and during the 21 days, any Member of the House may put down a motion to annul it; he may put down a <Col N="1306" /> motion to annul is merely for the purpose of discussion and withdraw his motion, or if he is not satisfied with the explanation offered, he can express himself accordingly.  After the expiration of that time, the Government can make an order giving effect to the increases.  In my view, a more efficient way of dealing with this matter.  For obvious reasons, there never will be a suitable time for the introduction of legislation increasing judges' salaries. There is always the excuse in respect of people in that category that the time is not opportune because of various difficulties and so on.  However, the fact that they are our most important public servants should not be lost sight of.  It is unfair that, for instance, the higher civil servants should be given an increase while the judges should have to wait until what the Government of the day regard as a suitable time.</P>

Again dealing with a point made by Deputy O'Higgins, I do not think it is satisfactory to stick to the old legislative procedure which involves hanging on for a year or two, or possibly more.  The House and the public would very strongly object to dealing with a matter retrospectively by giving large lump sums&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of retired justices and judges has been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  I understand that any increases given to the other pension classes have been given to them.  I will have a look into the points raised by the Deputy in this connection. I am not very familiar with the details of the men who are retired.  I will take the opportunity of looking up what the position actually is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully has said that a judge's job is a lonely one.  I think a judge's job always is.  I would agree with the Deputy that it is reprehensible if witnesses who come to give evidence in criminal cases are subjected to any indignity in any court.  I can only say I hope his complaint is an isolated one.</P>
      <P>Outside the desirability, which Deputy Tully recognises, of the abolition of the differential between metropolitan and other judges, there is another good reason for the abolition of this differential.  Formerly because of this differential, if a justice in the metropolitan area wanted to transfer to the country, he could not do so without a loss of salary.  This will make the position more flexible.  It will lead to more efficiency and make the whole organisation easier to run. Any Dublin District Justice who for one reason or another wishes to move out of Dublin can now do so for the first time without any financial loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also agrees that <Col N="1308" /> the present salaries are inadequate, and he referred to what he regards as the inadequate pensions for retired judges.  I have already said I hope to look into that matter.  Again, I am grateful to the House for the sensible and expeditious way in which they accepted the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to press this point if the Minister thinks it is not workable.  It would seem to be preferable that something active should be done in this House in connection with these increases rather than something passive being done. What happens under this is that when the Minister proposes to increase the salaries of judges in future, he drafts an order and it is laid before the House.  He will make the order final provided no one moves to set it aside&mdash; I think &ldquo;disapprove&rdquo; is the word used in the Act&mdash;by resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knowing the pressures on the House and how difficult it is for some of us to keep up with the legislation we should be dealing with, it may very well be that when a draft is laid before <Col N="1309" /> the House, while it might be desirable to have a discussion, no one will put down a motion, and the way is then clear for the Minister to make the order final.  It is desirable that the public should know the reasons why increases of this sort are given.  If the Minister were to move in the House that judges' salaries be increased by so much, there would be the advantage of avoiding any delays which might be occasioned by having to introduce it formally as a Bill.  While avoiding that disadvantage, you would retain the advantage that the matter would come before the House for discussion.  However, this is simply a point of view I am putting before the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point of view.  I have given considerable thought to this matter.  I have examined the different procedures and inquired about them in different cases.  I decided that this was the most effective way of dealing with the matter.  At all times any increase to the judiciary is not a matter that will pass unnoticed.  Deputies will appreciate that if an increase were given at the wrong time, there would always be many Deputies who would be very quick to attack any such order being made and bring it to the attention of the public.  I am quite satisfied that this procedure would be very well known by Deputies and by the Press.  As politicians, Deputies will appreciate that any Government who at any time tried to slip through an increase to the judiciary in some quiet way would be fooling themselves.  It is a matter which by its very nature commands public attention.</P>

At all events, I am sure whatever Minister for Justice is concerned, this matter would arise on the Estimate for his Department and he would certainly have to justify the increase given.  If, as Deputy O'Higgins fears, the House did not bother putting down any motion to annul the order, Deputies <Col N="1310" /> could certainly attack the provision on the Minister's Estimate, if it were not justified.</P>

I was referring to Deputy MacEntee's efforts to justify the activities of himself and of the &ldquo;Busted Flush&rdquo;, as Deputy Dillon used to refer to them, here for a while this evening.  I wonder why the effort was made.  As I see it, the position now is that an amendment by Deputy Norton is before the House.  Speakers from both the Government side and the Opposition have indicated they are all against it.  If we are anxious to have the matter dealt with, it simply remains for the question to be put.  If Deputy Norton can get four people to stand up with him, he can call for a division; if he cannot, then that is it.  There has been a colossal waste of time. The Minister for Local Government repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> the same statements. I should like to know from the Minister what exactly the Government are doing.  What are they doing?</P>

However, this system decides that it is the smallest minority that gets the most votes and that the majority gets one vote only.  I want to point out that it is not possible to devise any system of counting the votes or any system of manipulating the votes after the election to establish the fact that there is an overall majority in favour of one candidate, out of the number that presented themselves for election, if the people themselves have said in the ballot boxes that there is not.

      <P>I do not think I am called upon to recapitulate what I said before Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Barrett came in.  Undoubtedly they will read it in the Official Report. I should like to point out that it is not necessary to produce theoretical figures to show that this suggestion that it is possible to establish that there is a majority in favour of one candidate when the people have said that there is not, is a fraud.  I suggest that the figures of either the Wicklow by-election or the Limerick by-election will establish this.  Deputies will see that if the same treatment is given to every voter, it would certainly in the case of Wicklow, and very likely in the case of Limerick, show that there was a majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to go and have his tea, he can; I do not mind.  Nobody attempted to controvert the proof which I have already given that this is the position and that to attempt to prove this on the basis of equating some people's preference votes to actual votes is likely to produce the nonsensical result that there is a majority in favour of more than one, which of course there could not be.  The point is that if three or more candidates decide to contest an election in a single-seat constituency, it is not justifiable to try by an artificial means to arrange for a choice between one particular pairing. Even on the basis of the transferable vote, if three candidates contest an election, there are three possible pairings and there is no justification for artificially trying to deal with one pairing. The three are entitled to stand, and if the people having indicated that there was not a majority in favour of any particular candidate are to be required to decide between any particular pair, then they should have the opportunity of deciding between each of the three possible pairings of the three candidates.</P>
      <P>In the case of four candidates, there are six possible pairings and in the case of five, there are ten possible pairings.  Of course it would not be practicable to arrange for this to be done and so some group of people whom Deputy Dillon has described in his own picturesque language as cranks and crackpots decided on this system which is based on the fraudulent pretence that it gives a second chance to people who fail to elect their candidate whereas in fact it gives that only to some and these are selected in the most undemocratic way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have challenged Deputies on the opposite benches on a number of occasions to say just why it was that of the 18,258 people who voted for candidates not deemed to have been elected in Wicklow, 8,470 of these should have been given multiple votes and 9,788 <Col N="1317" /> should have been given only one vote; why in the case of East Limerick where 21,399 who voted for candidates other than the candidate deemed to have been elected, 11,248 got a second chance and some of them a third chance, while 10,151 got one vote only. It is quite clear that the system of voting in single-seat constituencies as proposed here is a discriminatory system which it is not possible to justify.  The question of the fanciful projection of what might happen, which was put forward by certain professors on television, was raised here and it has been adequately dealt with by Deputy MacEntee.  It shows the ridiculous things that can be said by people who discuss matters about which they know nothing.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. D. Barrett states that there is no need for this exercise.  Of course we are not alone in thinking that there is, because, as Deputy Barrett knows, Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, thinks that there is need for this exercise. Deputy Barrett says that this is brought in for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would not accuse Deputy Cosgrave of being so false to his own Party as to be in favour of a proposition that can only benefit the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would ask Deputy Barrett to explain how this must benefit the Fianna Fáil Party.  Surely it obviously provides the most favourable circumstances for any Party to produce its policy to the people because there will be no question of a number of different personalities and each Party will have one candidate in the single-seat constituency to put forward their policy?  Surely if it is possible for this full-time policy drafting committee of the Fine Gael Party eventually to produce a policy that is better than Fianna Fáil's, it must be possible in the circumstances we propose to convince the people of this?  It is quite clear that in putting forward this proposal what we are doing is endeavouring to implement Deputy Cosgrave's wishes in spite of the Party that he is supposed to lead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also spoke and, as we know, Deputy Tully has already disclosed his reasons for opposing this <Col N="1318" /> proposition; he sees a prospect, if these amendments are not made by the people, of a cushy seat for himself in a rearranged County Louth constituency. That is how he described it himself.  Deputy Tully asked me to deal with a period which, he said, Deputy MacEntee overlooked, that is, the period from 1951 to 1954 when the Fianna Fáil Government were maintained in office by a group of Independents. I was not here at the time myself, but I can well imagine that it was not a very comfortable position to have somebody, such as the vice-chairman of the Labour Party, who has described what his attitude was when he was actually a member of the Government, namely, to try to spring the trap on his colleagues.  That individual never got an opportunity of springing the trap on Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>We are a democratic Party, and when we have an application from an individual to join, he is accepted, but in this case it was very quickly seen that he was of no benefit to the Fianna Fáil Party and he never got any opportunity in that Party of springing the trap on his colleagues in Fianna Fáil.  However, he was not long in springing the trap on Deputy Tully when he joined the Labour Party; we all know he succeeded in ousting Deputy Tully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to conclude by directing members of the Opposition back to the amendment we are supposed to be discussing, that is, the amendment which proposes this unjustifiable system of the transferable vote in single-seat constituencies.  This amendment proposes the retention of a blatantly discriminatory system for purely tactical purposes.  I suggest the evidence would have to be very strong indeed that it was tactically necessary to require <Col N="1319" /> this to be done in order to justify continuing an unjust system of manipulating people's votes after the election. I believe the people will see what is involved in this and decide to avoid, first of all, the inevitable effects of the situation the present system is designed to bring about, which is a large number of small groups after an election, indecisive results depriving the people of a chance to choose a Government, with a resultant stalemate, such as we see in both Belgium and Italy at the moment.  At the same time, the people will see that this affords them an opportunity of securing for themselves the substantially better representation inherent in the system of single-seat constituencies.  I also believe the people will see the discrimination involved in the transferable vote system and will, in fact, decide in favour of the principle of one-man-one-vote and all voters treated equally which is, in my opinion, the fundamental basis of the democratic system.</P>

      <P>As recently as 15th of last month, Deputy Fitzpatrick stated: &ldquo;I think constituencies ought to be revised every 12 years.&rdquo;  I do not see how one can keep pace with the changes of mind of Deputy Fitzpatrick. As far as I know, 12 years has been the period laid down since the foundation of the State and, if anything, I think it is too short.  Too frequent revisions of constituencies are not desirable in anybody's interest.  Shifting people from one constituency to another, shifting Deputies from one constituency to another and disrupting Party organisations is not required constitutionally any more frequently than every 12 years.  In fact, the position established as a result of the action taken by the Fine Gael Party in the High Court requires revision to take place every five years.  On the one hand, Deputy Fitzpatrick is trying desperately to hang on to a position which requires revision to take place every five years and, on the other hand, he is purporting to insert an amendment into the Constitution requiring revision every ten years.  I think 12 years is quite satisfactory and I see no reason whatever for reducing it.</P>

      <P>Article 2º of Part VI of the Schedule reads:</P>
      <P>A Constituency Commission shall consist of seven members appointed by Dáil Éireann, of whom one (who shall be the Chairman of the Commission) shall be appointed from the judges of the Supreme Court and High Court on the nomination of the Chief Justice, three shall be appointed from the members of Dáil Éireann on the nomination of the Taoiseach and three shall be appointed, from such members of Dáil Éireann as are determined in accordance with law to be in opposition, on nomination provided for by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendments which are in my name is to make it clear that the Chairman of the Commission shall, in fact, be appointed by the Chief Justice.  The section as it stands states that the Chairman shall be appointed on the nomination of the Chief Justice &mdash;whatever that may mean.  I want to make it clear that in my opinion and the opinion of this Party the Chairman should be appointed by the Chief Justice.  I also want to make it clear that the three members of the Commission who shall be appointed on the nomination of the Taoiseach shall, in fact, be appointed by the Taoiseach and, finally, I want there to be no doubt whatever that the three members <Col N="1324" /> of the Opposition shall be appointed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The first amendment&mdash;amendment No. 7&mdash;proposes to substitute &ldquo;by the Chief Justice&rdquo; for &ldquo;on the nomination of the Chief Justice&rdquo; in relation to the Chairman, thereby making it clear beyond doubt that the Chairman of this Commission shall be a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court and that he shall be appointed by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>My next amendment is amendment No. 8 and it simply proposes that the three Government Deputies, as I call them, who are to serve on the Commission shall be appointed by the Taoiseach.  It is stated in the section as it stands that they are to be appointed on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  I want to make it clear that they shall be appointed by the Taoiseach.  But, important as the provisions for the appointment of the Chairman and the three Government representatives on the Commission are, it is vital that the three Opposition Deputies who are to serve on the Commission will, in fact, be Opposition Deputies and that they will, in fact, be appointed by the members of the Opposition.  As the section stands, it would be open to a Government with a majority in this House to determine that three Independent Members were members of the Opposition and to appoint those three Independent Members to serve on the Commission as representing the Opposition.  That could serve to disfranchise in the present Dáil, for example, the two Opposition Parties, Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    <P>I accept that the intention of the Government and of the Minister in drafting this section is, in fact, to provide that the Opposition shall have three representatives on the Commission for three representatives of the Government and an independent Chairman. I accept without question that that is what the Government and the Minister have in mind but I put it to the House and to the Minister that the subsection as it stands leaves it open to a Government with a majority in the House to elect three members to this Commission who would, in fact, represent the Opposition and who might technically be members of the Opposition <Col N="1325" /> in so far as they did not come under the Whip of the Government Party but, nevertheless, they might be supporters of the Government of the day.  That is what I want to avoid and I think it is what the House would wish to avoid.</P>
    <P>If my amendments are accepted, the Chief Justice will appoint the Chairman; the Taoiseach will appoint three members and the Opposition in the House as defined by law will elect three members from among the members of the Opposition as defined by law to serve on the Commission.  I put it to the House and to the Minister that there is nothing controversial about that.  It is a reasonable safety provision to introduce. I will make the Minister a present of saying it is not necessarily a safety provision against the Minister and his Party, but in my opinion, it is a necessary provision to safeguard the Opposition of the day from the Government of the day and to ensure that the Opposition of the day will in fact have their rightful representation, to wit, three members on this Commission.  I trust I have made the position clear.  I will be glad to have the Minister's attitude on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3, 2º, states that the Constituency Commission shall consist of seven members appointed by Dáil Éireann.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment does not propose to amend that wording.  These amendments he has submitted clash with that provision that the members shall be appointed by Dáil Éireann. They obviously cannot be appointed by the Chief Justice, by the Taoiseach and by the Opposition and also appointed by Dáil Éireann.  It would be preferable that the seven members of the Commission should be appointed by the Dáil instead of those who select them.</P>
      <P>It is the normal practice in the case of statutory boards to provide for the appointment of a member or members on the nomination of specified persons and bodies.  Therefore, the procedure proposed is not a new one.  The Constitution itself provides for the appointment of persons by the President on the nomination of the Government and the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Practical difficulties would arise if the appointment of the seven members of the Commission were not made simultaneously and by one body. Section 3, 1º, requires that a Constituency Commission shall be established but it does not say by whom it shall be established.  This is because the establishment will be effected by appointing seven named persons to form a Commission.  This could only be done if one body were responsible for making all seven appointments.  It is essential to be able to determine precisely the date on which a Commission was established in view of the obligation placed on it to report within three months of its establishment.  If members are to be appointed by different persons and at different times the question would arise of when would the Commission be established, and therefore when did the period of three months from the time of its establishment arise.  This is especially so as four members may constitute a quorum.  Provisions would obviously have to be inserted to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the appointment by the Dáil of the seven members of a Commission will be purely a formal measure.  It will be necessary to promote legislation to deal with matters of detail relating to the nomination of members and the working of a Commission which would be inappropriate for inclusion in the Constitution. This legislation will provide that the first step in the establishment of a Commission will be the passing of a resolution by the Dáil directing that the necessary steps be taken for the establishment of a Commission.  Under the arrangements visualised seven nominations, and only seven, could be made and put before the Dáil.  The Dáil will then appoint the seven persons duly nominated, and no others, as a Commission.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government Party would not in fact be able to interfere in the selection of the three Opposition representatives.  I may say that the Taoiseach in his Second Reading speech on the Bill indicated that it is the intention that the choice with regard to the Opposition Members <Col N="1327" /> should be made by the Opposition and that he would welcome the views of Deputies as to how this might be done. I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that if the Opposition put forward a workable system for selecting Opposition Members, it will certainly be considered.</P>
    <P>The proposals we have in mind would provide machinery to determine first, who are the Opposition Members of the Dáil and then enable three of the members to be appointed as members of a Constituency Commission.  As I said, I would welcome suggestions as to how this should be done.  I think I have shown there are big difficulties in the way of accepting Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment, in particular the fact that the Commission is required to report within three months of its establishment and that, if it is to be established in fact piecemeal by different people appointing members not necessarily at the same time, it would be difficult to decide when in fact the Commission had been established.  The section already says that the Constituency Commission shall consist of seven members appointed by Dáil Éireann.  Obviously, it would be unrealistic and contradictory to provide in the very same subsection that the members shall be appointed by Dáil Éireann and also by other people. Legislation has to be introduced to provide for the nomination of the members of the Opposition.  This legislation will ensure that the Government Party will have no say whatever in the selection of the three Members of the Opposition to act on the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When speaking to an earlier amendment, I emphasised that I quite appreciated that the actual wording of my amendments might not be perfect and that I put them down in order to argue a principle.  In the event of the Minister accepting my amendments, I would expect him to have them drafted by his parliamentary draftsman and reintroduced on a later Stage.  I quite agree with the Minister's opening remarks that in order to perfect my <Col N="1328" /> amendment, I would have to delete &ldquo;by Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in the subsection and substitute the words &ldquo;as hereinafter provided in this subsection.&rdquo; Then the amendment would be perfect.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated there is a precedent here for appointing people on to various boards by the Dáil on the nomination of certain people.  That is all very well.  I agree there is a precedent for so appointing people by a majority of the Dáil to serve on boards &mdash;people who have designated by associations such as the Association of Municipal Authorities, the General Council of County Councils and bodies of that sort.  But I want to put it to the Minister that here we are dealing with something entirely different.  I am satisfied this provision is intended to do what it appears to do.  It is intended to ensure that constituencies will be revised on a fair and equitable basis, fair and equitable to the Government as the largest Party in the House and fair and equitable to each Opposition Party and each independent.  That is what is behind this subsection in the Schedule if there is anything behind it and I accept without qualification that there is.</P>
      <P>In order to do that, and ensure as far as possible that the constituencies are arrived at in a fair and equitable manner, the Minister has offered a Commission and he says that the Chairman of the Commission is to be a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court and with that I entirely agree.  The Minister says that the judge is to be appointed by Dáil Éireann, on the nomination of the Chief Justice.  I do not put it any stronger than saying that I believe it would be more satisfactory if the judge of the High Court or Supreme Court were appointed by the Chief Justice.  I am not very fussy about that but I think it would be more desirable as I suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next provision is that three members are to be appointed, presumably to represent the Government Party and, as the subsection stands, these three members are to be appointed by Dáil Éireann, on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  I think it would be a neater job if they were appointed by the Taoiseach.  Again, I am not too fussy about that but I am <Col N="1329" /> very concerned that the three members who purport to represent the Opposition should, in fact, be members of the Opposition and should in fact be appointed by the Opposition.  In other words, I want to ensure that the Opposition as defined by law should decide who will represent them on this Commission.  This is fundamental and goes to the basis of the protection offered by this subsection.</P>
    <P>I take a firm stand on that.  As the subsection stands you could have a Government&mdash;I do not say the Government&mdash;appointing three Independents to represent the Opposition, to the complete exclusion of the one Opposition Party in the House or two Opposition Parties.  That is one situation which could arise.  The Opposition are entitled to be represented on this Commission by three members of the Opposition whom they think best qualified and most able to represent them and argue their case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The overall provision says they shall be appointed by Dáil Éireann.  I want to develop this a little further.  The Opposition are entitled to be represented on this Commission by three members, who, in the opinion of the Opposition, are the people best qualified and most able to represent them. A majority of the House could, by designing by law what constituted the Opposition, appoint three Indepdent members who would not necessarily be members of the Opposition.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall come to that in a moment. These three members might be members of the Opposition because they did not come under the Government <Col N="1330" /> Whip, but in all other respects might be supporters of the Government. Further, if that were not done, a Government of the day could decide to appoint three members of the Opposition whom the Opposition considered were totally unsuited to represent them and unqualified in the opinion of the Opposition to go before a Commission or serve on it and argue the case for the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall came to that immediately.  We are now dealing with what has been referred to as a constitutional safeguard. I think the Deputy will agree with me that we are writing this into the Constitution as a constitutional safeguard.  I want to write into this constitutional safeguard the method by which these people are to be appointed because if we leave that constitutional safeguard loose and viable&mdash;to use a modern term&mdash;the Government of the day, with their majority in the House, can then decide how the nomination should be made, who is to be the Opposition and from where these three members shall come.  If this is to be a constitutional safeguard&mdash;I take it that is the intention&mdash;provision for appointing these people must be written into the Constitution.  Otherwise it ceases to be a constitutional safeguard and becomes such a device for safeguarding the Opposition as the Government of the day may, by its majority, determine is good for the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust I have made that case clear and if I have, I think it is unanswerable. I repeat that either this is a constitutional safeguard or it is not, and I assume it is being offered as a constitutional safeguard in order to endeavour to convince the people of the country that if they accept single-member constituencies with a single non-transferable vote, there is one thing they can be certain of, that those constituencies will, as far as possible, be fairly determined. They are being assured that the provisions of this constitutional device make certain that three members of the House acceptable to the Opposition will be selected by the Opposition with three members of the Government <Col N="1331" /> Party and an independent chairman to form the Commission.</P>
    <P>What I am arguing and what I intend to continue to argue and urge is that subsection (2) of Part VI means no such thing.  As it stands, it means that a judge will be chairman and I do not think it fundamental whether he be appointed by the House or by the Chief Justice&mdash;I would prefer him to be appointed by the Chief Justice&mdash;and the next thing laid down is that three members will be appointed to represent the Government.  The Government of the day, whoever they may be, with a majority in the House, may be relied on to see that three members acceptable to them will be appointed by them.  It goes on to say that three other members to be decided upon by this House in accordance with the law will represent the Opposition.  That means that the three members who will be decided upon by an Act of this House, put through this House in the teeth of the Opposition, perhaps, as this Bill will be put through this House in the teeth of the Opposition, will represent the Opposition.  I say that is not the safeguard that it holds itself out to be, and I intend to stand on these amendments as something fundamental to the Commission provision in this Bill.  If the Government Party do not accept these amendments or give me an assurance that on a later stage of this Bill they will introduce amendments which will give effect to the principles behind these amendments as outlined by me, I will be convinced that the Government are not serious about this Commission and do not intend it to be the safeguard which they hold it out to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is being unduly nervous on this point.  I agree that the provision for the Commission is a constitutional safeguard, but the Constitution is only a document <Col N="1333" /> setting out the general principles, not the details, which can be dealt with more properly by legislation.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is consistently forgetting the second last line of this subsection which refers to the nomination of members from the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Supposing we assume that something really sinister is going to happen and that some Government, not necessarily this one, but some Government in the future, prescribes by law some fanciful procedure for nomination which allows three independents to be nominated to represent the entire Opposition. That in itself would be a flagrant breach of the Constitution, and Deputy Fitzpatrick forgets that no Government has the authority to interpret the Constitution.  In the last analysis, there is always the protection of the courts, and any legislation which an overbearing Government might introduce would undoubtedly be held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I thought the whole point of these Bills was to avoid going to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  We do not want to have to do that, but any Government would realise that to bring in a law which would discriminate against the Opposition so far as representation on this Commission is concerned, would be so flagrant a breach of the Constitution that it would be thrown out immediately by the Supreme Court.  The Deputy is trying to see difficulties where no difficulties can possibly arise.  The Commission must be representative equally of the Government Party and the Opposition Parties, and equal representation must be based on fair principles of law.  As regards the Opposition members, it is quite clearly stated that it is not an appointment by Dáil Éireann from nominations provided by law.  There is no discretion given to the Dáil.  They must simply accept the nominations and elect those nominees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is far better that the Dáil should <Col N="1334" /> be the appointing body.  If you have various people, the Chief Justice or the Leader of the main Opposition Party making appointments you will get into all sorts of technical difficulties in the event of resignations and so on, and there is the provision later on that Dáil Éireann may terminate the membership of a member of the Commission. Obviously that could not be done if a member of the Commission had been appointed by somebody else.  It is essential that this Commission should be a body set up by Dáil Éireann, but it is equally essential that it should be representative and, consequently, that the appointments should be made only from nominations provided by law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly clear that there would be only seven names before the Dáil for appointment.  It is essential, in view of the fact that the Commission is required to report within a definite time from the date of its appointment, that the appointment of all the members must be at the same time.  I suggest it is reasonable to provide that the manner in which the Opposition representatives on the Commission should be appointed would be decided by law.  I can assure the House that we intend to bring legislation forward here, and the intention is to provide by law that the Opposition Members should be selected by the Opposition themselves.  Obviously we will need to spell out the procedure in considerable detail which would be inappropriate to the Constitution.  In view of the difficulties I have already outlined, it seems to me to be best to let the proposed provision of the Constitution stand and deal with the detailed arrangements in ordinary legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to what Deputy J.A. Costello said in regard to this matter on 26th November, 1958.  As reported at column 1028 of the Official Report, Deputy Costello said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a fundamental mistake to put the details of this Commission into the Bill.  If it had anything to do with carrying out my own admonition in the speech I made in the Engineers' Hall, I would put into <Col N="1335" /> the Constitution the principles on which any such commission shall be set up and the principles on which their work shall be guided so that if the commission were set up contrary to those principles as laid down in the Constitution or if they operated against them, then their action would be liable to be questioned in the Supreme Court in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution as being unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable attitude, that we should not, in fact, clutter up the Constitution with unnecessary detail, that this detail should be dealt with by legislation, and that is the intention.  I see the difficulties which I pointed out in accepting Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  I have been trying to see if there is any way in which his point could be met, although I agree with Deputy Booth that it is fairly farfetched and I think Deputy Fitzpatrick realises that himself.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that what Deputy Fitzpatrick has in mind could be met in this way.  The provision at present reads: &ldquo;... and three shall be appointed, from such Members of Dáil Éireann as are determined in accordance with law to be in opposition, on nomination provided for by law.&rdquo;  If we inserted after the word &ldquo;nomination&rdquo;&ldquo;by such Members&rdquo; the provision would read: &ldquo;... and three shall be appointed, from such Members of Dáil Éireann as are determined in accordance with law to be in opposition, on nomination by such Members provided for by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The result of that would be that it would be provided in the Constitution that the law must arrange for these Members to be nominated by Deputies who are determined to be in opposition. If Deputy Fitzpatrick agrees that will meet his case I will undertake to see if there is any technical objection to an amendment on those lines between now and Report Stage.  It appears to me that it would achieve what Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to achieve, that is, to ensure that it would be Members of the Opposition who would nominate the three Opposition Members of the Commission, and it <Col N="1336" /> would still maintain the position that the appointment of the Commission would be all done at the one time by the Dáil.  Therefore the difficulties I foresee would not arise, though I must say there would still be some conceivable difficulties but they are nearly as unlikely as the difficulties Deputy Fitzpatrick foresees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I said when moving these amendments, I regard the points I am making as fundamental because the provisions of this subsection are offered to the House and to the country as a safeguard which will ensure that the constituencies are fairly delineated by a Commission with a judge as chairman, and three Members of the Government Party and three members of the Opposition Party.  I want to ensure that these will be three members of the genuine Opposition and three members acceptable to the Opposition.  In the course of his remarks, Deputy Booth said I am seeing difficulties which he thinks do not exist, and difficulties which will be decided upon by the Supreme Court, if anything is done which is repugnant to the Constitution.  It appears that Deputy Booth thinks there is some slight room for argument.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a little concession by offering to write in certain words.  I want to point out to the House that if this Bill is passed by the House, as I am sure it will be and if, God forbid, it is accepted by the people, as I believe it will not, we will then have enacted something which if it turns out to be unworkable, or if it does not serve the purpose for which it is enacted, can only be altered or remedied by a referendum at a cost, according to present-day values, of something in the region of £150,000.</P>

      <Col N="1340" /> 2º Every law enacted by the Oireachtas which is in any respect repugnant to this Constitution or to any provision thereof, shall, but to the extent only of such repugnancy, be invalid.</P>
    <P>I think this is a completely unnecessary amendment.  It is obvious from Article 15.4 that every law is subject to the entire Constitution and that no law may be enacted which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution or any provision thereof.  The only constitutional provisions directly bearing on Constituency Commissions and constituencies will be contained in Article 16 and in similar circumstances the Constitution when treating of other matters such as Presidential, Dáil and Seanad elections, uses the phrase &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Article&rdquo;, or some variation of that phrase.  For instance, in Article 12.5, the sentence occurs &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Article, elections for the office of President shall be regulated by law&rdquo;. Again, in Article 16.7 we have &ldquo;Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article, elections for membership of Dáil Éireann, including the filling of casual vacancies, shall be regulated in accordance with law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 18.10.1º says: &ldquo;Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article elections of the elected members of Seanad Éireann shall be regulated by law.  &ldquo;Therefore, it is the practice in the Constitution to refer specifically to the provisions of the Article of the Constitution which deals with the matter that is appropriate to the particular Article.  But, at the same time, as I said, Article 15.4 provides that every law is in fact subject to the entire Constitution and obviously, for the sake of consistency in the Constitution, I feel I must oppose this Article&mdash;it already being provided in the Constitution that the whole Constitution must be observed in regard to every law enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>In Part VI, section 8.1º, page 10, line 53, to delete &ldquo;1969&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;1970&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was being drafted, the 15th April, 1969, was selected as the likely date by which all the necessary arrangements to enable an election to be held on the new basis, including enactment of legislation relating to the Constituency Commission and consequential electoral legislation providing for new voting and counting procedures and other matters, determination of the constituencies by the Commission, and so on, would be completed. The words &ldquo;or occurring next after such earlier date as may be determined by resolution passed by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, which amendment No. 13 proposes to delete, were included in case the arrangements should be completed before 15th April, 1969.  While it now appears unlikely that all the necessary arrangements will be made by the 15th April, 1969, it is still desirable to retain these words in the subsection to cover such a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> Another reason why amendment No. 13 cannot be accepted is that I propose, in amendment No. 12, to substitute &ldquo;1970&rdquo; for &ldquo;1969&rdquo; in subsection 1º of section 8.  In case all arrangements have not been completed by 15th April, 1969, which is very likely, it is essential to extend the operation of existing laws and constituencies to a later date, subject to the Dáil being enabled to fix an earlier date if the arrangements are completed earlier.  The date now being proposed &mdash;15th April, 1970&mdash;gives ample time for completion of all arrangements.  It is likely that they will be completed in advance of that date and it is essential to retain the provision which enables the Dáil to fix an earlier date by resolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on acceptance of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 which were moved by Deputy Fitzpatrick on the Committee Stage of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968.  In accepting the amendment, which substitutes a new formula for calculation of the national average for the one proposed, I said that under the new formula there was some doubt whether or not the second seat for an outgoing Ceann Comhairle <Col N="1345" /> would have to be taken into account in calculating the national average population per member.  I am now advised that it is desirable to make it clear under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill that the second seat for an outgoing Ceann Comhairle will not be taken into account in calculating either the ratio between the number of members to be elected for each constituency and the population of each constituency for the purposes of subsection (3) of section 2 of Article 16 of the existing Constitution or the quotient for each constituency and the national average population per member for the purpose of the new Subsection (3) which will be substituted for the existing subsection (3) of section 2 of Article 16 if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, is enacted.</P>
    <P>It would not in fact be practicable to do otherwise because it will not be known at the time of a determination of constituencies whether or not the outgoing Ceann Comhairle will seek re-election following the next dissolution after the determination.  It will only be in the event of the outgoing Ceann Comhairle seeking re-election that the law will enable him to be deemed to be elected as a second member for a constituency.</P>

It has always been assumed that that was not desirable and the provision up to now in fact reduced the representation of the particular constituency by one.  In Britain there is no such provision, but there is a gentleman's agreement that the Speaker's seat is not contested.

I know Deputy Fitzpatrick did because we discussed this on the Third Amendment and, on that, I accepted Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment providing for a different definition of the national average.  He and I had quite a discussion on it and I pointed out to him that some further amendment might be required to clarify the position with regard to the provision to be made for the Ceann Comhairle's seat.  It was on that basis I accepted Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment to the Third Amendment <Col N="1350" /> of the Constitution Bill.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick will remember that.</P>

That has always been the assumption. To provide merely that the Ceann Comhairle's seat should not be contested, which is the present position, would in fact deprive the electorate in the particular constituency of the opportunity of electing anybody at the next election and that is why this provision has been inserted.  It was reasonable to assume, I think, that it was accepted by all Parties.</P>

      <P>Are we being confused? As I understand it, the person who is <Col N="1351" /> elected as Ceann Comhairle moves from a constituency to the office of Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle's Office is never in the political arena but the holder of the Office may at some stage have to contest a future election, but he will not contest it as outgoing Ceann Comhairle.  He will contest it as an outgoing Deputy.  Is that correct?</P>

I should point out that if the Office of Ceann Comhairle becomes vacant and the Dáil selects someone else to be Ceann Comhairle that will not involve a by-election in that constituency.  The position will be that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle at the next election will be deemed to be elected and that constituency will have an election the same as every other constituency.</P>

      <P>In a set of circumstances such as this, where you can have of 144 Deputies, 72 elected on the Government side and 72 Deputies elected on the Opposition side, the outgoing Government usually have the controlling of the Chair.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the holder of that office would be a Government Deputy.  The Government could ask that Deputy to resign as Ceann Comhairle and that would give them 73 and reduce the Opposition to 71.</P>

The position is that the Government decided some time ago to amend the Constitution in two respects: first, by abolishing proportional representation and introducing the single member constituency; and, secondly, by introducing a tolerance of one-sixth.  They decided to attempt these amendments by way of a single Bill or a package deal, as I have said on other occasions, and in that package deal provided in one Bill they included a Commission to delineate the single member constituencies. They did that as an inducement or as an insurance to the House and to the people that the constituencies would be fairly arranged.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Until it was suppressed, and as expressed in the free press of this country and the attitude of the Opposition Parties in this House made it apparent to the Minister and the Government that there was no hope of getting this package deal through in one Bill.  The Government were then forced to abandon the idea of attempting these two amendments in one Bill.  They decided to divide or split up the proposals. We were then presented with the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I am taking them in this order because it demonstrates what I want to point out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were then presented with the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, a Bill which proposes to establish single-member constituencies and to abolish PR.  This Fourth <Col N="1365" /> Amendment of the Constitution Bill contained in it a provision that if the Bill became law, and if the single-member constituencies were established, those constituencies would be arranged, mapped out and delineated by a Commission consisting of a High Court judge, three members of the Government Party of the day and three members of the Opposition.  Of course, the object of including that provision was by way of an inducement to the people to support it.</P>
    <P>It was an assurance to the people that the Government would not gerrymander the constituencies, that they would not rig them to suit themselves, and that these new constituencies would be arranged and decided upon by a Commission consisting of three Government Deputies, three Opposition Deputies and presided over by an independent chairman in the person of a High Court or Supreme Court judge. As I say, the object in that was to lend respectability to the proposal, to give confidence to the people in the proposal and to endeavour in that way to get support for it in the country.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Minister and the Government have no faith in their effort to get the Fourth Amendment accepted by the people.  They know it is doomed to failure: they know the people will not accept it. They know very well that the people believe proportional representation is the best system for electing a Government to govern this country.  They know that when the people have spoken, we will still have PR in the multi-seat constituencies and that they will have to operate that.  The Government know well that their effort to parade 95 Fianna Fáil Deputies into this House after the next general election, on less than 40 per cent of the votes cast in that election, will not work because the people will not stand for it.</P>
    <P>The Government then in their desire to establish themselves as a one-Party dictatorship here looked around for some other way of doing it and presented us with the tolerance Bill as it is called, that is, the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Under <Col N="1366" /> that Bill, the Government seek authority to depart from the provision of the Constitution which says that the same number of people in the country shall be required to elect a Deputy in one constituency as in another.  That is what is known as the national average. The Government seek power in this House to depart by one-sixth from the national average, up or down.  The effect of that is that under the Bill as it stands a population of 16,667 may be entitled to elect a Deputy in one constituency, while in another constituency it may take a population of 23,333 to elect a Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a case for this on the ground that it is necessary to provide for the rural areas as against the city areas.  All that has been thrashed out, and it might not be relevant to thrash it out again on this amendment.  The Minister with his majority has passed the Second and Committee Stages of this Bill which gives him authority to arrange the constituencies in the manner which I have just spoken of, that is, a population of 23,333 in one constituency may have a Deputy, while in another constituency a population of 16,667 only may have a Deputy.</P>
    <P>It would be obvious to the House and obvious to the country that unless these constituencies were arranged in a scrupulously honest and impartial manner this proposal and this tolerance could lead to wholesale gerrymandering and rigging of the constituencies in the most disgraceful way to the unfair advantage of the Government of the day.  The Government of the day which will arrange these constituencies, if this Bill goes through and is accepted by the people and the fourth amendment is not, are the present Government. The Minister in charge of electoral law and electoral reform is the Minister for Local Government.  I do not think the Minister for Local Government will be offended if I describe him as the political boss of the Fianna Fáil Party, as a man who thinks from morning to night in terms of politics. as a man who has acted as Director of Elections for the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the length and breadth of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is the man to whom we are being invited to hand over the arrangement of these constituencies.  I think, therefore, the House and the country will be satisfied that it is something much more than an oversight, that it is something much more than an accident, that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill&mdash;the tolerance Bill&mdash; contains no provision for a Commission to arrange the constituencies, although Deputy Booth, who seems to be holding the Minister's hand through this debate, seemed to think there was a provision in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill for a Commission.</P>
      <P>I have raised this in one form or another through the Committee Stage of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The answer I always got from the Minister was that he could not put the Commission provisions into both Bills because, if he did, the Constitution would look foolish.  Now, the effect of the amendment I am moving is to incorporate into the tolerance Bill, the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the self-same constitutional safeguards by way of a Constituency Commission as the Minister has offered us in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
      <P>I should say I have deliberately drafted the amendment so that the Commission provisions, if they are incorporated in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, will read, word for word, as the provisions for the Commission in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  In other words, I have deliberately left out the amendments which I tried to get the Minister to accept to the Commission provisions in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I therefore move the amendment subject to a suggestion that, if the Minister accepts my amendment, he will incorporate in it the amendments I proposed to the Commission provisions of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I say that the Commission provisions of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill should be incorporated in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I say they are equally necessary in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to prevent gerrymandering, to prevent a rigging of the constituencies and to prevent the Minister from using the tolerance for unfair political purposes.  Under the law as it stands at the present time&mdash;I have put it on the record of this House&mdash; by virtue of a decision of the Supreme Court on the Electoral Act of 1961, the Minister is entitled to take into consideration, in arranging his constituencies, county boundaries, town-land boundaries, electoral divisions, the presence of rivers, mountains and lakes but, in addition to that, he is taking the right here to operate the one-sixth tolerance without any regard to mountains, lakes, electoral divisions, townlands or county boundaries. I argued that out with the Minister on the Committee Stage.  I leave it to the test of any constitutional authority to decide it.</P>
    <P>I say, therefore, that the constitutional safeguard which is being offered in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is absolutely essential here if this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is passed. If the amendment is not accepted and this safeguard is not given then we are open to wholesale gerrymandering, wholesale rigging of the constituencies, unfair discrimination and the operation of the political boss for political Party purposes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I have specifically provided here in this amendment that, in the event of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, becoming law as the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1968, these amendments which I am now putting forward shall immediately stand repealed because they will not be required&mdash; they will be in the other Bill if, God forbid, that Bill is passed&mdash;and that gets over the Minister's argument that it would be silly to write them twice into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to give any <Col N="1369" /> valid reason why, if he accepts this constitutional safeguard by way of the Constituency Commission in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, he will not accept it in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. I hope he does accept it.  But, if he does not accept it, I want to tell the House&mdash;and I would certainly tell the country&mdash;that the Minister refuses to accept it because he knows that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill will not be accepted and he is relying on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to carry out the evil political designs which prompted him, in the first instance, to revise our electoral law.</P>
    <P>I conclude by challenging the Minister to say clearly to the House and to the country why he refuses to accept this amendment, if he does refuse to accept it: why he refuses to write into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill the constitutional safeguards which he has offered to the country in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill &mdash; in the likely event of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill being rejected and the unlikely event of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill being accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why the Minister should refuse this amendment.  What Deputy Fitzpatrick seeks to put into this Bill represents the only acceptable part of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which has already been before the House.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill does not pass the scrutiny of the Irish people&mdash;and I do not believe it will&mdash;it is terribly desirable that this amendment should go into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again I have asked the Minister on another Stage of another Bill why, if he wished to amend the Constitution in the manner set out in Part VI of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, he did not introduce another Bill concurrently with the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution incorporating <Col N="1370" /> this amendment by itself.  He probably would have had the unanimous support of this House and he certainly would have had the support of the people for this highly desirable measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister might take this opportunity to explain why he determined to put the Irish people in this dilemma by inserting only in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill these highly desirable measures.  Does he mean to put to every voter who goes to the polls in the forthcoming referendum this proposal: if you do not vote for the destruction of PR, you cannot vote for a Constituency Commission?  This is among the reasons why Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested in this amendment that these highly desirable proposals should also be inserted in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>I would be deeply interested to know what reason the Minister can give for refusing to incorporate in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill these proposals, particularly having regard to the provision which Deputy Fitzpatrick has so thoughtfully inserted that in the event of the Fourth Amendment passing, these provisions will not come into force. There is no relevant reason why the Minister should refuse to put into the Third Amendment Bill something which he has proposed to the country already in a different context.  If he does not do so, you are driven to the regrettable conclusions Deputy Fitzpatrick has already put forward. I await with interest the Minister's explanation why he inserted this completely irrelevant portion of the Bill into the Fourth Amendment Bill. Obviously, and in commonsense, it should be an entirely separate proposal. However, having done so, the Minister now finds himself in this dilemma: he has to give to the House and the people a cogent reason why if they want to reject the proposals in the Fourth Amendment, he will not give them a second bite of the cherry in the Third Amendment and give them an opportunity to vote for the <Col N="1371" /> proposals which on the Fourth Amendment he told us are highly desirable.</P>

      <P>The amendment is eminently reasonable and would represent the point of view of most people.  Constituency revision is always a matter which gives ground for suspicion in any country.  I know that the revisions which have taken place here in the past have led to accusations of one kind or another, that the Government in office were utilising or certainly were in a position to utilise their office and that the Minister in particular was in a position to utilise his office, in order to revise the constituencies in the interest of his political Party.  That is one of the facts of political life.  In the neighbouring island of Britain, which the Minister so clearly admires and to which the Fianna Fáil Party are so clearly dedicated that they want to adopt the system of election they have there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now that we are being told to be good little British boys and to do everything that Britain does, let us at least have regard to the fact&mdash;I am sure the Minister will, because he has learned the British lesson and the British way&mdash;that in Britain when they revise constituencies, they do it through a commission so that at least whatever emerges from the commission's recommendations and whatever leads to a constituency revision appears to be done fairly.  As the Chair knows and as every Deputy <Col N="1372" /> knows, there is no doubt that the proposal to abolish PR will be emphatically defeated by the people.  That is one of the facts of politics which the Minister is trying to digest, causing him some facial and other disquiet.</P>
      <P>However, out of evil perhaps some good may come.  I do not know what the fate of the tolerance Bill is going to be&mdash;I think it will also be defeated &mdash;but lest it might not be, it would be a very good safeguard and a very good protection for Deputies in all Parties to have the assurance&mdash;and I say this also to Fianna Fáil Deputies because it may also be necessary to safeguard them&mdash;that there will be no gerry-manderer either in one political Party or in occasional office in Government, who can revise constituencies according to his whim or fancy and wielding the big stick when doing so.  That is what the law and the Constitution permits at the moment.</P>
      <P>Indeed it is true to say, and it certainly was common gossip in the corridors of this House when the last constituency revisions took place, that a map was put up in the Fianna Fáil rooms of this House and, under the auspices of the then Minister for Local Government, all the Fianna Fáil Deputies proceeded to have their say about how constituency boundaries were going to affect their positions and what particular corns might be trodden upon.  From that conclave of the Fianna Fáil Party, a Bill emerged here, introduced by the Minister for Local Government, providing for the revision of the constituencies from which Deputies to this Parliament were to be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone could feel that that kind of operation was fair and just. It was not.  It was quite unjust and undemocratic and quite out of accord with what the people would have regarded as cothrom na Féinne.  While it is necessary and essential from time to time to revise or amend the areas and limits of existing constituencies, it should be done, like everything else, in the light of day, fairly and openly, not behind the locked doors of the Fianna Fáil cabal, not with the Fianna Fáil Party meeting and then issuing, as they did in relation to this referendum, <Col N="1373" /> a decision which they purport was a unanimous decision.  That will not enable our democracy to develop and flourish.  If that sort of practice continues, it will lead to the growth of suspicion and the frustration of Parliament itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is eminently fair.  He is seeking, in relation to this amendment of the Constitution, to do what the Minister and the Government proposes in relation to the Fourth Amendment.  In the case of the Fourth Amendment, it was a bit of sugar with which to coat the pill. Let us have a bit of sugar again now on tolerance also and, whatever proposal is put to the people, let us at least regard it as essential in relation to constituencies, or the system of election under which this Parliament henceforth will function, that there should be an independent Commission to define, on the one hand, the constituencies and, on the other, to advise on the limiting and on the boundaries of constituencies.  I cannot imagine what argument could be put forward to suggest that Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is not a reasonable amendment, a fair amendment and an amendment capable of implementation.  I certainly strongly support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies know, we are in fact proposing to ask the people to insert a provision for a Constituency Commission into the Constitution and, as I explained before, this provision obviously can appear only in one of these two Bills, two Bills introduced separately to please, as we thought, the Opposition.  We are making a recommendation to the people to enable them to provide themselves with a more rational and a more appropriate system of election.  We subdivided this proposal to please the Opposition.  We will be asking the people to vote for both proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Fine Gael Party will be asking the people to do. I find it hard to elicit exactly what they are in favour of and what they are not in favour of; whether some of them favour some of the proposals and others favour others I do not know.  We will, in fact, ask the people <Col N="1374" /> to pass both these amendments of the Constitution.  We expect the people will pass them because we are convinced of the good sense and intelligence of the people and their sense of fair play.  We believe they will pass both these amendments and we, therefore, expect that this Constituency Commission will be provided by the people in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It was not our proposition that there should be two separate proposals. That was the proposition of the Opposition. The separation was made to meet the complaints of the Opposition that having both amendments in the one Bill was just too confusing for them; they could not understand them and it was at the behest of the Opposition that we divided the proposals into two.  I did not know the Opposition wanted it divided into three or four until Deputy Barrett spoke.  I do not know whether, in fact, they think we should have a separate question for each section and subsection in both these Bills.  If we did that, we should certainly run out of colours for the different ballot papers and the Opposition would not be able to tell their supporters which proposal to support because a number of ballot papers would have to be the same colour.  I cannot understand the suggestion that we should have all these different sections in each of these Bills voted on separately.  That would seem to be what we are coming to; practically every day we have a new suggestion that we should have some particular aspect of what we regard as one single proposal decided separately.  I was not here at the time of the debate on the Constitution of 1937.  I do not know whether at that time the Opposition were making the case that each Article should be voted on separately.  Had that been the position, had some been opposed and some not, we should have arrived eventually at a hotchpotch Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this amendment because it is objectionable in principle to put a hypothetical proposal such as this to the people for decision by way of referendum.  Apart from that, I am advised that this hypothetical proposal <Col N="1375" /> is not in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Constitution for amending the Constitution.  Any proposal to amend the Constitution must be a definitive proposal which, when approved by the people, becomes part of the Constitution.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment proposes to insert this hypothetical proposition into the Constitution and, in the event of a hypothetical situation arising, to have it repealed again automatically.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the Constitution can be amended only by referendum. Deputy Fitzpatrick proposes the people should insert this in the Constitution and at the same time take it out again in the event of some hypothetical situation evolving.  I am not a constitutional lawyer.  I have to be guided by the legal advice available to me.  The legal advice available to me is that this suggestion of Deputy Fitzpatrick would not be in accordance with the procedure for amending the Constitution. Indeed, I think any normally intelligent person will see that it would be ridiculous to do what is suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>We are asking the people to pass both these amendments.  We believe they will do so and we have, therefore, every reason to believe that our proposal to insert in the Constitution a provision for a Constituency Commission will, in fact, be carried by the people.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that amendment No. 2, as drafted, does not achieve the result intended by the Deputy.  In fact, I am advised it would not be possible to draft such an amendment. Obviously the difficulty in which the Opposition find themselves in relation to this Commission stems from the segregation of the proposals, proposals which were originally intended to be incorporated in a single Bill.  I confess myself unable to find out exactly what the Opposition want.  When these proposals were together in one Bill, they were not satisfied.  They could not understand them: they wanted them separated.  We separated them and then we had to make the arrangement <Col N="1376" /> that the provision for the Constituency Commission should go into one Bill.  Now they want them back again.  The assumption, surely, was that if they wanted them separated, they were going to accept one of the proposals and not the other.  Apparently, that is not the position.  They do not know what their position is. They do not know whether they are in favour of one and not in favour of the other or if they are opposed to both proposals.  I think it is clear that the Labour Party are opposed to both.  If you are opposed to both, all you have to do is to campaign against both, and if the people accept your view, we will have the present position carrying on.</P>
    <P>We subdivided these to oblige the Opposition.  I admit we were trying to do the impossible.  We were trying to eliminate the confusion from the minds of the Opposition and that has proved to be completely impossible.  I suppose we were foolish to try to please the Opposition because that is something that cannot be done.  All through this debate it has been a question of, &ldquo;We want them separated&rdquo;, &ldquo;We want them put together again.&rdquo;  I do not think the Opposition know what they want.</P>
    <P>When a decision had to be taken to divide the proposals that we were putting before the people we had to decide into which Bill this proposal for a Constituency Commission should go. The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is, in fact, doing no more, possibly doing less, but certainly, doing no more than re-establishing the <i>status quo</i> which existed up to 1960 when the Fine Gael Party took an action in the High Court to have the interpretation of this phrase, &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;, that had existed up to that time, declared to be in breach of the Constitution.  This Bill is proposing to re-establish the position that existed from 1922 until Fine Gael took steps to have it declared unconstitutional, in 1960.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill proposes a fundamental change in the electoral system.  It proposes to establish <Col N="1377" /> single-member constituencies instead of multi-member constituencies and it appeared to us that this was a more fundamental change and, therefore, this being a proposal that would require a complete recasting of the scheme of constituencies, that, when we had, in order to please the Opposition, to separate the proposals and put the provision for the Constituency Commission into one Bill, this was the more appropriate one into which to put it because, as I have said, the Third Amendment is merely getting back to the <i>status quo</i> that existed up to 1959.</P>
    <P>It certainly seems to me to be more appropriate to put it into the other Bill because the purpose of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is to get away from the position which the Fine Gael Party arranged to have established here which required this operation of detaching from one county portion of the population and attaching it to another county and another constituency and, if it is possible to gerrymander in this country&mdash;and, personally, I do not think that it is; I certainly would not know how to go about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;surely, the best way in which this can be done is by this process of taking portion of one county out and putting it into another?  This Bill here proposes to get back to the position where that will not be required by the Constitution, where the Government or the Oireachtas in revising constituencies will not be compelled to go through this process of taking bits of one county out and putting them into another.  If it is, in fact, possible to gerrymander, surely these are the most suitable circumstances for doing it where you have a selection as to the portion of one county that you take out to put into another in order to comply with this requirement of the Constitution that the Opposition are trying to retain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, then, if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is passed and the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not, we will <Col N="1378" /> be establishing a position in which we will be required to adhere as far as possible, within the maximum divergence proposed, to county boundaries. So, therefore, the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill will make it more difficult to indulge in gerrymandering. Accordingly, when a decision had to be made to put the Constituency Commission into one Bill rather than the other, the obvious one to put it into was the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>I find that a number of charges have been made again here on this amendment which were also made on the Committee Stage of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. We have the charge again made by Deputy Fitzpatrick that this is going to lead to one-party dictatorship.  I do not think it was this Bill that he was talking about; it was the other Bill. He was talking about the whole proposal. Because, despite the fact that, in order to facilitate Deputy Fitzpatrick and the Opposition in general, we separated these two Bills, the experience has been that Deputies opposite are unable, in fact, to separate them in speaking here on either of these Bills.  Deputy Fitzpatrick again made the charge that the proposal that we are making will result in this one-party dictatorship and since he persists in making this charge I want to point out again to him exactly what the making of this charge means.  It means that Deputy Fitzpatrick is saying that in circumstances in which there would be a clear confrontation between the Parties in 144 single-seat constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is inconceivable that either now or at any time in future either Fine Gael or Labour could persuade in a majority of these constituencies more people than Fianna Fáil can that their proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs are the better.  That is an admission by Deputy Fitzpatrick, by the Fine Gael Party, surely, that our policy is, in fact, better than theirs!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> If their policy is better it must be possible for him to attract to their Party people who are capable of explaining this to the public.  Or do they consider the people are too stupid to be able to recognise what is good for them?  I would not be surprised if that is what they actually have in mind, because they have operated down through the years obviously on the theory that anything at all is good enough to put before the people.  We have operated on the opposite assumption: that the people are capable of understanding the principles that are involved in good government, and we have not been disappointed.  The people have continued to support us and to reject the unrealistic policies put before them by the Opposition Parties with the exception of the two occasions on which, because of multiplicity of Parties that this system of election was designed to foster, the people found it impossible to make an effective decision at all and which gave rise to two disastrous coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick again went on to this question of the proposed maximum divergence of one-sixth from the national average of population per Deputy.  He again repeated the assertion, which he must know to be wrong, that this proposal of ours will mean that in some counties it will take 16,690 people to elect a Deputy and in others it will take 23,366.  I say that Deputy Fitzpatrick must know that this is in fact wrong because the provision in the Constitution refers to total population.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick should know, first, that a person has to be over 21 years of age to be on the register and that newborn babies have not votes.  He should know that no aliens have votes and that people have votes only in the constituencies in which they are on the register.  The fact that people happen to be resident, say, in an hotel in Dublin city on the date of the census does not mean that <Col N="1380" /> they can vote in that constituency.  The result of what Deputy Fitzpatrick and his colleagues, both in the Labour and Fine Gael benches, want to establish would not be as he alleges that it would take 16,650 voters to elect a Deputy in rural Ireland and 23,366 voters in urban areas.  He knows that is not true. In fact, the position he wants to establish is that in parts of Dublin city it will take 10,206 voters to elect a Deputy, whereas in rural Ireland it will take up to 13,567 to elect a Deputy. Deputy Fitzpatrick knows this.  He has the figures available to him.  All he needs are the figures of the census and the register.</P>
      <P>He knows that in the area of Dublin North-West the voters form less than 51 per cent of the population and that therefore if a division is made in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution he wants to maintain it will take 10,206 voters to elect a Deputy there.  He knows that in Deputy O'Donnell's constituency of Donegal South-West the voters form 67.741 per cent of the population and that, therefore, if the situation he and his Party want to retain is retained, it will take 13,567 voters to elect a Deputy in Deputy O'Donnell's part of Donegal. In fact, the situation Fine Gael and Labour are trying to establish is a position which will differentiate in this way as between voters in rural areas and voters in urban areas.  All this Bill is asking is that there should be a maximum divergence of one-sixth from the national average to take cognisance of the practical considerations of county boundaries and the areas and accessibility of constituencies.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, the result of this all over the country as a whole would certainly be to do no more than equate the value of a rural vote generally to the value of an urban vote.</P>

Deputy Fitzpatrick and his friends want to do this <Col N="1381" /> because they have abandoned rural Ireland.  They have decided to try to retain a position which gives a differential in the voting power to people resident in the built-up areas.

      <P>Would Deputy L'Estrange like to know what he bought in exchange for the farm? Deputy Costello described the rural vote in contemptuous terms as &ldquo;the cow vote&rdquo;.  It is obvious that the Fine Gael Party look on the rural voters as cattle, as people who will continue to vote for them no matter what they do to them.  We have a fair idea of the people who support Fine Gael in rural Ireland.  We know that they are not easy to change but we will let them know exactly what you are doing.  We do not think they are so bovine as Deputy Costello seems to think.  We think they will be able to see exactly what you are doing &mdash; that the Fine Gael Party have decided to deliberately devalue the vote of every person in rural Ireland in favour of increased voting power for everybody in urban areas.  They have deliberately and cynically decided to try to divide the country on the basis of urban population versus rural population.</P>

      <P>I am dealing specifically with a point raised and spoken about at length by Deputy Fitzpatrick to the effect that the proposals in this Bill would result in it taking a substantially greater number of voters to elect a Deputy in urban areas than in rural areas.  I am pointing out that is not so and the people of the cities do not want it to be so.  They will be quite satisfied to have the same effectiveness attached to their votes as to those in rural areas.  And that is all we propose to do.  I do not say that taking cognisance of county boundaries and so on will result in it taking <Col N="1383" /> exactly the same number of voters to elect a Deputy in every single constituency. I do not really see why it should be necessary for me to go into all this again.  But for the fact that Deputy Fitzpatrick insisted on bringing it up again, I would not go over what I pointed out to him on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to have exactly the same number of voters per Deputy in, say, Limerick as in Kerry.  I do not think in order to do that it should be necessary to transfer part of the population of County Limerick to Kerry.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before this referendum takes place that they are entitled to three seats.  They will know it is not necessary to breach the county boundary but that Deputy Fitzpatrick is trying to insist that the boundaries of Cavan will be unnecessarily breached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick wants these two measures brought together again: that seems to be the whole trend of the argument on both Committee Stages but Deputy Barrett wants a third Bill involving a third ballot and possibly if we gave him that he would want a fourth and a fifth.  I think, in fact, Deputies opposite know this would be impracticable and that it would not be reasonable to ask the people to vote on three or four or five referenda at the same time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has once again raised the question of the British system and since it was relevant for him to raise it at this stage, it must be relevant for me to reply.  I think everybody knows that the voting system we propose is the system that operates in Britain.  We also know on the authority of Deputy Dillon, if on no other authority, that the system we have here was invented in Britain but not for elections in Britain.  It was invented to be inflicted on people like us who insisted on leaving the British Empire.  We know why it was imposed on us and not imposed in Britain.  In fact the British Parliament set up a royal commission to consider the system of election that they invented for us.  They went into every aspect of it and decided that this system certainly was not for them.</P>
    <P>Both of these systems could be described as British systems, one being the system they have for themselves and the other being the system they invented for people like us.  The fact that it has not yet produced the results it was designed to produce is due to Fianna Fáil.  The results it must eventually produce are obvious; they will be similar to what is happening on the Continent.  It is designed, as Deputies opposite admit, to arrange for the representation of small sectional parties.  That being so it is obviously designed to encourage the formation of small sectional parties and it has had this effect in the past, as I have pointed out.  There were two occasions on which this confusion of the electorate took place and there can be no doubt that this will eventually develop again because the system is designed to produce exactly that result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> Deputy O'Higgins is apparently very much in favour of a Constituency Commission now.  I should like to remind him that on 21st January, 1959 on the Committee Stage of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill at that time, there was an amendment, amendment No. 1 to section 3 of the Schedule, moved by Deputy O'Higgins and this amendment proposed that the provision for a Constituency Commission that was in the Bill should be removed and that in future the Oireachtas should revise the constituencies instead of a commission.  Deputy O'Higgins is now on a completely different line.  That is typical of the lack of consistency in the Fine Gael Party but obviously the Deputy was given a different brief in 1959 and now he is suddenly in favour of a Constituency Commission.</P>
    <P>Let me quote what he had to say at column 946 of Volume 172 on 21st January, 1959:</P>
    <P>...we say in this amendment:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Forget about your Constituency Commission.  Let any law revising <Col N="1386" /> constituencies be passed here through the Dáil.  Let it be supported and defended in the Dáil.  Let the Minister who seeks to introduce it take full responsibility for it in this House where he can be challenged in the broad light of day with the press looking on and with the public entitled to admission&rdquo;.  We say that is the responsible course for any Minister or any Government genuinely intending to do the right thing to adopt.</P>
    <P>Now, not alone does he want one Constituency Commission; he wants two.  As I have said, there is great difficulty in trying to interpret the mind of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
