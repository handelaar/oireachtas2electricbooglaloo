      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the apparent deadlock regarding the admission of the applicant countries, including Ireland, to the EEC, he will now consider the advisability of an interim agreement between this country and that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, various proposals for some form of interim arrangement between the applicant countries and the Community are still before the Council of the European Economic Community.  The Council has not yet found it possible to reach agreement, but is meeting again on the 9th May to discuss the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept the fact that there does not appear to be any agreement on any of the proposals among the Ministers concerned from the different European Economic Community countries and, in the light of that, could he not indicate to the Dáil what attitude it is likely the Government will take in future to eliminate the present standstill system with regard to our application?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my original reply, the Community countries are still discussing the different suggestions that have been put forward for greater co-operation between the Community Members and the applicant countries.  So long as they are still considering the situation, it is better, I think, that we should await the outcome of their consideration.  I do not at all accept that there is, as the Deputy suggests, stalemate at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is likely to be a considerable delay before any decision is taken either by the Ministers or by the Commission and, because of that, would he not consider that the state of uncertainty which naturally exists here should be resolved by him and his Government as soon as possible by some positive action on their part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion of some positive action seems to imply that we should make some independent arrangement with the Community.  I indicated in replies to previous questions that I do not think that is possible; any interim arrangement with the Community will have to be with all the applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that we should make some interim trade agreement with the EEC.  Would he not agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that I do not think that is feasible so long as the Council members are considering the arrangement with the Four, and possibly with more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been directed to the fact that the Six have recently decided to equip themselves with emergency power to impose special duties on agricultureal exports to the Six?  In the light of that new development, would he not agree that some discussion should take place to ascertain at least in how far it is intended such emergency restrictions will apply to agricultural exports from this country and how those restrictions will affect exports from this country?</P>

      <P>We are aware of all the developments within the Community and, in so far as such developments may affect us, we are in constant touch with the Community, through our representatives, and with the Commission to ensure that as far as possible no adverse effect will ensue for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what the import excess for 1967 would have been if the terms of trade had been (a) one per cent less advantageous, (b) at 1966 levels, and (c) at 1965 levels; and whether he can make any forecast of the likely level of the terms of trade for 1968 having particular regard to devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to measure the quantitative effect of changes in the terms of trade on the volume of imports and exports. What can be done is to estimate the value, at different price levels, of the quantum of imports and exports recorded in a certain period.</P>
      <P>In 1967 the actual import excess was £106.1 million.  If the actual 1967 totals for imports and exports are revalued using the official import and export price (unit value) index numbers for the years 1966 and 1967 (provisional). then the import excess becomes £111.9 million.  A corresponding revaluation using the index numbers for the year 1965 yields an import excess of £116.7 million.</P>
      <P>The answer to (a) of the Deputy's question depends on the allocation of the hypothetical change of one per cent between changes in import and export prices.  For example if the change is due entirely to lower export prices the import excess becomes £108.9 million&mdash;if the change is due entirely to higher import prices the import excess becomes £109.7 million.</P>
      <P>While both import prices and export prices are expected to rise in 1968 it is not possible to make a reliable forecast of the terms of trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the level of the terms of trade for each of the years <Col N="208" /> 1965, 1966 and 1967 for Irish trade with (a) Great Britain, (b) the Six Counties (c) the EFTA countries and (d) member countries of EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The particulars requested by the Deputy are not available. The terms of trade index is derived from the import and export price (unit value) indices which are compiled only in respect of the aggregate trade with all countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to add to the numerous replies I have already given to Dáil Questions regarding the conflict in Nigeria and recognition of the Eastern Region.  We shall, of course, continue to do everything possible to encourage the negotiation of a just and stable peace in which the rights of the people in all parts of Nigeria will be safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House if it is a fact that the Biafran region have offered peace terms to Nigeria, holding the <Col N="209" /> territory they now hold, if they are prepared to call off the present attack?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that in my replies to several questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied to the second question I asked.  Tanzania has recognised Biafra.  Is there any reason why Ireland, that has a particular interest in the area and a particular interest in the Irish nationals there&mdash;Irish nationals have been doing work there for practically a century&mdash;should not recognise Biafra?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest interest in the Irish nationals who have been there and admire the work they have done in the last 80 or 90 years in that area and in the rest of Nigeria and other parts of Africa.  It is a question, having the utmost sympathy with the people involved in this terrible conflict, of what we can do to resolve it.  In my judgment, the best thing we can do is to keep advising and urging both sides to have a cease-fire as quickly as possible, to negotiate a peace settlement that will recognise and support the rights of the people in all parts of Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why his Department did not reply to letters from the town clerk of Midleton Urban District Council, one on 16th December, 1967 and a second on 13th March, 1968, in connection with having displayed in the telephone booths in the town the emergency numbers of the Garda, fire brigade and ambulance; and why these letters were not even acknowledged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was the subject of correspondence between the Midleton Urban District Council and the Department in 1966 and in May and June, 1967.  The proposal then put forward was not favoured but when the council raised the matter again towards the end of 1967 the Department decided to reconsider it in the light of a general review being made of the arrangements for dealing with telephone calls for emergency services.  The council should, of course, have been so advised.  The failure to do so is very much regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the harm done by the failure to have these numbers displayed and the danger that exists of inability to contact services immediately in cases of emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this matter has now been settled and the proposals have been agreed that subscribers in the area, in case of emergency, can dial 10 and get Cork city exchange who will dial the appropriate service or they can dial the local services themselves, for which they have to have four pennies available.  I <Col N="211" /> will be quite frank about this.  I very much regret the delay that took place, which was due to the fact that this emergency service has to be examined throughout the country and conditions are not always the same because of the distribution of the exchanges and the fact that it is not always possible to make an immediate arrangement of this kind.  I very much regret the delay that has taken place and have advised the Department accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that dialling Cork and all the rest of the red tape that he has gathered around the Department will hasten the arrival of an ambulance or the fire brigade?  Why not give permission to the urban council to display these numbers in the telephone booths?</P>

      <P>The Survey Team on the Horse Breeding Industry in its report made a series of recommendations which involved a number of Government Departments as well as voluntary organisations interested in different aspects of the horse breeding industry.  Some of the Team's recommendations have already been implemented. A major one related to the establishment of a Horse Board, the provision of a National Training Centre and statutory control of riding establishments.  This recommendation is under active consideration; the various organisations concerned have been consulted and a further meeting with them is to be held shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (a) the total gross amount paid to farmers this year in respect of the 1967-68 beet crop, (b) the estimated total gross amount they will receive for the 1968-69 <Col N="216" /> crop, and (c) the total extra ascertained costs involved in the production of the 1968-69 crop as compared with the 1967-68 crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the gross amount paid by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta to growers for beet of the 1967 crop was £7,825,602. It is too early to estimate the yield of the 1968 crop and thereby to forecast the gross return which farmers will receive for it.  I am informed that detailed figures are not available which would enable the comparison asked for at (c) to be made, but the costs to beet growers of fertilisers, herbicides and seeds are the same as last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in present circumstances, due to the interference of another body claiming to represent the farmers, for the coming season the farmers will get cuts of 1/9 per ton, due to a cut in pulp, 1/3 per ton, due to increased freight charges, and 8/9 per ton, due to increased labour costs&mdash;a total of 11/9 per ton or £420,000 of a loss in the coming season on their beet crop? Does he intend to do anything in that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only accept the figures the Deputy has given me.  In so far as the pulp return is concerned, I take it the figure of 1/9 per ton is correct but I am not in a position to say whether it is or not.  However, there must be some reduction by virtue of the reduction in the pulp allowance from 1¾ cwt. to 1½ cwt.  On the question of freight rates, I have been given to understand that the increase, which may range from 5 per cent in the case of rail freight and up to 10 per cent on road freight, is to be offset by some subsidy or other to be paid for by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir; we have to pay 50 per cent of the cost, or 1/3 per ton. In regard to the third one, the amount agreed upon by General Costello, the then manager, and myself, was that on a labour increase of £1 per week, the cost on beet was 8/9 per ton.  That is 11/9 the boys who would not know beet from a turnip over there have cost the beet growers this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his Department issue regulations concerning the maximum load for trucks, lorries and other road vehicles; and if he considers that these regulations are adequate and are effectively enforced at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, prescribe maximum weights laden for mechanically propelled vehicles and trailers, based on the number of axles and the length of the vehicle or vehicle combination.  The enforcement of these requlations is a matter for the Garda Síochána and the road authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Road Traffic Bill, 1966, contains a provision which would enable a new system for regulating the weights of vehicles to be introduced. Under that system, the maximum weight of vehicles would be determined to take account, <i>inter alia</i>, of horse power, brakes and tyres and would <Col N="222" /> then be prominently displayed on a plate on the vehicle.  This system should be easier to enforce and be more effective from the safety point of view.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps, including the introduction of legislation if necessary, to ensure that secondhand cars offered for sale are equipped with reliable and unworn tyres; and what powers he has at the moment to ensure that cars currently on the roads do not use defective or worn-out tyres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under article 16 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, it is an offence to use on a public road a mechanically propelled vehicle or trailer with excessively worn tyres.  In the case of pneumatic tyres on passenger and goods vehicles the pattern relief throughout must be clearly visible and at least one millimetre in depth.  Also, <Col N="223" /> all tyres must be maintained in such condition as to be free from any defect which might in any way cause danger.  Consideration is being given to the need for developing these regulations further.</P>
      <P>In order to secure higher safety standards, powers are being sought under the Road Traffic Bill, 1966, to control the supply and sale of motor vehicles (both new and secondhand) and motor vehicle equipment and parts.  These powers would enable regulations to be made in regard to the condition of tyres on secondhand cars offered for sale.</P>

      <P>While I expect housing authorities generally to be as helpful as possible to persons borrowing house purchase loans, it is by law a matter for each authority to require applicants to pay the appropriate part of the purchase price before giving their consent to the alienation or sub-division of any cottage. The steps to be taken to this end are a matter in each case for the authority making the loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has disability benefit in mind, as other benefits are already paid through local offices.  Under existing arrangements the long-term disability benefit recipients, approximately half the total number of claimants, receive their benefit cheques on the same day each week in advance, while the remainder receive payment promptly on submission of medical evidence of incapacity. In the majority of cases the cheque is issued on the date of receipt of the medical certificate.  Even if it would expedite payment of new claims to disability benefit to any appreciable extent, which it is reasonably certain it would not, it would not be feasible to pay all disability benefit claimants at employment exchanges or local offices of this Department as the distances <Col N="234" /> to be travelled would prevent large numbers from attending while many others would not be in a fit state of health to attend.  In fact, in the case of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, only half the claimants are paid at employment exchanges, the remainder, on account of the distances involved, being paid by means of postal orders.  It is not proposed, therefore, to alter the existing arrangements for payment of disability benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On more than one occasion, I had this suggestion examined.  I could never agree that it would be of any assistance whatever in expediting payment.  The records are held centrally at the Department.  They are required in connection with all sorts of claims that may arise at different times in relation to benefits and it would be necessary for the local office to correspond with the Department anyway which would not short-circuit the necessary decision that must be taken before a claim is decided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department was notified on 1 February, 1963, of the death in the previous month of the last holder of the permanent office of district medical officer in Riverstown dispensary district. The question of making a further <Col N="237" /> permanent appointment was deferred as reorganisation of the boundaries of the Dispensary Districts in the area was under examination at the time. Before this examination was completed the general recruitment of permanent district medical officers was suspended in anticipation of the Government proposals to introduce a scheme to provide for a choice of doctor to replace the present dispensary service.  A permanent appointment is not considered necessary at this stage as it is considered that the area would be adequately covered under the scheme providing for a choice of doctor.  In the meantime the health authority are satisfied that the present temporary arrangements for the performance of the dispensary service are satisfactory. The medical card population of the dispensary district is only 700, out of a total population of 3,635 persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated, in reply to a previous question in this matter, that there is no generally accepted definition of autism in children and while the term is used to describe a particular illness it is also used to cover a number of <Col N="239" /> different mental illnesses of childhood. At present statistics of the total number of children in this country in need of psychiatric care are not available, and indeed reliable statistics are not available for any country.</P>
    <P>The only residential unit in the country specifically provided for the treatment of mentally ill children, including autistic children, is that at St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, County Dublin.  The work of this unit is complemented by a day centre for emotionally disturbed children at St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  Of the 30 children being cared for in St. Loman's Hospital, ten are from Dublin city or county and 20 are from areas outside Dublin. All of these children except one are either partically or totally maintained by public funds.  There are twenty-two children attending the day centre at St. Kevin's.  Charges are made by the Dublin Health Authority in the case of a number of these children, but in no instance does the charge represent the full cost of treatment.  I may add that there are plans to provide two additional units&mdash;one in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
    <P>A number of mentally ill children are treated in district mental hospitals and there may be a few such children cared for in private institutions.  I have not information about charges in these cases but I would say that few, if any, of the parents with children in district mental hospitals would be paying the full cost of treatment for their children.</P>
    <P>In his second question I assume the Deputy has in mind the mentally ill children, including autistic children, who are cared for by their parents at home.  There is no special scheme of financial or other assistance for such children administered by my Department but the ordinary local health authority services, including psychiatric services, are available to these children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget presented yesterday and the review contained in the documents circulated prior to the Budget on the Second Programme indicate the urgent need for a review of the results achieved, for a realistic revision of the targets laid down, and for a decision by the country in general and by the Government, in particular, to adhere to the aims and objectives of whatever programme is decided upon.</P>
      <P>The review published and the comments made in the course of the Budget yesterday indicate clearly that the aims and targets laid down in the Second Programme were not realised.  The failure of the Programme to achieve the objectives laid down and to measure up to the claims made for it have been the subject of comment for a considerable time.  These comments have been expressed both by Deputies and by commentators who have written or spoken about the Second Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication entitled <i>Review of Progress</i> deals with this aspect of the matter and comments on the nonrealisation of basic assumptions and conditions.  It says that some of the factors could not be controlled but that, in the main, the factors responsible were amenable in varying degree to internal influence.  It goes on to express the view that national commitment to the Programme was not sufficient to prevent the emergence of disruptive factors.  It expresses again the comment made earlier that the measures taken to put the Programme into effect must not only be coordinated but be consistent with the Programme's objectives.  It repeats the <Col N="242" /> view which was stated previously that the primary responsibility rested on the Government for creating conditions conducive to the success of the Programme.</P>
    <P>The main failure of the Second Programme, which was commented upon here yesterday by Deputy O'Higgins, was the failure of the Programme to increase employment, which, it was clearly indicated by Deputy Lemass when he was Taoiseach, would be the acid test of its success.  The figures published and the results of the Programme to date indicate that in respect of employment, in respect of new jobs provided, not merely has the Programme not succeeded in providing increased employment but that at the end of 1967, compared with the beginning of the Programme, as shown in the Review of 1967 in Table IX of the publication incorporating Economic Statistics, there were fewer people at work, that there had been a drop from 1,071,000 at work in 1964 to 1,063,000, that at the same time the numbers out of work had increased from 53,000 to 57,000, and that the change in the method of compiling the statistics did not hide the facts or obscure the bad picture.  Only the other night it was announced in Britain that last year 33,000 new immigrants secured employment in Britain, so that under the test which was originally laid down for this Programme, the Programme has clearly failed to measure up to the claims that were made for it.</P>
    <P>The significant fact emphasised in the report is that, while the assumptions made when the Programme was laid down were not realised, these depended on internal rather than external causes.  It is important to note that the capital expenditure undertaken in respect of the Programme has exceeded the targets originally laid down and that the expenditure on the Programme not merely exceeded the estimates, but that the percentage of gross national product taken in taxation increased from 23.5 per cent in 1963-64 to 28.2 per cent in 1967-68, compared with a projected 26.2 per cent for 1970.</P>
    <P>In the course of a number of comments that have been made and particularly in the report which the Minister <Col N="243" /> for Finance presented yesterday in the Budget, credit was taken for the fact that economically 1967 could be regarded as a satisfactory year.  In stating that fact, sufficient attention has not been given to the slack that existed and to the disappointing returns in respect of 1965 and 1966.  Sufficient attention was not given to the fact that if last year exports of agricultural products, especially of cattle and dead meat, increased, this country was in the fortunate position that arising from the foot and mouth epidemic in Britain, there was a unique demand for live-stock and meat from here and that not merely did that result in increased numbers but in increased prices as well.  The fortuitous circumstances which gave rise to that situation, and which to a considerable extent still continue, were due to a variety of causes completely outside the sphere of action of Government policy and affected the economy here without any action on the part of the Government or any result of arrangements made by the Government.</P>
    <P>This situation, while providing a temporary advantage, does not or cannot obscure the problems which have to be faced and which have been accepted with extraordinary complacency in the Budget Statement.  The failure of the Second Programme and the complacent attitude in the Budget Statement, contrast sharply with the analysis of the problems facing this country and with the urgency of providing a solution, which are covered in a report of the Federation of Irish Industries entitled &ldquo;Challenge&mdash;Industry and Free Trade&rdquo;.  This document analyses in great detail all aspects of industrial and export problems and in its conclusions and recommendations, expresses the concern of the representatives of firms and trade bodies who contributed to the compilation of the report.  The Budget presented yesterday gave, as was expected, certain social welfare increases, provided compensation for the increase in the cost of living and provided for an increase in pensions for various categories of retired public service pensioners.  In so far as providing incentives, or in so far <Col N="244" /> as providing a plan to meet the challenge of the 1970s, there is in this Budget no systematic, comprehensive or properly ordered contribution to the problems which affect industry.  According to the views which have already been expressed, it fails to meet the demands made either by the NFA or the ICMSA.  In fact, other than a reference to external difficulties and a complaint about international problems, the Budget presents an attitude that this country can continue to trade successfully and to operate in conditions which take no account of the keen competition which must be faced either inside or outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>The report prepared by the Federation of Irish Industries deals with a variety of problems affecting industry. It lays particular stress on the need to provide for the keen competition which must result, as the report clearly states, whether this country becomes a member, or whether this country and Britain become members of the EEC by 1975, from the situation which will result for industry under the Free Trade Area Agreement when existing protection ceases in 1970 or 1971.  The report urges that action should now be taken not only by industry itself but by industry and the Government, to study how a research and development programme had best be organised.  It goes on to point out that:</P>
    <P>The proper question is not whether this or that product can continue to be produced competitively here, but rather whether it is the one on which maximum profit can be earned in the new free market. Thinking of our present products in terms of their defensibility against outside competition is an instinctive reaction derived from the protectionist tradition.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to make specific recommendations in respect of assistance, particularly for exports, for consultation with industrial representatives and for a unifying of the methods of assisting industry by combining the efforts of a number of bodies.</P>
    <P>It recommends, and I believe this is appropriate not merely for industry <Col N="245" /> but must be also considered in relation to agriculture, that on the State's side, in addition to the drawing together of the various services dealing with industry, the Government will need to provide for direct representation of industry through its representative organisations on the bodies planning and operating the various services and aids.  It states:</P>
    <P>In the past, largely because of the absence of appropriate representative machinery, it has been the practice for industry representatives on bodies such as Córas Tráchtála, Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the Kilkenny Design Workshops, to be selected directly by the Government to act as individuals. This system will have to be changed in future if industry and these services are to work together to agreed policies and plans.</P>
    <P>This report, as I said, is prepared by persons directly concerned with the problems which face us, and who are conversant with the difficulties which have arisen, and are seeking to provide solutions to the various problems of marketing, research and analysis, and of small industries to present a unified market and research system and a unified selling organisation.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in that report in respect of industry are also appropriate in respect of agriculture. The most notable feature of yesterday's Budget was the failure to provide any incentive in respect of agriculture.</P>

      <P>The increase of 12/-per cwt. for the A Special and A pigs is approximately one-third of what was requested by the NFA.  As one individual described it, it is a step in the right direction.  Nothing was granted in respect of milk despite the substantial increase in production costs. This failure evoked a protest from a person normally not unfriendly to Fianna Fáil, the secretary of the ICMSA.  It also evoked a protest from the NFA.  Despite the measures taken by a number of bodies in regard to this <Col N="246" /> problem and the efforts made by firms processing or utilising milk products, the situation has now developed in which we have a substantial surplus, with rising costs of production, and, so far as one can gather, the Government are satisfied to allow the increased prices obtaining in respect of cattle to cover up for the needs of the dairy farmers.</P>
      <P>This brings forcibly to mind the question of what the Government and the appropriate bodies are doing about marketing and, if markets are not available, what decision will be taken to change to other lines of production. If ever a certificate was granted to mark the death of the NAC, yesterday's failure to increase payments in respect of milk spells the end of that body as a body entitled to any consideration. This has been emphasised by the Federation of Irish Industries report. It has been emphasised by the reaction to yesterday's decision.  A body representing, or purporting to represent, either the farmers or industry cannot be handpicked merely because those so picked are Fianna Fáil supporters. That method is entirely unsuitable in the case of a body facing the problems these bodies will have to face, the problems which those whom they are supposed to represent are endeavouring to solve.  It is ridiculous to expect that a handpicked body selected because of political affiliations can be regarded as either competent or sufficiently energetic to push the case and argue the interests of those whom they are supposed to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech yesterday and in the reports published of comments made by the Central Bank and other financial interests, there appears to be a sort of self-satisfied reaction because, it is alleged, last year was such a good year.  If we examine the reports in the review of 1967 and the outlook for 1968, we find that the net output from agriculture last year of £111.4 million was almost identical with the net output four years ago, in 1964, when it was £111.8 million.  In the intervening years, there was a drop and net output has only now caught up on the deterioration which occurred <Col N="247" /> in the intervening years.  The output for last year is, in fact, only comparable with that of 1964.</P>
    <P>The Budget, while providing no incentive in respect of industry, with the exception of some promises in regard to minor tax changes, has failed to provide any of the incentives requested in respect of agriculture. This year every local authority was faced with the unpleasant task of implementing a very substantial increased demand for rates.  The situation was a cause of concern to all local authorities and, in particular, to health authorities, especially the authority here in Dublin.  This Party has consistently urged and recommended an appropriate and workable scheme for health services based on a graded scheme of contributions and a graded scheme of benefits.  That policy was published in great detail many years ago.  The Government at the time and the Minister for Health, in particular, resisted that proposal.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance admitted that:</P>
    <P>The cost of the health services is rising so rapidly that it is necessary to consider alternative methods of finance in order to reduce the amounts now charged on the tax-payer and the ratepayer.  A detailed examination is being undertaken of the feasibility of introducing an insurance or contributory scheme to finance at least part of the cost of the services available to the middle-income group.  It will extend to the question of eliminating the hospital charges for which middle-income patients are now liable.</P>
    <P>This is the latest recognition, and the latest adoption, by Fianna Fáil of large chunks of Fine Gael policy.  Time will show the extent to which this policy will be implemented.</P>
    <P>This year the County Dublin rate increased from 54s 3d in 1967-68 to 60s in 1968-69.  The health charges last year were 13s 9d; this year they are 18s 3¾d.  In Dún Laoghaire, the rate last year was 59s.  Health charges were 20s 9.8d and, this year, the rates have increased to 67s 3d and health <Col N="248" /> charges have increased from 20s 9.8d to 26s.  This is a fact which has been repeatedly brought to public attention by us because we recognise that the present system of financing health services is not merely inequitable but entirely unsatisfactory in the cover it provides and in the range of services made available to those sections most in need of such services.  It has taken six to seven years to get that home to the Government.  Now we are promised an examination of the feasibility of a contributory system of health insurance. It is only reasonable to express the hope that this examination will not be shelved, deferred or frustrated in the same way as the examination of the rating system report was deferred or suppressed.  We have consistently argued that the provision of adequate health services can be based only on a contributory insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The provision made in the Budget for social welfare recipients represents monetary compensation for the increase in the cost of living but the Budget omits to deal with a very serious problem.  It fails to tackle in an enlightened and progressive way the whole question of social security.  This is one of the matters referred to in the report of the Federation of Irish Industries. Comparisons are made in that report between the level of social services and social security services here with the provisions in EEC countries. A problem has been posed not merely for industry but for trade unions and those employed in industry.  The comparative figures reveal that the percentage gross national product spent on social security in this country is smaller than in any EEC member country or in Britain.  The Irish figure is 8.1 per cent whereas in Britain the figure is ten per cent and in the EEC countries ranges from 12.2 per cent in Italy to 15 per cent in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The most notable omission in the Budget yesterday was the failure to do anything about family allowances.  The present rate of family allowances was fixed in 1963.  Until the increase of 2s 6d in respect of dependent children of social welfare recipients was included in the Budget yesterday, no increase had been granted in that <Col N="249" /> allowance.  This fact was brought to public attention by the report of the Revenue Commissioners in 1967 and in the White Paper issued by the then Minister for Health, the late Donogh O'Malley, in 1966.  That report showed that there were over 800,000 persons on the general medical services register. The report of the Revenue Commissioners indicated that of over 942,000 children in families only about 153,000 were in families whose heads paid income tax, in other words, that almost 800,000&mdash;certainly threequarters of a million&mdash;were in families whose heads were not liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>The present rate of family allowances was fixed in 1963.  Since then the cost of living has increased by just 24 per cent.  The tax remissions granted in the Budget yesterday in respect of managerial or technical categories and the benefit given in respect of lower income groups provide no relief whatever for this large category who are above the social welfare categories and below the managerial classes.  This omission is one of the most remarkable in the Budget and highlights the urgency of the need for a comprehensive, satisfactory, planned social policy.  That there has been no increase since 1963 is particularly harsh in a country where there are large families on whom the rise in the cost of living is a real burden.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the need to prepare a proper social policy in the light of EEC membership has been mentioned not merely in the report of the Federation of Industries but by the trade union organisations.  The existence of that need is a condemnation of the preparation which has been made for EEC membership.  A proper social policy must include provision not only for proper health services but for a proper system of social insurance.  We have expressed the view and have advocated that a graded contributory system is the only means of providing a satisfactory service and the essential cover for those entitled to it.  The present position must be contrasted with the aims and objects of the Treaty of Rome in which reference is <Col N="250" /> made to the need to harmonise social policies and to secure that social policies in general in EEC countries would conform to the same standards.</P>
    <P>In this country the rate of family allowances compares unfavourably with the rates in operation in a number of other countries and, in particular, in a number of the relatively poorer countries in Europe, some of which are in the EEC and some of which are applicants for membership of that community. We have consistently advocated that the rates relief granted in respect of agriculture provides no relief for the urban areas.  Fine Gael have advocated and recommended that rates relief must be provided for the urban areas also.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals brought forward in yesterday's Budget is one which has been advocated by Fine Gael and which was strenuously recommended by us in 1965 when the Finance Bill was going through the House.  I refer to the question of estate duty in the case of widows and orphans.  At that time there was considerable debate here and objection made to parts of the 1965 Finance Bill part of which was abolished when Part VII was changed, and now the remaining objectionable feature has been removed in respect of widows and orphans.  The provision in the Finance Bill of 1965 was strenuously opposed because we regarded it as imposing hardship on people least able to look after themselves and least able to meet the problems of widowhood and the problems inherent in inheriting businesses.</P>
    <P>We have advocated that the present health charges must be removed from the rates.  A defect in the Budget is that the proposal to examine the problem postpones any relief.  Not merely does it postpone relief, but ratepayers this year have to face the very substantial increase in rates, most of it attributable to the health charges.  The time of this House was wasted in the Health Committee that considered this problem some years ago.  Only now has a decision been taken to examine the problem.</P>
    <P>The same is true in respect of education. The proposals made now and <Col N="251" /> which are to be implemented go some way towards meeting the recommendations which were made in our education policy in respect of university education and post-primary education. The decision now taken to examine the health services does not provide the remedy for the acute problem of rising rates affecting particularly the urban areas this year.  The rise in the cost of living, the added burdens in respect of rate demands, has spiralled because of the failure to introduce a system comparable with that recommended and published by Deputy O'Higgins some years ago.  We believe that the problem which faces urban ratepayers is one which should be tackled without delay and without waiting for an examination such as is being suggested here.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, this scheme can be put into operation.  It was described at the time&mdash;by, I think, the then Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee&mdash;as a poll tax.  Every system that involves a personal contribution can be so described.  Every system that involves a contribution by an individual, either on his own behalf or on behalf of his family, could be criticised in that way. It is now admitted and recognised that no workable scheme, no relief in respect of the problems affecting ratepayers and no comprehensive health assistance can be properly undertaken except on a contributory basis.  We have advocated that the system should be graded, that graded contributions will not merely provide a better scheme but provide a workable scheme.  This system can be put into operation without delay if the Government have the will and energy to do it.</P>
    <P>One of the decisions announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance was a decision to introduce here a decimal coinage system comparable with that to be operated in Britain.  It is generally recognised that the system adopted in Britain is not a satisfactory one.  There was a good deal of opposition to the unit there because it would make it difficult to operate in respect of taxes where small units are necessary. It is not easy for this country to operate a different system from that <Col N="252" /> which operates in Britain.  It is for many reasons more convenient for trade, business and ordinary commercial transactions to operate a similar system. The system to be put into effect in Britain was adopted with considerable misgivings by large interests and representative organisations over there as well as by a number of MPs.  When that system was adopted, the Federation of Irish Industries recommended an alternative.</P>
    <P>This is a question which might be further considered before a final decision is taken.  It is not easy to operate a different system from that which operates in Britain.  But in respect of taxation like the wholesale tax and the turnover tax and the added value tax, if it is operated here, where small units are concerned, the system in operation there&mdash;because it is not strictly metric, I understand&mdash;may make it difficult to operate except to round off to a much higher level than provided for in the actual incidence of taxation.</P>
    <P>The most notable failure of the present Budget is that it fails to provide the incentives which are necessary, that it merely marks time and that it is too cautious in facing the challenge and problems of the future.  It is not sufficient for the Government or for the Minister to say there are particular international and external problems in the world and that we live in difficult times.  That is true of any area at any time.  We have always been existing in a situation in which, if there was not an international crisis of one sort or another, there was a war somewhere. This country cannot isolate itself from the effects of these and must live and compete with them.  We must tackle the great problems of emigration, of providing increased employment and the great problem of housing our own people.  It is notable in the Budget, in spite of the increase in the Capital Budget, that for every £11 only £1 of the increase goes to housing.  In fact, the total increase for housing this year is only £2.3 million.  That barely covers the increased costs in respect of housing. It will enable local authorities merely to maintain their existing output. It will only enable private building to be continued at the same level.  In <Col N="253" /> fact, it provides only for the increased costs of building.</P>
    <P>There is in this Budget not merely a general lack of imagination but a general lack of determination to solve the problems of housing and health services and to provide the incentives necessary for agriculture and for the provision of increased employment, to show the decision and energy necessary to make this country capable of taking its place in the EEC and capable of meeting the competition which will be inevitable, either with the continuation of the present Free Trade Area Agreement or inevitable in whatever regrouping may take place in respect of Common Market membership.</P>
    <P>The Budget was described as being more or less as expected.  It provides some compensation in respect of pensioners and some relief in respect of those affected by the rising costs of living.  But in so far as it fails to provide an energetic, comprehensive plan to deal with the economic and social problems affecting the country, it merely marks time.  Worst of all, it fails to provide, as was emphasised in the OECD Report, any carefully worked out plan dealing with prices and incomes. This is one of the matters we have adverted to.  The only reference to it in the Minister's speech is a reference in the early stages and the promise that if prices and incomes rise unduly, there will be another Budget later in the year.  That is not providing a solution.  It is not providing the lead accepted as essential in the review of the failure of the Second Programme, which is accepted and emphasised in the Federation of Industries report and which has been accepted by the NIEC &mdash;that the real direction and real sense of purpose to put the Programme into effect must come from the Government. We have had exhortations to industry and agriculture and to the trade unions, but the failure to give a lead stems from the Government.</P>
    <P>In that regard it is well to reflect on the number of failures which have taken place in respect of proposals arising from Government activity.  One was again referred to yesterday.  There is a sort of suggestion that because <Col N="254" /> particular cases of State investment are raised here, there is opposition to and criticism of what is being done.  This is public money.  The public are entitled to know how it is invested and how it is spent.  In respect of three notable cases in recent times&mdash;Galway Textile Printers, the Potex factory in Galway and the Potez factory in Baldonnel&mdash; substantial public investment has been made and in each of these cases an unsatisfactory report of the results has been presented to this House.  Some time ago a promise was made and an undertaking was given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that after an investigation a full disclosure of the facts would be made in respect of Potez in Baldonnel.  The only recent information in regard to Galway is an announcement that the receiver is in.</P>
    <P>In these cases where public money is being spent, care must be taken that the facts are disclosed, and every effort must be made to ensure that our competent skilled and trustworthy personnel are accepted here as people of trust, and people in whom the country can express its confidence.  I believe that when such a situation arises, there is an inescapable obligation on the Government to disclose the full facts.  From an examination of the national accounts as presented by the Minister yesterday, as shown in the returns, from all the figures and facts and publications that have been made, has come a clear impression that this country is marking time.  We are making no real progress economically or socially, or in the way in which we must make progress if we are to face the challenge of the 70s and the problems that cannot be avoided if we are to compete with other countries either as a member of the EEC or as an independent economic unit determined to provide a good standard of living and to provide the services to which we consider our people are entitled.</P>
    <P>Our people are paying substantially more in taxation, substantially more in rates, substantially more in respect of every commodity.  Possibly a limited few are getting a reasonable standard of living.  In so far as providing a better standard of living for an expanding <Col N="255" /> number of people and providing more jobs for greater numbers is concerned, the Second Programme has been a dismal failure.  That cannot be camouflaged by announcing that a Third Programme is to be initiated this year.  The failure of the Second Programme in spite of favourable external causes has been due to internal facts and has been due in the main to lack of Government leadership and is the most emphatic repudiation and rejection of the Government's policy and plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget document is a reasonably bulky one. It contains 69 pages and some 36 subheads. Trimmed of the embroidery, what are we left with?  If we want to know what is contained in the Budget, instead of reading through these 69 pages, the explanatory leaflet which was submitted to the House yesterday gives us an account of what the Budget actually contains.  To my mind, here there is a reasonable interpretation of what is in this Budget. It is proposed to take £1.45 million extra from the tobacco tax, £1.2 million from oil, £1.4 million from beer, £.35 million from spirits, and £.2 million from wine.  That is a total of £4.6 million and of this is transferred £3.12 million to social welfare, £1.2 million to agriculture, £.2 million to public service pensions and £.1 million to the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the changes this Budget is making so far as the country is concerned. I am very surprised that there is nothing new in this Budget, that there is no change from the road over which we have been travelling down through the years.  I have a reasonably high regard for the Minister.  I believe he is well qualified to be Minister for Finance.  He has at his disposal the entire Civil Service, many of whom must be men with exceptional qualifications, to advise him.  It was reasonable to assume that a man such as Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance would have some changes and some innovations to bring before the House in this his second Budget Statement. Unfortunately he had not.  There <Col N="256" /> is nothing new.  There is nothing to indicate to the different sections of our people that there will be an improvement in their position as a result of this 69 page document read to us by the Minister yesterday.</P>
    <P>If we take the industries, what do we find?  We find first and foremost that so far as our main industry, agriculture, is concerned, the total additional amount in this Budget is £1.2 million.  Taking into account that one-third of our people derive their livelihood from agricultural pursuits, everyone must agree that that figure is well below anticipation.  Surely our agriculturalists throughout the country must be very disappointed indeed that the Minister in his Budget Statement had nothing brighter or more useful to say so far as the development of this our main industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the many obstacles the Minister had to surmount. Everyone knows the problems of dealing with the sale of our agricultural produce.  I refer mainly to dairy products. I know that the sales of such products have to be subsidised.  At the same time, we have been told by the Government in the past few years that it was essential and necessary to increase our cattle population, and that the best way to achieve that objective was to increase our cow population because without an increase in our cow population, our cattle population could not really increase.  We were inviting our people to get more cows and produce more milk and we were assuring them that any additional costs would be met, if not by an increase in price on our export markets for dairy products, by a subvention from the State.  That assurance has not been honoured in this Budget.</P>
    <P>We must take into account that our store cattle trade and our fat cattle trade play a vital part in our economy and we were told in this House again and again that were it not for an increase in our exports of cattle, and live cattle in particular, our balance of payments would not be as good as it actually is.  I do not want to labour this question but I feel it is a grave disappointment to the agricultural community <Col N="257" /> that the Minister was not able to be more specific in advising them and helping them and providing more incentives.</P>
    <P>I am now leaving the cattle and dairy industry and moving to an industry about which I have spoken in this House time and time again.  I have great faith and confidence in the pig industry.  I know what that side line means, particularly to the small farmers. It is unfortunate indeed that despite the many incentives various Ministers for Agriculture have given in recent years to this industry, through financial help and a good deal of soft talk, the industry is declining.  Something must be wrong.  What could possibly be wrong?  The answer is obvious.  The industry is not paying. Pig prices are not remunerative.  If they were, there would be no need for any incentives to maintain our pig numbers.</P>
    <P>We have bacon factories threatening to close down.  Within the past few years, two bacon factories closed down. Instead of trying to get the smaller farmers to keep pigs and to help to supplement their other incomes, the Minister, in this Budget Statement, seems to accept that pig production with small farmers is out.  Now, in order to maintain the number of pigs supplied to the bacon factories, he is changing over to big pig units.  I do not like that policy.  Again and again, I have condemned it here.  Mass production on pig holdings or by pig co-operative groups keeping 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 pigs would not be helpful to our economy.  It might keep our bacon factories working but would it not be much better if pigs were produced in tens, 20s, 30s or 40s by the smaller farmers throughout the country than by mass-production in big pig units?</P>
    <P>Our policy on pigs is failing.  We hear a lot about incentives.  The Minister will speak of sow grants.  He has given a reasonable increase of 12 per cwt. for Grade A pigs.  It will help to cover additional costs.  However, I should like that increase extended to <Col N="258" /> Grade B pigs, if possible.  It is our aim and objective to produce Grade A bacon but unfortunately that cannot be achieved by all and, in a number of cases, people have to take a grade below that of Grade A.  I must digress here and say I do not like to encourage the production of any type of bacon other than the best type.  At the same time, we could go as far as Grade B with some additional price as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I am satisfied, in offering these criticisms, that the Minister, from previous statements he has made on pig production, would much prefer to have pigs produced as I have indicated, namely, on our small holdings throughout the country rather than to have them mass-produced in big units. Any support the Minister may need&mdash; such as the support we gave him from these benches yesterday for getting additional taxation&mdash;to help the small farmers to get into the pig industry, to get a firm hold of it, to supply our bacon factories and to increase our production for export, will be given to him.  I do not wish to delay any longer on that point except to repeat that prices must not be satisfactory at present because, if they were, the pendulum, instead of losing momentum, would be swinging satisfactorily.  I shall not labour other farm sidelines. There is no use in speaking now about the poultry industry.  With the exception of a small number of keepers, the traditional poultry industry is dead and gone.  It is of some advantage, possibly, to a small sector of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the obstacles the Minister must surmount to help further in the development of agriculture.  It is a difficult task by reason of the great variations in our agricultural industry and by reason of the great variations in the sizes of our farmers and our land potential.  With counties where the land potential and productivity is much higher than in <Col N="259" /> other counties, it is difficult indeed to lay down a general agricultural policy. Statistics indicate that some 60 per cent of our farmers have farms of less than 50 acres.  I am well aware of the difficulties of bringing them up and of raising their standard of income to an economic level.  I shall not go into the proposed bonus schemes announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or into other recent statements by him.  We are dealing today with the Budget.  Every farmer in this country expected at least another penny on the gallon of milk in order to offset increased costs.  If the economy is prospering and growing to the extent which some parts of this Budget Statement tell us it is, surely our dairy farmers were entitled to some small increase on their dairy products and surely 1d on the gallon of milk would be very small?</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the position so far as other industries are concerned. Deputy Cosgrave referred earlier to industrialisation.  He mentioned moneys and incentives to industrialists that have gone down the drain.  We should have a complete change so far as financing or locating new industries is concerned and so far as dealing with industrialists or development groups in this country is concerned.  At present, no matter in what part of Ireland one may reside, the local development group must crawl up to Dublin to An Foras Tionscal or to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or to some other credit organisation and, when they meet these bodies or other State servants dealing with industrialists, they must be humble and meek because those people are the overlords and must be looked up to.  One dare not say anything to offend them because, if one does, one might as well stay at home.  I want a change in that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of sitting in their soft seats in offices in Dublin, why do those people not go to the provincial towns to meet development groups in their own centres?  Why do they not meet the community there and give them whatever information they have available for them?  Why do they not give whatever <Col N="260" /> information they have got from industrialists in other parts of the country or from other countries who may wish to establish industries here? Why not give the people concerned the facts?  Why not get these people in Dublin to move around the country and to meet the development associations? That change should come about.</P>
    <P>I believe also that the State should take the initiative in establishing industry. If a development group come together in any small town and decide to contact industrialists, they must have everything laid on and then come to Dublin to get the grant, if they are lucky enough, from An Foras Tionscal or the Industrial Credit Corporation.  I believe that system should change.  The people in Dublin who are supposed to be throughly conversant with industrialisation, supposed to know what foreign firms require here and what industries are most likely to be economic&mdash;surely it is they who should go down to meet local industrialists in their own centres rather than have them coming up to Dublin?</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the mistakes made by these boards which were mentioned previously by Deputy Cosgrave and by others on other occasions. A number of blunders have been made and if public persons in other countries made such blunders, they would be no longer there to make them: their services would be dispensed with.  In my view, we should change the system and get the people from the boards to move around the country.  That would be a much more beneficial way of encouraging industrial development than the present system, which, to my mind, is beneath contempt.  I say that, fully satisfied that I know what I am speaking about and in the light of the condescending attitude one has to endure on the part of some of the people in Dublin when you put your case before them.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in industrial development in smaller towns and villages.  The 1968 statistics indicate that 11,000 people left agriculture last year.  That has been the pattern for years and the Labour Party claim that these people should be provided <Col N="261" /> with an opportunity of earning a living in their own town instead of having to emigrate as 16,000 of them had to do last year.  It is all right for us here to refer to emigration again and again but I come from a place where several thousand people have left&mdash; Cork South-West&mdash;and where you will see young girls and boys leaving for England and other countries not knowing where they are going, knowing nothing about the changed world they will meet.  One can visualise a girl leaving West Cork and moving to the centre of London and what a change of environment that means and what a change it can make in every aspect of her life.  The same applies to a young man emigrating. This is a most undesirable problem. The Government, with only 2.8 million people to cater for, cannot provide employment for such people despite all the experts we have in Dublin city, despite all the State-sponsored bodies established to help industrial development and growth.  Development is remarkably slow.  There must be something wrong with the people in the towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave quoted from books supplied by various State and State-sponsored agencies in Dublin.  I do not put a great deal of trust in any of these books.  We remember the booklet &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo; and the Second Programme and the Third Programme and the reports from this group and that.  The best way of factually stating the value of such reports is to recall the Minister's comment yesterday when he was asked by Deputy Corish why did not the Government take steps to develop our mineral resources and replied that it was because the State-sponsored organisation told the Government of the day that there were no minerals to develop.  That clearly indicates what I assert, that they did not know what they were talking about.  It was left to some private individual or group &mdash; more luck to them&mdash;to develop our mines as they are doing so well and so profitably in some parts of the country at present, mines which the Government were officially informed by a State-sponsored organisation did not <Col N="262" /> exist.  These blunders can be very costly.  Our services at the top should be more streamlined.  There is no mention in the Budget of the numbers engaged in the different advisory services. I have asserted here that the number is entirely excessive, that our public services organisation has grown too rapidly for the volume of work it is performing.  Everybody knows that if you have too many people doing a job it cannot be economically carried out.</P>
    <P>The Budget Statement offers no new jobs for people who may need them. We have 57,000 registered unemployed at present and there is nothing in the Budget to indicate there will be any extra jobs.  We must recall the statements made for a number of years, particularly in dealing with Financial Resolutions annually, about the extra potential, the extra industrial jobs that would be provided for our people. Everybody knows the increase in industrial work is exceptionally small. It does no more than offset 25 per cent of the loss in the agricultural sector and this is very serious.  Many of those who are working have wage rates which are not reasonable and that applies to public services, council employees and forestry workers who earn from £8 to £10 weekly at present. A Cork County Council worker, after deducting his social welfare and superannuation contributions, has a take-home pay at present for a week's work of £8 5s 6d.  Surely in 1968 no family man could exist on that sum which is scarcely sufficient for a single man with no dependants, not to mention a married man with a wife and family.</P>
    <P>We must address ourselves to these problems.  The Budget Statement on incomes was vague and is of no advantage to the people of whom I speak, the unskilled workers in public authorities and local councils.  These people need help and had hoped that the Minister would say it was the intention of the Government at least as far as the public services are concerned to see that any employed man would get a wage of at least £x for a week's work. Men and women were expecting a <Col N="263" /> statement like that from the Minister. Everybody looks forward to guarantees. Farmers and industrialists like to have guarantees, and naturally the ordinary workers, particularly in rural districts, many of whom may not be well organised, also like to have guarantees.  The present wage rate is scandalous and one we should be ashamed of, and the time is at hand when such wage rates should be improved. I am sure everyone will appreciate the justice of that demand.</P>
    <P>I referred to the £8 5s 6d a week maximum wage for a worker in Cork, but I did not take into account the Revenue Commissioners.  They will tax him on the £8 5s 6d plus part of the social welfare contribution, and he will have to pay in or around 11/- weekly, so that a single man without dependants will have only £7 14s 6d.  I was hoping that such lowly-paid workers would get some taxation concession in the Budget.  Unfortunately there is no such concession, other than the increased allowance of £100 in the first year of his marriage.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us in the Budget Statement that health services are increasing steadily, and not only increasing steadily but increasing rapidly, and that the State now contributes towards the cost of health services from 54 to 57 per cent of the charge.  The care of elderly people is one of the main problems in regard to health services. These men and women who worked hard at a time when standards were not as good as they are today are entitled to consideration.  Despite the low standards that obtain for some families, when these people were young and active in the early part of this century and even in the 30s and so on, their conditions were not good, and I am always sympathetic towards improving the lot and brightening the lives of these, our old people.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that on the social welfare side 7/6d extra is being added to their pensions, but in discussing our old people and their charges on the public funds, we must take the social welfare side together with the health side.  As regards old age pensions, there <Col N="264" /> is no distinction made by the State between the farmer, say, with 100 cows who has signed his farm over to his son who is getting married and who, between himself and his wife, has less than £50 capital, and the old woman living in a wretched hovel who has nothing to exist on except the old age pension, or the old man living alone in his cabin.  Under the present regulations, each receives £2 17s 6d.  I do not blame the State for that.  It is very difficult for the State to draw up a set of regulations differentiating between the different classifications of old people. That is the job of the health authorities and, in my opinion, the health authorities are making a hell of a bad job of it.</P>
    <P>Our main problem, we are told from the reports of the various health authorities, is to provide hospitalisation for our elderly people.  We have insufficient space to answer all the calls for institutional treatment from elderly people.  This gives rise to difficulties, and there is no need for me to go into the diversity of problems that arises from that position.  However, I maintain that these problems could be overcome to a large degree if the health authorities throughout the country, as they are entitled to do under State legislation, would grant certain reliefs to these old people.  Again and again I have pleaded for the payment of allowances, under the Disabled Persons Allowance Act, to our old people.  I have made that case in Cork and here in Dublin.  I cannot see for the life of me why, because some group or some agency who are not responsible to the elected people do not feel that such an allowance should be paid, it is not paid.</P>
    <P>Let me give one instance of what happened down in Cork when I proposed in respect of our old people who are physically or mentally handicapped, and whose financial circumstances or the circumstances of their relatives are such that they have to apply for home assistance, that instead of this allowance being given to them under the heading of home assistance in the winter of their lives, we should pay them the disabled persons allowance, as we are entitled to do under the <Col N="265" /> Health Act of 1953.  Cork Health Authority, which comprises 40 members&mdash;there are two of them here at the present time&mdash;agreed with my proposal that the allowance should be paid.  What happened?  The Manager of that health authority did not feel like it, and said: &ldquo;I am not paying this allowance.  This is a matter for me. I am the bureaucrat.  I am the dictator so far as this business is concerned.&rdquo; As a result, these people were denied the allowance, and I am informed that this group known as the County Managers Association have agreed at their meetings here in Dublin, which are not official or even semi-official, that this allowance should not be granted.  If the Minister were here, I would ask him to make it mandatory on health authorities to pay the allowance where the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>A number of our young people return from England to mind their parents in their own home and they are deprived of any allowance.  They cannot get unemployment benefit because they are not available for work; they cannot get unemployment assistance for the same reason.  I maintain that the old person should get this disablement allowance whereby he could not only maintain himself but maintain the relative who had returned to care for him in his old age.  In Cork South-West constituency, we are paying hospitalisation expenses, according to the latest returns, of up to £14 10s to maintain some of our old people in institutions.  These people are not anxious to be in our institutions. They are in them because of financial circumstances, and if these allowances were payable to them in their homes, they would much prefer to be in their homes.</P>
    <P>From my investigations and from my visits to such institutions, I know that more than 90 per cent of our old people would prefer to be in their own homes, in the concluding stages of their lives rather than in these institutions no matter how well cared for they are.  The county or city managers, call them what you will, have no right to say that legislation enacted by this House should not be put into operation. <Col N="266" /> I moved that the particular manager to whom I refer should be removed from office.  Any person with that outlook is not fit to have control of an authority such as Cork Health Authority which has an expenditure of almost £6 million a year and caters for so many people.  Why would any manager or any group of public servants say that, even though this legislation has been passed by this House, the allowances will not be paid?  All public representatives, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, gave me 100 per cent support in endeavouring to get the allowance, but when it came to removing the manager the numbers decreased and we all know why.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this question of our aged people.  The Minister referred to this section of the community several times yesterday and he was most sympathetic.  I am sure he would not stand for what I have just outlined, imposed on these old people by the autocratic system we have in the country.  It is completely out of place to ask an old person to go to an assistance officer or to send somebody along to get his weekly sum.  It is also unfair to ask a young girl who has returned home to mind her father or mother to go to the assistance officer for an allowance to help her stay at home to mind her parents.  The system whereby the allowance is paid by post, as the disablement allowance can be, would be much better.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that our social welfare regulations allow the man who needs the money only as pocket money, if you like, the man whose family is around him and who are reasonably affluent and who respect and honour him, as the vast majority do, to have the money for private spending.  I know that the State cannot carry the differentiation and that it would impose an impossible burden on them, but that should be the job of the local health authority.  It is the local health authority which must help the physically and mentally incapacitated who need help and the Minister should implement the appropriate legislation.  I am not altogether opposed to the&mdash; should I use the word &ldquo;extermination&rdquo;? &mdash;of local authorities in some cases.  If such people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am going into detail because it is a Budget matter, the old people are the centrepiece of this Budget.  Unless there is a change, unless some of the functions of our executives are curtailed, it would be to the advantage of such people to be dealt with on a national basis, if the health services became completely nationalised.  To conclude on this matter, on the money side there would be little difference in the amount required because if these allowances were payable, people would not be in the institutions; the number would be drastically reduced.  The figure at present is 113,000 people over 70 years of age in receipt of pensions, which is a relatively big number.  The cost of paying the allowances would be saved by the reduction of the numbers in the institutions, and their maintenance, and by the reduction of the pressure on hospital space.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to trading conditions, the balance of payments, and so forth, and we have the usual jargon in dealing with these matters. Reference was made to the possibility of entering the EEC and mention of the EEC by Deputy Cosgrave brings to my mind again the failure of our people abroad who deal with trading.  I have referred to this matter year after year and I have pointed out that in our trading position there is an adverse balance of slightly more than two to one.  How is it that we cannot get the six EEC countries to buy from us as much as they sell to us?  Why is there this big gap in our trading?  In the Budget Statement it can be seen that the gap has widened and our sales to the EEC have reduced by £4 million according to the latest statistics.  I do not understand how that can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think we should be able to bargain with the EEC countries to buy from us as much as they sell to us.  The deficit runs to about £28 million annually and this year it will be in the neighbourhood of £31 million <Col N="268" /> or £32 million.  Something must be wrong with our marketing system. The same situation exists with our trade with eastern Europe.  There we are losing heavily and those countries seem to be getting the best side of the trading balance.  This is bound to affect our economy.  The only country with which we trade on any kind of fair basis, and when I say &ldquo;fair&rdquo; I mean where exports and imports are kept reasonably close, is Britain.  We are very fortunate that Britain is so close to us and we all hope that the difficulties which Britain is facing at present will be overcome.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that our relations with Britain are improving.  Today, we do not hear anything about hoping and praying that every British ship will finish up at the bottom of the sea. I could never see any justification for that attitude and I am pleased that it apparently no longer exists.  Britain has been very helpful to us in catering for our large exports of men and women over a number of years.  Were it not for having Britain there to take these men and women, give them good jobs and better conditions than they have here at home, I shudder at the thought of what the trend might have been in yesterday's Budget.</P>
    <P>Trading is not satisfactory.  We have not at our disposal the expert advice Ministers have.  We have to get information as best we can.  It is very difficult to get information from Ministers even though they are the people who should know.  Deputies like myself have to try to get information we require for ourselves and assess its value, and it is only reasonable for us to question Ministers, particularly those dealing with internal trading, as to why such a position should obtain. With the enormous numbers employed in the public services, I am surprised that there is not more information available not only to the House but to the people at large.  I am surprised, too, that we are not able to strike a better bargain with countries with which we are trading.  I do not want to cast any reflection on our Ambassadors because I am not sufficiently conversant with the position, but I <Col N="269" /> would like to know what help these Ambassadors give to those of our people who move out into other countries on business errands.  Do they give them very much help or are they, as has been alleged, unapproachable?</P>
    <P>With regard to social welfare, the few bob will be helpful.  I was surprised it was not a little more.  I had set my mind on 10s because of the approaching electoral reform.  It was reasonable to assume the Government would make things as bright as possible on the eve of their effort to change the system which, according to some, is responsible for all our ills. It was reasonable to anticipate a brightly painted picture and improved social welfare.  But I did think the figure would be higher.</P>
    <P>We have always supported the policy of social welfare for those who need it.  The mentally and physically handicapped are entitled to the best we can give them.  What I do not like is paying unemployment benefit to such large numbers of people willing, able and capable of productive work.  The figure stands at 58,000.  There is a vast amount of work to be done all over the country&mdash;land reclamation, roadmaking, housebuilding, the provision of water and sewerage schemes.  In that situation it is somewhat bizarre to have 58,000 moving into the exchanges to draw benefit and, in order to qualify for that benefit, they must give an assurance that they will do no work of any kind for cash.  That system should be changed.  I am satisfied from my knowledge of these people that they would much prefer to be working instead of going along to the exchange and drawing the money there without any physical effort on their part.  I know many of them have paid contributions, possibly more by way of contribution than they draw in unemployment benefit, but the system is degrading and demoralising.</P>
    <P>I have made the case that civil servants should be drawn from every Department to form an interdepartmental committee for the purpose of establishing a system designed to absorb the unemployed in useful employment and those so engaged could be paid by subventions from the Department of <Col N="270" /> Social Welfare equal to the amounts the Department pays by way of unemployment. With proper co-operation and co-ordination, workers could be moved from one scheme to another, according as the need arose.  Earlier I quoted some figures in relation to the incomes of some of our public servants. The figure is, if anything, less than the figure for unemployment benefit and a subvention, therefore, from the Department of Social Welfare could cover the full cost of the scheme I suggest.  Why should these be left standing around idle?  They do not want unemployment; they want employment.  They want to do a job of work.  Houses are required; water and sewerage schemes are required.  Everyone knows the problem of getting money in regard to the latter.  There are many local improvements that could be carried out and many desirable amenities that could be provided if my suggestion were adopted.  These subventions from the Department of Social Welfare could be utilised for productive work carried out by those who are at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>Each Department seems to operate completely independently.  There is no co-ordination.  I suppose the defect is really at the top.  Each Minister is busy minding his own business.  He discharges his functions as if his Department were the only Department in the country.  I thought the Minister for Finance had it in him to change a system that has outlived its usefulness. I had high regard for Deputy Haughey's qualifications and felt that he would revolutionise the Civil Service, being the head of the service by virtue of the position he occupies.  I hope that he will take steps in that direction.  He may claim that there were other items to engage his attention but I contend that this inter-departmental committee should be established.</P>
    <P>The Budget was summed up in an interview reported in the Government newspaper to-day with a man with a wife and family in Dublin who said to the <i>Irish Press</i> reporter: &ldquo;It does not make much difference to me.  It does not make much difference to my family.  We will be somewhat the same <Col N="271" /> after it as we were before it.&rdquo;  He summed up in those remarks&mdash;I was surprised that they were published in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;the general opinion in the country, that the Budget has made little difference to any section. Naturally, any benefits that arise from the Budget will be wiped away in increasing costs.  The man that I was speaking about, earning £8 a week, may say that the Budget makes little difference to him.  He will have to pay 2d an ounce extra for tobacco and a 1d on the pint.  He may not mind about that.  Any little difference the Budget makes will be on the wrong side as far as he is concerned.  The farmer or the industrialist has got very little benefit from the Budget.  He, too, can say that the Budget does not make much difference to him, that he is somewhat the same now as he was before the Budget was announced.</P>
    <P>The few side benefits provided in the Budget such as free radio and television licences and free transport are undoubtedly of some value to the recipients but the costs indicated are much higher than they should be.  In most cases a television set in a house where there is an old age pensioner is licensed in the name of a member of the family.  In such case there will not be a free licence.  It is only where the aged person is the licensee that the State will help.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring to a matter I have mentioned here occasionally about which I feel very strongly. I realise that the objective I have in mind is very difficult to attain and I am not blaming the Minister for not reaching the target this year.  When we speak of old age pensions and retirement allowances, we should have in mind a change of age for qualification purposes.  In 1908, the British Government set the standard at 70 years.  That was 60 years ago.  So far as certain groups are concerned, that standard has been lowered.  Professional people and others get their retirement allowances and pensions at the age of 65. The man out under the wind and the weather has to linger on for five more years.  I realise that a reduction in the age limit would be costly but it would <Col N="272" /> not be nearly as costly as was indicated by the Minister in reply to me some time ago.  The advantages to be derived would far outweigh the cost.</P>
    <P>First of all, is it not time that there should be a change?  Has not everything else that one could think of changed in the last few years?  Why not give an opportunity to people, who are mainly manual workers, to retire at 65 years of age?  That would leave their places open to younger persons and would help to relieve the unemployment problem to which I have referred. Secondly, in the case of farmers or shopkeepers, it would be an incentive to them to transfer their businesses five years earlier to members of their families who would then have an opportunity of taking up where their fathers had left off.  Thirdly, it would afford the persons concerned an opportunity to enjoy in some reasonable comfort the later stages of their lives. Unfortunately, almost every second person of more than 70 years of age is incapacitated.  That is a factual statement.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the cost of reducing the qualifying age would be some £12 million.  The usual question is asked; where is the money to come from?  I calculate that if the pension were paid at 65 years of age, a great deal of the money involved would flow back to the Exchequer by way of tax on consumer goods.  Almost every commodity an old age pensioner buys is taxed.  Drink is taxed and cigarettes are excessively taxed.  There is a tax on food and clothing.  It is reasonable to assume that, at least, half of the retirement allowance would flow back to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is now in the House and I should like to comment on the educational system but time does not allow.  I understand that the debate will be adjourned at 6 p.m. but I want to say to the Minister that he should ask his colleagues to review the qualifying age for old age pensions. If there were a proposal to reduce the qualifying age from 70 to 65 in this Budget, it would have, without doubt, the support of the Labour Party and of the Fine Gael Party and, I am sure, of every member of the <Col N="273" /> Fianna Fáil Party.  There is a national demand for a change of this kind.  I shall conclude by reiterating my disappointment with the Minister's Budget Statement.  I expected something more hopeful for the various sectors of our economy, particularly the agricultural and industrial sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>I feel privileged that one of my first acts as Minister for Education should be to sponsor this particular piece of legislation and to recommend it to Dáil Éireann as something that will go a long way on the road towards applying a finishing touch, to the structure of free post-primary education so ably and swiftly set up by my late predecessor, Donogh O'Malley.  It is no denigration of Donogh O'Malley, however, if I associate with him as coarchitects of our educational advancement the names of Dr. Patrick Hillery, Minister for Labour, and George Colley, Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was during their terms of office as Minister for Education that the spadework was begun.  I refer particularly in that regard to the OECD survey &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;. Once our course had been set and the road signposted, it was inevitable that we should reach the stage of development now being initiated.  It was perhaps Donogh O'Malley's greatest achievement that this stage has been reached in so short a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the introduction of free post-primary education in September, 1967, has rendered unnecessary the provision of scholarships at second level education, so that we may now tackle the problem of enabling deserving students to proceed to third level studies at universities and comparable institutions.  The purpose of this Bill is to divert the flow of the existing financial provision for scholarships to that end and to make available <Col N="274" /> sufficient additional money to enable all students, who reach the required standard and who satisfy the means conditions, to have the higher reaches of education thrown open to them.  It will provide avenues of opportunity to students from a segment of our population who have hitherto been unable to go as far as their abilities could carry them.  It will cater much more adequately than before for the particular bent of each student in making assistance available not only in universities but also in approved institutions which offer courses leading to a definitive qualification of university degree level.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted from the explanatory memorandum that the standard of attainment has been set at four honours in matriculation subjects at the leaving certificate examination. It might be argued by some that this standard is too high.  One answer to that is the fact that it was reached by over 1,900 candidates at last year's leaving certificate examination. Another is that no apology is due for putting a premium on attainment as far as higher education is concerned. Furthermore when we come to treat education as basically what it is, an investment, we have got to assess how much we can invest at any given time. By investing what money is available to us in the best brains we are making sure of the greatest return.</P>
    <P>What is proposed under the Bill is of itself so substantial and represents such a departure from previous approaches that I see no reason why this piece of legislation should not commend itself to the House.  Heretofore you had a position in which about 275 university scholarships were offered annually.  In some of the less well-off counties, the number of scholarships available did not exceed four or five. Accordingly an accident of birth played an important part as to whether a student did or did not get a scholarship. Now a standard which will be applied nationally is being set.  Students will know where they stand.  There is no question of the competition being keener in one county than in another. In fact competition as such disappears. We anticipate that this will lead to a <Col N="275" /> position in which over 900 students will avail themselves of the grants which will be provided under the authority of this Bill.  Let me repeat that by any standards this is a very substantial advance.</P>
    <P>The means conditions have been fully set forth in the explanatory memorandum. From a basic income figure of £1,200 they proceed to £2,600 depending on the number of children in the family.</P>
    <P>The full rates of grant, £175 per annum to students living in or near a university town or other centre of higher education and £300 per annum otherwise correspond to the highest rates of university scholarship offered in recent times.  Reduced rates are payable by reference to family income and the number of children in the family.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the required standard of attainment and the means conditions the Bill does not propose any rigid requirements.  In fact it is very flexible, allowing me with the consent of the Minister for Finance to make such changes from time to time as experience and circumstances may warrant.</P>
    <P>As to the financing of the scheme generally, the county and borough councils will not be asked to contribute more than what they provided in the financial year 1967-68 for post-primary and university scholarships, a sum of about £280,000.  The remaining moneys will be provided from State funds.  It is estimated that in three to four years the annual cost will be running at about £750,000 of which the State will be contributing £470,000.</P>
    <P>The form of the Bill itself is simple and straightforward.  It is intended to repeal existing enactments so that the legislation now proposed will provide the foundation for all future aid to students in higher education.  It is a genuine effort to harness the available resources to the task in hand.  It will constitute a flexible instrument for further social and educational progress.  It will benefit the community as a whole and will be particularly beneficial to the part of our community most in need of aid.  It is a further <Col N="276" /> earnest of the Government's commitment to education.  There is no element of &ldquo;mair a chapaill agus gheofair féar&rdquo; about it.  Yes, there is no question of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  It is for these reasons that I confidently recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister to his new portfolio, but I cannot extend the same warm welcome to the proposals he has just formulated.  In spite of the lack of warmth which must necessarily accompany my recommendation, I still regard it as a step; but I doubt very much if in ordinary parlance it is a step in the right direction, that is to say, whether the sights have been properly set or whether the signposting is adequate.  We object, from the point of view of our own policy on education, to the means test.  We object further to the standard being set down, namely, four honours.  I should perhaps have asked the Minister if these four honours are to be four honours in any four subjects, subject to the inclusion of Irish in one of the four.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have explained that.  I am looking at the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, 1967-68.  On page 15 of this is set out the recognised subjects for the leaving certificate.  On page 29 are set out the qualifying tests for a pass leaving certificate and for an honours leaving certificate.  I must confine myself to the honours leaving certificate because naturally a person who gets four honours will get an honours leaving certificate, provided Irish is one of the four.  Of course, there can be four honours and a pass Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That of course makes this scheme utterly outrageous, as I hope to show.  There is a maximum inequality of marks attached to each subject in the leaving certificate.  What I mean by that is that you have 600, for instance, for Irish, 400 for English, 600 for mathematics, 300 each for history and geography, 400 for domestic science, 200 for drawing, 300 for commerce, and 300 for art.  Using these marks as a base, as they must be used, if my calculations are correct, you can have a boy or a girl taking Irish, English, mathematics, history and geography&mdash;not unusual subjects in the leaving certificate&mdash;and let that boy or girl get three honours, just a minimum mark of 65 per cent in Irish, English and mathematics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the thing is worse.  No, it is 65 per cent.  The standard for a pass in a subject is 40 per cent and for honours 65 per cent.  It is on page 27 of the rules and regulations. Does anyone in the Department of Education know what the proper percentage is?  It is now 65 per cent.  That at least is a concession.  If a boy or girl gets a minimum of 65 per cent in Irish, English and mathematics, and 60 per cent, which is a simple pass if the required 65 per cent is not reached, in two other subjects, say, history and geography, that constitutes two passes, and he or she will emerge with a maximum of 1,400 marks.  If a boy or girl chooses to take four subjects and engages in cramming&mdash;and I am afraid this will lead to a lot of new cramming institutions coming into being&mdash;and if he or she takes art at 300 marks and gets minimum honours with 195, drawing at 200 marks, minimum honours 130, commerce 300 marks, minimum <Col N="278" /> honours 195 and Irish 390, those four minimum honours in those four subjects will net a total of 910 marks and that pupil will qualify under the scheme now being formulated by the Minister for a university grant, whereas the pupil with 1,400 marks will not qualify.</P>
      <P>It may well be argued that the aggregate of marks is not necessarily a standard of scholarship, but, in my view, a boy or girl who got three honours in Irish, English and mathematics with a minimum of 65 per cent and a pass in history and geography with 60 per cent and a total of 1,400 marks is, in our scheme of things in this country, more qualified to benefit from a university education than a person who would resort to cramming. There may not be many but the posibility is there, and once it is there it is an impediment to true scholarship.  The first person is more qualified to benefit from a university education than the person who got 910 marks in subjects: like art, drawing, commerce and Irish. You could take five other subjects: Irish, physics or hygiene, domestic science, drawing and commerce, and you could pass in Irish which is necessary for the leaving certificate, and get four honours in the others, and a total of 1,005 marks, almost 400 short of the aggregate of the person who is denied a grant under the scheme, and qualify for a university grant under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to wait and he will have to recast this whole thing before we finish with it.  Mathematics are a necessary medium for engineering and science. You could get four honours without any of these and still qualify for a university grant.  The Minister will have to have another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is opposed to the scheme announced by the Fine Gael Party in 1966, and is but an extension of the existing scholarship scheme.  It is a diversion of the money that was to be used in post-primary education by way of scholarships towards the university level.  I suppose it is intended to get rid of the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;, but &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; is what a university education means.  Scholarship is learning. This gets rid of the idea of competition, as the Minister said.  Unless <Col N="280" /> there is competition, with a view to the establishment of the proper standards of scholarships, I do not think you will emerge with anything like what we understood scholarship to be.</P>
    <P>There are very many people who agree that there is an extremely vital difference between a standard of examination and a standard of education. People who could not get four honours in any selection of subjects might be brilliantly good at one or two or three subjects.  There are mathematicians who are absolutely hopeless at languages and make no secret of it.  There are linguists to whom mathematics is a completely incomprehensible subject.  The same applies to the sciences.  There are medical men, outstanding in their own particular sphere, who really could not be regarded as having been brilliant leaving certificate or matriculation people.  Accountants might fit into the same category; some chemists, lawyers &mdash;with all of them, you will find that&mdash; and, of course, in addition, there is the late developer.  He is a rare enough bird, but, mind you, rare and all as he is, there are some of them well known to us all&mdash;different ones, I suppose&mdash; who are outstanding in their own field and to whom nobody gave a chance at the time they were thinking of entering university and entering, mind you, through cramming, through tutors and through all kinds of courses.  Eventually having got there and as soon as they got in&mdash;into the engineering, legal or medical sections; probably it is more true of medicine than of anything else &mdash;they found their true <i>forte</i> and were able to go ahead.  These are the kinds of people who could never be expected to get four honours.</P>
    <P>I know that a lot of people get four honours but, again, are four honours the test of suitability for university education?  I do not think so.  It is not the paramount test.  It may well be part of the test.  I do not think it goes the whole way in determining whether a person is or is not likely to benefit from university education.</P>
    <P>In section 1 (b), the definition section of this Bill, we read:</P>
    <P>...any other institution in so far as <Col N="281" /> it provides courses leading to qualifications which are, in the opinion of the Minister, equivalent to university degrees.</P>
    <P>I do not care who the Minister is&mdash;I am not being at all personal in this; I am speaking of the Minister as simply the political head of the Department; I do not care who he is; I do not care whether he comes from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party&mdash;he is not, even with the advice of administrators, competent to determine matters of high scholarship of this kind.  I regard that paragraph as an inroad on the autonomy of the university. The university should determine what is the equivalent of a university degree or the standard of scholarship required.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied about this standard of four honours.  If the university has determined that a person with two honours in the leaving certificate, and with the leaving certificate, is a person who might properly be admitted to university, then I think this scheme of grants, however more costly it might be, would not be that much more costly because there will be an administrative cost in this, looking at these two Schedules, looking for rateable valuations and looking for incomes and, I suppose, determining whether you live in or adjacent to, and what &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; means and whether it will be ten miles or five miles from a university town, whether there is a bus on the road, and so on.  We shall be in fierce trouble with all kinds of regulations. I cannot imagine them being less than the carriage of children to primary schools at the moment, with age limits, and so on, but that is another day's work.  All of these things will pile up and we shall have tremendous trouble with these tests.</P>
    <P>There is one question&mdash;I suppose the Minister will deal with it when replying &mdash;in relation to the Schedules in the explanatory memorandum.  The Minister talks about less than £1,200 a year and a rateable valuation, in the next column, of less than £60.  Does that mean that you can have a holding, or a house with a holding, of less than £60 valuation in order to qualify?  Take the second one&mdash;£1,200 or more but <Col N="282" /> less than £1,300 and a rateable valuation of £60 but less than £65.  Does that mean that you can have £1,200 a year and a holding of a valuation of between £60 and £65?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I was impressed by the comments of the Union of Students in Ireland after the Minister's press conference.  They certainly put it extremely lucidly, as reported on page 3 of the <i>Irish Press</i> of 23rd April, 1968.  I think it is well that we should examine these points because we are living at a time not of angry young men but of angry young men and angry young women and of shockingly discontented students.  It must be very comforting for a Minister for Education, as it is for me and for education authorities generally, to find a young body such as the Union of Students of Ireland sitting down to examine the Minister's proposals and to enumerate their points of comment or objection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="283" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to go to the trouble of submitting them for publication. It is for that reason that I propose to deal with them now in this House.  They welcome, as I do, in a restricted manner, of course, the proposals themselves.  They regret, as I do, the grossly limited nature of the scheme.  The first point they stress is:</P>
      <P>The assumption, which the scheme makes, that the leaving certificate examination is a suitable mechanism for the selection of students and that those with a four-honours pass are most suitable for higher education is highly questionable. The examination is designed to act as a terminal qualification; a higher education selection examination must be considerably different.</P>
      <P>I have adverted to that point in a general way and I think it is a valid objection, in addition to the various comments I have made on how persons with a lower aggregate of marks can secure a grant while others with a higher aggregate must necessarily stay out of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Their second point is:</P>
      <P>The scheme will further accentuate the existing unfortunate competitive element in second-level education.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very vital consideration. It goes on:</P>
      <P>University entrance requirements already give rise to undue competition and an excess of specialisation, both of which are educationally undesirable.  The tendency for students will now be to specialise in four subjects from the intermediate level onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we shall see schools doing that&mdash;some, not all of them.  I can see special selecting of pupils being done after the intermediate year in relation to their intermediate successes and I can see them being diverted into classes for four specially selected subjects so that they will emerge as specialists&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;in these subjects.  Can anybody say that is a suitable combination of scholarship <Col N="284" /> and the necessary knowledgeable leisure that must accompany the pursuit of scholarship in a secondary school?  Will these boys and girls have their noses to the grindstones for two years in a specially selected way in order to qualify for this grant, when, with very little extra expense, both the local and the other grant could be made available to all who qualify for entrance to a university according to the university authorities?  I think that is the simpler and better way.</P>
    <P>The Union of Students go on to point No. 3 where they say:</P>
    <P>No provision whatsoever has been made for students at present in higher education.</P>
    <P>I think that the present scholarship-holders may carry on.  I think I am right in saying that those now in receipt of scholarships under the schemes being abolished by this Bill will carry on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you come across cases&mdash;I have had a few letters about this&mdash;of people who are making great sacrifices at present and have gone on to pensions while their families are still dependent on them and some at the university.  They are struggling along as best they can.  Nothing is being done about that.  I take it that is what the Union of Students has in mind when they say that no provision is being made for students at present at universities or technological colleges.</P>
      <P>The statement at point No. 4 says:</P>
      <P>The number of students who will be helped by the scheme is so small as to have little material effect upon the present restricted access to higher education.</P>
      <P>One would, of course, need vastly more information before dealing with that.  I presume the Union of Students had more information before they made such a material pronouncement because there is the means test and the matter of four honours.  Assuming you have a certain number with four honours they will not necessarily qualify for the total grant.  I do not know that this idea of the grant being related to the number of dependants is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> The fifth point is:</P>
    <P>Even the maximum amounts payable under the scheme are inadequate to meet the costs of the student.  Where fees of £100 are paid &mdash;and many students must pay more than that amount&mdash;the remaining amount for students living away from home will not even cover the cost of lodgings for the 36 weeks which students on average must remain up at university.  Thus even those who do benefit from the scheme will continue to have economic penalties imposed on them as a result of their participation in higher education.</P>
    <P>That speaks for itself, and I think it is true and particularly so where the scheme operates on a sliding down scale.  You are paying fees out of these grants.  The Fine Gael policy was that the fees were paid and after that, maintenance grants: I know something about this and about the difficulties of having to pay fees out of the grant for university attendance.  That does away with the grant in an extraordinary way. I had that experience myself with scholarships at the university.  When you pay the fees out of the scholarship, it requirse a considerable sacrifice from one's parents to make up the balance.  I do not know that my experience was different from that of anybody else in those times, nor that circumstances now are any different for any more people.</P>
    <P>That is why I say I cannot give this measure the warm welcome I should like to give it and give the Minister on his first appearance with a Bill in his new Department.  It is a typical example of stealing Fine Gael policy and failing to be fully inspired.  I wish the Minister had our courage.  He has the money but lacks the courage or perhaps it would be fairer to say that the Government lack it.  I am sure the Minister has sufficient courage if he could persuade the Minister for Finance to do the right thing which is obvious in these circumstances, that is, to provide for all who qualify to enter the university the necessary fees and the local or rural grant, or whatever it may be called.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> The seventh point is about the means test.  We are perpetually talking about means tests, for pensioners, for widows and orphans and so on.  The cost of the administration of these schemes is something that can never be determined and something we are never fully informed about.  The Union of Students say:</P>
    <P>The means test perpetuates the dependent position of the student&mdash; it also carries with it all the unfortunate social implications of such a test.  The Bill does not indicate the way in which the means test will be operated but in general it can be said that a means test that would be just would be extremely expensive, and one which was inexpensive to operate would inevitably be deficient in flexibility and therefore justice.</P>
    <P>I take it that the students did not have the explanatory memorandum when they were saying that because it is now clear from these two Schedules how it will be operated.  Indeed, they are quite extraordinary when you come to deal with the means test.  A man, say, a farmer, with £80 or £85 valuation who has one dependant at the university gets £25.</P>

      <P>The last point the Union deals with is this:</P>
      <P>USI regrets the absence of provision for post-graduate studies.  The Union regrets the scale of priorities for investment in education which allows for such a restricted system of student grants.  USI believes that there are other areas in which economies could more appropriately and more safely be made.  However, despite the many disadvantages the positive character of the scheme is recognised and welcomed as an earnest of the Government's intention to give urgent attention to student financing in education.</P>
      <P>That, I think, is a very fair comment from the beginning to the end.  It is not argumentative; it is not destructive. It is full of carefully thought-out suggestions and ones which I think the Minister should examine before we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>For people living in or adjacent to a university town, the maximum grant is £175, out of which, of course, fees must be paid, and the maximum grant for students whose normal family residence is not in or adjacent to a university town is £300.  Deputies who are interested in this should have a look at the sliding scale and see where there is, in many cases, a possibility, in fact even a probability, of genuine hardship.  In the Fine Gael policy <i>Towards a Just Society</i> in connection with education, paragraph 150, page 46, says:</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, therefore, propose to introduce a scheme of fee and maintenance grants for university students.  We intend that these maintenance grants should be available to all who require them and who qualify to enter a university in accordance with the entrance standards laid down by the university authorities and acceptable to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where we differ from the Minister, when he talks in the definition section of what, in his opinion, are the <Col N="289" /> suitable standards.  The authority that is receiving the students should be free to lay down its standard of scholarship for them, and they should benefit accordingly.  All students, in my view and in my Party's view, who qualify to enter a university in these times of educational change and in these times when the accent is on freer and freer education and equality of opportunity for all, should go in and qualify alike for the grants.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 152, page 46, says:</P>
    <P>The fee grants will be designed to meet the cost of university fees.</P>
    <P>There is, as I am sure everybody here knows, a wide divergence between the fees chargeable in one faculty and the fees chargeable in another.  That is understandable.  I do not know what the various fees are at the moment, but I know they are considerably higher than when I last remember them.  We go on to say.</P>
    <P>They will not be at a fixed amount but will vary with the cost of the course being taken.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 153 says:</P>
    <P>We do not favour a means test because under Irish conditions the proportion of parents who can afford the full cost of university education for their children is so small that there would be little to be gained financially by excluding their children from participation in the scheme, a process which would involve the application of a cumbersome means test to all university entrants in order to segregate the minority of students whose parents are well-to-do.</P>
    <P>Then we talk of local maintenance grants, the ones to which the Minister refers in respect of those who live in or adjacent to a university town.  Our figure was £150, and the Minister has gone one better.</P>

Of course, our £150 would be a supplement to the fee, so that you have not really outbidded us; you are codding <Col N="290" /> the people again that you are giving them more.  It looks as if it is better than our £150, but our £150 was plus the fee, whereas the Minister's £175 includes the fee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the other maintenance grants, applying to those living sufficiently far away from a university to qualify, we say:</P>
      <P>The amount of these grants initially would be up to £350 a year.</P>
      <P>That, of course, would be in addition to the fees.  When the scheme was first announced some little time ago, we made a statement about it, and it was a statement welcoming the Government's acceptance of the Fine Gael proposals but rejecting the standard they were setting, that is, the four honours.  We did this before the Union of Students, and before the many other informed people to whom I have been speaking, stated the same thing, that four honours is not a true or proper test.  It is taking the decision away from the university; it is simply an extended scholarship scheme as we knew the scholarship schemes, and it runs completely contrary to the principle of equality of opportunity in education, and to that principle we in Fine Gael are entirely committed.  This scheme is one which prevents students who even surpass the university entrance standard from availing of the opportunity of a university education because of the lack of parental means, and a scheme of that kind cannot be regarded as socially just.</P>
      <P>We also dealt with the question of paying the fees out of the grant, and we are still violently opposed to that, because in addition to fees, there are text books.  Text books before the war, and even later than the war, were not too dear, but now text books are exorbitantly dear.  When I say that they are exorbitantly dear, I do not mean that somebody is making a fierce profit out of them but they are dear because of the cost of production, when you can get a suitable person to produce such books, and they must necessarily be dear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> That is our view of these proposals. In recapitulation, I want the Minister to look again at the regulations and to do a few of these little sums that I did with university subjects and to see and recognise the unfairness of the result that would deprive a boy or girl, who had 400 more marks in four or five subjects than somebody else, of a grant. That is a valid objection if you are going to accept the total number of marks as being the thing that counts. We are always inclined to call things &ldquo;a step&rdquo;, but this is a step, and, as I said before, I am not certain that it is far enough or that the signposts are adequate.  But it is a halting step.  I hope I can remember the proper term. I would like to think that this would not be the great educational blundering that might be referred to in later times as the great catalectic, the halting foot. It is not a bridge term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The halting foot which, while it was a sort of figure of speech, or a means of poetic composition, nevertheless left in its trail a certain impediment.  I would not like a scheme of this kind to be that kind of catalectic that would leave in the minds of our students, not alone of the present day but of those to come, a sort of ill-informed and ill-defined Byronic discontent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">

      <P>I should like to congratulate the new Minister on his appointment to this very challenging and exciting post, to wish him well and to hope that his term of office will be marked with the same degree of success as was that of his predecessor, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley.  We in the Labour Party naturally welcome any proposals, or the introduction of any Bill which will make education available to even one child to whom education was not available heretofore. We are conscious that this measure does not provide all that we would wish for in the sphere of higher education. I suppose that no measure will ever satisfy all sections of the community <Col N="292" /> and no measure will be absolutely perfect, but we look on this as a breakthrough in the field of higher education which is welcomed by us who for so many years have been advocating the rights of all of our children to an education commensurate with their abilities and without regard to the financial ability of their parents to pay. We must welcome any measure which will bring that nearer to reality.</P>
      <P>For the past few weeks since this scheme was announced by the Minister, there has been some confusion in the minds of members and officials of local authorities in regard to the extent moneys should be devoted by them to this scheme of higher educational grants.  The House will recall that up to last year the local authority provided each year a certain sum for the provision of post-primary scholarships, and with the introduction of the free post-primary school scheme, all that was required in preparing for the coming year was that those scholarships already held by pupils should be maintained, that provision should be made to continue scholarships held by pupils until their post-primary education was completed. We, and I am sure many other local authorities, in accordance with the desire of the Department devoted the surplus of money not required for post-primary scholarships to university scholarships.  In preparing estimates this year, local authorities were doubtful about the position.  They did not know whether they should estimate for the total or only for the continuance of the post-primary and further education scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork County Council's estimate worked out at an increase of £15,000 but we finally decided to be optimistic and cut out the £15,000.  It would appear from the Minister's speech that the county borough councils will not be asked to contribute more than they contributed for post-primary and further education scholarships in the financial year 1967-68.  In Cork county, post-primary scholarships were discontinued which resulted in our being able to provide 50 extra university <Col N="293" /> scholarships.  We allocated that money and what I want to know is, is our contribution frozen at the new figure or, if we had not allocated the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid then that it will mean that we shall have to bring in a supplementary estimate and perhaps other local authorities will have to do the same.  I am glad the Minister in this scheme envisages the allocation of these grants to other institutes of higher education, apart from the university.  This is very important in our present economic set-up.  It is important, too, that some students should have the possibility of following technological courses and they should be facilitated in every possible way to do this.  I would accept this measure in the spirit of the Minister's phrase where he said that these conditions may be varied from time to time as occasion arises.</P>
      <P>Reference is made also to the admission standard required, but I am disappointed in regard to the difference that exists between the entrance requirement of the person who can afford to pay and the person who has to avail of this grant.  It is a pity that some uniform requirement in regard to the entrance level could not have been worked out between the universities and the Minister on the introduction of this scheme.  I know the universities are now building up to three honours and my hope it that, up to three, we, as they build will build down to three. That is my ambition.  If that could be done, it would be very useful from the point of view of the entrance examination.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister arrived at some of his figures and I should be grateful for some enlightenment. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> It might be argued by some that this standard is too high.  One answer to that is the fact that it was reached by over 1,900 candidates at last year's leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>How the Minister arrived at his second figure puzzles me somewhat.  He says:</P>
    <P>We anticipate that this will lead to a position in which over 900 students will avail themselves of the grants which will be provided under the authority of this Bill.</P>
    <P>How was that figure of 900 arrived at?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We assumed that some students would go to training colleges, into the Civil Service, or into business.  All might not necessarily want to go on for higher education. We made the assumption on the pattern over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to teacher training, this is a matter, I think, that needs close examination. Heretofore the very cream took up teaching as a career.  That was eminently satisfactory.  It is all the more important that teacher training should be linked with university education and we should, I think, give it the same status as a university profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise the best will not go on for teaching.  On page 1 of the explanatory memorandum, paragraph (c) says:</P>
      <P>The age limit will be that laid down for entrance to the institution at which the student proposes to avail himself of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with the universities in order to ensure a lowering of the age limit in certain circumstances.  That may be an odd request, but, some years ago, the age limit for post-primary scholarships was reduced and some very bright boys and girls secured these scholarships at the age of 11. That means that they will finish their secondary school curriculum at the age of 16.  I guarantee that they will get four, or more, honours in their leaving <Col N="295" /> certificate, but, because of their ages, they will be precluded from benefiting under this scheme.  We argued this matter with the university authorities in Cork and they told us that there was no way of measuring the age of mental maturity, and, while these bright boys and girls might be more mature at 16 than others at 26, they maintained that 17 on 1st January was the ideal.  That will prevent some of the very best material we have availing of higher education.  This problem will arise in the next three or four years.  The result may well be that these children will take up positions for which they may not be really suited or in which they may not be able to use their talents to the full.  I would ask the Minister to try to prevail on the university authorities to make some allowance in the case of these very bright children.</P>
    <P>I am not as concerned as Deputy Lindsay about particular subjects.  My experience is&mdash;it may be limited&mdash;that university authorities know what they want and they insist on getting what they want.  They have their own system of marking subjects.  I am sure that position will continue.  I should like the Minister to ensure it will.</P>
    <P>With regard to the grants, we are all aware, as Deputy Lindsay said, that means tests consume a great deal of money and we have no way of estimating it.  However, until we alter the whole system, a means test will be necessary.  We accept that it will.  These grants will be an incentive to those who have a little money.  They will be outside the scope of those who have none and these are the people about whom I am concerned.  A widow, with one child, in receipt of a non-contributory pension in West Cork, or elsewhere, will be unable to send that child to university.  Deputy Murphy, speaking earlier on the Budget, said that our interdepartmental system was defective because there was no co-ordination between the various Departments.  This is a case in point.  The child of this widow will cease to be treated as a dependant when he reaches the age of 16, irrespective of any scheme any other Department may be offering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> I would ask the Minister for Education to ensure that the Department of Social Welfare will work in close <i>liaison</i> with his Department where the education of such children is concerned. The sum of £300 will not enable a widow with a non-contributory pension to keep her child in a university town.  One cannot get lodgings under £5 at present.  As far as I know, lodgings are not available in any town at under £5 a week.  This scheme will be of wonderful benefit to many people who are reasonably comfortable but not sufficiently comfortable to afford university education for their children and who certainly could not afford it unless they were living in or near a university town.  But there will still be at the bottom of the scale in regard to this scheme as in connection with all the schemes operating in this country, a group of people for whom we are not catering, whose incomes make it impossible for them to avail of the grants.  These are people for whom I am very concerned.  In this group there are very able boys and girls who deserve to continue their education and who would be an asset to the State if they were allowed to do so.  As previous speakers have said, because of the cost of books, clothes and all that goes to maintain a child, it is reasonable to assume that there are people who will not be able to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister about the availability of facilities for the extra number of students.  I understand that the Minister anticipates that 900 students will avail of these grants. I would not say that that means that there will be 900 additional university students because persons will avail of these grants who would in any case attend a university.  Does the Minister believe that the existing facilities will meet the requirements of the increased number of students?  I know that at the moment the facilities available are not adequate.  The facilities that students require for successful study are not available in the colleges.  That is a matter that should receive attention in order to ensure that when we are providing for higher education and making it more readily available to <Col N="297" /> a great many more people, the education will be of the required standard and it will be possible for the students to benefit to the utmost from the money being expended on them by the State.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and, I am sure, all other Parties, will be examining this measure more closely before Committee Stage.  We are all anxious that the Bill will be completely successful. Any criticism we have to offer is made with a view to making the scheme a success.  We welcome it as a breakthrough in the sphere of higher education and we sincerely hope that any deficiencies we now see in the scheme will be short-lived and that it will provide in this sphere the justice which is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Mrs. Desmond in congratulating the Minister on his appointment to the Ministry of Education and to wish him the same success as was achieved by his immediate predecessor in that office, the late Donogh O'Malley.  In his introductory statement the Minister has paid tribute to the late Donogh O'Malley and also to Deputy Dr. Hillery and to Deputy Colley.  He can go back to the Taoiseach, who was an occupant of the office.  Every one of these left his own mark on education.  Great strides have been made.  I commend the Minister for introducing this measure and, like the other speakers, I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few comments to make about a matter about which I am not satisfied.  This came to my mind when Deputy Gilhawley put down a question on the day before the Dáil recessed for Easter as to the number of scholarships being provided by county councils. I asked some supplementary questions on that occasion because Galway County Council had drawn up a scholarship scheme, of which I have a copy here.  As Deputy Mrs. Desmond has said in the case of her local authority, we availed of the money saved on post-primary education and put into our scholarship scheme the sum of £5,400.  There are over 50 post-primary and secondary schools in <Col N="298" /> County Galway to which we sent application forms printed by O'Gormans Limited, Galway, and it was indicated that they should be returned on or before 22nd April, 1968.  After all this trouble, this scheme is brought in which supersedes the scheme we formulated. Therefore, it is my contention that there was not proper co-ordination between the Department of Education, the local authorities and the local authority scholarship committees.  I have been a member of the Galway scholarship committee since 1943.  We met annually and formulated a scheme. We did that this year.</P>
    <P>Last year we gave about 14 university scholarships and up to 100 post-primary scholarships.  This year, the money to be saved on post-primary scholarships was to be allocated for university scholarships so that we would have 40 or 50 university scholarships in Galway.  When Dr. Hillery introduced his scheme, it was optional to allocate 75 per cent of the money under a means test and to allocate the other 25 per cent for scholarships with-other 25 per cent for scholarships without a means test.  That was done in order to provide an incentive for brilliant students.  Having been in training college and being an educator, I know, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, that incentive and competition are very important in education.  Incentive is better than punishment and I have never been a great believer in punishment.  I believe it was in order to provide that incentive that under the scheme introduced by Dr. Hillery as Minister for Education we were allowed to allocate 25 per cent of the money for scholarships without a means test.</P>
    <P>In County Galway, since last September, students have been working in the belief that next June they would be able to get a university scholarship, irrespective of their parents' means if they attained the standard required. They are now being excluded by this Bill.  They may not have a legal right, but, at least, they and their parents have a moral right to these scholarships. That matter should be set right before this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> I am not satisfied with the term &ldquo;grants&rdquo;.  There are housing grants, water and sewerage grants, in-calf heifer grants, and now we are to have university education grants.  I think the term &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; is more appropriate. The Minister seems to think that there is a poor law association with the term &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;, according to a press conference he gave.  However, that is only a minor matter.  I am not particularly worried about the terminology, so long as the money is available.  I should like to repeat that under the scheme that Dr. Hillery introduced some years ago and which has been in operation up to the present moment, Galway County Council allocated 75 per cent of the money available on the basis of a means test and the other 25 per cent without a means test.  Under that scheme, we would be able to give 35 to 40 scholarships on the basis of a means test and another ten or 12, without a means test to brilliant students.  This option is not provided for in the Bill and I suggest that an amendment making such provision should be introduced.</P>
    <P>I asked a Supplementary Question here on the day the House adjourned which was reported in the newspapers and in <i>To-day in the Dáil</i> that evening. Since then, I have received letters and telephone calls from all over the country.  I even got a letter from a parent here in Dublin explaining the position in Dublin last year, where they had the same as we had in Galway&mdash; a smaller number of university scholarships. With the extra money they were hoping to have 250 under the means this time and 37 over the means.  These are all being cut out now and the result will be much the same as we have in Galway if this grant scheme goes through.</P>
    <P>I am not happy, as a ratepayer and as a member of Galway County Council, that the contribution of the county councils will be frozen at last year's sum.  That means that the unprogressive counties that did not contribute much towards the scholarship scheme down the years will get off lightly, while the progressive counties like <Col N="300" /> Galway and Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council will have to bear a heavier burden.  Galway County Council has always been progressive in this matter.  We gave up to £5,500 last year.  We will be penalised.  I am not going to say we will not get any of them, but there is a possibility that special classes will be set up in the cities and big towns geared to prepare people in these four subjects, whereas the small secondary schools like we have in Mountbellew and Castleblakeney may not have the same chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out we will have to pay more in Galway than other counties which have always paid less.  I have sent in a Question which has not yet appeared on the Order Paper but will, I understand, tomorrow. If I had the information I am seeking in that I would know more about what the other counties are paying. But I do know from private enquiries that proportionately we are paying more in Galway and we are going to be frozen at that sum.  That is not right.  It should be done on a valuation or some other basis rather than saying that those who were generous last year will have to pay that for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>Those are the two big criticisms I have&mdash;one about freezing the contribution at the same figure as last year and the other that there is no incentive for the brilliant child of a certain means.  That was in the old scholarship scheme we were operating since Deputy Dr. Hillery, now Minister for Labour, introduced the extra grant from the Government to supplement the rates.  Otherwise, I am satisfied with the scheme.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in and I hope he will improve it along the lines I am suggesting before it becomes law.</P>

Thanks be to God, we know the truth is otherwise.  There are many people in this House and others holding high positions throughout the country who would not be there but for the Christian Brothers and others like them who did it long before the presumption, arrogance and theft of the Fianna Fáil Government tried to mislead the people into believing they were doing something for education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that this is a most destructive scheme, destructive of some of the best elements which should be encouraged in education.  It is destructive of initiative, destructive of planning, destructive of concentration. It is a discouragement to those who have made a substantial effort, as many have over the last two years, to get scholarships in the forthcoming examinations.  It is extremely difficult to be patient with a Minister and a Government which, within weeks of the leaving certificate examinations, radically changes the whole basis of the scholarship scheme and deliberately sets back many young boys and girls who have been concentrating on particular subjects for the last two years and putting in tremendous effort in the study of those subjects in order to acquire for themselves scholarships which would give them a university education.  Many of these pupils will now be ruled out entirely because of <Col N="302" /> this scheme, which is to be paid for by local authorities, but local authorities are to have no say in its application.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt said quite rightly that in Galway 25 per cent of the scholarships were allotted to people irrespective of means.  A similar scheme has been in operation in Dublin financed by money contributed by the Dublin ratepayers.  That contribution is made without regard to the ability of the ratepayers to pay it.  It is contributed in many cases by ratepayers who find it a next-to-impossible burden to bear. That opportunity which people had to get some recognition for their endeavours and for their interest in Irish education is being entirely sabotaged by the Minister's scheme.  To that extent we believe it is deplorable.</P>
      <P>The Minister's scheme puts the smaller section of our community against the majority.  The majority of our people are now wage and salary earners.  They are people whose wages and salaries are easily ascertainable and cannot be watered down in any way. No expenses can be set off against their earnings so as to produce a net figure which might qualify for the scholarships which the Government are now pretending they are giving for the first time.  The situation is that people of independent means&mdash;professional men, farmers and shopkeepers; people who are not in receipt of a specific amount by way of salaries or wages&mdash;can adjust their books so as to bring them within the scope of this privileged scholarship scheme.  We think that that is grossly unfair and is hitting in particular the people of Dublin, who will be contributing the greatest amount to this scheme and who under the rules and regulations applied by the Minister are going to be deprived of opportunities which will be available to other people. In the name of the people of Dublin, I protest vehemently against this grossly unfair scheme which does a serious injustice to the boys and girls in Dublin schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the matter, as ascertained by me within the last couple of days, is that dozens of boys and girls in Dublin schools who are eligible to receive scholarships under the existing corporation schemes will not now get scholarships, no matter how brilliantly <Col N="303" /> they do in their examinations in a couple of months time, because if their parents happen to have an income which sets them outside the limits fixed by the Minister, they will not receive any reward for their efforts.  That is not a scheme which is likely to encourage students in the future to work for scholarships.  It is not likely to encourage the schools to organise their programmes and the students to discipline themselves in order to benefit by scholarship schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government knew for the past 12 months that this situation was likely to arise unless they took steps long ago to dispel the doubts which began to exist when local authorities saw that the Government were procrastinating.  The truth of the matter is that most local authorities on their own initiative decided, when it was no longer necessary to have post-primary scholarships, to allocate the money previously used for that purpose to university scholarships.  The local authorities who did that received encouragement from the Minister to do it.  They prepared their own schemes for the application of that money in a manner similar to that in which they operated their earlier scholarship schemes.  That was the situation in Dublin and, as far back as last October, the Department received from Dublin Corporation the plans which they had for the allocation of their scolarships in the June examinations of 1968.  In anticipation of receiving approval from the Government, the details of the scheme were leaked to the public press so that people would be put on reasonable notice of what would be available to them.</P>
    <P>Although it was common knowledge that that was the situation, and although the intentions of the corporation were well known, there was no reason why anyone should doubt that this would be the scheme which would operate this year until the Minister's outrageous and grossly unfair proposals were published last Saturday.  If ever students got a kick in the stomach, and if ever schools got a kick in the posterior, they received it from the Minister for Education in a hurry last <Col N="304" /> Saturday when this severe blow was given to the whole educational world in Dublin in particular, and all over the country in general.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that in the schools, and particularly those who dedicated themselves to giving secondary education to the less privileged section of the community, two years ago the students were geared to take particular subjects and concentrate their efforts on learning those subjects and on acquiring certain skills with a view to obtaining scholarships.  The Minister may say this is not good education.  It may well be said that the best education is not the one which is governed by scholarships and I do not think any good educationist would disagree with that, but the Minister's scheme is geared to putting that machinery into statutory form.  The whole idea will now be geared to the student attaining honours in four subjects. This will certainly aggravate the problem of our whole educational curriculum rather than broadening it in the way in which we should like to see it broadened in this modern age in which we live.</P>
    <P>It may be that until such time as university education is freely available to people irrespective of their examination technique, there is no reasonable alternative available, but we should all remember at a time like this that if we are to relate assistance for university education to those who display skill in examination technique, we may not, in fact, be giving assistance to the people who could be the best doctors, the best engineers, the best scientists and the best professional people in the future.  Any person who had the unique advantage of being one of the small privileged minority who were at a university in this country in the past will know that it is not uncommon for students who were not particularly brilliant in the primary and secondary schools to blossom forth for the first time on entering the university campus.  That is quite a frequent phenomenon, and no less frequent is the experience of the student who appeared to be clever and brilliant, the student who was successful in the primary and secondary <Col N="305" /> examinations, and who failed miserably in university tests.  Certainly if he did not fail miserably, he was less than brilliant.  We are now to apply the test of one examination in four subjects. That alone is to determine who is and who is not to go to a university. I should not really say that alone will determine it.  It will also be determined by income the child's parents may or may not have.</P>
    <P>We believe that the local authorities should be allowed to exercise their discretion.  All the local authorities I am aware of, and Dublin Corporation in particular, have exercised their discretion in the past in relation to scholarships in an exceedingly fair and acceptable manner.  I have never heard any criticism offered by the people of Dublin about the Dublin Corporation scholarship schemes.  They are the result of an exchange of views between the 45 elected members of the City Council in Dublin who come from all walks of life.  They have had various educational experiences.  Indeed, many of the members of Dublin City Council were not reared or educated in Dublin, but they contribute to Dublin life, and to Dublin public life in particular, quite an amount which is of value.  These people pooled their wisdom in the past and produced fair scholarship schemes.  Naturally, they now resent that it is proposed to take from them the money they levied on the rates and put it in a pool without their having any control over the manner in which it is to be used outside the pool.  We think that is wrong. We think it is a negation of the very things which education should try to develop, a spirit of endeavour and a spirit of interest in matters educational.</P>
    <P>We think it highly deplorable that the Minister and the Government are apparently incapable of devising an educational scheme tailored to our requirements and suited to our needs. Apparently they are incapable of accepting that the Irish people can devise schemes to suit their own needs so they ape the schemes in operation in England, America and the Continent. That is very bad planning.  That <Col N="306" /> is shallow thinking.  This scheme is doing a disservice where it could have done good.  The fact that more money will be available for university education is not due to any generosity on the part of the Government.  Rather is it due to the continuing activity of the Government in taking from the local authorities moneys they had in the past and which they would be only too glad to give again in the future.  I appeal to the Minister to look again at this matter and, certainly as far as 1968 is concerned, to provide that the schemes devised by the local authorities in the summer and autumn of 1967 will be applicable to the 1968 examinations. Common justice demands no less than that and it will not in any way jeopardise the future operations of the Ministerial schemes.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is convinced his scheme is the perfect scheme, he is quite entitled to ask the Dáil and the Seanad to accept it.  Even if it is the perfect scheme, I say the Minister is doing injustice to the boys and girls who have worked for the past two years in the belief that the accepted principles would be applied to the 1968 examinations and that those people now deserve something better of the Minister than to be told, a few weeks before the examination, that they wasted their time and might as well have been out enjoying themselves, for all the benefit they will get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to offer a friendly word of advice to the Minister on his taking up of this massive job.  I suggest he operate less by way of Press conference in the task before him and that he realise that we must now get down to the solid work of consolidation. Unless we understand that Irish education, as we know it at present, despite any improvements that may have been made of late, is still run on rigid class lines and that the higher reaches of our educational system are reserved for students from the managerial or high income groups, we do not understand the nature of the animal that is Irish education.  If we are to achieve change and alter what is still, in effect, the &ldquo;murder machine&rdquo;<Col N="307" /> that Pearse called it, we must understand the nature of the system we talk about, the educational system that we have.</P>
      <P>The classrooms of our country at the present time reflect the snobberies of the economic conflicts in the outside world in regard both to the type of pupil they admit to the higher reaches of education and the manner of their selection.  I do not think Members of any Party in this House can be content with a situation in which the majority of the nation's children are consigned to live their lives in that kind of subculture and intellectual twilight in which so many of our adults are condemned to live.  It is a situation we must change.  It cannot be done too easily if only for the reason that Irish education, for many years, has not been touched, that no innovation has taken place and no progress has been recorded until recently with the welcome change inaugurated by the late Minister for Education, Deputy Donogh O'Malley, in secondary education. I would say we now have the job of going further.  Above all, we must not believe that, suddenly, the educational system has been changed by the improvements that have taken place.  It would be to misunderstand the size of the problem before us if we consider that either this measure or the improvement as regards secondary education has drastically altered the class nature of Irish education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are shocked by examples of racial antagonism in the outside world. The press is full of accounts of them. We must understand that there is also in this country a discrimination which takes a child, from the type of education it gets, into the type of job it gets which, in turn, reflects the education it received.  Children with a certain educational background are condemned to a certain minimum wage all their entire adult life because of the kind of education they receive.  If this is not discrimination, I do not know what it is. If we are shocked by discrimination elsewhere, let us understand that we practice deliberate discrimination in respect of the majority of the children of our country because their parents <Col N="308" /> come from a particular social background. If anybody thinks that this is mere propaganda, understandably coming from a Party which represents those who have been subjected to lack of suitable education, I would refer the House to the Lynch Education Report which talks about Irish education in the light of social groups and social backgrounds and which points the lesson of the low rate of participation of children of unskilled workers, and semi-skilled workers, unemployed people, widows, and so on, in post-primary and higher education.</P>
    <P>Not to go too far back, let us remember that, before we go to the top of the iceberg which is university education in Ireland, we must find the drop-out rate according to social groups in other areas of our educational system.  To think that we have changed anything dramatically because we hand out another few scholarships to those survivors of our educational system who are lucky enough to reach the university gates is to ignore the size of our problem.  This casualty rate in our educational system is based fundamentally on the economic background of the parents of the children and occurs at the stage when the child has completed primary school and has reached the secondary school level.  As many children do not go forward after the age of 14, never to be heard of again in our educational system, as go forward to the other spheres of our post-primary and higher education together.</P>
    <P>Last year one political Party suddenly discovered that it is mentioned in the 1916 Proclamation that all of the children of the nation must be cherished equally.  Last year, the year it was emblazoned on the billboards of the country that all of the children of the nation must be cherished equally, we provided 245 scholarships in the entire country.  The Minister is stretching the credulity of this House if he asserts that substantial progress can now be made in educational matters because 900 scholarships will be provided.  Let us not mistake that this is a very modest step along the very arduous road we have to tread if we are serious about changing the nature of Irish education which, substantially, <Col N="309" /> has changed little from the thing that Pearse called the &ldquo;murder machine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We must tackle in depth the matter of the participation rate of pupils in our educational system.  The Minister and the Department said we may calculate, from those who did the leaving certificate examination, that, last year, only 1,900 received four honours and, therefore, this scheme envisages 900 pupils participating in it.  We make a big mistake if we think that figures for students who managed to survive to the university gates, because of the position of their parents, the kind of secondary school they attend, and so on, is an adequate gauge of the entire country's need for higher education.</P>
    <P>In beginning, in order to appreciate what greater participation by social grouping means, it seems to me there is a far greater figure than the thinking behind that 900 envisages.</P>

      <P>On the amount of cash before us at the moment, it would be quite embarrassing if we had more than the figure envisaged by the Minister. It will take far more revolutionary changes than the puny things we have done so far to alter the nature of our educational system.  For example, there is free secondary education.  The people we are talking about who will participate in the scholarship scheme are the products of the secondary schools.  We have repeatedly made the point that the fee portion of secondary education is only one of the costs involved in the matter of greater participation in secondary education, an important matter but only one.  I was speaking to a man last week who spent something like £30 in the current year on textbooks for a child at secondary school. Under the scheme for help in the provision for such books he would, at the discretion of the local school principal, have to prove that his family had only £X if he were to cover the cost of this number of textbooks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that we have repeatedly pointed out and the drop-out ratio is large enough to suggest that it is valid in all walks of education. This is the problem of doing without the earning power of the children.  This <Col N="310" /> is a big problem in relation to the continuing of children in our educational system.  As educationists in other countries have recognised, the social background gives certain children advantages over other children whose parents possibly have not themselves received higher education. We must agree that an intellectual plimsoll line is necessary if our university education system is to operate in this manner.  There must not be one law of intelligence for the rich person's child and another for the person who must participate in a scholarship scheme.  We should have a uniform intellectual attainment level for all students in our universities.</P>
    <P>At his press conference a week ago the Minister said that we could consign the scholarship idea to the scrap-heap, that it was no longer considered necessary. The thinking and the cash provided in this Bill do not even seem, in its most generous terms, truly to reflect the costs involved if one is to depend solely on the scholarship.  It does not seem to reflect the costs involved for the student on the average university course in this country.  It seems we have the paradox in scholarships at present that one must practically belong to a certain income group in order to be able to participate in the scholarships available.  These scholarships, if the student were lucky enough to survive to that level in our educational system, are not sufficient really to enable a child of a general worker or a semi-skilled worker to do a full university course.  In other words, the cash involved in the scholarships at present amounts practically only to pin money in the case of families in certain circumstances.  They must themselves have sufficient cash to be able to augment the scholarships available from local authorities.  The cash grants given in this scholarship scheme do not seem to be realistic for children coming from homes such as I have described.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister who referred to the extension of the scheme to places other than recognised universities, to technological colleges and so on&mdash;a widening of the scheme, therefore, to certain institutions&mdash;if this includes physical training colleges.  This <Col N="311" /> is a pretty important point.  Evidently, we do not accept the importance of physical training in our educational system nor do we give any proper status to our physical training colleges. My point is that if these scholarships are available to technological colleges and higher technical institutes they should also be available to higher institutions specialising in physical education.</P>
    <P>In answer to a question of mine some time ago the Minister said there were only 45 qualified teachers of physical training in this part of the country.  Is it any wonder that we have a teenage population that must have the lowest standard of physical training of any country in the world?  We are supposed to be a sport-loving people, but I do not know any country, in Europe certainly, which is so careless of giving its youth physical training.  This stems from the fact that we give no status to teachers qualified in physical training.  The position is far different in the other part of this country and it is quite apparent to anybody who has been through any Northern Ireland school that the general physique of the students there is far superior to that of our students.  It is about time that we tackled this problem seriously because there is a problem there to be tackled. If the Minister is widening the scope of the Bill to include the technological colleges he should also include the Ling College and Sion Hill which, in Dublin, I understand, deal with physical training.</P>
    <P>There is another problem to which the Minister might shortly address himself in connection with university scholarships.  The Taoiseach recently said that it was important to relate the universities to the communities around them and to relate the training in the universities to the needs of the country.  The first year arts classes in the universities bulge with students who do not know exactly what they will work at in after life. This, in itself, speaks of the lack of vocational guidance.  I suggest that if the State is going to be increasingly involved in greater cash commitments <Col N="312" /> in our universities the State must make an inventory of what professions and skills are most necessary for this nation.  If more money is to be spent on educating students who will then go to the developed countries and this expenditure comes from the taxpayers there is a question to be examined. The usual excuse may be made that it is part of our free gift to the world, that we train people and send them abroad and that we must maintain our reputation of being the foremost exporter of men and women in Europe in the professional field also. I suggest that we should look at the situation in which we are producing professional people that the Irish taxpayers have paid to educate and exporting them to fully developed countries.</P>
    <P>We must question the wisdom of this course.  If the universities are to be subsidised and helped by the State the State is entitled to ask the universities to give us more men and women qualified in the professions that are needed to build up our economy.  Those who are educated in excess of our needs by means of the taxpayers money, it should be understood, are our conscious contribution to the under-developed countries and we should not be producing qualified people for the capitals of the different countries of Europe, the US or Britain.</P>
    <P>I began in a friendly fashion by advising the Minister to avoid this feeling that there should be a loud hurrah for higher education.  Anything we have done yet does not provide a basis for any self-congratulation, and our educational system is still substantially a Victorian edifice largely untouched by the passing of years, and the fact that we have begun to wake up recently is no reason to think that the whole system has been utterly changed.  The universities at the top are the icebergs and we must reach down into every area.</P>
    <P>We must understand and tackle the problem as to why we have drop-outs at primary school level, why the children of this country are split into two sections, one section going to dead-end jobs, low-paid work with no future and all the frustration involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Even if we were not committed to end this state of affairs by our ordinary democratic feelings, we should realise that it is not good economically, that there is a close connection between the kind of education undergone by the majority of the people in a country and the rate of development of the economy.  If the majority of our people undergo an inferior education or at least one that gives them no more than a passing acquaintance with education, we cannot expect to build a secure economy.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the drop-out from our secondary school system and the fact that only a very lucky few reach university. We must also tackle the question of the drop-out from our vocational schools, involving half the students in the system.  Again, I would suggest that, while it is a generalisation, there is a great deal of truth in this; that the economic facts of life, the position in the home, the earning power of the parents, is the clue to the massive drop-out in Irish education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the matter, at university level, of up-grading social science as a subject.  Seeing that we are assisting people through scholarships, it is only just that the State should declare a priority of subjects in accordance with the needs of our economy.  We must end this free trade in education under which one is entitled to do any course one feels like. The needs of the community must be met.  We do not know what talent and brain power we are losing under the present wasteful educational system. The few people who finally come to university do not represent the genius <Col N="314" /> or the talent of Irish people.  They represent the uppercrust of the Irish people, and not the true talent or genius.  It should, therefore, be our aim, even in the interests of our economy, putting it at as low a level as that, to see that there is greater participation in our whole educational system, irrespective of the background of the student.</P>
      <P>This problem will call for investigation of the home background, because it has been discovered in other countries that pounds, shillings and pence, while a major part of the problem, will not solve it completely.  However, we must appreciate the fact that the child coming from the secure middle-class home has a far greater advantage than the child coming from the workingclass home.  I ask anybody to consider the situation of the brilliant child in the city of Dublin, the child who is an Einstein, in embryo at least, who belongs to a family living five in one room.  How is he supposed to study?</P>

      <P>It is a very serious question.  How is that child going to study, and what incentives are there in that child's background to encourage him to struggle through our educational system and overcome all the class prejudice and snobbery in his way?  We have already seen some of these obstacles in secondary education, because we already see there the gates of privilege closing up again.  We see sprouting up all over the country new schools devoted to the principle of being outside the free secondary education system.</P>
      <P>Irish education is in great need of a genuine crusade, one that will not end this year or next year but will be a continuing process over the next ten years; one that will push back vested interests, which must be done before we can say there has been any real progress in Irish education.  Above all, it is one that will call for courage in this House and in this Government and succeeding ones.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to philosophise on our educational system a task that was carried out in depth, to quote himself, by the philosopher from the Labour Party, Deputy O'Leary.  I shall confine myself to the Bill that has been presented here by the Minister for Education.  I have for most of my life been engaged in teaching.  I have served for over 20 years and I am still serving on educational committees at vocational school level and at university level.  I am a member of the Governing Body of University College, Galway, and of the committee on county council scholarships in my own county.  I hope what I intend to say will be relevant to the Bill before us and that the criticisms I offer will be practical and will have a bearing on the subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has laid down as a condition for securing one of these university grants the gaining of four honours at the leaving certificate examination.  It is well known that if a student so likes, he can pick four subjects in which it is not so difficult to get honours in the leaving certificate. The marks allowed for these subjects <Col N="316" /> by the Department would tend to show that educationally some subjects are regarded more highly than others.  For example, if you present honours maths in the leaving certificate, you have a maximum of 600 marks to play around with.  The same applies to honours Irish.  If you take subjects like English, chemistry, biology and so on, the maximum in these cases is 400.  As regards history and geography&mdash;I speak from memory and I may be wrong&mdash; the marks used to be 300 for history and 300 for geography.  There may be some variations in these marks now.</P>
    <P>When we in Galway, in consultation with the Department, were devising a university scholarship scheme, we had a more realistic approach to this problem than the four honours requirement. We had a notional maximum of 2,000 scholarship marks and students were allowed to present subjects and had to take the honours paper in the subjects up to this 2,000.  You might take four or five subjects, or shall I say, five and a half subjects.  I should explain this.  If you took Irish, you had 600 marks and if you took mathematics, you had 600 marks.  That was 1,200.  History and geography would bring this up to 1,800.  Now you had to make up the 200 for the notional maximum so you might only be credited with 50 per cent of the marks you obtained in the other subjects, whatever they might be.  I suggest that the four honours of themselves are not a fair criterion to work on.  I assume, of course, that you have to get your leaving certificate and that presupposes passing Irish, English and mathematics, if you have taken them, but you can pick four subjects which are regarded as easy subjects.  I will not say what they are&mdash;everybody knows what they are&mdash;and so get such high marks that you could be in the running for one of these grants.  I am just putting that forward as a minor criticism.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kitt that counties like Galway which strike rates from time to time which for us are fairly substantial, in order to defray the expenses of our scholarship schemes will be at a disadvantage <Col N="317" /> compared with counties which do not put forward big sums for scholarship schemes.  Now the whole country will be in the one pool, so to speak.  We in County Galway will have no say in the allocation of scholarships.  Heretofore we made it a condition of our scholarship scheme that the parents or parents of the student had to be residing in the county for at least a year or two.  That was our residential qualification.  The money which we would have provided, £5,000 or £6,000, has been frozen and theoretically it is now possible for a student from, say, Westmeath to collar a scholarship we would have earmarked for the son or daughter of a Galway resident.</P>
    <P>Having the country in one pool might lead to the creation of specialised classes in large urban areas.  You could have a big attendance at a secondary school and the cream of the scholarship class, or the grant class, as it is now called, could be syphoned into another class where they would concentrate on four or five subjects. Cramming could become the order of the day.  It has not been unknown for this to happen in the national schools in the past before free post-primary education came into being.  I am afraid this may happen.  We in Galway in our own way, when we were designing secondary scholarships, made it a condition that a certain number of scholarships were reserved for the two-teacher schools in which the pool of students was very small, and a certain proportion was reserved for the bigger schools of up to seven, eight or nine teacher schools.  In that way we made it possible to programme out the allocation of these scholarships, so as to benefit children who were placed at a disadvantage in having only one or two teachers to cater for them.  This might happen in Dublin, Cork or Galway, and you might have classes being crammed and teachers serving for the purpose of securing these university grants for their pupils, to the disadvantage of children who are not so well placed schoolwise.</P>
    <P>I do not see in the Bill any reference <Col N="318" /> to conditions which must be fulfilled in regard to the renewing of these scholarships.  If you secure a scholarship, or a grant, as it is now called, in the first year, and we will suppose you are doing commerce in the university, in what conditions will that grant be renewed for a further year?  In my part of the country, you had to produce a certificate of satisfactory attendance from your professor or professors, or the president of your university college, and of course you had to pass your examinations.  I do not see in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum any conditions laid down for the renewal of these grants.  Does it mean that if a student gets the grant in the first instance, it is automatically renewed for a period of years?  For how many years will it be renewed?  In Galway normally, we used to give scholarships for three or four years, but in the case of special students who were taking long courses, such as those for medicine or dentistry, the council saw fit to renew them to help out the students. I should like to see something about these conditions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The sum of £300 has been mentioned for students who are living a fair distance from the university and £175 is the maximum for those living adjacent to the university.  I hope no one has the idea that the State will pay only £300 or £175, as the case may be.  In the university I know best, the State is subsidising each student to the tune of £200 by way of capitation grant, non-recurring grant and so on.  It is only right that people's minds should be disabused of the erroneous idea that the cost to the State will be £300 or £175.  It will be much more than that.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there should be some scheme of bursaries or exhibitions based on merit, and merit alone, irrespective of means. In the old Intermediate, the Department of Education used to award first-class and second-class scholarships. A priority list was determined based on results.  In all, I think there were 72 scholarships and there was no regard paid to the means of the parents. Regard was had only to the excellence of the student.  Such a scheme might <Col N="319" /> meet the objections raised by Deputy Kitt and Deputy Ryan.</P>
    <P>Another matter that arises is the position of the present holders of university scholarships granted by the different local authorities.  There is a difference of £25 or £30 between the scholarships they hold and the grants proposed under this Bill.  I should like this difference to be made good by the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise the question now of financial aid for students who wish to go to university and whose parents, or some responsible person, will guarantee the repayment of such financial aid.  During the past week, I met a young man who had returned from Britain, having saved a certain amount of money.  He told me it was his life's ambition to become a secondary teacher.  He thought he had enough to put him through university. He is 24 or 25 years of age.  He would like, however, to get a guarantee of some kind of help from the State to enable him to complete his course. Otherwise he may have to interrupt his studies, go back to Britain to earn more money, and come back again here to finish his course.  Assistance of the type I mentioned would be invaluable to him, or to any young man or woman in that position.  He gave up a farily good job in Britain in order to achieve his life's ambition.</P>
    <P>Another point of interest is the provision of free transport for university students.  In my town a certain number of children travel every day to Galway University, a distance of some 23 miles. Their parents would like an extension of free transport.  I think it would be an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will give attention to the points raised by those who have served on scholarship committees.  I hope he will be able to resolve the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to compliment those Opposition Deputies who approached the Bill in such a constructive way. One Deputy resorted to destructive criticism.  Listening to him, one would imagine we were going to put the <Col N="320" /> children into jail instead of trying to improve their lot in life.  Our great ambition is to give our children a good education and I hope I will live long enough to see that ambition realised.</P>
      <P>The scheme for post-primary education was well received.  The only way in which we can improve the lot of all our people is by education.  I deplore references to class distinction.  Only those with inferiority complexes would indulge in such references.  I suppose they cannot help their complexes.  We have people today at the top of the educational ladder from all walks of life.  That is due in large measure to their parents.  Parents who have the right outlook send their children to good schools.  That is the pattern all over the country.  That is one of the notable advances in our time.  Our economy is a Christian economy and we try, as far as possible, to spend money to improve the position of the citizens of the State as a whole.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a wonderful advance.  I compliment the present Minister, his predecessor, the late Donogh O'Malley, and his predecessors, and the officials of the Department of Education, on the work they have done.  This year we will send 900 leaving certificate students to university. That is a big advance.  The Minister has assured me that in the case of persons above the £1,200 ceiling, he will bring in a scheme.  That category were provided for in the city and county of Dublin.  Other Deputies have referred to similar schemes in operation in Galway and other places.  I am very grateful to the Minister for meeting our request.  It is great encouragement for a child to be able to go to the university on a scholarship attained by his own merit.  That provision should be continued even if only a certain number of scholarships were provided for that category.  I shall not suggest to the Minister the number of scholarships that should be provided but I do urge that scholarships should be continued for this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as being an intelligent step forward.  I hope the state of the economy will allow a great deal more to be provided for higher education next year.  During the past <Col N="321" /> few years, wonderful advances have been made.  I hope that God will bless the economy and that progress will continue.  Those who have engaged in destructive criticism are hardly worth mentioning.  I wish good luck to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.  It is a clear indication of the firm commitment of the Government to cherish all of our children equally.  In the case of university education, we are going as far as is financially possible in this year, but the big breakthrough has come and must be welcomed throughout the country. This scheme, we hope, will be expanded. We know that great use will be made of it and that very many children who are deprived of higher education at the moment through lack of means will be able to attend university.</P>
      <P>There are a few questions I should like to ask the Minister which he may reply to when he is concluding.  First, I should like to ask about the qualification for these grants.  There is the question of four honours in the leaving certificate examination.  We all know that in the leaving certificate examination different subjects carry different marks.  The Minister says that any student who gets four honours will qualify.  I am wondering if the Minister means that all subjects will be regarded as of equal standing.  Has he given this matter any further thought? I am thinking now of a subject such as drawing.  Honours in drawing cannot be compared with honours in mathematics.  Perhaps that is a sufficient comparison to illustrate the point I wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point on which I should like clarification is in connection with a student who studies privately for the leaving certificate examination.  A student may have left the secondary school last year in his fifth year.  Now, when he sees this grants scheme being introduced, if he studies privately and undergoes the leaving certificate examination and gets sufficient marks, will he qualify?  Such a student will get only a statement of his marks, not the certificate.  The certificate will not <Col N="322" /> be officially presented to him by the Department.  Will such student qualify for the grant on attaining four honours in the examination even though he may not receive the certificate to qualify for which a student must complete two years in a secondary school after the intermediate examination?</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that, when the scheme is introduced, at the start of the next academic year, those students who qualify for the grants should have it made quite clear to them before entering the university that they have, in fact, qualified.  I make that point because there has been a certain amount of confusion about a scheme announced last year for pupils on islands off the coast.  Because of the fact that secondary education was not available to them on these islands, the then Minister for Education, the late Deputy O'Malley, introduced a scheme whereby these pupils could attend boarding schools whose fees did not exceed £120 a year.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, none of the island children attending boarding schools under that scheme has had his or her fees paid in the boarding school.  There is some confusion about the matter. Therefore, I would hope that when the scheme now being introduced is in operation, it will be quite clear from the start as to who has qualified and who has not and to whom payment will be made and how it will be made.  A great deal of worry has been caused to parents and to the schools concerned as a result of the fees for island children not having been paid.  They do not know whether or not the full fees will be paid.  Perhaps the Minister wil clarify that matter when he is replying to the debate?  I approve of this step forward in the provision of university education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill which is the first of its kind and which represents a big breakthrough.  As in the case of all &ldquo;firsts&rdquo;, it will have teething troubles. We envisage quite a few, at any rate for this year.  The Minister has used the word &ldquo;flexible&rdquo;.  A great deal of flexibility will be required in the first <Col N="323" /> year of operation.  The main point that I want clarified is as to the manner of operation this year.  We are now in the middle of the school year.  The terms of the scheme have just been published. In Sligo, there was a scheme in operation whereby university scholarships were given on the basis of the best three honours papers.  Naturally, students anxious to obtain university scholarships concentrated on three subjects which carried the highest marks&mdash; mathematics, Irish and English.  I think I am correct in saying that pupils taking the leaving certificate examination this year have already nominated the honours subjects which they will take.  I know at least three pupils in Sligo who have selected only three honours subjects and have notified the Department to that effect.  They will be ineligible for scholarships this year under the new scheme.  Such snags are bound to arise.  I should like the Minister to exercise the flexibility he has mentioned.</P>
      <P>In my view, it would have been a better idea to have allowed local authorities to continue this year as previously and to have increased the number of scholarships and the amounts of them within the framework of the money carried forward as a result of the abolition of post-primary scholarships and to have started the new scheme next year.  That would have been a great deal easier on the Minister.  There are many pupils in Sligo who have nominated three honours subjects under the scheme which I have already explained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one other point about special cases.  Deputy <Col N="324" /> Carty mentioned a case of which he has knowledge.  I have in mind a similar case.  I know of a brilliant young boy who got an honours degree in Galway University.  He is anxious to study languages.  At the moment he is in Germany studying German.  He is paying his way by teaching English. He is anxious to come home and do a master's degree.  He comes from a poor family who would not be able to afford the cost.  Special cases like this should get some consideration.  In spite of the fact that only a limited number of children will benefit at the moment and we do not appear to be cherishing all our children equally, nevertheless I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for what was on the whole, apart from, I might say, Deputy Ryan's contribution, a very constructive debate.  Deputy Lindsay, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, and Deputy Mrs. Desmond and Deputy O'Leary on behalf of the Labour Party, and other Deputies made a number of constructive remarks on what is after all a matter which should be outside the partisanship that sometimes characterises our debates here.  Education is too important a matter to be made the subject of partisan debate. For that reason I am very grateful for the constructive suggestions made not alone on the Bill but with regard to education generally and what we need to do to improve Irish education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill marks a new breakthrough in education, although I am not going to say it is the be-all and end-all of higher education grants.  However, it is the first step we have taken in this direction since the formation of the State and is a logical follow-on to the introduction of the free post-primary education scheme.  It was imperative, once we had taken that step, to ensure that the children who participated in free post-primary education and were brilliant enough to achieve the standard we will set out by order under the Bill would have an opportunity to go to university if their parents were not so well circumstanced as to afford to send them to higher education.  In practical terms, <Col N="325" /> this is in effort to give reality to the social principle of equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is, as I say, a substantial step; but we have made the Bill flexible so that we can improve it as the years go on.  Such matters as the standard set down, four honours, and the means categories set out in the schedule to the explanatory memorandum will be the subject matter of ministerial orders which can be varied from year to year, can be expanded and amended to suit the particular requirements of the pupils and the educational needs of the particular day.  I want to stress the importance of this, because, within the flexible framework of this Bill, we can expand the opportunities and improve the categories to whom they will be open.  We can adjust the means levels and thereby keep pace with changing values in regard to money and salaries and wages and also keep pace with the requirements of the future.  I want to emphasise that this is the first substantial step.  It is a breakthrough, but it is only the beginning. As far as the resources of the country allow and as far as we see the educational requirements in the future, we can amend and adjust both the means test and the standard requirements.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that this is a very substantial step forward and marks a breakthrough when one considers the figure of 275 pupils in the current year who secured scholarships last year.  We are jumping that figure from 275 to somewhere between 900 and 1,000 boys and girls who will now participate in this scheme.  This is a substantial improvement in one year.</P>
    <P>The grants will now be given to every student in the country.  The standard to be applied is not the particular county in which the child lives: the only standard is the standard of achieving four honours and the requirement of being within a particular means category with regard to income.  This will apply to all the children of the nation equally.  Those people who spoke about some counties being progressive should remember that mere residence in a county is not <Col N="326" /> the criterion that should be applied to a basic social need such as the education of a child whose talents are fully fitted to further education.  It has been a fundamental weakness of the scholarship system heretofore that it has been administered by local authorities and that local authorities had to make a contribution from the rates to it.  As a result, the poorer counties did not have as many scholarships as the richer.  Deputy Gilhawley's county of Sligo had only four scholarships, while places such as Dublin and Galway had many more.  In counties such as Sligo and Leitrim the local authorities, due to the pressure of rates on small holders and small business people, could not face the prospect of raising the rates to provide for sufficient scholarships.  That very fact meant that some of our children, because of the county in which they were born, were more privileged than others.</P>
    <P>We will do away with that county caste system in regard to higher education in the future.  We are setting out here, irrespective of the capacity of the county to contribute towards a child's higher education, that every child, no matter where he lives, will come in under the criteria which will be set out by way of order under the Bill. This is a substantial step forward.  For that reason alone, we can call the Bill a substantial breakthrough in regard to higher education.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made in the course of the debate.  Deputy Lindsay was concerned with a point in regard to marks.  I think it was also mentioned by Deputy Molloy that some subjects are more important than others.  I want to assure the House&mdash; it will be written into the order I will make in regard to the qualification standard&mdash;that the four honours requirement will be related to four university subjects, important subjects in any department or faculty of a university. Drawing, for instance, is not a university subject and therefore will not come into this category.  The whole purpose of student grants is to equip the child for higher education and logically the only subjects that should count as regards the standard should <Col N="327" /> be subjects to which the child will be devoting himself or herself in the university.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that our standard of four honours was in some way too severe.  Yet if we examine the whole structure of higher education not only in Ireland but throughout the world, we find that it is not at all severe.  Already the universities have decided to limit the fee-paying students to two honours at least.  Indeed, the Provost of Trinity College said he was thinking of raising that figure to three honours in the leaving certificate as a requirement to getting into Trinity College.  The university authorities not only here but in Britain and throughout the world are moving towards more stringent qualifications of entry for fee-paying students.  Is it not reasonable that in regard to a free grant scheme we should propose four honours when the university authorities are thinking in terms of three honours for fee-paying students?</P>
    <P>Again, this is wise thinking, because, as was mentioned during the debate, of the amount of wasted resources from the point of view of the universities and from the national point of view in the matter of educating children who are unsuitable for the courses they are pursuing and who drop out after one or two years.  They are not suited to what they are doing and yet they get in easily.  If we had stringent standards, these children would not get into the universities and they would probably get into some other stream of employment more suited to their needs.  So the whole thinking is to make qualification for entry into higher education as stringent as possible so as to ensure that children who are equipped for it will go into it.</P>
    <P>There is always the difficulty of the late developer.  That is not a matter we can budget for.  We cannot budget for everything.  We have to do the greatest good for the greatest number. If our universities are to be crowded out by having a low level of entry, to the detriment of people with high standards who are prevented from going to their fullest extent in higher education, is not the obvious thing to <Col N="328" /> do to raise the standard of entry and secure that in most cases the people who are equipped for higher education can go into the faculty they choose?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary raised some very interesting points and indeed I go along with him in much of what he says.  I think he was over-critical of Irish education.  He was over-critical of the drop-out rate which is not quite as serious as he suggested.  Indeed, this is a factor in which there has been a tremendous improvement in recent years.  It might surprise the Deputy and the House to know that over 50 per cent of the 16-year age group are in whole-time education.  That figure is on a par with the figure for every other country in the world from which we could obtain figures.  Again, it is not perfect.  We have a long way to go, but it is not quite as bad as Deputy O'Leary suggested.  I agree that we have not by any means seen the end of the problem in regard to Irish education.</P>
    <P>Education today has become an explosive issue.  Everyone is interested in it.  The class barriers are disappearing. Parents now rightly feel that their boy or girl is entitled to go as far in higher education as their talents will bring them.  The whole idea that higher education was for a particular class and that people did not look outside their class is disappearing.  Every boy and girl now feels that he or she is entitled to a place in the sun.  Every category of society feels that there has been a tremendous improvement in recent years.  I would say that at present in our society education is the most talked of subject and the one in which the greatest interest is shown. That is a good thing because we are coming to the very roots of living when we place a high premium on education.  Equality of opportunity is a basic social impulse.  We are seeking to provide it in our State.  I see emerging from this not only the betterment of the children concerned who wish to make progress, but the betterment of the nation as a whole because if the best talents come to the top, no matter in what class of society, in trade, commerce, industry, the professions, <Col N="329" /> business of all kinds, techniques of all kinds, technological skills of all kinds and so on, society as a whole is the better for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the question of people getting into blind alley occupations to which they were not suited.  I regard that aspect as being very serious.  We have all seen human tragedies arising out of the fact that people were in the wrong jobs.  One's daily work is a very important aspect in one's life.  We have seen the tensions and troubles that are caused by people being in unsuitable jobs, jobs from which they derive no personal satisfaction.  If there is a lack of job satisfaction, tension is created which is reflected in the person's attitude at home and throughout his life.  We want to ensure in so far as possible that we can guide our boys and girls along lines of education which will lead them to jobs for which they are equipped and jobs which will be available.</P>
    <P>At the moment in conjunction with the Minister for Labour and the Department of Labour, we are accumulating data with a view to publishing within the next 18 months a comprehensive document which will set out for the years ahead up to 1998 the jobs that will be available in our community and set out the various streams of education which will lead to the jobs which we will project as being available in 1998.  This will be a detailed analysis and we may have to engage outside consultants.  The projections made may not be perfect but they will be projections within the limitation of the knowledge and data available to us at the moment. Subject to the inevitable limitations of our present knowledge as regards making forecasts, I feel this will be a worthwhile exercise in giving a broad outline of where we are going in regard to education and in regard to manpower requirements for the future, where the jobs will be, what categories of jobs will be available and how the parents can now make mature decisions on how to plan their children's future.</P>
    <P>It is within that context that I will <Col N="330" /> be announcing within the next few days a whole new structure in regard to the leaving certificate which will come into operation from September, 1969.  The idea is that we should have five separate groupings within the leaving certificate, ranging from the academic, on the one hand, to the scientific, on the other.  Within these five different groupings there would be three subjects in each group.  Students coming from the intermediate certificate can specialise in some degree&mdash;not to a total degree because there are evils in over-specialisation&mdash;towards a type of leaving certificate which will enable every boy and girl to go ahead into technological or university higher education.  If we plan out the whole educational system now on the basis of where the job requirements will be and how we should train our children towards the job requirements, looking at education from the primary to the higher education level, I think we will be taking practical steps along the road towards having a community in which talent is used to the fullest extent.  In saying this, I do not want to take from the other object of education which is that of education as an end in itself.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should have education geared to job requirements. At the same time, education is also an end in itself.  I do not want, in any way, to seek to take from the fact that not alone is education an end in securing a job for a person but is also for the purpose of enriching one's personality, of improving one's life and one's appreciation of the quality of life and of developing a capacity to utilise leisure in the best possible way.  I want to emphasise again the totality of education in that primary education, secondary and vocational education and higher level education, both university and technological, all form part of a whole.  This is the thinking behind the new comprehensive approach towards the new kind of secondary education.  We would wish to see the secondary and vocational education streams coming together in a comprehensive stream.  Along with the five groupings we have in the leaving certificate, we have the first streaming at <Col N="331" /> the Intermediate stage between technical and non-technical education.  This is helped by the abolition of the primary certificate, thereby giving a broad education in the primary school which would gradually be streamed between technical and non-technical in the post-primary stages and then on to university level.</P>
    <P>I hope, in the near future, to be in a position to announce the proposals for the total rationalisation of all our higher educational facilities.  I wish to emphasise that the merger discussions between UCD and TCD are, again, just part of this total hope.  We want to rationalise all the higher educational facilities in the country and not alone the place UCD and TCD must get but the place, for instance, Kevin Street Technical Institute and Bolton Street Technical Institute must get, the place Galway University will get, the place Cork University will get and the place the university in Limerick might possibly occupy.  Viewed in that connection, we shall have proposals to announce in the near future on the whole structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that I should like to have this Bill regarded by the House, the context of its being considered as a contribution towards ensuring equality of opportunity in higher education, the context of free post-primary education, the context of our system of primary education and the context of the rationalisation of all higher education.  We should be able to say, shortly, to the Irish people where we are going with regard to Irish education.  We should be able to present the total picture soon.  Once we know the road ahead and once the people appreciate precisely what we are planning in regard to education the question from then on will be one of continual supervision of the over-all system and the allocation of more resources to it.</P>
    <P>One other matter I should like to mention is the question of publicity.  In regard to this scheme which has been set out here in the explanatory memorandum, I propose to publish a booklet inside the next few weeks that will show, in graphic terms, precisely <Col N="332" /> what is meant here in regard to the means test and to the categories of people who will qualify under it.  I propose to circulate this booklet to the principal of every secondary school in the country.  In regard to further education proposals, I think we should do this and we propose to have it done.</P>
    <P>I propose to have any of the innovations to which I have referred in the course of my speech, such as the new structure of the leaving certificate examination, proposals in regard to higher education and the streaming of our students towards job opportunities in the future, circulated to the public in attractive booklet form.  Apart from those of us here who are parents, the people who will make the decisions in regard to Irish education are the parents of the future.  They are the people who will be taking the mature, responsible decisions and they should have the information on which they can base these decisions presented to them in an attractive, readable form so that they can get the message and know precisely where they are going. With this consciousness at the moment of the importance of higher education, it is up to us not alone to pass the legislation to make the finances available but also to inform the people fully of the progress we are planning along the road towards complete equality of opportunity.</P>

      <P>This morning's <i>Irish Press,</i> when describing this Budget &mdash;and one would expect it to describe it in the most attractive possible terms &mdash;described it as a good Budget for rich and for poor.  That is true.  One of my main objections to the Budget is the fact not so much that it is good for the rich and for the poor but that it does nothing for the man who is sandwiched in between these two classes of rich and poor.  These would be the some 800,000 wage-earners who do not pay income tax, to whom Deputy Cosgrave referred here earlier to-day.  These people get nothing.  They face the forthcoming financial year, in a large number of the cities and urban areas, secure in only one fact, and it is a fact which makes them feel they are insecure, that there will be quite a steep increase in their rent, in cases where they are dwellers in corporation, county council or urban council houses.</P>

    <P>The only possible atmosphere of happiness which could be generated in persons of this type by this Budget derives from a sort of promise that, at some future time, there will be an increased selective children's allowance. We, of the Fine Gael Party, welcome that selective children's allowance, but we do not pat the Minister or the Minister's Party on the back in respect of it.  The last increase in children's allowances was in 1963, five years ago.  Since then, the cost of living has increased by 23.9 per cent.  It was 159 points in mid-May, 1963, and in mid-February of this year it was 197 points.  Since 1963, there has been an increase of 23.9 per cent.  We should keep that in mind because on the last occasion when the children's allowances were increased in 1963, there had been an increase in the cost of living between 1957 and 1963 of 15.1 per cent from 115 points to 138 points.  Before that, between 1952 and 1957, the increase was 20 per cent.  Taking the Government's own norm or standard for the time at which an increase should be given in children's allowances, that time does not arrive next year or the year after as the Minister indicated: it has arrived now or, in fact, arrived last year.  It is not fair for the Minister to <Col N="334" /> come along now and try to encourage the voters in the Limerick by-election with a sort of half-promise that they will get an increase in children's allowances, particularly having regard to the melancholy picture this country presents in regard to our existing children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I want to quote a few examples.  In Ireland at present a man with two children has a weekly allowance of 6s. His counterpart in Northern Ireland and Britain has 15s.  A man in a similar situation in the Netherlands has 30s; in Luxembourg, £1 16s; in Italy, £1 10s; in France, £1 16s and in Belgium, £2 5s.  By Irish standards, it is a small family that has only two children and so let us move up to the man who has seven children.  In Ireland, he gets a weekly allowance of £1 16s.  If he were lucky enough to have his children in England, £5; in the Netherlands, £6 16s; in Luxembourg, £7 19s; in France £10 5s and in Belgium, £11 19s.  Why we must lag behind these countries in this regard and continue as a deliberate part of Government policy to lag behind is something I cannot understand and which I feel the country generally finds it hard to understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to this matter has been much too slow, in my opinion, as indeed has been his approach to a problem which is agitating every section of the community at the moment and over the years, the only exception, it appears, to that agitation being the present Government. I refer to the impact of health charges on local rates.  If it were not costing the ratepayers so much it would be laughable to observe the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party are now in a sort of gingerly fashion putting their toe into the pool of Fine Gael policy with a view to rectifying that situation, because, as far back as five years ago, we presented to the country and to the Government a manner of equitably dealing with that difficulty. Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, who is in charge of health for our Party, then produced a system which was subsequently incorporated into our document entitled <i>Towards a Just Society,</i> namely, an insurance scheme under <Col N="335" /> which the employer, the employee and the State would make three equal contributions towards a fund from which the health services would be met.</P>
    <P>Now, as if it had come suddenly out of the heavens down to a Fianna Fáil Cabinet meeting, the Minister comes here and suggests that he might do this at some future date.  This is clothed in the vesture of a brand-new idea of the Government.  They know exactly where this scheme emanated from, and I am happy and pretty sure that the country generally feels the same way, because I assert here that were it not for our consistent advocacy in this Chamber and in local councils throughout the country, the ratepayers would still be left to shoulder the burden of health charges.  I believe that as a result of the continual pressure brought to bear on them by us in Fine Gael, this concession is at last being made to the outraged ratepaying public.  &ldquo;Outraged&rdquo; might sound a bit strong, but it is true that in my constituency of Cork city, the ratepayers this year had to pay an extra 11s. in the £ in rates.  Of the 91s. rate, they must pay 31s. towards the health charges.  We of Fine Gael in Cork Corporation took the opportunity to explain to the ratepayers that if our policy were adopted, the rate in Cork city this year would be 52s. instead of 91s. in the £.  We are happy to feel that at last the penny has dropped on the Government side of the House and that they are now going to adopt what has been preached to them and to the people for the past five years.</P>
    <P>Health charges represent only one aspect of the rates.  There are other charges which should just as equitably be put on public funds, such as vocational charges and others.  I welcome the forward steps in regard to the Trustee Savings Bank for they also are long overdue and by no means over-generous.  That is the general pattern of this Budget.  Anything the Minister did is something he should have done long ago.  The assistance to pig producers is inadequate and will not stir them out of the lethargy into which they have fallen as a result of years of neglect.  The aids now given <Col N="336" /> to pig producers in my constituency and in Deputy French's constituency are much too late.  We have had one bacon factory closed down within the past 12 months simply because there were not enough pigs produced to keep it going.  The fact that these aids are given at this stage to disheartened pig producers will certainly not have the significant effect on the pig trade they should have.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think the Minister was rather conservative when he budgeted for only £200,000 on brandy and wines.  I mention that because I think it will become germane in a minute or two.  As far as I can see from the latest statistics we have, we are drinking wines and brandy like mad.  Home consumption clearances of wine in January, 1968, as compared with January, 1967, showed an increase of nearly 18,000 gallons, from 55,028 to 72,739 gallons.  There is a fair amount of drinking in 18,000 gallons of wine, sparkling or still.  The clearances of brandy were up by 2,500 proof gallons in January this year as compared with the same period last year.  But the thing that is to me most surprising is this&mdash;and it is something that the Minister might have overlooked, and if he did overlook it, he probably has under-budgeted what he is going to get from the imposition on wines and brandies&mdash;that between January, 1957, and January, 1968, there was an increase of nearly 33,000 gallons in imports of brandy; the figures for January, 1957, were 11,578 proof gallons, and in January, 1968, 44,896 proof gallons.  I do not know who is drinking this brandy or where it is going to, but certainly it is a significant figure, a rather mystifying figure, and a rather disturbing figure when you consider the approach of the Minister to the forthcoming financial year.  The Minister more or less indicated that if over the next 12 months we led quiet and holy lives and did not spend too much, his approach was sound.  However, to approach this quiet and holy life in the knowledge that we have imported four times more brandy in the first month of the year as compared with last year does not indicate that we <Col N="337" /> are going to get this reticence in spending for which the Minister hopes; not alone did he hope for it but he budgeted for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to maintain the 1967 growth rate, but this is largely dependent upon the success of the efforts not to generate too much domestic spending.  He intends to keep price increases tightly in check.  These are imponderables and nobody knows at any given time how the populace will react to the different stimuli they may receive throughout the year.  Certainly, the figures I mentioned with regard to brandy and wine are not indicative by any means of a public who are ready to economise in the manner for which the Minister seemed to hope.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has taken sufficient cognisance of the possible effects of the measures taken by the British Government following devaluation to restore the strength of the economy.  These are most likely to have repercussions here.  For one thing the British demand for imports and for consumer goods will diminish.  Again, the income squeeze may reduce demand for foodstuffs such as meat, dairy products and such commodities. For that reason, I think the Minister is being unduly optimistic when he limits his worries to the possible restraint on demand for industrial exports.  It is possible that the Irish exports to Britain will be preferable to those of non-devaluing countries, and exports to some of the non-devaluing countries, especially in Europe, might well be encouraged.  Nevertheless, there are dangerous possibilities about the entire international situation which, in my view, the Minister has underestimated.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the United States programme to strengthen the dollar. That could&mdash;and a lot of people are apprehensive that it will&mdash;result in a slowing-down of trade which would undoubtedly have its repercussions here.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us if he considered all these aspects of the matter before he came to the House with his statement yesterday. I think we can fairly expect an increase in the import of capital and other goods, but the figures quoted earlier <Col N="338" /> on occur to me, those for brandy and wine imports.  There is also a possibility for the reasons I mentioned&mdash;that is, the present conditions in England and the steps taken there&mdash;of a fall in our exports.  This should certainly lead to a deterioration in the balance of payments about which the Minister is much too sanguine.</P>
    <P>In discussing the balance of payments, I should like to refer the House to something about which I have consistently agitated here over the years. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce I baited him both in the House and publicly in our constituency about this matter, which gave me worry and continues now to disturb me, and not alone continues to disturb me but continues to disturb those who are intimately concerned in the matter.  I am referring to imports from the Iron Curtain countries.  Year after year I used to put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking him how much we had imported from the Iron Curtain countries, and how much they had taken from us; and year after year I used to get the most depressing replies, and so bad was the pattern that one was almost afraid to ask the question.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that as a result of pressure of this nature, there was eventually passed in this House a measure which enabled this country to guard its economy in this connection by taking restrictive steps in respect of imports from those countries.  Incidentally, I often wonder whether the goods which we purchased from these Iron Curtain countries are produced in ideal trade union conditions.  That is only a thought which occurred to me. However, it is quite true that despite our taking the legislative right to restrict imports from these countries, there has not been any noticeable improvement in the situation in so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Cork Examiner,</i> there is a report of a meeting which will take place in Dublin tomorrow, that is, the general meeting of the Irish Exporters Association.  They refer in terms of no small perturbation and gloom to the situation to which I have referred here and to which I have often referred in <Col N="339" /> years past.  They point to the distressing imbalance which exists in the trade figures between the Iron Curtain countries and ourselves.  These are not people who sit down and complain that this is dreadful and wring their hands and do nothing about it; these are gogetters who are anxious to do what they can to attract trade from the Iron Curtain countries.  They actually made advances to the Russians in the matter, and to put it in a rather delicate way, they say they found a lack of warmth in the reception they got from the Russians.  This is exactly what we legislated for.  If we experienced a lack of warmth amongst our brethren on the other side of the Iron Curtain, we had power to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad if the Minister, the Taoiseach, or somebody, would tell the House, the Irish Exporters Association and the people why this is allowed to continue.  I would be glad if they would tell us why we passed this legislation if we are not going to use it.  I think there was one luke-warm effort made to use the legislation, but certainly we have forged a weapon and we have put it into a scabbard, or worse, but we have never used it as effectively as we could have used it and as, perhaps, we should have used it.  Surely this is the acceptable time to unearth that legislation again, a time when the Minister, quite rightly, is worried about the imbalance in our trade which might occur.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's apprehension in that regard.  I have a feeling that possibly deep down within him the Minister is not quite as happy as he might appear to be about the ensuing 12 months.  I have a feeling he might have been viewing the immediate future in Limerick with one eye while viewing the more remote of the next 12 months with the other.  Limited words of good cheer went from the Minister to the electorate in Limerick.  I would be afraid that somehow the reasonably happy frame of mind in which the Minister appears to be here might prove to be unfounded.  I would suggest that one step he could take is to investigate as soon as possible how he could warm the reception which our <Col N="340" /> trade negotiators would receive if they went behind the Iron Curtain simply asking for the same kindness and consideration from the business interests behind the Iron Curtain as we appear to give to them when they come here selling their goods to us.</P>
    <P>One of my main objections to this Budget, and I feel sure it would be the main objection of many other people were they privileged to come to the House to give their views on it, is that it does nothing to improve the employment outlook for the forthcoming 12 months.  It does not even presume to do so.  At the very best, it is a sort of standstill Budget from that point of view and we are going, possibly, to hold the ground we are supposed to have gained last year.  That is a very distressing prospect.  One would expect from a Government who have been so active in producing programmes for economic expansion, from a Government whose Taoiseach once promised 100,000 new jobs in so many years, that the Minister would come in here and give some indication that they were still looking for these jobs and still hoping to place some more people in employment.  Instead of this, the Government choose to overlook the fact to which Deputy Cosgrave referred today&mdash;and there is no harm referring to facts like this now and again&mdash;that it was stated from a very good British source last week that 33,000 Irish emigrants passed over the British coastlines in the previous 12 months.  Having rid ourselves of these 33,000 people, we found ourselves on 11th April this year with 5,500 more people unemployed than there were at the same time last year.  The figures were 58,547 on 14th April, 1967 and 64,193 on 11th April this year.</P>
    <P>Another thing which stirs me very much, indeed, is the housing provision in the Capital Budget because I come from a constituency in which there has been a continual starvation of houses, particularly in the city where unbelievable slums still exist, although we live in the year 1968.  The Capital Budget says that the provision for local authority houses in 1968-69 is £14.5 million, an increase of £2 million on <Col N="341" /> the original estimate for 1967-68. Having regard to the increase in the production costs of housing&mdash;as far as I recall, Deputy Cosgrave also made this point&mdash;this represents no increase in the number of houses the Government hope to provide this year.  That is not good for the tens of thousands of fathers and mothers who are aching to bring up their children in proper conditions.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago we were patting ourselves on the back here for what we were doing for education and on how much we were spending to give youth an opportunity.  Why not spend equally on youth at its most formative stage so that a child can grow up happy in the knowledge that it is living in decent conditions and that there are not four or five children living in one or two rooms to which the bread-winner must return tired and weary and in a state of mind in which he is quite likely to take steps, if possible, to send the children out to play on the streets so that he can get some peace in his garret?  These are the sort of conditions which have led to many of the ills which are damaging the structure of our society and, in addition, costing enormous sums of money to eradicate them.  These are the sort of conditions which give rise to ill-health and make it necessary to have the health services to which I have referred already, the sort of conditions which give rise to juvenile deliquency which has become so great a menace in recent years.</P>
    <P>Again, I appeal to the Government not to be content just to produce a sort of standstill Budget.  While I am on that subject I should like to refer to one local matter which has rather mystified us in Cork Corporation. When the National Building Agency advertised for tenders for the building of 1,800 houses in Cork contractors were notified in the advertisement that they would have to provide the finance themselves.  Naturally that was a very important aspect of any tender sent in. Naturally, again, it would have been very difficult for some firms to provide finance of the nature required and never, so far as any public representative in Cork city knows, was there ever <Col N="342" /> any intimation to would-be contractors that this condition would subsequently be dispensed with and it was not until everything in respect of the tender accepted had been completed and contractors had been appointed that we found out, in the most incidental way, in Cork Corporation that the funds were coming from the Local Loans Fund.  I have nothing against the builder.  The firm is a most reputable one.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason for or the significance of this, but I should like someone to enlighten us as to why there was this change and I should like an assurance from the Minister that the fact that this money is now being provided out of the Local Loans Fund to the successful contractor will not affect the corporation's right to obtain from the Local Loans Fund moneys for their own housing programme because, concurrently with the building by the contractors of the National Building Agency, the corporation intend to build some 200 to 250 houses a year and I live in dread that the corporation will be told: &ldquo;Listen; you cannot get any money from the Local Loans Fund. Messrs. Sisk have already got enough to build 700 houses this year,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You are very lucky; congratulations.&rdquo; That is not what the corporation was promised.  That is not what the corporation expected.  That is not what the people of Cork were led to believe. It is not what the Corporation of Cork will accept.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is just one small item I would commend to the attention of the Minister and I am sure Deputies on both sides will be with me in this. I would ask the Minister to reduce one Estimate by 30/- or £2, or whatever sum it would take.  There is an estimate for heating the Oireachtas.  Would the Minister take a few pounds off that?  I have yet to meet a Deputy who does not complain about the dreadful atmosphere.  This overheated atmosphere is very bad; it can make you thirsty as well as everything else. It is a very difficult atmosphere in which to think properly and to work as hard as one would like to work. This request may sound frivolous, but it is not by any means frivolous.  This overheated atmosphere is something <Col N="343" /> that should have been rectified long ago.  If this were a business premises, I am quite sure the staff would have gone on strike long ago; the boss and everyone would complain and something would be done.  It is about time something was done and I hope the Minister will now turn the heat on on those who should do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the aid he proposes to distribute to the needy sections of our community. The increase of 7/6 to old age pensioners is most welcome.  It will bring the pension up to £3 in the case of the non-contributory old age pensioner. Admittedly, more is needed, but an increase of 7/6 is generous at this stage.</P>
      <P>The concessions in the case of the old IRA and the Cumann na mBan are long overdue.  The increase given in the past 12 months was nullified by the simultaneous reduction in the old age pension.  This increase now is very welcome and I take this opportunity of expressing my own thanks and the thanks of those who will benefit by the concession.</P>
      <P>The increase of 10/- in the case of mountain lambs is very welcome.  It should help the development of this branch of farming.  I should like now to direct the Minister's attention to the need for a subsidy towards the cost of lime spreading on the uplands and mountainsides.  I understand a new machine has been developed in Cork by one of the lime contractors and it will spread lime satisfactorily on the lower slopes and hillsides.  It will, however, cost 25/- to 30/- per ton and an extra subsidy would be invaluable to those concerned because liming is vital in increasing sheep production.  I doubt if the subsidy would cost a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people hardest hit at the moment are the small landholders&mdash; mostly bachelors&mdash;who find it very difficult to eke out a living on a holding of £3 valuation.  In some cases the income is nil.  Normally, they qualify for very little dole either of the ordinary kind or what we call the farm dole.  In the case of a man with a holding of £4 valuation, his means are <Col N="344" /> assessed at 32/- and with the recent increase, he would be entitled to 37/6d. Certainly, it would not pay anybody to travel even only once a week in order to sign the register and then return on another day to collect 5/-.  A recipient of the ordinary dole is entitled also to 37/6d.  The fact that a man has a couple of cows and sends milk to the creamery is assessed as means.</P>
    <P>Some form of help should be devised for the type of person I have referred to.  These people are living on the hillsides, in the valleys and mountain areas.  The majority of them are 40 to 50 years of age.  There are many cases of a brother and sister or two brothers&mdash;bachelors&mdash;living together. It is not feasible for them to emigrate at that age and they are unable to secure employment in their locality.  A special scheme should be devised whereby they would be given some form of assistance that would maintain them.  I would prefer that assistance to these people would be removed from a social welfare scheme. The assistance could be designated as a smallholder's subsidy or something like that.  Such provision would help to maintain these people in their own homes.  In many cases it is not possible for these people to procure an income of even £3 a week gross from the smallholding and out of that they have to pay rates and whatever other overheads they may be liable for.  Aid of some form or other is necessary in their case.  I should like particular notice to be taken of that suggestion, and if the Minister is in a position to do something about it immediately, it should be done.</P>
    <P>If there was any disappointing feature in the Budget so far as I am concerned it is the very small sum provided by way of increased provision for the fishing industry.  The fishing industry is one of our most valuable assets.  It should be developed.  Many foreigners are interested in fishing development here at the moment.  Grants are needed.  Harbour facilities must be improved.  Money should have been provided for the early development of harbours and the development of fishing in general.</P>
    <P>It is an established fact that there <Col N="345" /> are over 500 foreign trawlers fishing off the Kerry and south Cork coast.  These trawlers, coming hundreds of miles to fish there, are not on an idle journey. The fish is there.  The value of this natural asset is overlooked.  Recently, in County Kerry, one European expert stated that fish caught off the Irish coast could be landed immediately and if handled conveniently and marketed without delay would be superior to any fish available on the Continent.  I was informed this evening by a person who has returned from the Continent that the Dutch are scrapping their fishing fleet, or a big part of it, because they have to go too far to fish and this means that fish has to be kept for six to eight days and deteriorates even though it is packed in ice so that it is next to useless when it is eventually marketed.  This expert stated that fish caught off the western coast of Ireland, which could be landed within a matter of hours, would have much greater value than anything that can be procured in Europe.  We know that fish abounds off our coast.  The necessary personnel is available.  The industry must be organised properly.  The opportunity would appear to be there now.</P>
    <P>I should like once more to direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to the vast potential of the fishing industry and the possibilities that have arisen for that industry in Europe.  It is too valuable an industry to be overlooked. Much more aggressive action should be taken to have it developed. At present our harbours are not capable of accommodating the type of boat now required.  At the present rate of progress it would take years to have the harbours sufficiently developed. Money must be found for this purpose and a positive approach must be made to the problem of developing the fishing industry in the very near future at a rate which will mean that the industry will be of value to the national economy.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the Kerry coast, I believe that there is a valuable potential industry which could be developed along the entire coast that would employ from 20,000 to 30,000 people and that would be worth from <Col N="346" /> £30 million to £50 million on the export market.  The fish is available.  We have the necessary skill.  There is a sufficient skilled labour force.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty in finding the necessary finance for the provision of a fishing fleet and processing stations.  Certainly, there is a vast market in Europe.  One hears that the European market is over-supplied but an expert who supplies large quantities of fish has stated that the European market is over-supplied with bad fish and that if he could get Irish fish as he sees it off the Kerry coast, he could sell any quantity that could be caught.</P>
    <P>A special effort should be made to have this arm of our economy developed. It is at a very low stage of development at the moment even though there have been recent developments and there has been some addition to our exports.  No real effort has been made to develop the fishing industry as it should be developed. In Killorglin there is a harbour where vast quantities of shellfish would seem to be available.  As a result of the very niggardly amounts given by the Department for the purpose of having the mussel seed replanted, all this material is allowed to go to waste.  About 25,000 cwts. of mussels have been produced there this year whereas the quantity should be at least 100,000 or even 250,000 bags of mussels.  A processing station should be established.  This very valuable industry is languishing and is not being developed into the valuable national asset it could be.</P>
    <P>The fact that £130 million is being provided this year for capital purposes and that we can finance that expenditure out of our own resources certainly bespeaks the progress we are making as a nation.  The fact that our people are working and saving sufficient money to provide that colossal sum this year after the very big effort made in recent years augurs well for the future and shows that we are going ahead as a nation, developing our resources to the maximum and in such a way that in the not too distant future we can provide sufficient work for all our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> At present in Kerry vast projects are in hands for the provision of hotels and guesthouses, but we are slowed down because we cannot get sufficient money to provide the water and sewerage so necessary for hotel, farm-house and guesthouse development.  If there is any means of finding that money more readily, it should be devised.  Tourism is a valuable asset and our people there are rising to the occasion and trying to get the necessary development.  Every effort should be made to help them as soon as possible.  Water and sewerage schemes are of paramount importance and should be a first priority.</P>
    <P>Once we get the tourist money in, it will help us in future development.  The maximum amount should be channelled into this much needed development. Certainly great progress has been made in regard to hotel building, industrial building and house building, particularly in my own county.  We have a very lively economy.  By and large, there is plenty of work for our younger people.  I can only hope that this forward march will continue and grow better.  We have in the scenery in our county a valuable asset to offer. Our people do their very best to receive the visitors and make them happy when they are there.  They are doing a very good job of work.  We are the shop window of Ireland down there.  I would again stress to the Minister the necessity of giving us the maximum help.  The sooner we can get more money to develop water and sewerage schemes, the sooner we will be in a position to receive far more visitors and distribute them throughout the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Since the car ferries began operating, tourists are coming here in vast numbers.  It is noticeable that the bulk of those head for Killarney in particular, and at Easter week the town was full of visitors.  We are doing our best to attract more and at the moment in Kerry, particularly around the Ring of Kerry, about 25 hotel projects are in progress.  Vast numbers of people are looking for guesthouse accommodation, particularly farm-house accommodation, but, because of the <Col N="348" /> difficulties of water and sanitation, schemes are not proceeding as fast as I would like.</P>
    <P>By and large, this has been a magnificent Budget, very well received on the whole throughout the country.  The various weaker sections of our people have got their slice of the cake.  I do not think anybody can find fault with this in general, and the Minister is to be applauded for doing a very good job of work.  To give out the sums that have been given out with very little taxation, especially of the painful type, was a master stroke and certainly speaks well for the future of our country and the progress we are making. We hope that this will continue in the future and help to stop emigration and keep more of our people at home. Anything that helps to develop our natural resources will definitely assist the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to convey on behalf of my constituents, particularly social welfare and old age pensioners, their grateful thanks and my own thanks for the magnificent help given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish described this Budget as a cosy Budget. To some extent it has been a cosy Budget.  It has been a cosy Budget for the Minister for Finance.  He has been able to give a little bit here and a little bit there and has not imposed any great increase in taxation.  At the same time, one might with equal truth describe it as almost a stand still Budget because of its lack of imagination and the failure to use it as an effective instrument of economic progress, particularly in the interests of the ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>All Parties welcome the provisions the Minister has made in respect of certain increased social welfare benefits on the general basis that the recipients of such benefits are in urgent need of some increase.  However, I will deal with that a little later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing his Budget the Minister referred to the Capital Budget. Although naturally this is not a debate on the Capital Budget, I think it is necessary to make one or two remarks in relation to it.  The <Col N="349" /> provisions of the Capital Budget so far as they are intended to encourage an extension of industry or the establishment of industry are generally welcome. They are welcome if only from the point of view that they may hold out some hope, if these provisions are implemented, for those who are described in the return as the 57,000 unemployed.  This is a peculiar position. This is the Minister's second Budget.  He told us that we had a good year this year and a fairly good year in 1967, but we have more people unemployed now than we had last year or the year before.</P>

      <P>I think it was in 1952 that he expressed the view in the Budget that the people could almost live on herrings and little else.  He was very eloquent on many occasions about the moral degradation that would fall upon Irish families if free school meals were introduced.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary remember those days, and does he remember when the former Taoiseach, the present Taoiseach and he himself were very eloquent in telling the country that we would have 100,000 new jobs?  Would he mind telling us how many more <Col N="350" /> jobs there are for Irish people, taking all the workers into account, in 1968 since that famous statement?</P>

      <P>If I get a little help from Fianna Fáil Deputies I do not mind: I like it.  The more they talk in this House either by way of making a contribution to the debate or by stupid and asinine interruptions, the more they demonstrate their unfitness to take any part in a temporary Government of this country.  The Taoiseach is described as Honest Jack Lynch and as a nice or a pleasant person, but many of the members of his Government do not bring credit on themselves, on their Party, or on this Assembly.  I was referring to some figures of which the Parliamentary Secretary does not want to be reminded.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary comes from a western part of the country.  How is it that as a result of deliberate Fianna Fáil policy practically 52 per cent of the population of the country are in the province of Leinster?  They have left Connacht. They do not want to be associated with the Parliamentary Secretary and his like.  They come here where they are welcome, as he is.  He stays in my constituency. God knows, Fianna Fáil were long enough in office to have some small policy of some kind, but they can always disguise from the poor innocent voter what their policy is on anything.</P>
      <P>I was congratulating the Minister for Finance because to some extent he indicated in the Capital Budget that he is proposing to take some small steps towards securing that there will be a possibility of greater employment.  For that he is entitled to some little congratulation from everyone in the House, whether from his own Party who fall over him, or from Fine Gael or Labour.  If this encouragement in the Capital Budget has the effect of creating more jobs for the people at present signing on at the labour exchanges, no one will be happier to congratulate him than the people on these benches.  I also note in the Capital Budget that there is quite a small increase only for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this is another secret under the Fianna Fáil cabinet.  I do not think there is any section of the community which is unaware of the urgent need not only to maintain the house-construction programme at the 1966-67 or 1967-68 level but to increase that programme expeditiously and rapidly.  I have expressed sympathy in this House and elsewhere with the Minister for Local Government, whoever he is, who is faced with a housing problem and also with the elected members of local authorities and with the members of housing committees in the various local authorities and even with the city and county managers of whom I have <Col N="352" /> been critical in the past.  I sympathise with genuine efforts to speed up the provision of houses and to move our country from, possibly, among the four lowest in Europe in this connection to a higher level if additional capital moneys are not provided for that purpose in the Budget.</P>

      <P>This country is amongst the lowest in Europe from the point of view of providing houses for our people.  This is a Government responsibility.  Let nobody try to dodge the issue.  It is a responsibility placed on this House and on the Government elected by this House.  My fear is that, because of the small amount of money provided, all we shall see this year is a mere maintenance of the level of housing instead of a substantial increase.</P>
      <P>In the course of his rather inaccurate survey, the Minister talked about industrial relations.  If we had not so many lectures from time to time from Fianna Fáil Ministers, who know little and appear not to be able to learn about industrial relations, we might not have had some of the difficulties we have experienced.  Down through the years, various Fianna Fáil Ministers have come in here with some form of cure-all in this field.  In the early part of his speech, the Minister spoke of the danger involved in workers seeking adjustments in their wage rates through the normal negotiating machinery.  Unlike previous Ministers for Finance, he did not dwell on it at great length. He referred to phased agreements in many industries negotiated on a reasonable basis.  He makes this statement which, to say the least of it, appears a little careless:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a movement in a number of industries and individual <Col N="354" /> firms towards the conclusion of agreements for increases in rates of pay phased over a period usually up to the end of 1969.  Some of these contain special provisions&mdash;such as removal of restrictive practices&mdash; aimed at increasing productivity, though it must be recognised that many so-called productivity agreements make little more than token provision for raising productivity.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has made any study of contributions by workers in manufacturing industry in the past ten or 15 years, or more, in the light of the question of increased productivity. He has only to go to some of the larger firms to discover that, though the productivity level is the same as it was five or six years ago, as a result of productivity developments, the work force has considerably decreased.</P>
    <P>Productivity in industry is not a new subject.  It is not something that began when the term first came to be used in official documents.  With adequate prior consultation and genuine efforts by managements with some appreciation of the need for consultation and agreement with their workers and their representatives, there have been significant increases in productivity, in industry after industry.  There has been little productivity, however, in the Government. We do not see any reduction in the number of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.  Rather is there a tendency to increase their number.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25th April, 1968.</P>
