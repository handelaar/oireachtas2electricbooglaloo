      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the very high landing charges and harbour dues etc., being charged to trawlers and fishing boats landing their catches in Cobh can only result in driving this fishing development away from Cobh Port; and if he will take steps to remedy this matter.</P>

      <P>The charges applied by harbour authorities to vessels and goods are determined by the harbour authorities and are promulgated in Harbour Rates Orders made by me under the Harbours Act, 1946 after due publication of the intention to make the Order and consideration of any objections thereto by interested parties.</P>
      <P>The charges currently applied by the Cork Harbour Commissioners were authorised in 1957.  They were duly publicised in draft form and no objections were made thereto before I made the Order authorising them.</P>
      <P>As the authorised charges are maximum charges it is open to the Cork Harbour Commissioners to vary them should they see fit to do so in relation to fishing vessels and their catches.  My consent is not required for such variation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in any fishing port, for example Dunmore East, the charge is 3d per cran landing charge and £5 per year for the amenities of the port?  The Cork Harbour Commissioners are charging 6d per cran and 30/- every time the fishing boat comes in beyond Roches Point, £5 as against £490 a year.  In view of those circumstances, will the Minister see that those charges are changed immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy that this is not a matter specifically for me; it is a matter for the Cork Harbour Commissioners. They in their wisdom have decided to maintain this charge, and it is one in respect of which those people who represent the interests in the area come to, I presume, the best decision from the point of view of the harbour board. There is no doubt that the charges are somewhat higher than in other places but the Deputy is comparing the port with a fishing port, and in this case it is a commercial port.  My information indicates that the total value of fish sold during the month of December was £23,000 and that would indicate an average value per catch per vessel of £217.  The average overall charge per vessel was 38/-which is .87 per cent of the value of the fish sold.  I think that is not unreasonable.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary stated that it is he who makes the Order in regard to this charge and I am asking him now if he is going to amend it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Grants paid to Messrs.  Denny in respect of their Cork factory under the Bacon Factory Modernisation Scheme introduced by my Department in 1960 have amounted to £22,398.  Grants under this scheme are paid only after receipts for expenditure have been obtained and after an inspection team from my Department have visited the factory concerned and satisfied themselves that the work in respect of which a grant is sought has been completed and that any machinery or equipment included has been installed and is in proper working order. No grant was, therefore, paid in respect of machinery delivered to the Denny factory at Cork but not installed.</P>
      <P>In 1965 Messrs.  Denny applied for a grant under a scheme of Technical Assistance Grants operated by my Department which is designed to promote efficiency in agriculture-based industries.  The grant was sought to enable the firm to engage industrial consultants to investigate and carry out work measurement on production operations in the Cork factory and to recommend changes including the application of suitable incentives which would result in cost reduction. Early in 1967 the firm notified my Department that the project had been completed and a grant of £3,587, representing 50 per cent of the consultants' fees, was duly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> No other grants and no loans have been made from State or semi-State sources under my Department to Messrs.  Denny in respect of the factory.</P>
    <P>As regards weekly production figures for the Cork factory, it would not be in accordance with practice to disclose details of an individual firm's business and accordingly I regret I am unable to furnish the figures requested.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has good grounds for believing that it would be possible to attract bacon interests to Cork city with a view to acquiring the Denny factory premises, I will of course look into the matter.  There are, as the Deputy is aware, three other substantial bacon factories in Cork; two of those have been in the course of being modernised and the third is being completely rebuilt on more advanced lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the findings of An Foras Talúntais as published in the volume <i>A Review of Drumlin Soil Research</i> he will declare the western part of the Drumlin soil belt in the counties Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal to be a region for special development so that the further development that the review advises may be better undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems of the Drumlin soil area are already receiving special attention in the context of the Pilot Area Programme and western development generally.  The Report published recently by An Foras Talúntais is mainly a summary of experimental work which is still proceeding.  My Department is keeping in close contact with the work, with particular reference to the possibility of developing special drainage techniques suitable for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there has been for many years in operation in the Department of Agriculture a special drainage scheme devised in the light of the knowledge which is available to the Department <Col N="564" /> of the peculiar trouble in the soil situation obtaining in County Leitrim?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about what is now operating the Deputy will, I think, agree that the report published by An Foras Talúntais is an interesting report and that it may give us further ways in which we may improve the techniques that have been specially devised for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that it is of some importance to emphasise that the Department of Agriculture have been conscious of this special soil problem and have in fact an exceptionally devised drainage procedure for County Leitrim to meet these Drumlin soil conditions with which they have been familiar for many years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will consider extending the Dunmore-Clonberne pilot area so as to embrace the Williamstown, Ballymoe and Glinsk area, County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The original pilot area in County Galway was extended to about three times its original size last year and further extensions are not contemplated by me at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Ballymoe and Williams town districts are, in actual fact, more depressed than the areas in which the <Col N="565" /> pilot scheme is already in operation? In view of that fact, it is only right that the Minister should extend this pilot scheme to the areas mentioned in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be wrong to assume that merely because one area may be more depressed than another this is in itself complete justification for extending or providing a pilot area, because the whole basis of the pilot area institution in the first instance in the western counties is that it is a programme the purpose of which is to assess the problem of agricultural development in the West, and this is on a broad basis.  We would hope it would have a reflection on a broad basis and therefore it need not necessarily be that a pilot area so chosen must be in the most depressed part, nor indeed does it follow that it should be in the best part. Rather, I think, the pilot area to be truly pilot and to give returns on which general schemes for the whole area could be drawn would ideally be a cross-section of the type of area that one is likely to expect in the whole region of the West.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea which would seem to underlie the Deputy's question is that we should extend this without question to all parts.  Again I would like to point out that the very name of this scheme &ldquo;The Pilot Area Programme&rdquo; indicates that it is of a pilot nature and therefore is trying certain things out on a pilot basis to find where the different approaches are suitable, where changes in our approach to various things may have to take place, to find out what is good and proper in the process and to find out what is not so good.  It is really an education for all concerned.  This is what underlies it, an effort to find out what will work and what will best <Col N="566" /> work and what is not working so well, and this pilot element is still going on. We still want to learn more than we know at the moment and only when we are satisfied that we have learned what there is to be usefully learned in this way should we then consider general application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Section 56 of the Housing Act, 1966, empowers a housing authority to erect, acquire, purchase, convert or reconstruct, lease or otherwise provide dwellings.  In so far as vested cottages are concerned, housing authorities generally were informed by my Department on 24th February, 1966, that, in all cases where the consent of the authority is being sought to the sale of such a cottage to a person who is not in need of housing, the authority should consider if purchase by them to meet an ascertained housing need would be justified.</P>
      <P>In the case of local authority dwellings sold, leased or vested, housing authorities have, under section 107 of the Housing Act, 1966, and sections 17 and 24 of the Labourers Act, 1936, as amended by section 102 of the 1966 Act, extensive powers of recovery of the dwellings if the conditions on which they were acquired are broken.  In particular, the amendments made by section 102 enable a housing authority to recover possession of a vested cottage summarily if the cottage has not been occupied by a qualified person as his normal place of residence during a continuous period of 18 months.</P>
      <P>The introduction of further legislation to deal with the problem referred to by the Deputy does not appear to be necessary.</P>

Whatever his Department may say, we are advised by the Cork county solicitor that we have not the power under legislation to compete for and to purchase these houses.  I should like the Minister to make it clear now to the Cork county solicitor that we have the power and that there is no need for further legislation.  I want the matter cleared up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to promote discussion of the following matter, namely, clarification of the Taoiseach's statement of 31st January in relation to Proportional Representation in the following respects:</P>
      <P>(a) the Taoiseach indicated his Party's intention to cause a referendum to be held for the purpose of securing two separate results, namely, the abolition of Proportional Representation and the institution of a new population basis for Dáil representation which is offensive to the principle of One Man-One Vote: the recent statement of a Government Minister to the effect that both these issues, which are separate, will be put to the people as one question and will allow only one answer has caused considerable public disquiet;</P>
      <P>(b) Members of the Dáil feel that there is an obligation on the Taoiseach to state the reasons which influenced him to seek this fundamental change in our constitutional law in the absence of any public demand whatsoever; and</P>
      <P>(c) the Taoiseach has not informed the country of the probable cost of this operation in terms of Parliamentary time, printing, interruption of work and general interference in the working of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion of this matter is urgent because any proposal to alter the Constitution is necessarily so far-reaching in its nature.  The Government have a duty to provide the citizens with the <Col N="597" /> maximum time possible for its consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dunne for having given me notice yesterday of his intention to request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil on a definite matter of urgent public importance.  The precedents of the House require that, to be urgent as prescribed in Standing Order 29, the matter must be of such a nature that delay in discussing it might prevent effective action being taken.</P>
      <P>The Chair has considered the Deputy's request very carefully and I have come to the conclusion that the matter does not satisfy this requirement of urgency.  I must therefore rule that the motion is not one contemplated by Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, may I submit that in the light of the fact that statements as to the Government's intentions have been made, in the customary Fianna Fáil manner, outside this House and that no statement has been made to the Members of this House in respect to this proposed fundamental change, it does therefore qualify properly to be described as a matter of urgency and there does devolve on Dáil Éireann a responsibility to afford the people of Ireland the longest possible time to consider the implications and the undemocratic nature of the proposal.  I should like also, with great respect, to draw your attention to the fact that the Constitution Committee which examined this, among other matters, were engaged on their labours for longer than a year.  In the light of that and in the light of the possibility, and the strong probability, that this legislation, which seeks to undermine our democratic rights, will be rushed on the country, there is on the Chair, on us all, an obligation to discuss the matter immediately and fully, in detail, so that the public will know exactly what they are in for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House <Col N="601" /> adjourned last night, I was dealing with the question of retarded children, children slow to learn, and I pointed out that the present position in respect of the education of those children is not up to date.  Teachers in national schools have not an opportunity of giving individual attention to those children because otherwise they would have to neglect or slow down the children who are advanced.  I also suggested that in future a special school might be erected in each parish, and that retarded children should be taught there by a specially trained teacher.  I think slow-learning children would make much more progress and that the children in the ordinary national school would also do the same.  The importance of the primary school in laying the true foundation for all further education cannot be overstressed.  This true education foundation is most important for post-primary education.  A child who does not get a good foundation in the national school will be slow to learn in post-primary school, whether it be secondary or technical.</P>
      <P>We know now that primary education is no longer sufficient if young people are to play a significant role in the world of today and tomorrow. Primary education is no longer sufficient if we aspire to enter the Common Market.  With that in mind, and the importance of primary schools, I revert to the substandard schools.  Children cannot be properly taught in a national school if it is not a proper building, if it has not proper sanitary and heating facilities and if its surroundings are not pleasant.  In some of the substandard schools we have, we know the surroundings are anything but conducive to good teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on record that I support fully the INTO stand on, and their attitude towards, some of these substandard schools.  I taught in one of those schools some time ago and the conditions there were a disgrace to any civilised country.  There were dry closets which were cleaned only once a year and sometimes once every two years.  I often saw the filth and dirt <Col N="602" /> being taken in to the floor of the school. Such a position should not obtain in any civilised country.  In this respect I have nothing but praise for the present Minister who has to cope with the accumulated neglect of school buildings over many years.  I consider he is doing a fine job on this and I would like sincerely to wish him success in speeding up the eradication of all those substandard schools.  I know he is a man of action, but the job is very big, and nobody can expect that it will be remedied overnight.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of national schools, I should like to mention equipment. The equipment in most rural national schools is substandard also.  It is difficult to know just where to lay the blame.  I have taught in a school where the map of the world was at least 50 years old.  We know that the names of countries and also the names of towns in Europe have changed but Petrograd is still to be seen on some of those old maps of the world.  It is difficult for a teacher to teach geography with such equipment.  I do not know, as I say, where the blame lies.  It is not the duty of the teacher to purchase this equipment.  I would suggest to the Minister that through his inspectors, he should have first-hand information on each school and that where this type of map is to be found, it should be removed and replaced by a new map.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to wall charts.  The Department of Education should think this one out and supply suitable wall charts.  There are charts supplied to the junior division but in the senior division, the only ones I have seen are those issued by the Shell Oil Company, which are very informative indeed.  They are charts of birds, fish and so on.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to refer to in respect of national schools, that is, the system of inspection. I know the system was altered in the proper direction some years ago but we still have inspectors who do not appreciate that when they come into a school, their role should be that of adviser and helper rather than that of a critic.  I am sorry to say&mdash;I am sure the Minister would wish to hear this&mdash;<Col N="603" /> that I have had many complaints about a particular inspector who approaches the examination of children with the idea of sticking them.  I have had very pleasant associations with the Department of Education, with the officials and inspectors, all my life and I have found that inspectors will never stick a child.  If they see that a child is stuck, they will alter the question and bring it around so that the child will never get the impression that he is stuck.  However, this particular inspector appears to take a delight in sticking a child and in turning around to the teacher&mdash; which I think is a cardinal error&mdash;and asking: &ldquo;Did you not teach him this?&rdquo; That type of inspection should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The same man is fond of giving six months' notice here and there, where there does not appear to be any need for it at all.  I have heard many other complaints about him.  For instance, I have heard that his Irish is such that the children do not understand it. When he asks a child a question, the child does not know what he is being asked.  The teacher has to repeat the question and then the child will answer. The role of an inspector should be that of an adviser and helper rather than that of a critic.  In particular, criticism should never be made of a teacher in front of the children.  I suggest to the Minister that occasionally a circular might be issued to inspectors on the subject of their approach in examining children in national and other schools.</P>
    <P>The curriculum has not changed for many years.  It is much the same as it has been since the foundation of the State.  Certainly it is not attractive.  I suggest to the Minister that he might have the curriculum examined to see if a more attractive one can be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on the withdrawal of the primary school certificate.  It served no useful purpose.  Down through the years, the INTO asked for its withdrawal and this Minister for Education has had the courage to do so.  He is to be complimented <Col N="604" /> on putting an end to this certificate examination and on its replacement by a system of record cards.  I think few educationalists will regret the passing of that certificate.  It merely tended to cram the children and to neglect a broader education.</P>
    <P>The filling of the record cards should not be taken lightly.  It gives new professional responsibilities to the teachers, especially in principal teacher schools.  Their integrity as a professional body is being put to the test.  I hope and I expect that a truthful assessment of each child's work will be available to the parents and to the post-primary education authorities.  I have little doubt that those record cards will be a success and that they will be filled in conscientiously and truthfully.</P>
    <P>Passing on now to secondary education and post-primary education, I should like to say that when the Minister spoke about free transport for children, most people thought he was a visionary.  The high degree of success of the scheme, in such a short time, is almost incredible.  The Minister showed he was not a visionary but a realist. However, like all schemes of this magnitude that have been introduced&mdash;and successfully, might I say&mdash;there are bound to be teething troubles and there are teething troubles here, too.  I am sure the Minister, with his foresight, will have any such problems ironed out in the near future.  I have a few points here which the Minister might like to know about.</P>
    <P>I know of one case, not in my constituency, where 14 children&mdash;depending on how many are travelling&mdash;are put into a five-cwt. van to be brought to secondary school.  That is not desirable.  I am sure the Minister would like to hear if such a thing has happened. It is dangerous for the children, for a start.  In the event of an accident, there would be very little hope.  A part from that, I do not think it is desirable from a health point of view.</P>
    <P>Another type of case which is fairly widespread is this.  There is a school bus coming from Dromore West to Sligo town.  It collects the post-primary children attending Ballisodare school, <Col N="605" /> which is the first school on the way. It arrives at both schools in time for school.  There are children in the catchment area of Ballisodare who are attending school in Sligo.  The parents offered to pay on the school bus for them but this was not accepted.  Consequently, they had to travel on the ordinary bus which left them an hour late for school.  This may seem a small, technical matter but it means a lot to the children.  If I give the Minister the facts, I am sure he will look at them favourably.</P>
    <P>I come then to the question of scholarships.  Scholarships for university education are far too few and the amount of money is also too small.  It takes in the region of £350 to £400 a year to send a child to the university. The most Sligo County Council is providing is in the region of £200.  I realise that everything cannot be tackled together.  The Minister said on one occasion, and I thoroughly agree with him, that he would ensure that no child with ability would be deprived of a university education because his parents were unable to pay for him.  I believe the Minister means that.  It is a difficult problem and how he will solve it I do not know but, in view of his achievements already in various spheres of education, I think he is quite capable of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy, I know the Minister's Department very well.  I have received the greatest co-operation from the officials and the Minister.  He has done a very fine job in adverse circumstances. I conclude by saying that it will be recognised that he has done more in one year than has been done in the past 17 to 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this very important topic.  I shall begin by taking the first opportunity of expressing my point of view on the report of the Commission on Higher Education. It should go on the records of this House that they have my support and the support of many other people in relation to the making of this report. This Commission had their inaugural meeting on 8th November, 1960.  In fact, they began work on January 1st <Col N="606" /> 1961.  They concluded their present deliberations on 24th February, 1967. In all, the Commission met in that period of six years on 309 occasions: effectively, they sat one whole year out of the six or one day per week over a six-year period.</P>
      <P>A lot of the criticism and snide asides on this Commission have been totally unfair and totally unjustified. Here we have a group of men coming together, prepared to give their time and prepared to give their services to the nation over a period of six years. There has been a lot of criticism of the length of time they took to publish the report.  I do not subscribe to that criticism at all.</P>
      <P>It was said here last night that university education has been in the doldrums since the present Minister took over.  When we talk about university education being in the doldrums until now, we speak about the time when Cardinal Newman took over in the middle of the last century.  In fact, we can say that university education has been in the doldrums over a century, and this Commission took only six years to deliberate on it.  I express my gratitude for the very excellent report they made available which is a marvellous source of reference and one to which many people will refer from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers in the Seanad, from going through their reports, were critical of the Commission and the length of time they took in reporting.  They said that university education and the efforts being made by the Department of Education in relation to the universities had come to a standstill during the period of the Commission's report. This, of course, is unfounded and can be disproved by the production of financial figures.  During the course of the first financial year, 1961-62, the sum made available to the universities was £1,152,000.  During the present financial year the figure is £3,792,000.  I agree that the first figure may be a low one.  Financial aid had in fact increased to the universities almost four times since 1961-62.  Those figures will give the lie to the suggestion that the universities were not <Col N="607" /> getting assistance during the sitting and the deliberations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Also in the Seanad Debates, there was a very unreasonable case, I thought, made for the introduction of more honours subjects for university entrants.  I do not subscribe to this. We all know that from September next there will be two honours subjects necessary to qualify for entry to our universities.  Fair enough; let us stop at that.  My view is that a good pass student is equally as good as, if not better than, an honours student.  I do not think that examinations tell very much.  In my own short period at university, young men coming out of schools as geniuses come out of the university stream as fools.  Emphasis should be placed on the aptitude of university entrants and less emphasis of the examinations.</P>
    <P>The Commission dealt with the whole question of legal education and again I can speak from my own experience here.  The Commission stated that there should be closer consultation and co-operation between the universities and the law societies.  At the present time I do not believe this exists.  I left University College, Dublin, six years ago.  In conjunction with my attendance at UCD, I attended the King's Inns.  I was doing a law degree, BL, at the King's Inns and what happened? We would have a contract lecture in the morning at UCD and have a lecture in the same subject at the King's Inns the same evening, which was a duplication of subjects. Here I believe we should support this recommendation, that the law societies should get together with the universities and have one professional legal training centre in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I support entirely the Minister's views in relation to the amalgamation and integration of University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin. It will do away with all this duplication of education which exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell mentioned yesterday that having read the report of the Commission on Higher Education, he felt that the first priority was in relation to the New Colleges.  I do not <Col N="608" /> go along with that at all.  My priorities are, the need for better facilities in our present university structure and the need for a more comprehensive building programme in relation to our present university <i>piles.</i></P>
    <P>The first question relates to better facilities in relation to staffing, student/ staff ratio.  At the moment there are 18 to 20 students per head of staff in our universities, and apart from the fact that all of our universities are understaffed, the Commission make a recommendation that there be 12 students per head of staff.  In other words, there should be 12 students to one lecturer or one tutor.  Comparisions are somewhat unrealistic and invidious.  The situation is in England that you have seven students per head of staff on an average in the English university stream.  It is not necessary to aim at that figure in this country.</P>
    <P>I made an effort to get away from the psychological link with Britain in terms of education at any rate and went to some trouble to get figures in relation to the student ratio content in continental universities.  However, I failed, and received the figures for American universities.  Having examined these figures, the Commission's recommendations come somewhat nearer to the American university average, in relation to student-staff ratio.  If I may give some figures, the University of Houston, Texas, one of the biggest and richest in the United States, has a student-staff ratio of 20-1; in the University of Kansas, it is 16-1; in New York State University, 15-1; and in the University of Virginia, 20-1; There are of course some better-off universities in this respect.  You have the University of Harvard, again one of the biggest and wealthiest in the States, with a ratio of 4-1.  At the other end of the scale, you have Ohio State University, in which there are 38,000 students and where the ratio is 35-1. Taking all in all, the Commission's recommendations are in line with American universities.</P>
    <P>This question of lowering the present student-staff ratio in our universities would be my first priority. The second would be the question of <Col N="609" /> a building programme.  The Minister indicated what has been done and what he intends to do in relation to the universities, but he also pointed out there is need for a vast building programme. He tells us that in ten years time the number of our university students will have doubled.  Again, the Commission's recommendations should be noted, have been noted and must be put into action without delay.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate, there has been a call for free post-secondary education.  The Minister has expressed his own views in this.  He says that this situation will come about, and we accept his word for it. When people believed we would not have post-primary education here, the Minister came up with it, again to give the lie to the doubting Thomases.  I have no reason to doubt that when the Minister says he will do something he will do it, and I accept unequivocally what he says in respect of making free university education available to those who cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I was recently reading a report undertaken by the Institute for University Studies of the EEC.  It is entitled the Poignant Report.  The point made in it is that the lower income group within the EEC lack opportunities for higher education.  It states that the largest proportion of children attending institutions of higher education in the EEC countries have family backgrounds in the professional classes. This is the frightening feature of the report.  The children of manual workers are at the other end of the scale.  In France, only three per cent of the children of agricultural workers and 1.4 per cent of those of industrial workers go to university.  In Britain, the proportion is four per cent of the children of skilled workers and two per cent of children of semi-skilled and unskilled workers.  I am open to correction in what I am going to say next but I believe the figure for Ireland is ten per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>On what does the Deputy base that assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On this report.  They are on the scene and I am sure they <Col N="610" /> know what they are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they actually give a figure for Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No. This report deals only with the countries of the Six.  We on this side of the House are anxious to have education available to all. Members of every Party would welcome the introduction of a free education scheme for the children of those parents who cannot afford to send them to university.  During the recent by-elections, in which I took part, the question of scholarships was mentioned. The point here is that certainly young people get scholarships to go to university but then the question of maintaining them there arises.  In some cases the young people could not take advantage of the scholarships due to this lack of a maintenance or subsistence grant.</P>
      <P>Another subject dear to my heart is the teaching of our national language. Again, I believe the fact that we no longer have a brutal approach to the teaching of the language is directly attributable to the present Minister for Education.  Some of these people who have been critical of that very excellent programme <i>Buntús Cainte</i> should take note&mdash;these critics of miniskirted young ladies giving out our native language in a most beautiful and excellent fashion.  It does not matter to me how Irish is taught.  If Irish is taught through the medium of miniskirts all the better: rather miniskirts than sack-cloth and ashes.  This is another non-brutal approach to the teaching of Irish.  These two pleasant young ladies come on the air for five minutes every evening&mdash;not a long time.  They have met with considerable praise.  Indeed these people who attack the programme purely on the basis of their appearance ought to have their heads examined.  I mean that.  Some of the Minister's Departmental psychologists on examining some of these heads would come up with a lot of support for the theories of Sigmund Freud.  I welcome this <i>Buntús Cainte</i> programme. It has done a lot for the Irish language and I hope it continues as long as it possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Again, we have the question of audio-visual aids.  We must refer to an tAthair Colman Ó hUllacháin and his teanglann or language laboratory at Gormanston.  I visited this language laboratory and it is really magnificent. Now that our only honorary citizen, Chester Beatty, is dead, I suggest the Government might consider honorary citizenship for an tAthair Colman Ó hUllacháin because I believe he is one of the real saviours of our national tongue.  A lot of the credit for what is now happening to our language must go to him and indeed to the Minister for his encouragement and his recognition of the modern method of language teaching.  The Minister also said that he was attempting to get as many of these language aids into as many schools as he possibly could.  This is very encouraging.  These language aids should not be confined to Irish but should be available for French, Spanish and German, and indeed the English language could well be taught through them.</P>
    <P>Might I digress for a moment to the constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown?  At the moment there is a very thorny problem there in relation to the transport of children going to schools over three miles from their homes.  This is a very difficult problem and I do not wish to set the city off against the country or County Dublin off against the rest of the country.  However, I would appeal to the Minister to consider a scheme of State subvention in respect of children in the city and county of Dublin who are going to schools over three miles away from their homes.  Recently I heard of a parent in one part of the constituency, Clonskeagh, who was sending her four daughters to school in Dublin, and, by the way, had been sending them to this schools well before the free education scheme was introduced by the Minister; up to 31st December, 1967, she had been paying bus fares of 30/-, and she now finds the bus fares have increased to £2 13s, arising out of the increases brought about by CIE on 1st January last.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of issuing to schoolgoing children in the city and county of <Col N="612" /> Dublin some sort of pass, or of giving some sort of aid to the parents of such children.</P>
    <P>Let me assure the Minister that this is a real problem.  In Ballybrack, which is near Killiney, there are a lot of young people who have to take two buses to get from Ballybrack to Dún Laoghaire technical school or to Dún Laoghaire Christian Brothers School for all I know.  It is very difficult for the parents of these young children to pay this type of money weekly when the wage earner may be getting only £15 a week.  To have that wage eroded to the extent of £2 to £3 a week is a very real hardship.  I would ask the Minister to keep this point in mind when he is replying on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Last year I pointed out the need for career guidance in our schools.  Many past pupils' unions have been doing a first-class job in this respect.  They have been going back to the schools and telling them in the final year class what job opportunities are available, what their experiences are in relation to their own jobs, and in that way have been doing excellent work.  Again we might look to the Church in this respect.  The Church has a great capacity for sending around trained priests seeking out vocations from the schools.  We are going to have a trained corps of career guidance officers going around the schools of the country telling the children of job opportunities, finding out what their aptitudes are, and so on.  Many children in their final year at school have not got an idea what they want to do.  It would be a great advantage to have these career guidance officers telling them what the job opportunities are and helping them to come to a decision.  I look to the Minister to improve the situation and to help young boys and girls leaving school to find their proper niche in life.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the question of the mentally handicapped and retarded and the increase in accommodation forthcoming.  In this city and county of Dublin, certainly from the letters I receive from my own constituents, there would appear to be a singular lack of accommodation for the slow of learning, for our mentally handicapped children.  However, as the <Col N="613" /> Minister is aware of the situation and has undertaken to do something about it, I am certainly happy to leave it in his hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned a scheme of building grants.  This scheme of building grants was brought into operation by the Government in February of 1964, and it has been of great value in securing additional accommodation in our secondary schools throughout the country.  I would, however, plead with the Minister to do something to alleviate the financial burden on those schools which commenced building just before the scheme was announced.  I realise that when a scheme like this is announced, there has to be a finality, but think it is unfair to penalise a school that began its building programme a day before the scheme was announced.  It is in relation to this that I refer to a rapidly expanding part of the constituency which I represent.  I refer to a community of nuns who were asked by the diocesan authorities in 1963 to build a girls' secondary school.  They, of course, at once bought land, and by the end of 1963, building was well under way.  If they had delayed this undertaking by a couple of months, they would have been eligible for the grant under the scheme announced in February, 1964.  As a result of all this, this convent is £140,000 in debt and bank interest alone runs to about £11,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Let me say in favour of this convent &mdash;and, indeed, I would not advocate their case if they had not entered the free education scheme&mdash;that they were one of the first convents to enter the free education scheme, and that is why I undertook to espouse their cause here in Dáil Éireann.  As I say, they readily opted to go into the free post-primary education scheme, and this meant a drop in their income of £20 a year per pupil, that is, the difference between the school fee and the Department's grant. To help towards relieving the building debt the parents agreed to make a voluntary contribution of £20 a year per pupil, but even with this, it is clear that, having regard to the community's limited resources, they will not be able <Col N="614" /> to defray the £11,000 a year bank interest, not to mention the capital debt of £140,000.  The parents' committee has made a vigorous plea to the Department in support of the community's application for a building grant but, unfortunately, to no avail to date. Sooner or later the Department will have to come to the aid of communities such as this, and I would urge the Minister to make it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, if the Minister could not see his way to give this school the full 70 per cent grant, there are a number of other ways in which he could assist.  He could, for example, reduce slightly the percentage rate of grants for schools which were begun in 1963.  Alternatively, his Department could make a substantial contribution towards payment of the bank interest, by matching £ for £ the community's contribution towards bank interest.  Another way he could help would be for his Department to take over these building debts and get the communities to repay principal as well as interest at a nominal rate over an extended period of years.  I realise that, on administrative grounds and on other grounds, cases can be made against all these proposals, but something will definitely have to be done about schools with this type of problem.  When I have concluded, I will make available to the Minister the facts I put before the House and the name of the community I have in mind.  I will ask the Minister to devise some means of reducing the enormous burden this community has to bear.</P>
    <P>On the question of examinations, our whole educational system should be examined.  Examinations are utilised solely as a means of selection and guidance.  In this sense, they are justified for the purpose of entrance to universities.  We should see if there is any means by which the pupils could be guided rather than selected.  The Minister has eroded the principle of strict adherence to the examination system by the introduction of a record card system in our primary schools in substitution for primary certificate examinations.  This is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> I mention this question of university entrance examinations because some of our more erudite brethren in the Seanad felt there should be more honours subjects in the leaving certificate for entrance to the university.  They are judging people by their own intellectual attainments and by their own intellectual standards.  That is not reasonable.  These people in the Seanad are university professors and so on, and it is not fair to subject children and school-leavers to this type of mental scrutiny.  I would ask the Minister not to erode this principle of two honours subjects in the leaving certificate for entrance to the university.  This is a very important principle.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank the Minister for the magnificent job he has done for education.  He has introduced new developments, new ideas and new excitements, as it were, into the whole educational structure.  He has given the parents of young boys and girls hope, for the first time, that in time they will have secondary or university education. This, I believe, is important and I would ask the Minister to ensure that the hopes of these young parents are realised for their children.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will forgive me for my scattered remarks this evening.  I had intended to prepare comprehensive notes for this debate, but the problems in my constituency seem to be more numerous every week-end and I did not have an opportunity to make notes. I will give the Minister my few thoughts in connection with primary, secondary and university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always held the view that our primary schools are our most important schools because the education, such as it is, that children get in primary schools will govern their entire lives.  If they do not get a good start in the primary schools, they will never catch up in the secondary schools, and they will not be fit to go on to the university.  Since I came into public life, I am sure I have met every national teacher in my constituency. I can say that they are of the highest quality, and they are devoted to their <Col N="616" /> duty.  There is always the odd person in every walk of life.  These people work harder than most other professional people because they do not just teach.  In a rural community a teacher is like a Deputy&mdash;all things to all people.  He fills in forms, hears complaints, arbitrates, gives advice and teaches the children.  He follows their progress to the secondary school and the university.</P>
    <P>That is why I deplore the trend which is developing, of getting rid of the small national schools and lumping them together in a big centre.  That is a step in the wrong direction.  I had an argument with the former Minister when he was about to close four schools in my constituency, and the Minister said that the children would get an urban influence if they went into a big town.  Who wants to give them an urban influence?  The only thing that does for them, as far as I can see, is to make brats of them, and they acquire that soon enough without assistance from us.</P>
    <P>I have theories about the teaching of the Irish language.  I know that members of the Government Party are inclined to put it over in their own paper that they are the only people who are interested in Irish, and that they are the true patriots.  That is all eyewash.  I do not believe there is any Deputy who is not interested in the future of the Irish language, but we all have our own ideas about preserving it.  I have my own views.  I do not believe that very small children should be taught through the medium of Irish. I am glad that on Buntús Cainte, Irish is being taught through the medium of English.  The girl says a sentence in English and then repeats it in Irish, or says it in Irish and repeats it in English. That is not done in some schools where it is all done through the medium of Irish.  I do not think that should be the case where Irish is not the spoken language in the home.  It confuses small children.</P>
    <P>I know from people who deal with mentally handicapped children and disturbed children that if children are inclined to be slow, teaching them two languages confuses them in both.  I had <Col N="617" /> a conversation recently with parents who discovered that their ten-year-old child was not able to read in English but was fluent in Irish, although English was the language of the home. Some children are unable to assimilate more than one language.  In that case the child must have been taught more Irish and not enough English.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>To get back to primary schools, we have excellent primary schools, on the whole, in my constituency, but we will not have good primary schools in ten years time unless we try to attract the best type of teachers to primary teaching. Heretofore that was done, but I do not think we are doing it now.  We are not giving enough inducements.  We should be offering the highest possible salaries.  Every inducement should be offered to trap the cream of those leaving secondary schools into the training colleges.  When they get to the training colleges, they should be given a much better education than they get now. From my own practical experience I know that teachers, who qualified 20 years ago and more, are much better educated than the young people coming out now.  I do not know why that is so. I heard one young teacher say that they go through a crash course and are let out in two years to teach.</P>
    <P>A few nights ago I was at a non-political meeting and I heard three or four young teachers speaking.  I was horrified at the amount of bad grammar used by them.  That is not good enough. The Minister for Health may laugh but if we cannot get our teachers properly educated, how are we to educate our children?  I saw the corrected exercise book of a ten-year-old child who had written a composition on what she did when she went home from school.  She had written: &ldquo;I had my lunch, and I did my lessons at 4 o'clock.&rdquo;  There were two red lines drawn through the word &ldquo;did&rdquo;, and the word &ldquo;done&rdquo; was written over it: &ldquo;I had my lunch and I done my lessons at 4 o'clock.&rdquo; That is not good enough.  No teacher should get through training college and come out and say: &ldquo;I done my lessons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer to this. <Col N="618" /> Perhaps they come from schools where they are taught through the medium of Irish and their English has suffered, but their English must be as good as their Irish if they are to teach young children. I have very strong views on this and I am appalled by the slipshod conditions in which these youngsters seem to come out of training colleges at present.  They are obviously clever children, because the standard is high, but the training they are getting in the colleges is not as good as that given to the teachers who came out 20 years ago.  I am absolutely sure of that.  Perhaps the distractions of present day life have something to do with it.  I do not think people read as much as they did prior to television.  One must read and keep on reading if ever one is to consider oneself educated.</P>
    <P>You will not get the best possible teachers unless you pay them the best possible salaries and give them the best possible schools in which to teach.  We hear a lot nowadays about substandard schools, of which there are plenty, even in my own constituency.  That is not good enough.  It is no use blaming the managers.  The managerial system is a hangover from the British.  I have a good deal of sympathy for the managers who get all the blame, no thanks and no remuneration.  It is time the Department and the managers reached some agreement.  I do not know what can be done.  The clergy will probably feel they would like to have control of the schools but when a school gets into a certain condition, it is said that it is the manager's fault.  The Department should be able to put a finger on it and say: &ldquo;You must have this put right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are two schools closed for repair since last July.  It is not good enough in one small parish to have two schools closed.  Children will miss an entire year's education.  I understand one school is to be opened in the near future but the other does not seem to be in any reasonable state of repair yet.  I am reliably informed by the parents that if these schools are not soon reopened, they need not bother reopening them as the children will <Col N="619" /> have got accommodation elsewhere. That is all I have to say on this.  I did intend to make quite comprehensive notes but I did not get a minute over the week-end.</P>
    <P>On secondary education, it is difficult this year to say what one wants to say because we now have what we call the free scheme.  I do not like the words &ldquo;free scheme&rdquo; because everybody knows the taxpayer must pay for this scheme.  If he has to pay, he should have some rights.  I have some theories about this free scheme.  In theory, it is marvellous, but in practice, it will not work as it is working at the moment.  Obviously, the ideal thing is that every child in the country should have a good education but I do not believe that every child leaving the national schools last year and going into secondary schools was fit for academic secondary education.  I spoke to a teacher last night and asked him how his children got on.  He replied that two of them had gone into the nuns' school and they did not know how to read.  He said it was not his fault because God had not given them sufficient grey matter.</P>
    <P>I believe we must have some sort of screening of children going into secondary schools.  I know that the 11-Plus system in England does not work and that they are thinking of changing to something else.  At the moment every parent's idea and ambition is to get the children into secondary school.  We must educate the parents to realise that the necessity for technical education is just as great as the necessity for secondary education and that a large number of children will not benefit from secondary education but will benefit tremendously from technical education.  I believe&mdash;and this is a terrible thing in this country&mdash; that instead of trying to improve and enlighten our people as to the uses of farming education at rural agricultural schools these schools have been passed over completely and are considered by parents as only fit for those who will not fit into either secondary or technical schools.  Only then do they go to Athenry or some of these places.  That is a terrible pity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> We should make technical schools attractive to them.  We are moving into a technical age and if we do not move quickly enough we shall find ourselves without technicians and we may be in difficulties.  If it were pointed out to children, particularly to those with a flair in that direction, that they will get vast remuneration when properly qualified it should have a good effect. The day is coming fast when technical experts will, I believe, be paid much more than professional people.  If the idea was made attractive to children and their parents more children would go into the technical schools.  I think we are going mad on secondary education while we have fallen terribly behind in farm education.  We have excellent schools but they are not made sufficiently attractive.  There is a sort of feeling generally that the bright child will go to the secondary school, the less bright to the technical school and &ldquo;Johnny who has not got a brain in his head&rdquo; will go to the farming school.  But Johnny must have education and the best possible education because farming will be competitive if he is to stay on the farm.  We need educated farmers if we hope to survive and to get into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Last night in my constituency when I should have been in the House there was a meeting at a place called Coolarne.  The Minister will be well aware of it.  It is just five miles outside Athenry, a small thickly-populated centre in County Galway.  Some three years ago the nuns in the domestic school decided after consultation with various parents that it might be worthwhile to start a secondary school. They made contact with the Department which welcomed them with open arms and said: &ldquo;If you have one accredited teacher and 12 pupils, we will recognise you as a secondary school.&rdquo;  They went into that.  They reconditioned an old school building and renovated it and it is a beautiful school.  I was there last night for the first time.  Now, after three years they have 84 pupils this year and would have had more but for the fact that it is stated that the Department is going to close down Coolarne.  I understand the Minister has given a decision <Col N="621" /> that it must be closed.  I am making an appeal to him at this late stage.</P>
    <P>I went to this meeting at which 300 parents were present.  The children were there; the clergy were there and everybody aired their views but what struck me about the school was that the parents, the children and the teachers were all anxious that it should continue.  The Department does not agree.  But the parents are the people who will be paying for the so-called free education through taxation.  Surely they have a right to say where their children will be educated.  Surely they have a basic right when it comes to the education of their children.  This school teaches 13 subjects.  It has seven excellent qualified teachers, all university graduates and some with honours MA degrees.  It is a co-ed school with 48 girls and 34 boys, and I am assured that if the school is left in Coolarne for the next five years, it will have over 200 pupils.  That is a big thing in a small rural area.</P>
    <P>I know that the Department's idea is to get the children out of the small centres into the big towns.  This is not what the parents want because in this district they go in for a good deal of market gardening and if the children are home from secondary school at 3.30, as they are from Coolarne, they can give a hand on the farm and also get their lessons done.  This keeps their interest in the country and gives the parents a degree of control that they will not have if the children are in town all day and do not know what is going on.  It also keeps them in a rural atmosphere.</P>
    <P>We are talking about saving the West and about sending Departments to the West, but you will not save the West by taking the children out of the country and putting them into a town atmosphere, or by taking them away from their farms.  This is an area in which there are really good farms, I will say that for them.  This particular school is close to Athenry and they get teachers and instructors from the Agricultural Colleges to give lectures to them.  This is providing them with a secondary education with a rural influence, something which is badly <Col N="622" /> the Macra na Tuaithe quiz and won needed in this country.  It is also keeping them at home.  The parents assured me that they do not mind this because they have more supervision over their children when they are going to and coming from school.  Everybody watches children going to and from school and one parent can tell another what her Johnny was doing today on his way to school.</P>
    <P>One parent stood up last night and said that her children were educated before this school was opened and they went to Tuam.  Four of them were going to school for a full term and one of them, a boy, who is also going for the full term, travelled in by bus but he never put a foot in the school for the whole term.  Instead he was hanging around the town.  That could not have happened if he had been going to a rural school.  Another thing about Coolarne school is that it is situated in 200 acres of land.  They have their own playing fields there and on Sunday, they had a hurling match, boys and girls together, and it was well worth watching.  They have a tremendous spirit.  They also have a beautiful science laboratory which they built themselves.</P>
    <P>The arguments advanced in favour of closing the school are (a) children would be transported to school and (b) they would be in an urban atmosphere. As far as the people in charge can ascertain, no provision has been made in Athenry to receive these 100 children and no provision has been made in Tuam either.  The school in Athenry is a small secondary school and there would be no room for them. Last night the parents assured me that they would be quite satisfied if they felt that their children were going to get a better education, better facilities and better chances, but they honestly believe that their children are getting the best education at home and, mark you, I agree with them.  With 84 children and seven qualified teachers, they must be.  So far they have no results to show because they started only three years ago and this is their first year for intermediate certificate.</P>
    <P>However, they have results to show in other directions.  They competed in <Col N="623" /> it; they sent two children to the cookery competitions and won, and they sent children to Athlone for elocution competitions and won there also. They are giving the children a good all-round education there and I do not think the Department has any right to tell the parents where they should send their children to school.  We have gone too far in this country and now we are completely bureaucratic.  The thing that matters now is that the buses run on time.  It would be easier to run buses to Athenry and Tuam.  I do not see why they could not take some of the children from Athenry and put them into this school at Coolarne. What we have to remember and consider are the children and do not let us get away from this.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to criticise the school transport system; it is very new and it was bound to run into teething troubles.  Certainly in my constituency it has run into a fair amount of teething trouble.  I do not know what the answer is; I do not know whether there is an answer.  In one town in my constituency, the girls from the secondary school are out at 3 o'clock and the boys' school closes at 4 o'clock and the technical school finishes at 4.30. The girls are out at 3 o'clock and they have to wait until 4.30 for the bus, and although a room is made available for them, they do not use it but are hanging around the town being a nuisance to everybody and flirting with the handsome young guards and so on. This is not doing them any good.  It is all right for the Minister to laugh but if they were my children, I would drive in and collect them.</P>
    <P>Sending young children to school in towns is not going to do them any good.  They will grow up quick enough and be brats quick enough without our helping them in this way.  I have made a number of representations about these school buses but I do not see how the problem can be solved. I do not think it is good for children to leave home at 8 o'clock in the morning and to return at 5.30 in the evening.  We talk about free education but the parents must provide them <Col N="624" /> with a mid-day meal and that costs money.  I have looked at this problem from every angle and I do not see the answer.  I do not think there is an answer and I will let the Department worry it out.  It should be possible to have the schools closed at the same time, or certainly within a reasonable time of each other, because a difference of 1½ hours is too much.  I am sure that this could be done.</P>
    <P>The Department should also try to get across to the people who run the secondary schools the necessity for channelling children, when they find they are not fit for secondary schools, into technical schools.  At the moment a fearful type of snobbery exists in the country in regard to children going to secondary schools or technical schools. Only last week I was talking to some nuns in a particular convent about the problem of buses and the nuns wanted a bus for their own pupils only.  One of the arguments advanced by the Reverend Mother was: &ldquo;We do not want our children mixing with the children from the technical school.&rdquo;  I told her that those children came out of the same sort of homes and were returning to them, that they should mix now.  We have to break down this type of attitude.  There is this petty snobbery and it is pathetic.  It is being kept up by the secondary schools and this is a tragedy.  The children in the technical schools at the moment are considered inferior to the children in the secondary schools.  It is ludicrous and it will have to be eradicated by the Department.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on this subject.  I had intended to say more because this school in Coolarne is worrying me a lot.  I know that the Minister has made his decision but I hope he will be open to receive a little light.  His predecessor once made a decision and then reversed it for me. I hope that if we get working on him, he may do the same now.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say anything about university education but I think, like Deputy Andrews, that we should not get to the stage that we will make university entrance standards so high that university education will only <Col N="625" /> be for the very brilliant.  I think it was the President of Cork University who recently referred to four honours being necessary for children going to university. I believe that under our secondary educational system as it stands, very few children will obtain four honours in the leaving certificate.  I do not think that is fair.  A great number of children do not realise the necessity for cramming for examinations until it is too late.  They think that if they get the leaving certificate, everything will be grand, but the leaving certificate is not worth the paper it is written on if they do not qualify for something later.  I do not think we should limit them by requiring four honours.</P>
    <P>The entrance standard should be kept reasonably low and as they go up, requirements should get stiffer because the child will then be more adult and will realise the necessity to work.  If he does not realise it then, he never will. Remember many children leave secondary school at 17 years of age.  They do not realise at that age how competitive the world is and the necessity to work and to get four and five honours in the leaving certificate.  I do not agree with the extra ten per cent for doing subjects through Irish because I believe that children coming from a home where English is the spoken language and being taught through Irish get a worse education than the children who are taught through the medium of English.  I realise how important Irish is.  One can argue that we have a cultural heritage.  Very well, we have; but it is equally important for the children to have a good basic knowledge of English and at the moment children in secondary schools in this country have not a good basic knowledge of English.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the merger of the two universities.  This is grand in theory.  It is a very good thing but I feel it would be a tragedy if, in the merger, Trinity lost the niche which it has in this country.  Whether we like it or not, it has a tradition and it would be a loss to this country if we made it synonymous with UCD. It would be a great pity.</P>
    <P>Each year when speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Education, <Col N="626" /> I mention the problem of schools for mentally retarded children and each year the Minister, when replying, throws in a few words and each year we are promised something. This is a big problem in my constituency. The Minister for Health, who is in the House now, knows that the further west you go in this country, the more mentally retarded children there are.  I do not know why, but statistics have proved that.  In my constituency we have quite a number of mentally retarded children.  I believe it is all the intermarriage in the West that has caused it.</P>
    <P>We have two schools for these children.  We have one run by the Brothers in Clarenbridge, an excellent school for mildly mentally retarded boys.  There is another school in Galway for more severely handicapped boys.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to provide a minibus for the Loughrea area to collect our children and take them to the school in Galway which is a day school.  I know that priests and various societies have been on to the Department about this.  We have quite a number of these children in the Loughrea area&mdash;by which I mean the area from Loughrea across into Woodford and Gort&mdash;who could be collected by a minibus and brought into Galway.  Surely we have more of a duty to these children than to our fully capable children?  Surely we have a social duty, a moral duty and every kind of duty to these children who are handicapped and will find life so hard anyway?  I do not see why, if we can produce buses for every normal child in the country, a minibus cannot be provided for mentally retarded children.  I would appeal to the Minister to give consideration to that.</P>
    <P>I have nothing else to say except to remind the Minister for Health to pass on to his colleague, the Minister for Education, my words about Coolarne school because I know this is the last inch.  My main argument is that the parents are the primary educators of the children and as such they have the right to decide where their children will be sent to school and anyway, let us face it, are the parents not the <Col N="627" /> people who will have to pay for the education and surely they have a right to decide how it will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. First of all, I should like to congratulate the last speaker on her excellent speech which was fairly presented and at least she was not critical without indicating some type of remedy for what she regarded as a defect.</P>
      <P>In relation to primary schools, two of the most important aspects of the pupil's life are optical and dental treatment.  There are schools in my area which are fee-paying schools. They charge a very small fee and provide a very good service in so far as the overcrowded conditions that exist in a national school are cushioned off by these schools.  There is also the question of the location of the child. These are factors which urge the parents to send their children to these schools at a very low fee and in some cases no fee at all.  I would urge the Minister to take into consideration extending the optical and dental service to this type of school.  The children could be examined in the national schools.  I believe that this is in the interests of the children and of the educational system.  The child would be qualified when he would enter the school to absorb the education.  I would ask the Minister to make these services available to schools with children in the region of four years to ten years which provide a very useful service.  I feel that most of the pupils would avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the intermediate certificate, I should like to make a few comments. There is no pass for boys unless they qualify in mathematics.  If they pass a number of other subjects, they have no certificate to indicate to an employer that they are up to intermediate certificate standard in these other subjects, although they may be the subjects which are required for the job the child is seeking.  I believe there should be some type of certificate issued to indicate that a child reached <Col N="628" /> intermediate certificate standard in the other subjects.  Some children get a note from the school which is not generally accepted but a certificate from the Department would be appreciated by the children who sometimes are unable to proceed to further education because of family circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the leaving certificate, I believe that honours and pass should be the one paper.  I believe the child, in relation to mathematics, should have the option of doing the pass or the honours.  Last year I believe the honours paper was far simpler than the pass paper and many of the children who failed the pass paper could easily have passed the honours paper.  If this is so, and I believe it is, a child should have the option of doing the honours or the pass paper in a particular subject. I know this is not possible for all subjects.  I can see no reason why both pass and honours questions cannot be embodied in one paper, indicating the questions that should be taken in order to obtain honours and those that should be taken in order to obtain a pass.  This is a very important matter especially when there is so much emphasis on honours in relation to university entrance and, also, the fact that there are commercial firms who look for a certain number of honours when recruiting staff.</P>
    <P>The theses for the MA Degree and the Degree of Master of Economic Science and of Political Science are selected by the students.  In my view, the subject for the theses should be by direction.  This would mean greater benefit to the community.  For instance, students could be directed to write theses on such subjects as the industrial development of the western region, which would involve very comprehensive research, the results of which might be very useful.  Such subjects as the problems of the fifteenth century are chosen as subjects for theses, but current affairs could be examined and the useful matter contained in such theses could be extracted and made available to the Government or others interested in the particular problems.  For instance, soil survey in Carlow, the development of the Burren district in Clare, the provision of small industries in the West <Col N="629" /> are matters that could be selected for theses and the resultant information could be made available and might be of great value.</P>
    <P>Bus fares in Dublin have been referred to by a number of speakers. The Minister should have another look at the situation.  I do not know whether he is aware of the position in Dublin.  I made representations recently in connection with a boy attending the Catholic University School, Leeson Street, who has to pay 2/- for four journeys per day.  CIE will give no reduction unless there is 1s 4d paid in one journey to the school.  This defeats the concessions that are granted.  There are concessions granted of which some children cannot avail.  The boy to whom I refer is 18 years of age and has to pay adult fare.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has already been made that some type of ticket or identity card should be issued that would be acceptable to CIE.  This is a very important matter.  In some cases there is a family tradition of attendance at a school.  There are many children from Ballyfermot and Crumlin attending schools to which their families have a traditional attachment.  A great burden is placed on families.  The facilities that are available are not being properly utilised and the difficulties could be removed if some examination were carried out into the matter.</P>
    <P>In the area which I represent, a workingclass area, there is a problem caused by the fact that a child who attends school up to a certain age has nothing to show at the end of his school period, apart from a printed or typed slip which is not accepted by employers.  If some documents in such cases issued by the Department in such cases indicating that a certain standard had been achieved, that would fill the bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>An Estimate of this kind at this time affords us all an opportunity of reviewing, to some extent, the more important aspects of our education system.  Education is a subject that has given rise since the foundation of the State and, indeed, long before that, to considerable care and attention, not alone on the part of <Col N="630" /> legislators and administrators but on the part of many voluntary bodies, both lay and clerical.  At the present time there is an emphasis on talking about education: education has become the fashionable subject.  It is at this point that we need to take particular care because when a subject becomes fashionable, it is on the way to becoming decadent.  The interest expressed by the fashionable might well amount to something spurious never dreamed of by the persons concerned, parents, teachers or children.</P>
      <P>As I have said, from the inception of the State, the education system and related matters have been the subject of considerable care and attention and great study, perhaps all of it not as comprehensive as it might have been. By and large, our trouble has been that we have been engaging in <i>ad hoc</i> activities.  When a situation arose we chose to deal with it in isolation and thereby lost sight of the effect on the national scene.</P>
      <P>Many of the things that are said in the course of debates on Education Estimates and hailed as new by people reading the newspapers and by those who might have a vested interest in the spoken word of a particular Minister are not new at all.  They are things that have been agitating the minds of many people over the decades and about which these people have spoken but appeared not to have attracted the attention their subject merited because they were not, so to speak, voicing their opinions in the fashionable era in which we now appear to be in relation to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education in this country has made advances.  It has had its difficulties; it has had its failures.  Probably the greatest failure of all in the realm of education here has been the lack of real achievement following concentrated effort to make our language the spoken language of the country.  That being so, stock must be taken urgently in order to ascertain where we went wrong and how the mistakes that were made can be corrected.  I believe that two linguistic plants, as it were, grew together, starting on terms of equality, one being the growth of the sincere <Col N="631" /> band of Irish language enthusiasts who sought to achieve a noble and patriotic aim, and the other, the plant of hypocrisy, which naturally gained strength faster and finally became inter-twined with the patriotic plant.  We have now reached the stage at which the plant hypocrisy has almost choked out of existence the plant of patriotism.</P>
    <P>Anybody who searches his heart or, to use the old-fashioned and well-recorded phrase, looks into his heart, must admit that that is precisely what has happened.  The very fact that this debate, touching, as it does, on the teaching and development of languages, not alone Irish but English, French, German and all the other languages our children have to learn and we ourselves have to practise, is conducted in the main in English, is, I think, adequate proof that in this year, 1968, the patriotic objective has not been achieved. There are, of course, subsidiary reasons: emigration, the growing shortness of travel as between countries that speak different languages, our position particularly between the two great English-speaking nations of the world, Great Britain and the United States of America, and the close association through emigration, either forced or voluntary, that exists between our people and the peoples of these two great countries.  That is, I think, the biggest factor militating against the survival and spread of the Irish language, next to the hypocrisy that is associated with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister came in here with a 26-page script and, faithful to the hypocritical cant, on the first page, there are ten lines in the Irish language.  Admittedly, that is an improvement because last year there were only 8½ lines.  What is said in those ten lines has, of course, no bearing on the proposals contained in the remaining 25 pages and no bearing on any of the propositions laid down in relation to any of the branches of education for which the Minister is responsible.  That is the kind of hypocrisy I am talking about; that is one part of it.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies who come in here and say a few words in Irish; they <Col N="632" /> get their names in Irish in the paper and hope, as a result of that, to rank with the patriots because they engage in this little piece of hypocrisy in relation to the national language.  It is a pity that those who work so hard towards achieving this national objective&mdash;teachers, lay and clerical, writers of all ages who devote their time, their energy and their talents to research and scholarship towards a particular end&mdash;should be treated with such scant regard in this national Assembly of our people.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, and this is true of any subject, you either know the language or you do not.  Being able to say &ldquo;A cháirde Gael&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tá suil agam go ndéanfaidh sibh an rud ceart linn&rdquo;, does not mean that you are an Irish speaker; it means at most that you have learned the little phrase necessary to keep the cant going.  I have no small regard for the present Minister for Education.  I believe he tries to get things done; he has succeeded in getting things done.  But I would have far more regard for him if he left these ten lines and one word out of his speech, calculated, as they are, to give the impression that here is the great bilingual effort.  It is no such thing.  It is cant at the highest level.  It is cant coming from the highest source of educational responsibility.  However, I suppose things will always be like that. In spite of the efforts to curtail it, or knock it, or prevent it, you will always have the person who is prepared to put his hand on his breast and say: &ldquo;I am not like other men; in addition to the tongue of the stranger, I can speak my own tongue as well.&rdquo;  That amounts to nothing more than deceit: to paraphrase the poet, it is identical with the man who talks with one hand on his white shirt front and the other holding a knife behind his back.  Either do it right or forget about it altogether.</P>
    <P>We have in this Estimate this year a repetition of the pattern of earlier years, the division into the different spheres for which the Minister has responsibility in the educational field &mdash;primary, secondary, or post-primary, as it is now called, vocational, which is also post-primary, and university <Col N="633" /> education.  Then there are a few annual compliments paid to the College of Art, the National Theatre, and to those other bodies which get a grant-in-aid and which are always complimented for the manner in which they spend the money.  All to the good, of course.  Praise is very necessary, but searching and careful examination prior to praise is, in my view, vitally necessary.  If one has not got the prior examination and the prior knowledge of the workings of these various establishments, then it would be better to remain silent rather than praise or blame, ignorant of the proper <i>quantum</i> of them.</P>
    <P>In primary education in this country at present we are in a position of extreme difficulty from a financial point of view.  With the ever-decreasing value of money and the higher costs of materials, the progress made in building new schools and repairing decaying or dilapidated schools necessarily must be slow or curtailed to some extent.  We cannot hope to have all that is necessary done in a year, two years, three years or even five years; but during past years, when materials were cheaper and money had a higher purchasing power, the Department of Education under the guidance of successive Ministers were rather slow.  They contented themselves with doing so many jobs each year, with very little regard for priorities.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, we have now reached a situation in which the condition of our primary schools, both from the point of view of room for classes for proper teaching therein and sanitary and recreational facilities, is very bad indeed.  While there are people in this country, in letters to the newspapers and in private talk in pubs and bars, paying tribute to the INTO for their action in relation to the primary schools in a bad state of repair, though one must give them personal credit for doing something some time, one may equally pertinently ask: &ldquo;Why did you not do this long before now?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A great deal of blame, too is to be attached to the parents of schoolgoing children, particularly in rural Ireland <Col N="634" />&mdash;and I speak more of rural Ireland than of anywhere else&mdash;who allowed sanitary conditions to exist which they knew existed and who did not bring them to the notice of the persons responsible for sanitation and cleansing. There is a fair measure of praise due to the INTO now, but an equal measure of blame is due to them and all others concerned for being so late in taking this action, because it is quite clear that when the teachers' services were withdrawn in those schools in County Kerry during the past few weeks, action followed: whoever was responsible for the repairs did them and did them quickly.</P>
    <P>What was possible in 1968 was possible in 1928, 1938, 1948 and in 1958 and, indeed, in each intervening year. For myself, I am particularly happy to see this action taking place, to see services withdrawn and that as a result of the services being withdrawn, action has followed so promptly.</P>
    <P>The next matter that interests me in schools is the pupil-teacher ratio. Indeed, that applies to all schools, primary, post-primary and university. I am glad to see that the number of trained teachers is increasing and that it is hoped the number will increase further in the years ahead.  I wonder does anybody ever pause to think of what the pupil-teacher ratio has been in most of our schools, particularly in the larger centres and until the last two decades in the rural schools of one, two and even three rooms where teachers struggled with large numbers of children of two, maybe three classes in one room, classes numbering 35, 40, may be 45, and these classes made up not of any kind of intelligent segregation or as a result of any kind of screening, but simply on the basis of the children's ages in a particular year in which they started school.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, here and there one heard of a case of a child who did not go from second to third class, from third to fourth or from fourth to fifth, but that would be rare because one could sympathise with a teacher, particularly in a rural area, who did not do that kind of thing in order psychologically to assuage the feelings of the parents of children who might not be <Col N="635" /> so advanced&mdash;who might be retarded by comparison with others&mdash;and they were all jumbled together, of varying degrees of ability, varying degrees of capacity of absorption; and one man or one woman, in a cold draughty school with bad sanitary services and big classes, achieved what was achieved during the years in this country.</P>
    <P>Considering these circumstances, one cannot help but pay tribute to that body of men and women, the national teachers, who not alone ensured that every child, even the most retarded, could at least write his name and do simple arithmetic to enable him to go into the world with some little educational passport, but in addition, side by side with the parents, the teachers and the teachers alone made certain that inculcated in those children were the tenets of their Church.  For all of this&mdash;for the development of the three Rs, for the preservation of the tenets of Christianity and for the development of the children's national feelings and aspirations&mdash;no words of thanks can be loud enough, elaborate enough or adequate enough to pay tribute to the work of the national teachers of this country.</P>
    <P>Mind you, they did all that on the minimum of training and I am disappointed that in addition to the reference in his speech here yesterday to the increase in the number of teachers, the Minister did not say anything about the oft-advanced proposal to lengthen the time of training and to broaden the education generally of the trainee teachers during that time.  The principal of St. Patrick's College, Reverend Fr. Cregan, suggested it about a year ago; and as everybody appears to be praising the Minister for Education at the present time, I shall praise myself because I suggested it in my maiden speech on education in this House in 1955, 13 years ago.  Since then, nothing has happened in that respect.</P>
    <P>As I said then, and as I think now&mdash; and many educationists agree with me&mdash;the mechanics of teaching should be and must be done in the training colleges with all the modern aids that <Col N="636" /> can be given to them.  At the same time, during an extended period of training, the people attending those colleges should be attending university courses and proceeding to a degree. Having got that degree, I would then think the system which we advocate in the Fine Gael policy on education should be followed, that teachers should be able to move freely from primary schools to secondary schools and vocational schools, teaching classes suited to their own educational qualifications. In that way you would have better teachers, men and women with broader and more liberal minds.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to what was happening in the educational field before the introduction of the preparatory college system.  Then you had teachers admittedly who only had the two years training in St. Patrick's College or somewhere else, but they had the great advantage of doing apprenticeship as monitors or monitoresses with already good people in the local schools in their areas.  Anybody sufficiently old will remember the old style of teacher who was a man of tremendous parts and who is referred to in Goldsmith's poem <i>The Deserted Village.</i></P>
    <P>I remember these men and women who were pillars of society in their areas.  They commanded the respect not alone of the children who attended their school but of the parents of those children.  They were men and women of power.  They had the stamp of culture. Their learning was of the broadest possible kind in the period of training allowed to them and their reading was deep.  In those days, in addition to what is being taught now, you had rural science, Latin and Greek roots and all those extra things that tend to make man a fuller man.  Then came the system, the abolition of which I also advocated in 1955, and which is now gone, by which the boys and girls who came to a specific secondary school&mdash;call it a preparatory college&mdash;and mingled with the same kind of people, who moved from there to the training college, the same sort of herd from one type of grass to another, and having left that, went back to the <Col N="637" /> various parts of their own countryside, gained nothing in that journey from having the initial examination to the final training college.  Now that that has been abolished and there is more of a competitive spirit, the necessity for extending the training college period becomes more vital, so as to get back again the type of teacher we at one time had in this country, teachers with the stamp of culture who not alone commanded but deserved respect from the whole of the community.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the vast majority of teachers are now tending towards the professional, whereas in my view a vocation is more important in the selection of teachers.  It certainly is equally as important as it might be in any other walk of life where the term vocation is used.  A teacher's life, particularly a teacher who is dedicated to the teaching of little tots right through to the end of the primary stage, is a life of great courage and great dedication.  It is a hard life and is a tremendous drain on the physical and mental capacity of that man or woman.  It is for that reason that it always makes me a little sad to find this group, primary, secondary or anything else, involved in the quarrel about either increased pay or parity of pay.  I know that the State finances and the State resources are limited, but I also know that in the matter of priorities, the people who teach our children at any level should never be made the subject matter of trade disputes.</P>
    <P>It should be the business of a vigilant Minister and an equally vigilant set of advisers to anticipate trouble of that kind and to make provision for it because it is bad for the teachers, it is bad for the pupils and it is bad for the whole of the community in which it takes place.  I may be seeking after a Utopian kind of country or a Utopian kind of society.  I do not think so.  If we could get even one-tenth of the way every year towards what I am advocating, I am satisfied that this country would then be well on the way towards a good educational foundation and a good educational basis for advancement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> We have now the situation, in the selection of teachers, particularly primary teachers, in which they can be recruited from secondary schools.  More and more important then becomes the question of career guidance.  I do not think it should be left to any boy or girl to have to decide for himself or herself.  There should be attention paid to this question of career guidance, of course keeping an eye on the particular boy's or girl's capacity to follow a particular career, but if career guidance is established in each school in the way in which it should be done, then I feel you will get the proper recruits.  There will be fallings-off but it is only in that kind of man to man talk at career guidance level that it is possible to get the kind of recruit, either boy or girl, who will make the best teacher and be the dedicated and courageous type of boy or girl, subsequently man or woman, the teaching profession needs at all times.  There can be no gaps.  You cannot have a bad crop this year and a good one next year, followed by two good crops and several other bad crops.  This is an area where the screening must be done with great care, not alone every year but every day and every week and every month during every year, so that the material for this teacher-producing machine will be of excellent character.</P>

    <Title>Private Members Business. - Planning Appeals Bill, 1967: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I rose with some reluctance to intervene in this debate on the proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Party that planning appeals should be determined by an independent authority other than the Minister.  I did so as one who deals extensively with people who find themselves in some difficulty with their local planning authority.  I do not know whether this is peculiar to Galway <Col N="639" /> but certainly we have had growing-pains in the introduction of planning in the County Galway area.  People who have run into difficulties have not always been able to proceed with their plans.  Naturally, they turn to their local representative for his support in trying to get the necessary permission. They would ask him to see what objections there are and whether the objections can be overcome.  They would ask him to see whether there is any possible way in which the development could be allowed and thus meeting the objections that are put forward in certain cases.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that Fine Gael's intention in putting down this Bill has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with trying to provide a better or a more efficient or even a fairer system of dealing with appeals.  I am now firmly of the opinion that it is their sole intention, in introducing this Bill, to use it as a platform from which they can launch all the usual abuse, falsehood, and every type of rumour they can possibly think up and throw at the Government.  They do this quite often. They were doing it long before I became a Member of this House.  They continue to do it in the hope that, if they throw enough mud, some of it will stick and that somewhere, some place down the country, somebody will read only their side of the story and accept that as the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a firm believer in Fianna Fáil and in all that this Government are doing, I feel an obligation to stand up here and, in whatever way I can, to try to expose what I see Fine Gael doing. It is a very poor reflection on Irish politics that, in this day and age, this method is still employed by the major Opposition Party.  They are doing a great disservice to Irish politics.  One cannot understand how it is that they have not yet realised that only they themselves are suffering from the methods they are adopting and that none of it is rubbing off on the Government.  After 36 years, during six of which they had an opportunity themselves and for 30 of which this Party have been returned by the people as a Government, surely it should be sufficient <Col N="640" /> proof to Fine Gael that the Irish people do not like dishonesty, do not like falsehood and will not stand for rumour-mongering: it has not been our nature.  The result of it has been seen in the manner in which Fine Gael have continually been rejected at the polls.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a good Fine Gael Party.  I should like to see a good Opposition.  It distresses me to think that this is what we have as an Opposition. This is doing no service to the Irish people, to the Irish nation, and it is doing no service to those of us who come here to devote our lives to politics.  I think the Irish people can be saved from ever having Fine Gael in government but that concerns the will of the people and we are prepared to accept it.  We know what the will of the people has been up to this.  We see how Fine Gael are carrying on.  I cannot foresee any great change in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I will go even so far as to say that if Fine Gael had seriously thought there was any possible chance that this Bill would pass, they would never have brought it into this House.  They would never have introduced it in such circumstances because they know, from their dealings with people, that the system that operates at the moment is the only system that can operate fairly.  The majority of them, the backbenchers certainly, would be the last people to want to hand over the deciding of planning appeals to a judicial body&mdash;one suggestion was to have a judge decide planning appeals. In the first place, they are not qualified for that kind of work at all.  In the second place, we know that whatever delays there are at the moment&mdash; despite the expeditious manner in which the Department are trying to deal with the large number of appeals; and I know this and I know that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have often spent long hours into the morning trying to clear planning appeals &mdash; in the light of the hours judges work, we know how long it would take for planning appeals to be decided.  They are coming through now in from three to six or seven months: some may take longer than that.  However, with a judge deciding <Col N="641" /> appeals on the basis of a few hours work a day, people would have to wait years to discover whether or not they might add a room to their home or build a factory which would provide employment, or build a hotel which would help to develop the economy of an area.</P>
    <P>This whole question is tied up too much with the development of the economic life of our people and the matter must be left in the hands of those who are elected by the people to be dealt with by them.  If there are any complaints to be made about the manner in which planning appeals are being decided, then the Dáil is here and the challenge can be laid down in the Dáil.  We have the Parliamentary Question.  If we go back through the list of Parliamentary Questions put down in the past two years, we shall find that there were very few queries about decisions given in planning appeals.  If great concern is felt by Fine Gael, where is the proof of it?  Where is the proof of misuse of power by the Minister in deciding appeals?  How many times have they challenged this decision in Parliamentary Questions?  How many times have they used their democratic rights here as representatives in this House?  I would safely say that I put more questions down regarding planning appeals than the majority of the Members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There is no proof of any need for this measure at all and I firmly believe it is put down purely as a gimmick, purely to launch untruths and falsehoods and every type of mud they can sling, in the hope that some of it will stick.  That is their dying wish.  Where are the facts and where is the proof? Lay them on the Table of the House. Use the instruments of this House.  It is an abuse of their privilege to put down Bills like this to use for this type of purpose.</P>
    <P>The idea of having a judge as a member of an appeal board may be very suitable in one way to Fine Gael. It would of course be another way of helping to make fatter the wallets and the bank accounts of their members in the legal profession.  They twist into <Col N="642" /> everything.  They opposed the Occupational Injuries Bill for the same reason. They want everything to be decided in this country by the legal profession and we only have to look at their own Front Bench to see that.  They come in here in the evening when a lot of the work of this House is done, having ensured that their own private profession comes first and the country comes second.  You will never get some of the senior counsel members in the Fine Gael benches making a speech here at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in the morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am illustrating how attractive it seems to them to have a judge.  They could benefit, for one reason; they could help to fatten their pocket books by creating their own costly legal appeals.  One only has to see in the Planning Act that there is compensation for anybody who feels that a decision of the planning authority or any part of the plan for the county area affects their property, its value or can affect their business.  If it does, there is a clause which says they have a right to apply for compensation.</P>
      <P>One has only to look back and see how many applications for compensation have been lodged.  Very few, because the ordinary person just cannot afford this costly legal process which is involved in going through an application for compensation.  The only cases I heard of are cases of very large business firms who can afford it as a business expense.  But it is no use to Johnny or Mary down in the West who see that it is no good being offered the £500 they were offered a few years ago for a building site when the Planning Authority come along later and forbid any building on that land. There is no use in these people consoling themselves with the fact that there is a clause in the Bill which allows them to apply for compensation. They do not want to go near judges or courts; they cannot afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deal with quite a lot of planning appeals.  Each week they run from three to six at least.  Even today I had <Col N="643" /> to deal with three separate planning appeals.  This naturally causes me some inconvenience but I am certainly going to put up with any inconvenience it causes me as a Deputy, as long as I can ensure that the ordinary individual gets a fair crack of the whip, and he is getting a fair crack of the whip now in the method of appeal which is used at the present time under this Bill.</P>
    <P>No Fine Gael or Labour Members&mdash; who have also opposed this system and have made speeches here with great innuendo of all sorts of corruption&mdash; will admit that what I am about to say is true.  When a member of the public comes to a local representative, the first question you ask him is not what political Party he belongs to.  If he is a member of the community&mdash;if he is a constituent of mine anyway&mdash;I will go out of my way to ensure that anything I can do for that man will be done for him.  On numerous occasions I have made representations for members of the Fine Gael Party, and supporters of the Fine Gael Party, equal to the efforts I have made for members of my own Party, and this is true of all Fianna Fáil Deputies, and what Fine Gael think they are doing in putting down this Bill I do not know because the same facilities should apply for everybody.  If they have any great grouse, it has not been generally evident over the past two years and they have not used the proper means to question these matters.</P>

      <P>There is another matter which some members of the Fine Gael Party referred to.  I have heard it said on platforms that the Minister should not alter the decision of the planning authority.  If this is so, surely they must agree that the elected members should not have the power to alter the decision of the manager which is the same as the local authority, but they will not say why.  They make a half-statement, and hope in doing this that the poor innocent people, which is what they think everybody is, will think there is something wrong with the manner in which these things are being dealt with.</P>
      <P>In Galway recently along a certain road two acres were required to build a house.  People applied and were turned down because they could not acquire land to meet the regulations. They were turned down on appeal because the Minister had to uphold the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has to agree with the plan laid down by the local authority especially where such a plan has been adopted.  This case was on appeal at the time of the change to one acre and the Minister was informed that the council no longer required two acres so he granted the appeal on the <Col N="645" /> one acre.  What Fine Gael are saying is they want to make that man go to the trouble of making a completely fresh application and waiting another two months before he gets permission.</P>
      <P>Quite recently in my own area a certain gentleman&mdash;he was a foreigner, a Mr. Prager&mdash;applied to Galway County Council for planning permission to build a holiday home in Roundstone. This man was refused permission by Galway County Council so he took the only course open to him: he appealed his case to the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister in deciding the appeal decided in favour of the applicant and outline permission was granted on certain conditions.  For some extraordinary reason or other, a great furore broke out in one of our Irish national newspapers.  The Fine Gael bright boys at the Galway end of the stick thought this was a good thing to latch on to&mdash;anything to embarrass a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government. So they drummed up as much agitation and disturbance as they could and shouted loudly and loudly, and it began to stick, which is part of their policy.</P>
      <P>I have seen articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> about this matter, questioning the Minister's right to give this man permission. Furthermore, I attended a meeting in Roundstone village last Sunday evening. It was a wet and windy day and a long way from my home.  I decided I would get to the bottom of this.  I arrived in a packed hall where there were a lot of people at the top of a table, a certain number of whom were prominent Fine Gael people.  They were stating that everybody in the area was completely opposed to this man getting planning permission.  They were asking the local representatives there to seek to support all of their colleagues to oppose this outline permission which the Minister had granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated when asked that I could not give any opinion because I did not know where the site was.  The chairman of this meeting, the man loudest in his condemnation of the Minister's action, said he would bring me to the site and show me.  I was brought to a site where there was one huge rock on the side of the road and a large <Col N="646" /> field dipping away off down into a hollow.  The man said: &ldquo;I think this is where he is building the house.&rdquo;  I said to him: &ldquo;Are you telling me you do not know where this house is to be sited on this piece of land?&rdquo;&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; he said.  If it was up on the rock, there was something in it. It might have interfered with the view if you were in the top storey of a double-decker bus.  But down in the hollow it interfered with no view.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave his outline permission on condition that the house is built in accordance with the surroundings and that it would not interfere with the view.  It would not interfere with the view down in the hollow. But here was an effort to frighten this foreigner out of this place.  The people who were doing all the shouting did not know where the house was to be built on the site.  The <i>Irish Times</i> published a photograph which was most misleading.  It did not show the full site and it did not show the exact location of the house.  Not alone did they publish it once but they published it twice.  As well as that, &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; from Telefís Éireann were down in Roundstone last Sunday and one of their commentators, a Mr. Patrick Gallagher, was down in Roundstone 50 miles beyond Galway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It now transpires that the <i>Irish Times</i> are going to influence whether or not a man gets planning permission.  I would like to question their right to force their opinions on the people of <Col N="647" /> this country.  Every national newspaper, be it daily or otherwise, has the full right under our Constitution to express its opinion, but it has not got the right to try to force its opinion down the throats of the people as being the only opinion that is right.  I say this because it has further transpired that a certain employee of the <i>Irish Times</i> has a personal interest in whether or not this house is built down in Roundstone.  You can talk about influencing the Minister's decision but a paper can influence a lot of people's decisions by printing one side of a story.</P>
    <P>I spoke quite a lot at that meeting. The meeting was reported in Monday's <i>Irish Times</i> but not one word of what I said appeared in Monday's paper.  I know now why not.  Where a national newspaper stoops so low as to use its own privileged position as a newspaper in a country to influence a particular decision because one of its own employees could be favoured by this decision&mdash;Well!  how low can you go? That is all I say.  I am all for the present system of dealing with planning appeals.  The <i>Irish Times</i> or any other paper will not dictate to the Irish people.  We have here legitimately elected public representatives.  If there is anything to be discussed that is considered wrong, it can be brought out in this House by Parliamentary Question or otherwise.  I regret that this type of method is used.</P>
    <P>I fully oppose this lame duck effort on the part of Fine Gael to provide themselves with another platform to launch falsehoods and untruths upon a Party that has despite all this opposition stood by its guns.  The people have stood by it.  The Government and the Deputies behind it have worked hard and well and will continue to do so as long as we are privileged to be elected here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick in introducing this Bill indicated in considerable detail the reasons which compelled us to draft a measure of this character and introduce it to the House. The position is that under a number of statutes which have been passed here <Col N="648" /> over the years, certain defined functions are withdrawn from the discretion of a Minister and of the Government and handed over to an independent body of persons appointed in various ways. Particular tribunals which come to mind are the operation of the Land Commission in respect of the selection and allocation of land to tenants, the Special Commissioners in respect of income tax and, more recently, under the Redundancy Payments Act, a redundancy tribunal has been provided for and was recently established.  Outside these bodies, the case of grants to industry is decided by an independent body&mdash;although appointed by the Minister or by the Government, nevertheless, independent of the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>It has been said in the course of this debate that certain work that is involved in planning decisions may mean the establishment or non-establishment of a factory, with a sort of gloss put on it that if a tribunal were deciding it, it would decide against it; in the much more frequent case where the establishment of an industry depends on a State grant and where the approval for the proposal has, first of all, to be sanctioned by a statutory body, this decision has been expressly handed over to it by an Act of this House originally passed when we introduced many years ago the Industrial Development Authority, and since amended by Fianna Fáil Ministers, which body continues to exercise responsibility for deciding in what cases and where industries will be established and to whom grants will be paid.</P>
      <P>These tribunals were established because it was recognised that the important thing in issuing decisions in cases of the type we have mentioned in the course of this debate is always to ensure not merely that justice is done but that it is also seen to be done. Many years ago, in a number of cases, the ones to which I have referred and more recently those relating to industrial development, this House established independent tribunals to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning, as we know it, is in this country a relatively new matter in the <Col N="649" /> extent to which it now affects local authorities.  Admittedly there was a Planning Act in being since the early thirties, but 25, 30 or 50 years ago planning permission and planning arrangements, in the main, depended on whether facilities were available, and if the essential services were there it did not matter what character the development took; nobody objected and no controls were exercised in respect of it.  In all the earlier years the original Planning Act lay virtually dormant, either because of the intervention of the war or because in some cases the operation of the Act was found not to be in accordance with the statute as originally laid down.</P>
    <P>In recent times&mdash;and this, of course, applies more especially to urban areas, though there are certain cases where major planning decisions may be concerned with rural problems as well&mdash; when the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, was going through the Oireachtas, Deputy Jones, on behalf of this Party, proposed that there should be an appeals tribunal of some sort.  It is of interest that when the original Redundancy Payments Bill was introduced here there was no provision in it for an appeals tribunal, and as a result of an amendment brought forward by Deputy Jones on behalf of this Party, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Dr. Hillery, accepted the proposal and a redundancy tribunal has been established.</P>
    <P>We all know that modern planning is very complex and that there is a wide variety of matters to be dealt with.  It is an undoubted fact that planning decisions can, particularly in urban areas, inflate or deflate, according as approval may be given or modified or refused, the value of property. Anyone who has any responsibility for planning or who is in contact with the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council or Dún Laoghaire Corporation is aware of cases in which the planning authority decides in a particular way and, on appeal, the Minister either reversed the decision or modified it or confirmed it.  What we want to establish is that, where a decision is reached, and particularly where the planning authority recommend <Col N="650" /> in a particular way, when a contrary decision is reached, the reasons for that decision will be published and made clear.</P>
    <P>Our scheme of arrangements does not envisage&mdash;and Deputies know it does not envisage&mdash;any kind of expensive procedure.  No one is suggesting that the procedure which will be adopted under the Redundancy Payments tribunal or the procedure which the Special Commissioners for Income Tax operate involves great expense. The procedure in respect of the Land Commission is there for the simple reason that where the question of title arises almost invariably the applicant is represented by a solicitor or by a solicitor and counsel.  That is when complex questions of title arise, and any applicant who had regard to the value of his property and the importance of his interest would appreciate and understand that it was essential to have competent advice on it.  However, so far as this is concerned, we envisage a speedy, inexpensive, impartial tribunal not composed of lawyers but composed of a judge as chairman and assessors appointed in the way in which the Bill provides, one selected by the Minister and one selected by the Local Appointments Commissioners, who will give technical advice on the matters concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious to anyone who has experience that at present, certainly in the larger centres, in Dublin &mdash;indeed, I believe in most local authorities, but the Dublin area is the most complex&mdash;the planning staff is inadequate to deal with these matters with reasonable speed, and most people who have contact with it appreciate how greatly overworked the planning officer and all his staff in Dublin are.  The great bulk of these matters would be no problem; they would go through automatically in the same way as those in which people apply to Government offices for licences of one kind or another.  Anyone who applies to build a house with the necessary services would get automatic approval.  However, concern is felt and has been expressed at cases where decisions taken by the planning authority have been reversed on appeal <Col N="651" /> by the Minister or have been altered.</P>
    <P>I can give some examples without mentioning areas or individuals or anything else: an area of ground is passed by the planning authority for a particular housing density.  Subsequently the appeal is taken to the Minister and a much greater density is allowed. There may be valid reasons for this, but surely the public are entitled to be told.  It is suggested that Parliamentary Questions can get the answer.  Parliamentary Questions can get the answer that the Minister decided the appeal this way, and he is not obliged to give any reason to the House or to anyone else.</P>
    <P>When property is purchased, the planning authority, with the technical experts they have available to them, examine it and inspect the site and decide that a particular density of houses is appropriate for that area, and subsequently on appeal, the Minister, possibly on the advice of his technical advisers, may change that decision. Here again, we talk about decentralisation and devolution but one of the most frustrating things for any local authority is to find one set of officials making one recommendation in respect of a particular project, and a separate set in the Custom House making a contrary recommendation.  On appeal to the Minister, the value of the property can be greatly inflated, or the reverse. Properties and sites are purchased in the belief that they will be approved for a particular line of development, whether it is a factory, a hotel, a housing scheme or a petrol station.  Undoubtedly most people nowadays will not purchase properties unless they expect to get approval.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case in my own constituency where at the junction of two roads there was a petrol filling station already established which had access to both roads.  Although the residents objected and the local authority refused permission, on appeal, permission was granted to build another petrol station.  Justification for decisions of that character is not obvious.  We believe that this problem is complex.  A number of major decisions have to be reached.  There are <Col N="652" /> the ordinary run-of-the-mill decisions which can be decided on the simple form of application.  In a few cases an issue might arise and an oral hearing would be a simple and speedy matter.  Many applications are made by the applicant in person to the district court, or to Government Departments, and the formal issue of a certificate or an authority, as the case may be, is a completely simple matter. The procedure is laid down.  An application form is provided.  Under the Planning and Development Act, many major questions are involved, large-scale developments of one kind or another involving very considerable sums of money in the sense that the site value for the proposed capital development can be greatly inflated or deflated depending on the decision.</P>
    <P>We believe it is essential for these cases that an independent authority should be established.  If anyone can suggest a more expeditious type of tribunal, or categories of technical or specialised advice, other than those provided in the Bill, we are not wedded to the actual form in the Bill and we are not convinced that it might not be possible to improve it. At the moment no matter what decision the planning authorities give, the Minister has absolute power to over-rule them.  We believe that this tribunal should be established.  There is a clause in the Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>Any person who has made an objection to the granting of a permission, approval or licence or who, not having made such objection, applies to the Board to become a party and who, in the opinion of the Board, has a genuine interest in the appeal...</P>
    <P>will be entitled to be heard.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that there is no demand for this.  At the annual conference of the Municipal Authorities of Ireland last year, this resolution was passed unanimously:</P>
    <P>That the Minister for Local Government be asked to amend the Planning and Development Act, 1963, so as to provide that planning appeals should be heard by the judiciary instead of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> We have not gone so far.  We believe these are matters which could appropriately be heard by some form of independent tribunal.  Unless the tribunal is appointed directly under the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission, the appointment of a judge as chairman is generally acceptable.  His tenure of office is fixed and he would have the advantage of technical or specialised advice which would be available from assessors appointed in the manner which we suggest in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe there is sufficient public concern and that there are sufficient precedents under the Acts and the procedures I have mentioned to establish such a tribunal.  Its method of operation would enable these matters to be dealt with expeditiously and would clearly indicate the high standards laid down in respect of a number of public matters in which any Government or any Minister might be open to pressure and where the Minister is not obliged to give any reason for any decision which is absolutely at his discretion.</P>
    <P>Nowadays with the complexity of modern developments, it is essential, if progress is to be made in housing and roads and other schemes, as well as in industrial development, that planning control should be exercised and decisions made in relation to a variety of problems, which in the past rarely concerned the local authorities or concerned them only to a limited degree. That situation no longer obtains and it is essential that the public should be satisfied that not merely is justice being done but that it is seen to be done.  We believe that is an important principle.</P>
    <P>I need not elaborate on or repeat the facts and figures put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  A great many planning appeals are of a routine nature.  It is possible that as time goes on a number of them will cease to be problems for Government Departments. It is the case at present with so many planning authorities in existence and with different systems operating that there is a lack of uniformity in many of these matters, certainly so far as the major urban areas are concerned.  The need for the <Col N="654" /> establishment of some independent and impartial tribunal is, we believe, publicly recognised and because of that, we urge the House to accept this Bill or, if the House sees fit, to modify it in any way in which it can be improved.  We would be prepared to accept that but we believe there is a need to divorce a political Minister from decisions of this nature, just as Ministers have been divorced from decisions in respect of industrial grants, Land Commission proceedings, income tax and taxation appeals generally.  In each of these cases, the Minister has been divorced from decisions by express act of the Oireachtas and we believe a similar decision should be taken here and this form of Bill commends itself to us as a method of achieving the objectives we have in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Fine Gael published this Bill, they should have asked themselves: what is the purpose of the Planning Act of 1963? This is to make provision for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas including urban and rural districts, to make provision for the improvement of amenities and to make certain provision for land acquisition.  This Bill is in direct conflict with the purpose of the Planning Act.  I say there is not so much concern throughout the country regarding decisions on appeals as there is regarding the operation of the Planning Act in general and the reason for the concern about the operation of the Act is that there is so much development taking place at present In most counties you have large-scale developments being initiated and taking place.  Particularly in the great scenic areas, there is great demand for building sites for holiday homes and for people who would like to come and live in our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the fundamental principles in the Planning Act, and one very important matter in regard to this Act, is that there are so many sections in it and so many decisions to be taken in the operation of the Act, which are reserved functions of the local authority; in other words, the local representatives have such a big say in the <Col N="655" /> development of the future pattern of the economy in their own areas.  It is not right when local representatives, who are politicians, have such a say in this development that the Fine Gael Party should find fault with the manner in which planning appeals are dealt with just because the final decision is taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think Fine Gael had not studied the Act properly before drafting the Bill because Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the Act provides that any question which arises as to whether development is exempt or not should be referred to the Minister for a decision in the case of a dispute, and then he goes on to say that it is proposed to bring these decisions within the ambit of the proposed appeals board.  In section 5 (2) of the Act, there is provision for an appeal by an aggrieved person against the decision of the Minister to the High Court so that the Minister has not the final say on the question of whether a development is exempt or not from the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>We hear much talk about the Minister having so much work to do and being overburdened with responsibilities and also much talk about the number of planning appeals.  During the year ended 30th September, 1965, 979 planning appeals were submitted. In the following year, the figure was 1,125 and in the next year, 1,322.  But what about the officials of the planning authorities?  What about the county managers of the planning authorities who receive approximately 1,000 applications a month in the normal daily operation of the Planning Act? Consideration of these appeals is an executive and, therefore, a managerial function, and the managers have to make decisions on the recommendations and advice of their planning officers and county engineers.  Also, these managers have to carry out other duties relating to housing, health, assistance and many other services operated by local authorities.  We hear nothing regarding the taking of decisions on planning applications even though approximately the same number of applications are being received <Col N="656" /> and considered annually by some local planning authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest problems is that local planning officers do not discuss planning applications with applicants. If you had more liaison between planning officers and the public, you would not have so many appeals.  Many planning applications are rejected for trivial reasons and it is ridiculous that an applicant for planning permission should be forced to appeal to the Minister just because there is a dispute between himself and the planning officer as to the number of feet he should keep back from the public road or boundary, or something like that.  I say these things merely to point out to the Opposition that it is not necessary to have an appeals board to consider all these appeals.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition speakers referred to the Lay Commissioners and the Land Commission, to the appeals officers in the Department of Social Welfare and to the Appeals Tribunal provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act, but the Lay Commissioners deal entirely and solely with land acquisition and subdivision; the appeals officer in the Department of Social Welfare deals entirely with applications for services and works within well-defined regulations and is confined entirely to social welfare. Similarly, the Appeals Tribunal under the Redundancy Act will be confined to matters under that Act, but the position is entirely different in regard to planning because planning concerns so many different Departments and even different sections of Departments.  It would be impossible for a judge and two officials constituting such a board as is proposed by the Opposition to co-ordinate the activities of all these Departments and at the same time, ascertain and have a thorough knowledge of Government policy in various Departments, such as the Department of Lands, Transport and Power and Local Government.  Many of these planning appeals will have to be considered from the point of view of tourism and discussions may have to take place with forestry officials.  Many of these appeals could receive the attention of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Again, the Department of Local Government must take cognisance of whether water and sewerage services will be provided within a reasonable time in a certain area or on a certain site.  For this reason, I believe it would be impossible for a judge, or a board such as the one now proposed, to have a thorough knowledge of the policies of the various Departments.  I could see no hope of co-ordination but only confusion as a result of the setting up of this board.  I do not agree that a judge should be chairman because these appeals relate to planning matters, to development matters and to matters relating to services for which expenditure is involved.  Judges should confine themselves to judicial questions merely.  I think it was Deputy Molloy who mentioned that the public would be very slow to appeal to a board whose chairman was a judge without engaging the services of a solicitor and counsel.  If such a board is set up, no person would dream of appealing if he thought a final decision would be taken by a judge, or that he would influence the decision, without engaging a solicitor and counsel.  This would impose extra costs on the applicants, even for small developments such as houses, and it would prevent people from appealing and exercising a right to which they are legally entitled.</P>
    <P>Some of the Opposition speakers stated that the Minister has not given reasons for granting permission.  I cannot see why it should be necessary to give reasons for granting permission. It is provided in the Act that reasons must be given for the refusal of planning permission.  That is reasonable and fair, but I cannot see why reasons should be given for the granting of permission because it should be assumed that permission is granted because the person who granted it thinks the applicant is entitled to get permission.  For instance, an applicant for a medical card whose application is granted is not told why the application is granted.  Neither is an applicant for a housing grant informed why his grant is awarded; neither is an applicant for a loan told why his application has <Col N="658" /> been granted.  They are told why their applications are refused.  I suppose we all know that too well.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is that a planning authority, when considering an application for planning permission, is restricted&mdash;as is the Minister when he is considering an appeal&mdash;to the question of considering the proper planning and development of the area in question.  Having regard to all the thought, the work and the investigations which went into the initial operations of the Planning Act, it would now be virtually impossible for any appeal board to bring themselves up to date with the proper planning and development requirements of the various areas. The Department of Local Government have gone to a considerable amount of expense in providing courses and seminars for planners and local engineers who are engaged in the operation of the Planning Act and it would not be right that all this work should now be cast aside and the responsibility for appeals handed over to a judge who would have no experience whatever of planning and to officials who would have to be initiated into the planning law and regulations and into what the local representatives, whose responsibility it is to prepare the local plans, have in mind.</P>
    <P>I believe that there are too many planning authorities at the moment. There are 87, and I should like to see the stage reached when all the plans would be prepared by regional planning boards who, from their establishment onwards, would consider planning applications in their own areas. With a certain amount of liaison with the public, it would considerably reduce the number of planning appeals. It has been stated by the Opposition that it is not fair to the public, or to the Minister, to have the Minister decide all planning appeals where land acquisition is concerned, where values can change as a result of such decisions. I should like to refer to the confirmation of compulsory acquisition orders under the Housing Acts and to the confirmation of compulsory orders under the Sanitary Services Acts.  This is a far more serious and more onerous responsibility than the determination of <Col N="659" /> planning appeals, where a man's land is taken from him.  We hear no mention of a special board or tribunal to confirm or refuse compulsory purchase orders in respect of the acquisition of lands.</P>
    <P>In addition, a Minister determines appeals relating to superannuation and to conditions of employment of local authority officials.  As well as that, other appeals are determined by a Minister in cases where land is concerned, which could change the value of land and where personal property is concerned, where a decision could either make or break a person.  I do not see why, therefore, the Fine Gael Party should pick on the Planning Act for a special appeals board.  They may derive a certain amount of propaganda as a result but I do not think it will do them any good in the long run.  I feel it should not take a judge to decide whether it is necessary to have a proper sewerage scheme for the development of three or four housing sites or whether each house could be served by a septic tank. As well as that, an appeals board would be an authority without any responsibility whatsoever.  For that reason I do not agree at all with this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I am speaking on this, I shall mention something which comes within the ambit of this debate.  There is an attitude being adopted by planning authorities and by public representatives who do not wish to take an unpopular decision themselves to refuse the application and say: &ldquo;We will let it go to the Minister and we will let the Minister do the unpopular thing.&rdquo;  If planning authorities were more manly and faced up to their responsibilities, we would have few planning appeals and would not have the present delay in the determination of the appeals. Anyway, I feel that the number of appeals will be substantially reduced when the final plans are prepared and I want to say again that I am totally opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from Deputy O'Leary's contribution that he values the political influence that is given to him through the present Planning Act and indeed he does not value <Col N="660" /> it half as much as Deputy Molloy.  I am sorry that Deputy Molloy has not decided to remain in the House.  He spoke at some length on this Bill.  I should not say he spoke on the Bill; in fact he spoke about anything but what is in the Bill.  He spent his time more or less in slagging the members of this Party and then he immediately gets up and leaves the House.  One of the statements made by Deputy Molloy which I could not forget and which I made a note of was:</P>
      <P>It would be disastrous for me if this power was taken from the Minister and handed over to some judicial authority.</P>
      <P>It would be disastrous &ldquo;for him&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why would it be disastrous for him? I have as much connection with planning applications as Deputy Molloy has.  I am the present Chairman of the Planning Committee of Dublin County Council and have been on a number of occasions before, and I have been a member of the County Council for 12 or 13 years.  I certainly have had as much to do with planning applications as Deputy Molloy but it would not be a disaster for me if this power were taken out of the hands of the Minister. It makes one listen a bit more to things like what I was told a few days ago. Somebody rang me up and said that he had just been at a certain meeting which a member of the Fianna Fáil Party had attended and he disagreed with what the residents of that area wanted.  He said: &ldquo;I will see that you will not get this and I have the back door into the Minister's office and I am in a position to see that you will not.&rdquo; I am suggesting now that it is obvious to the House that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken have, in fact, the back door into the Minister's office and that their only objection to this Bill is that they see that power and that back door being taken away from them, if this Bill goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no denying the fact that political influence is being used and has been used on many occasions in deciding planning appeals.  Deputy Fitzpatrick in moving the Second Reading of this Bill gave a clear and detailed outline of the present position and I believe that he made a very convincing <Col N="661" /> case for the Bill and for the setting up of this independent tribunal presided over by a judge.  I feel it is right to say that the job has become a completely impossible one for any Minister&mdash;I do not care who he is.  The present position is, as we know from the records, that a Minister is now called on to pass judgment on approximately 1,000 cases per year, and in fact more.  That number will increase; and if the Minister has got himself an impossible task, he made it for himself.  I am referring now to the former Minister for Local Government, not the present occupant, because it was not he who piloted the 1963 Act through this House.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not accusing the present Minister of improperly using the power he has under the present legislation because I appreciate the pressures that inevitably will be brought to bear on any politician, no matter who he is, to give a decision in a certain direction or in favour of a certain person.</P>
    <P>Is it right for a Minister, as under the present Act, to grant an application where thousands of pounds may be involved, where the value of property may be enhanced to an enormous extent, where, as Deputy O'Leary says, he can make or break any individual&mdash;I am asserting here that he has both made and broken individuals with this power?  I d onot want anybody to misunderstand me.  On many occasions I was very pleased that we had a second authority to pass judgment on planning applications and I am sure that in 50 per cent of the applications that were reversed, when appealed to the Minister, I would have agreed with him.  In the other 50 per cent, there were some I had considerable doubt about, and in some of them I was quite satisfied that there was an element of political influence operated to bring about the particular decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke about a specific instance in relation to density. A clear case came to my mind where a certain farm came up for sale.  It was known for a considerable time that in this particular area, the density was one house per three acres and several applications for a greater density <Col N="662" /> than this had been turned down. This came up for auction and the bidders at the auction were aware of this situation and knew that they could pay a certain price for exclusive development of that kind.  However, there was one bidder who is a well-known supporter of the Government.  He bid higher than anybody else and he got the property.  He knew, of course, that he would be turned down at local level. He put in his application and he was duly turned down.  He appealed it to the Minister and the Minister reversed that from one house to three acres to three houses per acre.  That made an enormous difference&mdash;I think anybody can see that.  This is only a specific instance that immediately comes to my mind.</P>
    <P>I cite again the case of the petrol companies.  There are in a short stretch of the Naas Road about 16 petrol stations.  Only four of those were permitted by the local authority.  The other 12 got through on appeal.  I have other cases in mind.  I know a man who on two occasions bought land on which to erect a petrol station and on both occasions he was refused permission and his appeal failed.  The land changed hands over to the petrol company and permission was given.  It might have been a fresh application inasmuch as they might have erected a dwarf wall in front or decorated a pier differently but sufficient was done to enable it to be said that it was a new application.  Anybody can see the amount of suspicion that immediately arises and the amount of conviction when the person concerned happens to be a well-known supporter of the Government.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the objection to the setting up of an impartial body.  Many such bodies have been set up especially to deal with grants of one sort or another.  This, in fact, is a grant and it can be a very handsome grant but it is left to a politician to make the decision and the effect of that for a political Party or political individual is enormous.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken here want to hold on to that power and are determined to hold on to it.  If we had <Col N="663" /> access to that sort of influence it might be said that we would be on the same note.  We are not on the same note and do not intend to be on the same note. We want to see that justice is done in relation to planning.  There is far too much involved here and it is totally wrong that it should be left to the political head of a Department to make these decisions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister made a lot of his own difficulties.  At the time the 1963 Planning Bill was going through this House we were assured by the then Minister for Local Government that it was his intention that the Act would be brought in on a regional basis and that he had no intention of attempting to give blanket cover throughout the country.  What has happened as a result of that?  We have not the people qualified to deal with town planning in most local authorities and, as somebody has said, if they meet a complicated case they say, &ldquo;We will throw it over to the Minister and let him decide it&rdquo;.  They are not living up to their responsibility.  Worse than that, what has happened is that because of the fact that they were so understaffed and unable to procure staff and unable to deal with the volume of work coming into them, when the statutory two month period was about to expire they had to turn down the application or had to send out some foolish query in order to hold the application for a further two months.  That was done for a period until applications accumulated. As a result, there are thousands of applications going on appeal to the Minister.  It is clear that a Minister, no matter what his capacity, could not possibly read all the files even in the most condensed form and must entirely depend on the officials who make the recommendations on the files.  So, in fact, it is not the Minister who makes the decision except in cases where pressures of one sort or another or influences of some sort or another have been brought to bear or where big issues arise.  Then the Minister will come in to pass judgment.</P>
    <P>There are 87 planning authorities. There are appeals coming in from all of them.  Development has only started <Col N="664" /> to take place and people are only beginning to become aware of their rights under the Planning Act and the objections that they can raise.  This thing is only in its infancy.  As time goes on the Minister will realise that he has undertaken an impossible and fantastic task.  He will be supposed to be carrying out his responsibility but it will be physically impossible for him to do so.</P>
    <P>When that point is reached, the Minister has an obligation to himself and the country to say that this is no longer possible, that there are all the other ministerial responsibilities that he has to discharge, that he is only an ordinary human being, that these planning appeals are something on which he cannot bring his normal judgment to bear, that he has not got the time, that the day is not long enough.  In the long run he will have to agree that either he is not doing it or that he is not fit to do it because it is just not possible.</P>
    <P>There is an immense amount of concern and dissatisfaction in regard to the present situation.  Everybody is unhappy about it.  There are many cases where permission has been granted and many cases where refusals have been given by the Minister where the people  perhaps wrongly, suspicious that political influences have been at work, but it lends itself to that and to nothing else.  All over the place people have begun to say that politicians are suspect for this, that and the other reason.  They leave themselves open to this sort of suspicion.  It is bound to arise.  The Minister has an obligation not only to himself but to the country to remove this suspicion and this concern.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am very unhappy about some of the decisions that have been made.  The last thing I want to do is to come into this House and sling mud at anyone but I am well aware, having been a public representative for some time, of the pressures that can be brought to bear on a Minister in relation to planning transactions and all the objections that arise.  I know that the present Minister has taken steps to reduce the number of appeals that come before him&mdash;quite definite steps&mdash;and that this has had an effect and, certainly in the area of the local authority of which I am a member, he has reduced <Col N="665" /> the number of appeals.  Nevertheless, in view of the fact that under the Planning Act a man cannot change the colour of his house without planning permission and when that applies over the entire areas of 87 planning authorities, what can the Minister expect but that the number of applications will increase as time goes on, as development increases, as it must increase, if the economy is to expand and improve as we all hope it will?</P>
    <P>The Minister has set himself an impossible task.  He has put himself in an invidious position.  It is too bad that Fianna Fáil speakers should come in here and say that it would be disastrous for them.  I am glad Deputy Molloy is back.  He said it would be disastrous for him if this power was taken away from the Minister and handed over to some judicial authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have formally established the career guidance section in all our schools we will have, as a result of the screening that must necessarily follow the proper application of any career guidance system, really good material and this brings me straightaway into the area of teacher training.  Instead of the two-year period in operation I suggest there should be at least three years, and preferably four years, and I want that third or fourth year period associated with the training school in which the mechanics are done and the liberal side of the teacher's educational progress dealt with, both in the training school, in the universities or in any other school of technology that might be deemed suitable.  This kind of screening should, in my opinion, be kept up all the time at all stages of the teacher's training so that he or she can be selected from the point of view of particular propensities and particular <Col N="667" /> capacities.  It would be very easy to extend this teacher training period by carrying on with the two years at present being operated and then sending the teacher for another year to some school.  This might be described as a sort of post-graduate anti-climax because I have heard it mooted abroad that the Minister is thinking along these lines; if these lines are being considered I suggest that the idea be dropped at once because any such step would be a retrograde step in the ordinary progress of teacher training.</P>
      <P>Having given them the four year course or, to begin with, the three year course, you would then have to give them parity of status to enable them to go into a primary, a secondary or a vocational school and, presumably, they would carry with that parity of status parity of salary, something I regard as very desirable.  The children would benefit from this.  The parents would be better satisfied and, by and large, as the process goes on the children would get the best available by way of teacher because the teacher, trained under the system I suggest, would then be able to choose his particular school or move from a particular class to a higher or lower class, thereby keeping up the whole process of what one might describe as integrated education.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the primary schools, may I say that school managers in the vast majority of cases have given great service, given it voluntarily, and achieved great work.  There have been some laggards, of course, but one will find them anywhere.  One will find that particular type always ready to sit back and be satisfied with the minimum. But the vast majority strive after not alone the maximum but the optimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the question of secondary and vocational education. Last year, I freely conceded that the Minister's policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> transport was, in fact, a better one than the one we suggested.  I still think it can be improved.  There are certain difficulties. These may seem to be small but they are not small to those affected.  Frankly, <Col N="668" /> I cannot understand a transport system being described as free when that system imposes a charge on some. That may be related to the question of forcing a particular pupil to go to a certain school.  That might not always be the best thing for the pupil and I do not think one can gauge on a geographical basis what is best for all pupils going to either secondary or vocational schools or on the basis of mere finance either.  If there is a bus travelling from A to B and that bus is not full, or overcrowded, I see no reason why one or two pupils should be charged for travelling on that bus merely because they elect to go to one school rather than another.  There is more in it than that and, quite frankly, I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on this when he comes to reply because it is a matter giving rise to considerable anxiety on the part of certain parents affected by it.  It is also giving rise to trouble because we, in turn, have to make representations to the Minister or CIE, or both, all of which should not be necessary.  The life of a member of the Oireachtas is difficult enough without piling on areas of useless representation.  There should be more time for legislative activity and less time taken up with purely administrative matters.  If these things were done with a little more humanity as compared with the rigidity that operates at the moment we would have much more time at our disposal to deal with more important matters.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that in a country like ours, in primary, secondary and vocational schools, our educational system is geared closely enough to the family, closely enough to the rural conditions in which families live and in which pupils are brought up.  The <i>Irish Times</i> yesterday, in a column entitled &ldquo;A Social Sort of Column&rdquo; by Eileen O'Brien, published an interview with Dr. Birch of Ossory, who dealt very clearly with this aspect of the school versus the rural community and the family.  There is nothing in the primary school programme, or, indeed, in the secondary school programme at the moment which deals with rural <Col N="669" /> life or any aspect of it.  Book learning seems to be divorced from practicalities as well as realities, and though there has been a change, particularly in some subjects, <i>vis-à-vis</i> textbooks, I do not agree that that change, intended to bring everything up to date, has effected what it was intended to effect.</P>
    <P>The incorporation of certain extracts from world renowned poems and world renowned authors into school textbooks has given rise to some slight controversy.  Indeed, it has been the subject matter of an Adjournment literary debacle in this House as between the Minister for Education and a Deputy of my Party.  If one can find in almost any of the paperbacks you can buy freely in any of the shops in this city and some of our towns the words of which complaint was made, I do not see why we cannot come out in the open with the whole thing.  In this respect one cannot help touching on an element of our youth today&mdash; or juvenile delinquency as some people like to call it.</P>
    <P>In my view&mdash;maybe this is a sort of nostalgia for youth&mdash;I have the highest regard for the youth of today, subjected as they are to all the allurements that could, if wrongfully employed, corrupt; and one cannot but marvel at how few of our youth are getting into real trouble in spite of these very persistent temptations.  Some people are inclined to think that if youth, particularly those in secondary and vocational schools, and undergraduates, are assertive, are clamouring after truth, are interested in reality, are concerned with the facts of life in a genuinely interested way, they are approaching the realm of delinquency. They are not, and credit must go to the youth of this country&mdash;indeed to the youth of the world at the moment &mdash;the vast majority of whom are rejecting the temptations that are there and that could so easily destroy them.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, adult delinquents and it is there the trouble starts. An adult delinquent can be a parent, a teacher at any level, primary secondary, vocational, university; he can be a person of influence or stature <Col N="670" /> in his community.  Because example is the great driving force, if example is not good and if it fails to come up to the standard it should reach, then the result cannot be favourable to the child or youth subjected to it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I can say truly that I am sick and tired of all those super-excellent people who band themselves together into crank communities and are decrying perpetually the activities of our youth today.  Our youth is a good youth.  All it needs is leadership and I am satisfied that even if it does not get the leadership it deserves there is emerging from that youth a leadership which one day will do credit to this country.  Do I hear rumblings from the greatest adult delinquent in the House?</P>

      <P>The question of textbooks, therefore, is being reasonably well handled and I do not see any reason why some of the works of our great poets and prose writers should not be available to children in our secondary schools and so on, either in Irish or English.  I abhor the cut version, the edited version, of something that is great and loses its greatness in the editing or cutting.  Still on the question of textbooks, I should like to see greater continuity from year to year during the schoolgoing period of the average family.  Then the outlay on books would not be so great.  I know there are free books&mdash;in some schools books are included in the non-fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I appealed to the Minister to promote this to a total demolition <Col N="671" /> because the present system is bad psychologically.  A means test is wrong always, whether in old age pensions, school fees, hospital maintenance or anywhere else.  Anything that tends to differentiate as between citizens or children of citizens is damaging psychologically; and when one looks at the Minister's statement and notices the large percentage of books that are free one must wonder why the remaining relatively small percentage cannot be given free also.  It is a question in my view of spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar.</P>
    <P>We have a peculiar position here&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; in its classification sense&mdash;in our secondary schools in regard to the staff because so many of our secondary schools are owned and run by religious communities.  The religious communities would be doing themselves a very good service if they adopted that particular portion, for the moment, of our policy and gave the lay teachers positions of responsibility in various departments in their schools. There is agitation for this.  Once there is agitation for something in time there must be concessions but between the beginning of an agitation and the granting of a concession feelings become ruffled and hardened and bitternesses develop, sometimes to a degree that can never be cured in a particular institution.  It is for that reason that I would suggest that those positions of responsibility be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister's speech, while it gives a good broad outline of the mechanics of the whole system of education as it operates here, nevertheless is silent on the concept of education generally.  All its aspects, the psychology of education, the part psychology plays, are all again bound up with the teacher training.  I should like to hear more of this.  I should like to hear more of the plans or the planning that is going on within the Department itself. The great defect in our system is that educational planning is being done by administrators.  There is no doubt the administrators in the Department of Education, as, indeed, in the higher echelons of all departments, are excellent <Col N="672" /> but administration and planning, particularly planning from a carefully thought out concept are two different things.  In my view it is impossible for the administrator, or group of administrators, however excellent they are in that field, to do the planning that is necessary in this Department, particularly in education.  It was for that reason we suggested this unit within the department devoted entirely to planning.</P>
    <P>There is a matter in relation to education which has been given some publicity recently and it is very important. Apart altogether from its educational facility it is important right through life.  That is the question of voice training or speech therapy, or whatever you call it.  I do not mean elocution, which confines itself to imposing an accent on one's ordinary speech.  I am talking about speech training and the therapy of voice generally that makes more for clarity of expression.  Might I refer again to the speech I made in 1955 when I referred to this very matter?  On 7th July, 1955&mdash;I quote from volume 152, column 410&mdash;I said:</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would refer in all sincerity as a matter of some urgency is that of speech training.  It is not very long ago since we in this country were renowned for a very long time previously, principally abroad and to some extent at home, as a nation of orators and as people who could not alone be heard but could be understood. I am not speaking about Members of this House, or members of local bodies or anybody else like that.  I am speaking of the average person who is called upon from time to time to say a few words in public or even asked a question in the ordinary course of business.  At the moment we are a nation of mumblers.</P>
    <P>I think that is true in 1968 because nothing has been done since that time about it.</P>
    <P>Some time last year I put down a series of questions to the Minister in this regard because there are some very dedicated people in this country who <Col N="673" /> have gone to London which I understand is the nearest educational centre for getting a qualification in speech training.  They have come back here and have been going to certain schools, which are able to pay them the fees, or charge the parents the fees.  Now, of course, the charging of fees for extras is out and accordingly schools find themselves in the difficulty of not being able to employ those people who are available but who cannot give the service all for nothing.  They must live as well as everybody else.  I would strongly urge that, certainly at the beginning of secondary school education, speech training should be incorporated in the programme, either as a subject or associated with languages, so that our people from the very start would get to know the fundamentals of making themselves clear when asked to speak.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister says he hopes to make some progress with regard to slow learning or retarded children.  Again, in 1955, I referred to this and I notice in 1965 a commission was set up to inquire into it, 10 years later, but that commission has not so far reported.  When I talk about retarded and slow learning children, I am not referring to mentally handicapped and mentally retarded children for which great work is being done and for which, of course, the Minister very properly pays tribute in his speech to the voluntary people who give of their time and money to assist those unfortunate children.</P>
    <P>A good deal of money is being spent on the vocational schools side and that is a good thing.  I do not know how well the scheme of integration, dialogue or co-operation between secondary schools and vocational schools when they exist in the same centre is going.  That will have to wait for examination until we are able to assess the situation properly. Of course, it should be watched and a very sharp eve kept on it.  I agree with Deputy Hogan O'Higgins here today when she said that all of the children who are over 12 or past sixth standard or who can take a bus or private transport or whatever it is and go to the local secondary school, certainly create very great problems for teachers not <Col N="674" /> alone problems of space but problems of segregation from the point of view of intelligence standards.  There will, of course, be a falling off every year but, nevertheless, there should be some sort of test, some sort of interview, conducted by the superior of either the boys' secondary school or the girls' secondary school or the headmaster of the vocational school in conjunction with the principal of the national school or primary school which those children are leaving.</P>
    <P>At some stage there should be an assessment of the suitability of a child for secondary education, for vocational education or as far as intermediate certificate and, even at that stage, an assessment as to which way a child is best suited to go.  Children need that help: even parents need it.  It is only from the teachers that the parents can really get an assessment of their children.  That is a matter that will have to be examined as the years go on and will have to be examined quickly.</P>
    <P>Now, on the closing of schools, whether they be primary or secondary, I think there should be very full consultation locally, with the owners of the schools, the parents and the representatives of the Department.  I do not think a decision should be reached merely on an inspector's report.  Again, dealing with the statistical viewpoint, because the human factor is left out of it all, there are some small schools, whether primary or secondary, that would best be closed in the interests of everybody. Then there are others which I think would have a very great claim to be kept open.  Above all, before children are moved from one school to another, it must be made absolutely certain that the school building to which they are being transferred is adequate to house them in easily manageable classes, that there are enough teachers there to look after them and that the sanitation is all that it should be.  That is not happening in most of the changes from closed primary schools to others: in fact, there is no change at all.  I would look forward to what I would term the County Kerry activity moving into parts of my constituency in North Mayo to deal with the question of the sanitation in some of the primary <Col N="675" /> schools here to which extra pupils have been brought in very recent times.</P>
    <P>We do not quarrel, by and large, with the educational process as it goes, except for the fundamental differences to which I have already referred, particularly the planning unit within the Department which, of course, is responsible to the Minister.  If the Minister over-rides the suggestions of that planning unit, he is obliged to give his reasons for so doing in public either through a reply to a Parliamentary Question or in open debate in the House or, indeed, in open debate outside it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the universities. There is great excitement; there is great confusion.  Everything is happening; nothing is happening. Grants are being sanctioned but very little building is going on.  I particularly want to direct the attention of the Minister to our own university in Galway for which I was very glad to note he said recently the Government have sanctioned £1,750,000.  I do not doubt the Minister's word.  I believe that that sanction has been given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only a couple of noughts.  It makes no difference to Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  In fact, it is probably true.  My concern is its immediate application to the purpose for which it is intended.  Galway University is in urgent need of assistance. I think that attention was probably focussed upon it in the most effective way in recent times by the teach-in in Galway which the Minister and I attended, as well as many other equally important people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork has its own problems.  They appear to be looked after, especially as far as sanction goes.  I was quite surprised recently&mdash;but not amused&mdash; to read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 11th September, 1967, the report of a speech by the Taoiseach who, if it is not generally known, is a Corkman. Speaking in Cork and referring to the recent appointment of a President of the College in Cork, the Taoiseach, in his characteristic and disarming way, <Col N="676" /> was reported as follows in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of that date:</P>
    <P>At the outset of his address Mr. Lynch said it was well known that there had been two contenders for the post of the Presidency of University College, Cork, and well known also that he had favoured the defeated candidate who had been a classmate of his own.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Taoiseach did work for the defeated candidate.  I want to deplore the intervention of a Taoiseach or Minister in the appointment of a President or in the appointment of any member of a staff of a university. University autonomy in the field of education is very nearly a sacred thing and the Taoiseach, any more than the Minister for Education or any more than myself, has no right to intervene in the appointment particularly of a President of a University College.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the great talking point at the present time.  Some people call it amalgamation; some call it a merger; some call it other things which you would not even find in the new school books, to which exception has been taken.  I do not believe in the workability of a merger, as I understand a merger.  I can understand what we suggest as a university authority that would assist in the co-ordination and co-operation and dialogue generally as between Trinity College and University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>University College, Dublin, has now virtually moved out to Belfield, has its own buildings and of course has all its faculties still.  Trinity College is an extremely old institution in the centre of the city.  It has played a very vital part in the history of this country, some of it creditable, some of it not so creditable, but the not too creditable part is easily understandable when you relate it to the times in which events took place.  It is the university of Emmet, Tone, Douglas Hyde&mdash;one could name several others down the ages&mdash;Davis, John Blake Dillon, all of whom played a very important part in the history and development of this country which ultimately reached its natural objective in the Treaty of 1921.</P>
    <P>Have a unit or university authority by all means to see what can be done <Col N="677" /> to avoid overlapping and duplication and wasting, but leave the fabric of the two universities alone.  Let each have the basic faculties that make up a university.  Indeed, if I were planning at the moment and if I were giving serious consideration to this matter from an authority point of view, that is, in power, I would consider the feasibility of a third university in Dublin, and I would have it on the north side to cater for not more than 4,000 or 5,000 people, in close conjunction and collaboration, of course, with University College, Dublin, and Trinity College.  In American cities there are several universities, all kept down to a minimum attendance.  I think the proposal as the Minister has put it, a merger, was not a happy word, and I think it would be wrong to destroy anything that belongs either to a majority or to a minority.</P>
    <P>University College, Dublin, has its own particular claim to a place in the history of this country: McDonagh, Pearse, Kettle, and all of these great people of that time.  But, I want to make our policy perfectly clear on this question which we published on November 28th last.  It says:</P>
    <P>There has been no overall assessment of the nation's requirements in the field of university education, nor any plan to meet these requirements in a co-ordinated way.  We believe that this has given rise to serious duplication of facilities, and the fragmentation of scarce resources of academic skills....  No small country can afford such unnecessary duplication, much of which arises from competing claims by University College, Dublin, and Dublin University....  The duplication of facilities requires a close co-ordination of university college facilities in Dublin, which could be secured only by the establishment of an effective policy-making university authority which would have the power to secure this co-ordination.  Fine Gael proposes to secure the creation of such an effective policy-making university authority in consultation with the colleges concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> That is perfectly simple and a perfectly reasonable objective to which neither the authorities of University College, Dublin, nor the authorities of Trinity College could take the slightest exception.  I do believe that to the word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; and what it connotes, exception is being taken, not spoken out openly but worked against quietly and there is where corruption starts because if there is, as it were, an underground in both of these places, the Minister might as well be hitting his head against a stone wall unless he achieves his objective by co-operation. I think he should withdraw this word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; as soon as possible, and that should not be too long because there must be a Fianna Fáil dinner in the next week or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The next part of it is:</P>
      <P>We are, of course, aware that there are at present ecclesiastical difficulties affecting the entrance of Catholics to Trinity College, and that these difficulties have contributed to the under-utilisation of Trinity College's facilities by Irish students, and to the duplication of facilities between the two Dublin University colleges.  These ecclesiastical difficulties can, we believe, be overcome with the goodwill of the ecclesiastical authorities concerned, which has always been forthcoming whenever the State has actively sought it, and with the assistance of the authorities of the two university colleges involved, who are unlikely to insist on continued duplication of effort and facilities, unless the State encourages it by continuing to provide financial aid for wastefully competitive courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are of course ecclesiastical difficulties but these are difficulties which, <Col N="679" /> in my experience, have never constituted a hurdle which cannot be attempted.  Anybody in my experience &mdash;there may be other experiences&mdash; who has asked permission from Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid from this diocese to go to Trinity College has got it, once he gave adequate reasons for so doing.</P>
    <P>I might say in this regard that it has been fashionable not alone this year but for many years past for the neo-educationists to attack people like the Archbishop of Dublin who, in my view, is the real progressive in our Irish Hierarchy.  He is a true conservative and a real progressive, and has done more for schools and school buildings in this Archdiocese than anybody would ever have dreamed of when he took this exalted office.  I have nothing to get from the Archbishop and it does not mean that I am going to get anything by praising him.  But I feel, and have felt for a long time, that between the pronouncements one hears in the queerest places&mdash;letters to the papers from neo-educationists, ecumenical addicts and all this strange band of happy warriors now coming together&mdash; they are inclined to forget that fundamental things must remain fundamental and the only charge they can level against this prelate is that he insists on fundamentals keeping their true status and remaining fundamentals.  That does not provide any difficulty for our policy.  What we have said there is equally consistent with what I have said now and we are prepared to stand by it.</P>
    <P>The medical schools do not come within the ambit of this debate.  Neither do law schools generally, except in so far as they are faculties within colleges. But I do not see anything in this Estimate to help art or the teaching of art.  I do not see anything in it to make pupils understand colours, their use and blending.  Recently, at the Ursuline Convent in Waterford, the Minister said he had been grossly negligent and would do something about this straight away.  There is nothing in this speech to indicate he proposes to do anything in this regard.  He became so romantically artistic in this convent in Waterford <Col N="680" /> that he was deploring the sad treatment being meted out <i>post mortem</i> to the late Patrick Kavanagh, the poet, that we were only giving him a seat on the canal bank instead of a seat in the Seanad during his lifetime.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be harking back to the days when such men were given places in the Seanad, when they were nominated by the late Mr. Cosgrave to the Seanad in recognition of their contribution to the arts and sciences and the general culture of our country. The Minister must be apologising, through the nunnery at Waterford, to the Irish people for what has happened in between.  When other Prime Ministers and other Taoisigh had the opportunity of nominating to the Seanad men of culture, of learning and of industrial standing in this country, look at what they did.  Mr. Cosgrave was abused for having people in the Seanad like the late Oliver Gogarty and W. B. Yeats.  Mr. Costello in 1948 was abused for putting people of the standing of the late Arthur Cox and Mr. Guinness Mahon into the Seanad, representing culture and banking and industry.  Look at the cricket teams nominated by the Fianna Fáil Taoisigh.</P>

      <P>This speech by the Minister on the token Estimate is a speech dealing with the mechanics of education.  It is dealing with the sum allocated for this and that, the numbers going to training colleges, the number they hope to come out&mdash;all statistical stuff.  There is nothing in this speech which can give any hope to the parents of school-going children that the concept of education is being truly examined, that the planning unit within the Department is being consulted, that the university situation will be properly looked after.  There is nothing in this speech except a rehash of the various blundering pronouncements over the past year and a half.  There is certainly here nothing to inspire.  There is a lot that we would like to know of in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to invite the Minister, in addition to the things I have already asked him to reply to, to say whom he would put in the Seanad if he became Taoiseach and whom he would remove from this list of virtuosos.  We want the cant finished.  There is no good in pious asides in convents, at dinners or anywhere else.  Here is the place to say not alone what you would like to <Col N="682" /> do, but what you are going to do and what you advise should be done.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of this speech that education was becoming a fashionable subject, so fashionable that it was almost on the verge of decadence. Let the Minister beware that with all his anxiety&mdash;and I accept a great deal of it as genuine anxiety and I accept him for the work he has done, but I am not prepared to accept the cant&mdash; he is not translating genuine work into cant and destroying again the hopes of the Irish people for a proper educational process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us on this side of the House are not unmindful of or ungrateful for the welcome breakthrough which has been made in our archaic and outmoded educational system, and it is undoubtedly to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, that the greatest credit belongs for this welcome breakthrough.  There was never any doubt or ambiguity as to where we in the Labour Party stood in respect of this vital matter of education. <Col N="683" /> We have always said that education should be free to all.  From the very foundation of our Party over 50 years ago, we have stood by the firm conviction that investment in education would bring a rich and lasting reward to this nation.</P>
    <P>We have always said that our system of education should be based not on privilege, not on the ability of the parent to pay, as it has been for so long, but on the ability of the child to benefit.  We have always contended that a nation which was underdeveloped educationally would always remain underdeveloped economically, and this is as it has been in this country for the past 40 years.  We neglected the most essential thing of all, the human resources of our people, their talents, and we in the Labour Party long for the day when the children of this nation will be free at last to give their talents, their energies and their genius in the service of their own country, and I emphasise &ldquo;their own country&rdquo;.  What a terrible waste it would be if the vast amount of money now being expended were to be wasted and that the exodus, the haemorrhage of emigration were to continue, if the flower of our youth on whom we are now conferring, very largely, free education, were to go abroad for a livelihood, and all that expenditure and sacrifice were to go for nought.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate if we were again to face a situation where some 40,000 boys and girls who come out of our schools each year having completed their education could not find a means of livelihood, a means of applying their talents and their energies for the benefit of their own country, for the rejuvenation of this decaying economy of ours, for the greater prosperity of our country in the years ahead.  While acknowledging the progress which has been made and paying due tribute to the Minister for his courage and his daring in bringing about this advance, let me say there is no room for complacency. It is not a time for jubilation or for throwing hats in the air.  It is not a time for the Fianna Fáil Party, for the Minister, or even the hierarchy of his Department to form themselves <Col N="684" /> into a mutual admiration society of backslappers as if all was well with our education system.</P>
    <P>All is not well.  There is a long way to go.  There are still grievous defects in our educational system, and that is evidenced by the deplorable conditions in which thousands of our children are obliged to remain during their school life, in cold, damp, dilapidated, insanitary and often rat-infested school-houses, a threat to their health, schools where it is clear that it is impossible for a teacher to teach or a pupil to learn. This is a system which purports to be free, and yet the only way parents can secure free books, which are an essential ingredient in education, and a very costly one too, is by the parents and children subjecting themselves to an odious means test to ascertain whether they possess a medical card.  As members of local authorities, we all know the kind of inquisition and the odious means test which apply in respect of securing a medical card.  For, to secure a medical card, it must be clear that the applicant is unable, by his own industry or other lawful means, to provide a health service for himself and his family.  Large numbers of people, thousands of ordinary working-class people are precluded from having their names placed on the health register.  In other words, they are denied medical cards by reason of the rigid means test which the county managers apply.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of humiliation and distress for children when this test is applied.  I am appealing to the Minister to remove this blot, this stigma, from an otherwise relatively good educational system, especially when one sees evidence of a positive vested interest in respect of the supply of school books. One sees evidence of changes in books, regular changes in textbooks, which are a source of great worry and great financial cost to the parents.  It is a pity the Minister did not stand up to this challenge of the vested interests in respect of the supply of school books and say it must end, and that the odious means test, this terrible embarrassment to children and parents, must be removed from the system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transport service, a charge is laid down for transport <Col N="685" /> for certain categories of children. Worse than that, it is difficult for the ordinary layman to understand why school buses should pass little children on the road going to schools in the same town, especially on winter mornings. It is difficult to understand why these children cannot be provided with the shelter of these buses.  Many of the children to whom I am referring live further away and, in many cases, their parents are poorer than the parents of the children who enjoy this free transport. I appreciate that the Minister has reasons why these children should be passed by, why they should be refused admission to these school buses, but outwardly on a cold bleak morning to see these school buses passing by little children of tender age would strike one as a very hard and very callous approach.  We would hope that an arrangement could be made whereby all these children going to the same town could be provided for on the school bus.</P>
    <P>The much-awaited break-through in respect of extra help, much needed and urgent help, for our university students has not yet been achieved.  The Minister is well aware of the sacrifices which so many thousands of Irish university students are making in trying to maintain themselves at the university.  The cost of digs, meals, clothing, appliances, books and so on, is a formidable impost on the student who comes, perhaps, from a poor or relatively poor family.  These students are making a great sacrifice and this is an added handicap and an added burden for the poor man's child trying to get through the university today.  It was hoped in this instance that the Minister would see his way to providing a decent maintenance allowance for our university students.  It is a matter of deep disappointment to me and my colleagues in the Labour Party that provision has not been made on this occasion for such an essential facility.</P>
    <P>The indiscriminate closure of schools without due regard to the wishes of the parents is a matter of concern to many of us.  While believing that a larger centre of education is bound of <Col N="686" /> necessity to give better facilities to the pupils, and provide them with better education, we think it behoves the Minister and the Department to consult with the parents before a closure. A position has now been created in which the Minister and his officials are taking up the attitude that they know best what suits the children, and that they will close schools despite the confirmed opinion of the parents that this ought not to be done, or that there was an alternative.  I am submitting that parents have rights in matters of this kind, and that their views should be taken fully into account before a decision is made to close a school.  I hope to elaborate on this matter of closures later on in my remarks with special reference to closures in my own constituency and the feelings of shock and dismay which many of those proposed closures has caused.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to see that at last there are positive proposals for the commencement of the erection of schools of technology in the spring of this year.  That is something we in the Labour Party look forward to with hope and enthusiasm, because we know there is an acute shortage of skills and we hope that through the medium of the schools of technology we will find the kind of technicians, craftsmen, tradesmen and so on, we so badly require in order to make some worthwhile industrial advancement.</P>
    <P>I also notice the amount of money which the Minister is making available to CIE for extra school buses.  We are all very grateful to CIE for the way they have responded to the Minister's appeal for a school transport service and they have carried out a formidable task smoothly and efficiently.  It is, however, a matter of concern to me that owners of private transport would not be considered in the provision of school buses.  Many of them have been, but I know in my constituency of an owner of some excellent school buses that have not been taken up by the Department.  It is difficult to understand why this is so, because in this area, which is well known to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davern, who has just come in, the Cashel area, there is need for an improvement in <Col N="687" /> the school transport service.  Yet, these excellent buses are lying idle and are not availed of, while extra moneys are being voted in this Estimate to CIE for the provision of new buses.  Private enterprise should be given some recognition in this matter.  I am concerned that a man of not very great means should have incurred the expense of purchasing two buses which he believed would be used by the Department for the free transport service.  As yet, despite representations, certainly by myself, to the Minister, the buses are still idle while we have a clearly defective school transport service which means that children are obliged to get up exceptionally early in the mornings and return home pretty late in the evenings.  This causes concern to parents, especially in the case of children of tender years.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I expressed concern that school closures were taking place without at least seeking the goodwill of the parents.  I appreciate the necessity to close certain old schools, the need for mergers to ensure better education but it behoves the Minister, in the interests of education and particularly of the children, that he should try to secure the goodwill, understanding and co-operation of parents.  I know of schools which were closed and the school transport service put into operation, and the school buses now arriving in the area are regarded rather as if they were Black Marias arriving to take the children, as it were, forcibly from the parents and imprison them for a number of hours per day.  This is bad psychologically. There is, perhaps, need to educate the parents and this should be done.  It is bad to have this sort of situation arising.</P>
    <P>A number of schools have been closed in my constituency.  The most recently proposed closures are at Marlfield and Ballyheaphy.  In Marlfield, there has been a protracted withdrawal of children, a school strike, if you like, that has received a lot of publicity in the papers and other mass <i>media.</i>  From a reply to a question last week, it seems the Minister has taken up the attitude that it is still in the best interests <Col N="688" /> of the children that they should be transported to Clonmel.  I attended a number of meetings of parents concerned in Marlfield with his Lordship, the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Dr. Russell, and meetings also with the Minister's representative.  I have attended many such meetings in regard to closures but I have yet to experience such a determined approach as that of the parents in this case and such a conviction on their part that they are right and that it is intrinsically wrong to close this school, that it is wholly unjustified and that the simple solution is to carry out minor repairs which, in fact, is all that is required in this case.</P>
    <P>The school needs proper sanitary facilities, proper heating and lighting; otherwise, it is reasonably good.  It is staffed by two excellent teachers and has turned out some excellent pupils who have won themselves high places.  I say this&mdash;I see Deputy Davern smiling &mdash;not because I happen to be one of them myself but because we can point to many who have got high places in Church and State in this country, and indeed many other countries.  I think the Minister is unwise in this matter because the tradition at Marlfield school has always been that when children have spent a few years there and have had their formative education there at the primary level, they automatically gravitate towards the secondary schools in Clonmel.  There was never any problem in that respect and they had little difficulty in getting to Clonmel, whether they walked, cycled or had a car.</P>
    <P>The Minister's concern about better education does not arise in this instance and it would be a great pity if this otherwise excellent school with such a great tradition should be closed, especially as I know that this lovely village of Marlfield is to be improved and developed.  There are already plans before South Tipperary County Council, of which I have the honour to be chairman, for the provision of a site for the erection of cottages.  I hope the Minister will have another look at the situation and realise the determination of the people to retain the school, their loyalty to their teachers and the old tradition of the school and allow them <Col N="689" /> to retain it.  This would not diminish their educational opportunities in any way.  I trust the Minister will fall in with their wishes and have the minor repairs, which will not be very costly, carried out so that educational facilities may continue at Marlfield.</P>
    <P>In respect of the school at Ballyheaphy, Araglen, Kilworth, Co. Cork, which, despite the postal address, is in part of my constituency, here again there is agitation and opposition to its proposed closure.  There is disappointment that the Department and the Minister have dishonoured what the people felt was a firm undertaking, if not a promise, to erect a new school at Ballyheaphy.</P>
    <P>I understand from parents who visited me recently that plans for the erection of a new school at Ballyheaphy were drawn up two, four, five or perhaps six years ago and that it is difficult to pin responsibility for the delay on any individual or group.  It was felt that this new school should have been provided a long time ago. I feel I am presenting the unanimous wishes of the parents of Araglen and district, many of whom are not of my political persuasion, when I say that the move to close Ballyheaphy is deeply resented and the people feel they are being let down by the disinclination, if not the refusal, of the Department to erect the promised new school.  This is a mountainous area and it will be difficult to provide transport. I understand that the terrain is such that the pupils are spread over a wide area and that the teachers and pupils may have to be dispersed between a number of schools in the area, certainly at least two.</P>
    <P>In regard to school closures, I want to refer to the threatened closure of certain vocational schools in my constituency. In the virtual amalgamation of secondary and vocational education, in so far as certificates are concerned, it was never conveyed to the various vocational committees that there would be closures of technical schools.  One can imagine the shock and dismay with which I and my colleagues in Clonmel received the news that the <Col N="690" /> famed Mullinahone technical school was earmarked for closure.  The shock and dismay were all the greater because Mullinahone school is unique in that it was built by the people themselves, by a great voluntary effort. Literally, the people built the school with their own hands.</P>
    <P>Now they find that what they built up, this status symbol which exists in Mullinahone, this technical school, is, it seems, to be torn down by the Department of Education.  This was dreadful news, coming as it did a few months ago when we were commemorating the centenary of the Fenian Rising.  One might wonder what the Fenian Rising has to do with Mullinahone, but anyone who knows his history will realise that Mullinahone is synonymous with Charles J. Kickham, the great literary man who sacrificed everything so that his country might be free, whose philosophy might be summed up in the words &ldquo;Educate that you may be free.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has been compelled to leave because I was going to make a fervent appeal to him not to close Mullinahone school.  It would be a retrograde step, tantamount to an act of vandalism, and in addition, it is quite unnecessary.  The suggestion that the children should be transported to Callan, which is a considerable number of miles away, is certainly not well received by the parents.  The vocational educational committee to a man are deeply disturbed and I would ask the Minister and the Department to give up this idea of closing this school.  It is in a town which has no industry of any kind.  It is a fair sized market town, depending on the farming community in the hinterland.  This technical school, which, as I said, is a status symbol, is a source of inspiration and pride to the people of the town.  It is the hub of their cultural activity and the Minister's advisers do not realise the damage they will be doing if they proceed along these lines.</P>
    <P>Psychologically, the closing of Mullinahone school will have disastrous consequences.  That this school which they created, their university, should be taken away from them in this way <Col N="691" /> is an act of ingratitude which they would feel very deeply.  This is not just the closure of a school; it is a threat to all that the community holds dear and it must not be allowed to happen.  I appeal to my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davern, and to Deputy Fahey who is here also to use their good offices and their influence with the Government to see that this deplorable decision is not implemented.</P>
    <P>The man to whom I have referred, Charles J. Kickham, this great literary giant who stood shoulder to shoulder with Rossa and Devoy and all these great men of the Fenian movement, left us in Tipperary many things which we cherish.  Among his great literary achievements is a book called <i>Knocknagow</i>, otherwise known as <i>The Homes of Tipperary.</i>  I am pleading now for this school which was built by the men and women of Tipperary with their own hands and which has served the homes of Tipperary in Mullinahone and its surrounding areas for a goodly number of years.  It would be an insult to the memory of Charles J. Kickham whom we commemorated last year at Mullinahone and paid due tribute to him for his courage, his daring and his sacrifices that this country of ours might be free.  Ironically at about the time we were celebrating in Mullinahone&mdash;and my colleagues were with me there too on that occasion&mdash;plans were made and were being put into operation for the closure of the educational edifice which his successors created in that town.  I hope I have said sufficient to save Mullinahone school and if I have not said sufficient to retain it and to convince the Minister of the worthiness of my plea, I can rely on countless stalwart men and women to give back the answer when the right time comes.</P>
    <P>While I am talking of technical schools as such, I want to advert to a situation which has arisen at another worthy school in Tipperary, Cappawhite technical school.  The Minister must be well aware of the repeated representations made to him by the CEO of the South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee expressing <Col N="692" /> concern about what we consider to be the outright poaching of pupils from this catchment area and transporting them to an outside catchment area.  I understood when these catchment areas were drawn up by the Department of Education that they were virtually sacrosanct and that it was intrinsically wrong for anyone to poach from one area to another.  The vocational education committee, of which I am a member of long standing, is satisfied that endeavours have been made, and are probably continuing, to entice children to go to an outside technical school, children who are within the immediate area of Cappawhite and certainly within the catchment area and should be going to Cappawhite vocational school.  They are being advised to go to another school in North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>This constitutes a serious threat to the future of Cappawhite if allowed to continue and the person or persons of influence, and influence over parents in particular&mdash;and enticement is, as far as I am concerned, certainly a very moderate word to use in this matter&mdash;who can very easily entice them to send their children elsewhere, have done that.  As a result, scores of children have been lost to Cappawhite technical school to which they had a particular allegiance and have been transported to Newport in North Tipperary instead.</P>
    <P>For some reason or another, the Minister has been unable or unwilling to receive a deputation in respect of this important matter of the future of Cappawhite.  He has had his legitimate excuse in recent weeks and months&mdash; the threat of the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease and his disinclination, perhaps understandably, to receive a deputation from the heart of Tipperary.  I wonder if he is satisfied, in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, that the threat of foot-and-mouth has eased to the extent that he might now be good enough to receive this deputation. He will then hear confirmation of my expressions here of the anxiety and worry which agitates the minds of all the members of the vocational education committee, and particularly those members in the Cappawhite <Col N="693" /> area, about the unfair poaching that has been going on and the violation of this catchment area.  I should like the Minister to tell me at some stage whether he does regard the catchment areas as places in which the children would be expected to go to school within that area rather than being enticed or cajoled to go into another area.</P>
    <P>These then are some of the sentiments I wanted to express in respect of the effects on our education system, on my constituents, and the schools of my constituency.  I want to tell the Minister that I make a particularly special plea for the retention of Mullinahone vocational school.  I feel that the Minister who is fair, understanding and progressive will see that Mullinahone is no ordinary school; Mullinahone is a symbol of all that is good and noble in that townland synonymous with the name of Kickham, the product of the people by a particularly great voluntary effort and something which must not and shall not be filched from them by any Department of Education.</P>
    <P>We support the Minister in all his progressive designs.  I congratulated him in my native tongue and I congratulate him now in English on his courage and daring in achieving this magnificent break-through in our education system.  To him the greater credit belongs.  I have mentioned some of the defects which still require to be attended to.  No doubt they will receive attention in good time.  We support the Minister in all that he does to bring about that happy day when we can have an Ireland of happy homes in which our children will be given an opportunity to apply their talents, energy and genius in the service of their country.  That is the Ireland to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by expressing the ardent hope that an amicable understanding will be arrived at between the Minister's Department and the schools and parents to whom I have referred, and that we will not have too dictatorial an approach by the Minister's advisers on the question as to whether a school will be closed or remain open.  We hope that there will be goodwill and co-operation so that <Col N="694" /> we may go on together to build the free education system which we all desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little need for me or for anyone else to shower further praise on the Minister.  That would be gilding the lily as far as his policy and his activity as Minister for Education is concerned.  Suffice it to say that the 106,000 children who are now receiving free post-primary education and their parents have sung his praises throughout the length and breadth of the land.  There are 80,000 this year who are able to avail of post-primary education.  Post-primary education will be available to all children and will not be confined to those whose parents are in a position to pay for it. The credit for all this must go to the Minister for Education for implementing the scheme, to the Minister for Finance for making the money available, and last but by no means least, to the tax-paying public who have fully entered into the spirit of this tremendous effort on behalf of the nation.</P>
      <P>This is one of the soundest investments of all time.  It will show a return in quicker time than any other investment. The boys and girls now entering post-primary education at the age of 12 and 13 years will in six years time be men and women who will have to face up to the many difficulties of wresting from the world a living compatible with their ability.  They are now being given an opportunity to do this by the system of free post-primary education.  It is up to them to take every possible advantage of the opportunities presented to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the closure of schools, I attended what was possibly one of the first meetings in connection with this matter in South Tipperary, at Ballyhurst, where a one-teacher school was being closed.  Naturally, that aroused indignation and there were the usual side issues connected with local meetings, particularly when an institution of long-standing is being taken from the people.  However, I can assure the Minister and all here concerned that the parents of the children attending that school, which was a one-teacher <Col N="695" /> school&mdash;a position which was fair neither to pupils nor to the teacher who was trying to cope with six classes&mdash;are now loudest in their praise of the new arrangement whereby the majority of the children are attending a school in Tipperary town which is a one-class/one-teacher school.</P>
    <P>There is one regret that I have however with regard to the Protestant and non-Catholic children attending national schools.  We have adopted a policy on the closure of one-teacher and two-teacher schools for most of the children of the nation, but the children of the minority denominations cannot avail of the facilities afforded to the majority.  The Minister is sympathetic to their special case.  As a minority group, they must be protected more zealously, possibly, than any other group.  They have certainly many disadvantages under the present structure.  With all respect, I would ask that there should be established central schools in areas, particularly areas such as South Tipperary-West Waterford, for Protestant children, and facilities instituted for them because of the fact that they come from widely scattered areas.</P>
    <P>Under the present system a child can attend a national school up to the age of 11 or 12 years.  In some cases hardship is imposed on parents who, due to the type of structure of the national school in the locality, have to send their children to boarding-school at, say, the age of nine or ten years.  This interferes with home life and community life at this important time of a child's life.</P>
    <P>The question of the mentally handicapped has been mentioned by previous speakers.  I should like to thank the Minister for his dynamic approach to this very real problem.  He has sanctioned a school for the mentally handicapped at Cashel which will serve South Tipperary and a good portion of North Tipperary.  Tenders for this school have been advertised and I am quite sure that even as I speak, the successful contractor is already notified. This is a step forward in dealing with a real problem.  In the past six or seven years, this matter has been receiving <Col N="696" /> the attention of the public and the Minister has acted in regard to it in the most expeditious fashion.</P>
    <P>Up to the present time vocational schools were, in many instances, regarded as the poor relation in the matter of education.  The Minister has rectified this attitude by the introduction of the common intermediate certificate.  The curricula of these schools will include the normal academic subjects included in the curricula of secondary schools but will also place particular emphasis on skills and crafts.  This is something of real value to the children in rural Ireland.  The vocational school pupil will be a technician in his own right.  The knowledge that he will obtain there in regard to maintenance of farm machinery may make all the difference to the boy who returns to a farm as to whether he makes a loss or profit on his farm.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of education is the establishment of parent-teacher associations.  It is wrong for a parent to sit back and leave all the decisions as to what a child should do, the examination or course he or she should follow, to a teacher or anyone else. Parents themselves must be actively interested.  I believe parents could gain from a closer liaison with the teachers and the children; such liaison would ensure the children being steered and guided to the courses best suited to them and the subjects for which they show the greatest aptitude.</P>
    <P>I should like it if the Minister could in the not too distant future introduce vocational guidance officers in the classrooms when the children reach the intermediate certificate standard, which would be about 15 years of age, and should be in a position more or less to make up their minds.  Here, as in other countries, we have far too many people equipped with the wrong type of education.  Too many children are allowed to go on in happy-go-lucky fashion to leaving certificate, a certificate which equips them for neither the right kind of job nor the job for which they are best suited.  For some peculiar reason, the leaving certificate has become the hallmark of a well educated person.  That is really fallacious and many of those who hold <Col N="697" /> the leaving certificate might be far better off with a dog licence.  There are too many competing for the same type of job, clerkships and so on.</P>
    <P>This has been amply demonstrated in our universities.  Only 35 per cent of undergraduates come out with a degree and that means that 65 per cent are not fit subjects for university and are wasting their time.  One cannot stop them wasting time, but one can save themselves and their parents embarrassment.  Indeed, parents in the past might have been saved a good deal of money had the entrance standard been fixed at a higher level.  The Minister has taken care of that this year in that one honours in leaving certificate will be essential for entrance to university.  Next year, I understand it will be two honours.  This will result in a higher entrance standard and it may help to eliminate a good deal of the wastage.  Students filling lecture rooms and taking up places can adversely affect others who might make much better use of these places but who, because of lack of accommodation, cannot enter university.</P>
    <P>These are a few pertinent points. They are points which could be given a better airing at a later date when the Minister has had time to study them more fully.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transportation of children, particularly in the rural areas, those travelling long distances of eight or nine miles have to start early in the morning and return home at three or four o'clock in the evening when the light is beginning to fail.  A parent-teacher association could do valuable work by initiating some scheme of hot meals at midday for these children.  The idea of free meals should have gone out with the soup kitchen, but a hot meal organised by the parents would be a boon to the children and would be important from the point of view of the involvement of the parents in the education of their children.  The Minister may have enough on his plate without getting free meals under way, but the parents and managers could give a lead and ensure that these children have a reasonably substantial midday meal. At the moment the children can <Col N="698" /> scarcely benefit to the fullest possible extent from the teaching that takes place in the afternoon because they have had no proper midday meal.</P>
    <P>I sympathise and agree with some of the matters adverted to by Deputy Treacy.  I know, however, that the Minister is in the position of having all the facts at his command.  He has not allowed his judgment to be swayed or distorted by pleas, particularly invalid pleas.  We should not be too parochial; I can be as guilty of that as the next.  We are rather prone to the modern philosophy of &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo;.  The Minister, on the other hand, has to take into account the national interest and that is bound up more than anyone perhaps realises with the potential capacity and ability of the children of the nation.  These are the immediate charge of the Minister so long as he retains that portfolio; if he continues to implement so many revolutionary policies and to such good effect, he will hold the office for many long years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most revolutionary improvements in education has been the expansion in the transport of pupils to primary schools.  Conditions in the past, when children travelled on foot in all kinds of weather, to and from school, spending the day in the classroom in wet clothing, were responsible for a great deal of the rheumatism and tuberculosis rife in the country.  For that reason alone, the Minister has done a great deal by extending the transport scheme.  It is, however, a mistake to correlate that expansion with the closing of schools.  Reading the newspapers, one is aware of the agitation because of unfit schools.  We have a great many schools which are structurally unsound.  Some have been described as &ldquo;rat-infested dumps.&rdquo;  But the Minister would want to be careful not to allow himself to be led into the error of believing that, if he is providing transport over a certain area, that necessarily connotes the closing down of a school which is structurally sound, built possibly within the past 20 years.  This has been happening in some areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particular complaints in <Col N="699" /> my own constituency.  We are fairly well able to look after ourselves, but when we discover that a school which is structurally sound is to be closed down, if we do not think such closing is in the best interests of the pupils, the parents, or the teachers, we resist such a closure with all the force at our command.  Human nature being what it is, and remembering the bureaucratic system under which we operate it is only natural that schemes and plans should be laid and maps drawn behind closed doors; if transport is provided, the planners say that there is no longer any reason why a particular school should be kept open.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that until the backlog has been cleared and we have been provided with all the schools required, it is bad policy to close any school which is structurally sound.  It is bad policy to do that until such time as all the uninhabitable schools have been bulldozed and replaced by modern, up-to-date educational centres.</P>
    <P>I should like to give that note of warning to the Minister who may be carried away by his own enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of those who advise him to plan so that we can create a situation in which children are transported to school in such a way that nobody has to go to a two-teacher school.  We must take into consideration the social conditions applying to every area.  In my constituency we are fortunate in having comparatively sound school buildings structurally and perhaps the matters I am referring to do not apply to my county as they do to some of the poorer areas where this very acute problem exists.</P>
    <P>There is one more point I wish to make before leaving school transport. It was referred to by Deputy Treacy and I was pleased to note that the Labour Party at times realise the value of private enterprise.  In some areas transport has been handed over almost entirely to CIE.  With the kindest thoughts towards CIE, they somehow or another always succeed in introducing the dead hand of officialdom into everything.  We are not so much concerned in the part of Wexford in which I live but in South Wexford, CIE practically <Col N="700" /> control the entire transport arrangements so that time and again the planning mind comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Buses can pass the doorsteps of children but the plan is there and the children have to be collected at a particular point.  Therefore, to a large extent the benefits that could accrue from free school transport are nullified because children outside whose doors the buses pass have sometimes to walk a mile or a mile and a half to get the bus in the morning and have to walk home the same distance in the evening.  This does not happen because of some official planning mind in the Department of Education but because of the mind within the confines of CIE which dictates that though the buses pass their doors, some children must walk as much as a mile to the point of collection.</P>
    <P>One other point I wish to make brings me to a matter for which the Department are responsible.  As far as I know, the plan is that children are collected and transported only if they live outside a certain radius of primary schools.  That sounds grand but when minibuses and other CIE vehicles come to collect the children, those living inside the three mile radius, or whatever it is, are not collected.  There is no sense in the world in that.  Because a child lives two and half miles from a school and can be collected, why should a bus not also collect another child living 1¾ miles away?  These are things the Minister should consider seriously because otherwise the benefits that could accrue will be nullified.  The Minister will get plenty of opportunity to consider such cases because he will get them from practically every Deputy from every part of the country.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion here about universities and I am inclined to agree with Deputy Lindsay that the chosen word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; was not a wise one.  I appreciate what the Minister and the Government are trying to do.  They are trying to save money.  However, a better and more operative description would have been a unified effort between universities.  The universities in Dublin, the National University and Trinity College, have somewhat <Col N="701" /> different outlooks on life generally. In the first flush of enthusiasm, when everybody was asked to co-operate, when the spirit of ecumenism became widespread, there was this encouragement and everyone, including the professors and the dons in the two universities, felt that a merger was advisable.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is.  The idea of having, shall we say, an overall governing university authority, with representation from all, is possible and it would probably be advantageous for the different universities.  It would make it possible for those who direct the policies of the universities to meet and discuss the question, but the idea of a merger, with the idea of ultimate amalgamation, is out of the question.</P>
    <P>History dies very hardly.  I am not a graduate of either the National University or Trinity and therefore I feel freer to speak.  Trinity College is one of the oldest universities in what was originally known as the British Isles &mdash;I suppose it is almost treason today to use that description; I am speaking geographically.  The National University was founded about the turn of the century and it is unlikely that the traditions and the ideals of both are the same or that they would blend satisfactorily in a merger.  I suggest the Minister should forget that term and approach the matter from another angle.  If he does so, he will get co-operation from all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity&mdash;I am sure the Minister has had&mdash;of attending the different universities from time to time and of speaking at what are known as symposia on subjects relating to different matters.  I have gone to Trinity and the National University in Dublin, to Galway and to Cork Universities, and I have always been impressed by the independence of identity they all have, to a certain extent.  Therefore, if the Minister is trying to bring about a fusion, he should first of all allow the universities to continue with their individual identity.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the matter of the universities, there is another warning I should like to give to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> With the changing times, the professions are not as populous as they used to be and I know that already there is a tremendous shortage of doctors in the UK.  The problem there of procuring medically qualified people has become so acute that the British fighting services are paying students and many of the students are joining Irish universities. Their fees are being paid and their education being carried out on the basis that they will be prepared to enter one of the fighting services in Britain.  I mention that because the shortage in the professions that exists today in the UK will obtain here to-morrow. Already we have evidence of it.  I do not know what the cure is. Perhaps the cure is the antidote.</P>
    <P>If in ten or 12 years we are to find ourselves, as we probably shall, with a grave shortage in the professions, we may have to try to do something on the lines of what is being done by the fighting services in Britain.  We shall have to encourage people to take courses of studies in the professions and ensure that we retain them in this country afterwards.  We shall have to subsidise their education and ensure that we retain their services afterwards. It is the only way we can offset the problem we shall have to face in the not too distant future.  I should like to thank the Minister for what he has done in regard to the education of mentally handicapped children.  I am a member of a private organisation in my county which concerns itself with the education of mentally handicapped children.  That organisation worked hard to secure the education of those less favoured people in this country. The national conscience has been aroused recently in relation to mentally handicapped children.  We have struggled over the last number of years while different Ministers have occupied the position of the present Minister for Education but we did not have any success in receiving support from the official angle in relation to those children. I am now happy to say that all the differences which existed between my organisation and the Department of Education have been resolved and we have received the greatest help imaginable from the Department so <Col N="703" /> that we have been able to start a school for moderately handicapped children in Enniscorthy which embraces the greater part of County Wexford.  We will have a school built on the lines referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, who spoke just now, at Cashel in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this point to the Minister, as it is one he may not have realised.  It very often happens that mentally handicapped children come from very poor homes and, shall we say, homes of not very good ethical and social standards.  Those children come to the schools and they are literally clothed and fed by the organisation of which I happen to have the honour of being a member.  They are taught cleanliness in life and better standards of living.  Those children are usually allowed to stay in one of those schools until they reach the age of about 16 years.  The time will come when those children will no longer be in those schools.  What is the future for them? Has the State anything to offer in relation to those children?  Is it a problem which is being thought about? Have we any rehabilitation centre to cater for those children and to instruct them so that they may earn their own living and perhaps in time achieve a better standard of living and social conditions than they would enjoy if they went back to their own homes immediately after leaving those schools?</P>
    <P>I might add, to enlarge a little on that, that those children, apart from the fact that they are being taught to read and write, although their intellect is very limited through no fault of theirs&mdash;an injury at birth is the usual cause&mdash;are able to make mats, baskets and such things.  I am not aware outside of the city of Dublin of any rehabilitation centre to take over those children and train them so that they may be able to continue further and possibly be able to make a living.  In the past people were down on those children.  They were told they were stupid but now they are getting kindness. I should like to see the Department having something in mind to continue with the work which is being done in those schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Another point I should like to raise with the Minister before I sit down is that we live in an age in which there is a good deal of crime among youth. This is a materialistic age and there is no doubt that social workers and church dignitaries are fully alive to the difficulties of youth, particularly in our larger centres.  I do not believe there is any real link up to date between the many youth centres run, again by private enterprise and by people who are giving, without any reward, thought, time and service, and those particular groups which are functioning throughout the country.  It seems to me that the time has come when an overall lead might be given by the Minister for Education to co-ordinate those groups and to have an institution for training experts on youth guidance.</P>
    <P>Quite recently in my own part of the country, the Bishop of Ferns decided in his wisdom&mdash;how right he was&mdash;to send one of his clergy away for youth training.  He had to go to the United Kingdom to get that training because no such centre exists here.  I suggest to the Minister that he co-ordinate all those youth groups.  The Minister has initiated a lot of things in this country but I do not think he has done anything on this line.  He should invite all those groups to come together.  He might check on them from time to time.  At the beginning, he might have a symposium in Dublin&mdash;everything seems to start in Dublin as it is regarded as the centre of the country&mdash; to bring all those groups together.  All those groups would then be made known to one another.  They should be given a subvention to help with a youth training centre.</P>
    <P>Come what may, we are no worse than any other country but all those countries have realised this.  Bigger and wealthier countries such as the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany and France have become aware of this problem and have been dealing with it.  They have innumerable colleges for the training of youth leaders for those youth centres.  It is essential to have experts on this.  We can learn from other people in other countries and I would ask the Minister to give attention to this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister and, through him, his Department on focussing so much attention on this most essential and fundamental subject of education.  There is no doubt that, during the past 12 months, the topic of education has become one of very lively discussion in every household in the country.  I know the money is not coming out of his own pocket but the Minister is providing millions more money than was ever provided before in this country for this purpose.  I realise it is not free in the sense that nobody has to pay for it but the Minister has been able to convince the Government that the money should be made available.</P>
      <P>It is very obvious from this debate that radical changes such as those the Minister proposes cannot be made without treading on somebody's corns. There are vested interests and traditions which are hard to move.  Also, there are sentimental reasons which will express themselves when change occurs, even though the change means progress.  I hope and I am sure, knowing the man, that that will not daunt the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee.  Due to the changes in the educational systems, we found in Cork that we had trebled the number of students who wanted enrolment in our classes last September.  With the best intentions of the chief executive officer and of the committee, we would not have been able to house those pupils, recruit staff and make all the necessary arrangements for their education because, of necessity, the College of Technology will not or cannot be built for some years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork regards itself as the cradle of vocational education and we have a special regard for it.  I want to put on record our appreciation of the wonderful co-operation we received through the Minister from his Department and the officials, where my area is concerned&mdash;so much so that we had not to turn away one single pupil when the new term started.  We were able to make-do with various buildings, reconstructed and renovated in a short space <Col N="706" /> of time.  We have heard so often about red tape in Government Departments but it seems to have been cut in all directions in order to make that possible. Therefore, I want to put it on record that, although we had not a building called a college of technology, we certainly had everything else in the way of pupils, staff and facilities.</P>
    <P>I had the greatest sympathy with the last speaker and with those others who mentioned the problem of the retarded child.  I think this is a field where the Minister should and will do all he can to help but it is a field in which there is a tremendous need for voluntary effort.  In Cork, I think we are very far advanced in this respect. We have the Cork Polio and After-care Association looking after mentally and physically-retarded children and, indeed, people up to adult age. We also have the Rehabilitation Institute and we have a branch of the National Association for Cerebral Palsy.  The latter are building a new school which they hope to have open before this year is out.  My personal experience shows me and proves to me that, with the best intentions in the world, officialdom cannot be the full answer to the question of the retarded or physically-handicapped child.  Voluntary effort is required.  In this country, there is a tremendous well of support from volunteers, so long as they are made to understand the children and so long as it is understood that their efforts are welcome.  We find that situation&mdash;and I am sure it is true of every part of the country.  If we can harness that to the official mind and get the support that is necessary for the voluntary effort then we shall do a great deal to break the back of this problem which has come to the forefront only in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the National Gallery.  I am aware of the efforts he has made.  I know how far we have advanced in the past couple of years in the matter of getting pictures of merit sent around the country to local galleries that can house such pictures. If it comes within this Department, I would ask him to look also at the question of museums.  There must be at least one-third, if not maybe much <Col N="707" /> more, of the treasures of the National Museum which are never on exhibit and which would be very welcome for exhibition in places such as Cork, where we have a civic museum.  I realise that the question of the insurance of the pictures arose.  I am fully aware of the efforts that have been made and of the solution, such as it is, to bridge that gap and to make it possible to get the pictures to places such as Cork.  I thank the Minister and I should like to join in paying a tribute to the Curator of the National Gallery for the work he is doing there.  I am grateful for the increasing interest displayed by our people in this very valuable medium of education.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now about the teaching of elocution in the schools. Nowadays, when a business concern has a job for, say, a clerical officer and wants a boy with honours leaving certificate they will receive as many as 40 applications in reply to their advertisement from boys who are all qualified on paper and who have equal qualifications.  It is the boy who can speak out, who can express himself properly and who shows that he has personality who, in nine times out of ten, will get the job.  Far from its being a case of influence by some Deputy or some friend who knows the boss of the concern, as we enter into an era where there is keener and keener competition it is the most presentable boy and the young man with personality who will get the job.  There is not anything like enough attention being paid to this important matter. I do not think the girls suffer to the same extent as do the boys.  Generally speaking, a girl who has had a secondary education speaks much better than a boy who has had a secondary education. The boy is so much more shy. He does not find it easy to express himself.  Very often, because of this want in his education, a talented man will not get on as well as he should in business.</P>
    <P>There are various forms of musical expression.  I suggest that, by every means in his power, the Minister should encourage the holding of dramatic shows in the schools and <Col N="708" /> judging the pupils on their speech. Perhaps a certificate could be issued to those who pass tests in speech.  It is a most important matter and it is a facet of education that has been neglected in this country.  In Cork, we have the Blarney Stone and we are said to have the gift of eloquence but it is a sad fact that there are many brilliant students there who are very poor at expressing themselves properly and that is a reflection on somebody. I am speaking rather strongly about it because I have so often heard industrialists in the city of Cork say that they have to take somebody from perhaps another area who has not the academic qualifications of local persons who offer themselves for employment but who is so much the better able to speak and express himself and who is thus able to put his personality across to better effect than perhaps the local person.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on all he has achieved since he became Minister for Education.  Twelve months ago, even some of us on this side of the House thought that all the talk about free secondary education and free transport for post-primary pupils might be a pipe-dream and yet, within even that short space of time, these things have become a reality.  Many progressive steps have been taken by this Minister for Education&mdash;maybe not all of them 100 per cent yet.  I want to thank and to congratulate the Minister on the good work he has done and through him, I want to thank every official in his Department who had hand, act or part in it.  I sincerely trust that everything the Minister has in mind for the coming year will become a reality and that when the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Education comes before this House for consideration in 12 months time we shall be able further to congratulate him as sincerely as we now do on the tremendous step-forward he has taken to put education in its rightful place in this country.  Education is the same for all peoples.  It is what we must depend on to take any kind of place among the nations of the earth.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to speak long on this Estimate. Having listened to speakers on the far side of the House, I am sure the Minister must be almost embarrassed by the amount of praise that has been showered on him.  A certain amount of it is no doubt due to the Minister; he made a good try and I wish him every success in his educational programme.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of talk these days about free education.  I have not heard one Deputy on the other side of the House refer to the fact that the amount of the Estimate for the Department of Education this year is £38,325,400, an increase of £4½ million over last year.  Does anybody really believe that our children will be educated for nothing when it costs that £38 million to educate them?  I have yet to hear a Deputy on that side of the House mention that £38 million is being spent on our system of education.  Let nobody tell me there is free education. That £38 million has to come from somewhere.  The taxpayers will pay it and those children who are being educated will in their turn pay.</P>
      <P>My main reason for standing up is to deal with problems which affect my own county of Galway.  They are many and they are varied.  I should like first to deal with some of the problems in primary education in County Galway. I am glad to see that the Irish National Teachers Organisation are coming more out of their shell than they have come in the past and that they are to a certain extent dictating to the managers and letting the managers know, directly or indirectly, that a better primary school standard is needed throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The standard of many of our primary schools is something we cannot be very proud of.  It was good to see last week that the INTO have at last come out in support of members of their organisation in the hope that this will prompt the Department of Education and the Minister to ensure that these schools which we hear so much about not being fit for teachers or for children will not continue like that in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> There is also a lot of talk about one-and two-teacher schools.  I am not at all quite sure that the policy of the Minister in closing the majority of these schools&mdash;I suppose in time all of these schools&mdash;is altogether the right and proper policy.  Leaving aside the one-teacher school, as far as the two-teacher school is concerned, it plays a greater part in the life of rural Ireland than educating the children in a particular district.  The teachers are guides to local farmers and the policy of the Government and the Minister in closing these schools is not a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is one of these schools with which I am concerned, Carrowkeel National School.  An official of the Department carried out a survey there recently and he estimated that in five or six years time, there will be only 46 children going to that school.  There is a new school needed there and it has been decided by the Department to close that particular school and amalgamate it with a larger school in the town of Dunmore, notwithstanding the fact that a deposit was paid on the school to the Department of Education a number of years ago; a pump was sunk for water and the electric light cable is outside the school.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in this case because I feel there is need for this school at Carrowkeel, and he might even tell the inspector of the Department to come down and meet the parents and discuss the problem with them.  It was also stated that there are advantages in a larger school.  There may be advantages in a larger school but the parents and the children who attend Carrowkeel at the moment want a new school built there.</P>
    <P>There is another problem relating to a co-educational school at Abbeyknockmoy. About five or six weeks ago, we had a meeting in Abbeyknockmoy which one of the local representatives attended.  We had representatives from the county committee of education and the problem came up there about the closure of this co-educational school.  We had Deputy Kitt who was elected chairman and we had the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator <Col N="711" /> Ó Buachalla, representing the educational council.  They spoke to the people there about what they would do for them.  I did not realise until after that meeting that there was a decision to close the school.  These people knew it, but still they went along with these flowery promises that they would put proposals to the Minister and the Department of Education in an effort to keep this school open, when in actual fact it would be a miracle if it were kept open.</P>
    <P>There is another school, a secondary school, in Coolarne.  We had a meeting there last night.  It emerged that it is the will of the teachers, the parents and the children who attend that school that that secondary school should remain open.  All the Deputies from East Galway and from West Galway were invited to that meeting but those Deputies who support the Government were conspicuous by their absence. Some of those Deputies who had recently frequented Turloughmore in their cars could not find time to come down when the people needed them to keep the school at Coolarne open.  This secondary school was opened on 8th September, 1965.  There are 82 students on the roll, 48 girls and 34 boys. Various reasons have been given by the Department as to why it is intended to close this school.  One of the reasons the Department indicated was that the number of subjects on the curriculum is insufficient.  I would like to tell the Minister there are 13 subjects on the curriculum of the secondary school in Coolarne.  I would be only wasting time to read them out.  There are seven teachers there.  This school is served by four local primary schools which have between them 560 pupils.  It is estimated locally that in a year or two there will be approximately 200 pupils at Coolarne secondary school.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting in connection with this school.  I am sorry there was not a representative of the Government Party there because the parents, the teachers and the children themselves expressed the view that it was essential that this school be kept open.  I would make a sincere appear to the Minister to look into <Col N="712" /> this and to ensure, if possible, that the school remains open.  This school could have obtained various grants from the Department such as those for television sets and science facilities, but they did not avail of these grants because they felt that if they did the Department might maintain that the cost of running the school was too high in relation to the number of pupils attending.  I would make a strong plea to the Minister and his staff to keep the school open.</P>
    <P>The teachers have indicated that if the Department provided the same facilities at Tuam, Mountbellew and Athenry as the students already have at Coolarne, they would be satisfied to close the school.  At present the schools in Tuam are overcrowded. I do not know whether those in Mountbellew are overcrowded or not.  I know Athenry was approached and that no preparation has been made there for the influx of children they will automatically get if the school in Coolarne is closed.  I wonder what the view of the Department is on this?</P>
    <P>I object to the Minister's refusal to meet a deputation.  There is a saying in the West: never send a lad to do a man's job.</P>

      <P>He did not even send the Parliamentary Secretary.  He sent an official of the Department.  The people of Galway elect eight Deputies to the Dáil.  For quite a long time they have been represented by five Fianna Fáil Deputies and three Fine Gael Deputies.  During their time Fianna Fáil have not done one thing for East Galway, or for all Galway for that matter.  Not one of these five Fianna Fáil Deputies ever made an effort to bring one scheme that would be of benefit to the community in East Galway.  Due to the fact that they elect five representatives, would it not be a good thing in return for you to keep this school in Coolarne open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the fact that both these schools, Coolarne and These are the people I represent.  Is there any significance in the fact that <Col N="713" /> Abbeyknockmoy, are both in my area. they are both in my area?  The Fianna Fáil boys are usually trotting after me and the fact that two schools in my area are being closed makes one think. I am making a special plea to the Minister and his Department to keep them open.  The people there want it, no matter what their politics are.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now about the school transport service.  I never agreed with the system of transport. The farmers have been crying out for something to help their income.  Would it not be a good idea if instead of the present transport system, whereby children are collected early in the morning and left home late in the afternoon, and sometimes have to wait a long time for the bus, if a farmer in each village was appointed to bring the children to school?  The children would be under strict supervision while they were in his care and it would suit better in rural areas than the present transport arrangements.  I know the school transport service provides many problems and that it is a mammoth task for any Minister or Department to ensure that every child is carried, but I think my suggestion should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more recreational facilities in schools for boys and girls. Even if it meant putting another bit on the Budget for education, it would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his grant of £1¾ million to University College, Galway.  If Galway University is to keep up with the other universities in Dublin and Cork, it will have to get more money in the future.  The facilities in that university are certainly the worst in Ireland and, I believe, the worst in Europe.  It will have to have fresh capital to compete with the other universities.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave this Estimate without saying a few words on the Irish language. There is much emphasis on Irish at present.  I am a firm believer in the revival of the language, but under the educational system we had in the past many of our children from rural areas who attended these rural schools were forced to learn Irish.  The reason that many of them are now the <Col N="714" /> hewers of wood and the drawers of water in Great Britain is that they wasted a lot of their time at the primary school learning Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this matter earlier, I was rather amused by the Minister's reply.  We were informed that the charges were authorised ten years ago, in 1957.  A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then.  I do not know where the Minister got the figures he gave afterwards in reply to my supplementary, but it reminds me of all the other questions that one asks of the Department of Transport and Power.  I remember asking a question here one day in connection with the railway facilities to Cobh, and the Minister solemnly assured me that there was a most efficient bus service to Cobh, which had not seen a CIE bus for 25 years; and those figures that the Minister has given here today are in line with that.  I do not know where he got them but he should try to get some reliable information.</P>
      <P>The reply further stated that the Minister has to sanction the charges. I am asking him now, as a matter of urgency relating to industry, to review this matter.  The one black spot we have is the fishing industry.  Every other industry in this State has increased its exports over the past 12 months.  The fishing industry, according to the statistics, is down on last year's export figures by £32,000.  We would have increased our exports were it not for the mess that is being made there.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the Harbour Commissioners and the area of which they are in charge.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners Bill went through this House, one of the most outrageous pieces of legislation that was ever passed here.  Under that Bill the county representatives were removed from the board, and the whole Cobh area is now represented by two men, one representing Cobh Urban Council and the other appointed by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising it. I am telling the position to the Minister who informs me of the people who are in charge of the area.  I can tell him how these charges were imposed. When the secretary of the Harbour Board went in, he said: &ldquo;I am sorry, gentlemen, but I have increased costs this year amounting to £100,000.&rdquo;  One gentleman representing the coal industry says: &ldquo;You are not going to put it on my coal.&rdquo; Another gentleman says: &ldquo;You are not going to put it on my grain.&rdquo; A third gentleman says: &ldquo;You are not going to put it on my rubber.&rdquo; There was nothing left to put it on except the unfortunate farmers' fertilisers and the fish.  This is a complete change as far as Cobh is concerned. The town of Cobh has lost completely the liner traffic it had.  The liners are no longer calling there, due again to the activities that were engaged in.  The airport that should be beside Cobh has been moved over to Farmers' Cross, although it has been said that that location is unsuitable due to fog. These are the things under which we suffer, and it is about time that a bunch of pirates above in the tail end of the stream ceased their authority over a good harbour.  These dues are imposed to cover the cost of dredging in the tail end of that stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people, the southern fishing fleet, were fishing over in Dunmore East.  They had to travel a day without getting fish and they were hitting the tail end of Cork Harbour, and suddenly they found themselves in the middle of plenty, in the middle of shoals of fish.  It took them a day to get back; they were losing two days fishing with one catch, and they then very wisely decided that they would shift from Dunmore East into Cobh for their fishing.  What happened to them?  The landing charges in Dunmore East were 3d a cran; in addition to that there was a charge of £5 per year for the amenities of the port. When they came into Cobh, they found that the 3d a cran became 6d and that instead of paying £5 a year, they paid, <Col N="716" /> according to the size of their boats, anything from 25s to 30s every time they came into Cobh with their catch.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that this is a commercial harbour.  Commercial for what?  It is a dead harbour at present except for the ships that pass through it up to the pirates' lair in Cork.  If we are to improve our fishing industry, if we are to go ahead and provide something for the town of Cobh instead of the liners which have ceased to call, here is the opportunity.  At present there is no commercial trade so far as shipping is concerned in Cobh.  Ships just pass through, going up to Cork city.  That is all they are doing.  We are endeavouring now to establish Cobh as a shipping port.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to instruct the Cork Harbour Commissioners to charge the same rate at Cobh as is charged at Dunmore East and other ports in Donegal and other counties. I do not think that is asking anything unfair and it will make a difference of, perhaps, £½ million a year in our exports of fish because we have facilities there such as cold storage.  We can provide the facilities and we are prepared to provide them.</P>
    <P>If this is to be fought, it will be a long fight and a bitter fight, and I can promise the Minister that the people will win.  We have them from all parts of the country.  We have six from your country, a Cheann Comhairle.  We have five or six more from Wexford. We have some from Waterford, from Dublin, from Howth and Dún Laoghaire, in the town of Cobh earning this money from exports which the country so badly needs.  Are we to be deprived of it because of the action of a bunch of pirates?  I can think of no fitter description for this old pals movement: &ldquo;You do not vote to increase the harbour dues on my coal and I will not vote to increase the harbour dues on your grain.&rdquo;  That is the way the game is played.  Moryah, it is business.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister quite honestly to do this.  He has the power to do it.  If he had not, I would not ask him.  If he writes down tomorrow morning and tells Cork Harbour Commissioners to charge the same dues on fishing boats coming into Cobh <Col N="717" /> harbour&mdash;not Cork&mdash;as are charged in other fishing centres, I guarantee to him that Cork Harbour Commissioners will do their job.  Otherwise, I will make them do it.  That is it, short and sweet.  I am leaving it in the hands of the Minister to do his job.  There was a drop of £32,000 in our exports of fish during the past 12 months.  I can honestly say that I was not greatly interested in this phase of the fishing industry, but I now know that for six weeks these men could fish only three days a week because of the marketing position.  There was a loss of £100,000 worth of fish in those six weeks.  If the Minister does his part, I guarantee on my own behalf and on behalf of the fishermen concerned, that the position in regard to his Estimate will be far happier this time 12 months than it will be tomorrow when we are dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has made quite an elaborate case here as to why the harbour dues should be reduced by the Cork Harbour Commissioners in relation to the increased herring fishing that has taken place in the Cork harbour area or, as he prefers to describe it, the Cobh harbour area over the past couple of months.</P>
      <P>Let me say first of all in reply to his question in the House today, I pointed out that these charges were approved 11 years ago by order of the Minister at that time, and that on application by the harbour authorities, the Minister makes an order confirming the harbour charges.  They have to be advertised and persons may make objections to them.  Those objections are considered by the Minister.  I accept that it is probably unfair to fling that type of reply back at Deputy Corry because the emergence of herring fishing in the Cork harbour area has only now drawn attention to the problem at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that the charges set by Cork Harbour Commissioners are the maximum charges set, as I already pointed out to-day in reply to the question.  There is no reason why Cork Harbour Commissioners could not reduce that figure and, in fact, if <Col N="718" /> they decided to do so, I could not prevent them.  They do not need my sanction in any shape or form.  So I am rather surprised that Deputy Corry should ask me or the Minister to dictate to Cork Harbour Commissioners in this regard without first having taken up the matter directly with them.  Deputy Corry alleged tonight that Cork Harbour Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are a corrupt body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are opposed to the development of Cobh as such.  I think that is rather an unfair charge.  Knowing Deputy Corry so well.  I can appreciate the point the Deputy makes about various people with various interests opposing an increase in harbour dues on coal and grain and rubber but also, knowing him so well, I can imagine that if there were any increases, especially on grain coming in, he would have a different story to bring into this House.  I am quite satisfied that he would again have a question in the House in regard to increased harbour dues on imported grain and he would have me back on the Adjournment to see if there was anything I could do to prevent the harbour authorities from increasing harbour dues on the importation of grain.  Similarly, if there was an increase in harbour dues on raw rubber, the same case could be made on behalf of the workers in Dunlops.  Those are facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is unfair of Deputy Corry to suggest that Cork harbour is in itself just a place at the end of the steam that needs to be dredged in order to keep it there.  That is too derogatory a remark about Cork harbour and certainly I think the proper approach in this instance would have been direct to the Cork Harbour authorities stressing that this is a new development. We must appreciate that the coming of the fishing fleet into Cobh over the past two months has been a new development due to the movement of herring shoals in that specific area.  I already pointed out to the Deputy when he mentioned that he did not know where I got my figures&mdash;I notice that Deputy Corry was quite careful not to use a figure which he used to-day <Col N="719" /> during Question Time, a figure of £1,786 which he said the harbour authorities had collected by way of dues from the fishermen of this area over the past six weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;taking dues as being the overall coverage, covering the tonnage rates and the goods rates, and in reply I said to-day to the Deputy that during the month of December, which is the one month for which at the moment we can say we have figures supplied to us by the Cork harbour authorities, 106 Irish fishing vessels entered the port and the total harbour dues incurred were £104 14s. in tonnage rates and £96 15s. in goods rates.  That would be the cran charge to which the Deputy referred.  The total amount taken in by Cork Harbour Commissioners during the month of December in dues, therefore, was £201 9s.  That came from 106 vessels entering the port in that period. In the period from 1st January to 23rd January, 85 vessels entered.  I have not figures for dues collected during that period but Deputy Corry has mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when speaking now, and again when speaking yesterday, asking supplementary questions arising from a question to the Minister for Agriculture, that there was a certain restriction due to marketing difficulties but I assume that you had in or about the same number of fishing vessels in the month of January as December. I assume the average was the same and that is a pretty fair assumption, I should say.  I think the figure taken in harbour dues was something in the region of £400 which would be about one-quarter of the figure claimed by the Deputy when asking his supplementaries to-day.  I also mentioned in replying to-day that the total figure of £201 which had been collected <i>in toto</i> from those 106 fishing vessels during the month of December was out of a total of £23,000 which would <Col N="720" /> have been the approximate income from the sale of this fish.  That would be roughly £217 worth of fish sold from each vessel during the month of December.  Out of that £217 Cork Harbour Commissioners looked for £1 18s. and Deputy Corry feels that act of piracy is something which justifies raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>Not alone that, but I am satisfied that these people are very interested in the development of Cobh Harbour and Cork Harbour and it is rather remarkable that Deputy Corry who knows that Whitegate and Haulbowline and Rushbrooke are all in the lower harbour should say that this particular port is only developed in the upper river, or the mouth of the stream, as he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised at this.  I think the more rational approach, if it is a case that the fishermen feel they are being overburdened with dues, would be to make a reasonable approach to Cork Harbour Commissioners with a view to seeing if they would reduce the actual fees.  I think that coming up to the Dáil and slating the Commissioners on this matter is not the best approach and I believe that if a logical case were put up to <Col N="721" /> them, they would deal with it in a reasonable manner.  I think the coming of the herring shoals to Cobh is something that brought profit to that area and I do not think that the creation of civil war between Cobh and Cork is the ideal way of dealing with this situation. I suggest that reason should prevail and that a rational approach be made to the Harbour Commissioners to ascertain their views.  Certainly, there is no question of the necessity for the Minister's or my approval to any <Col N="722" /> reduced rates.  The maximum rates are those that are fixed and the Commissioners can reduce these as they see fit but they cannot charge any more than the maximum.</P>

      <P>The only relevant information relates to the number and net registered tonnage of vessels which entered and cleared Irish ports in the categories of countries mentioned.  The following table gives this information in respect of ships which entered and cleared Irish ports with cargo in the years 1960, 1961 and 1964-66.  It is not possible to compile such information for 1962 and 1963 as the basic data are no longer in a form suitable for processing. Corresponding information is not available for the year 1967.</P>
      <P>Following is the table:</P>

    <P>* The estimated changes are the differences between the figures obtained from sample enumerations carried out in 1966 and 1967 which are subject to sampling errors.  In the case of males engaged in farm work, the differences may not reflect the true changes because experience has shown that the treatment of migratory workers and of members of family on small holdings may vary between enumerators in different years and different areas.</P>

      <P>A major improvement scheme at Galway Harbour has been completed, with the exception of two items, namely (i) the provision of an additional navigational aid and (ii) repairs to the dock gates.  The harbour authority are engaged in preliminary investigations in regard to these two items.  A State grant of £360,000 and a loan of £70,000 from the Local Loans Fund were made available towards the cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>A hydraulic model investigation of Arklow Port to determine the best means of dealing with siltation has been completed with the aid of a full cost State grant of approximately £20,000. The harbour authority are at present examining possible schemes for improvement in the light of the findings of the investigation.</P>
      <P>The harbour authority at Wicklow propose to carry out repairs to the South Quay at a cost of approximately £10,000 which they hope to finance from the Local Loans Fund and bank borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> A report on the findings of a hydraulic model investigation of Drogheda Harbour to determine the best means of solving the dredging problem is expected in the near future. The model investigation was undertaken as part of a comprehensive improvement scheme in respect of which a State grant of 50 per cent of the cost subject to a maximum of £175,000 was approved.</P>
