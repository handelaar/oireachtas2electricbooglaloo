      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing the following matter of urgent public importance, the denial by an American company to its Irish employees at Shannon of the hard-won right of association in a trade union; its refusal to openly negotiate with the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and its disregard for the constitutional obligations placed upon it to recognise Irish trade unionism as the established method whereby our workers are represented in industry; the fact that this flagrant violation of accepted procedures by the company in question is taking place, although Irish workers have by enactment of Dáil Éireann shared in the cost of assistance and facilities made available to industrialists at Shannon; and the fact as well that the denial of trade union recognition at Shannon will, if permitted, represent a serious threat by non-Irish concerns to organised workers in all parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Dunne for having given me notice yesterday of his intention to request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil on a definite matter of urgent public importance.  As Deputies <Col N="876" /> are aware, the precedents of the House require that to be urgent as described in Standing Order 29 the matter must be of such a nature that any delay in discussing it might prevent effective action being taken.  I have considered the Deputy's request carefully and I have come to the conclusion that the matter does not satisfy this requirement of urgency.  I must, therefore, rule that the motion is not one contemplated by Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>With respect, I should like to put to you that this is, in fact, a matter of grave and urgent importance, that it does urgently concern the rights of Irish workers in every part of Ireland, that it does not permit of delay in being attended to and that there is laid upon this democratically elected Parliament the duty to provide facilities for Members to express openly and freely their views in regard to situations of this kind which are plainly harmful to the interests of Irish workers.  I want to ask, a Cheann Comhairle, that you reconsider your decision on this matter and to point out to you that a rigid interpretation of the Standing Order was hardly the intention of those who framed it, and whether it was or not, it cannot be said that such interpretation of the Standing Order is in consonance with democratic procedure anywhere.  I want to put to you further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was enacted for a period of three years and has been renewed at the end of each three-year period, will expire on 31st March, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st March, 1971.  The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by order the export of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  Such orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by Resolution of either House of the Oireachtas at any time during this period.  Control is at present in force on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1968 and the Control of Exports (Southern Rhodesia) Order, 1968.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to continue these powers for a further period and to enact the appropriate legislation. Control continues to be necessary for the following purposes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to conserve supplies of scarce raw materials (such as scrap metals) for the benefit of home industry,</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials, that is arms, ammunition, military and naval stores and so on are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations, or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere,</P>
    <P>(c)  to implement the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which requires, among other things, control on exports to the United Kingdom of textile goods containing cotton.</P>
    <P>(d)  to comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member States to prevent the exportation of certain goods to Southern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>(e)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned, I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether any further consideration has been given to a matter which I raised recently with the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  It <Col N="883" /> concerns the position which has arisen out of the elimination of certain duties on yarns which are used by at least one firm, and possibly others, as a result of a change in the position arising from the abolition of these duties between EFTA countries.  The position as I understand it was that up to quite recently manufacturers in this country were in a position to get the synthetic yarns or fibres at comparable prices to British manufacturers.  As I understood the reply of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present duty will expire in about 18 months under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, but because of the recent change in the EFTA duty, British manufacturers are now in a position to get supplies from Swiss sources without payment of any duty.  The position arises that manufacturers here have to manufacture from raw materials which bear a duty of approximately eight per cent.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate or be able to ascertain the position on it.  Up to now a particular firm in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire has been competing successfully on the export market but the recent arrangement under EFTA whereby British manufacturers are in a position to get Swiss yarn without payment of duty means that they can compete on substantially more advantageous conditions than manufacturers here.</P>
      <P>The other thing which I would be interested to know is what particular type of goods is restricted under the United Nations Mandatory Resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this deals with exports rather than what Deputy Cosgrave has been discussing, and in that connection I should like to draw to the Minister's notice some problems that we have in the case of export licences in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are materials especially timber, trees, firewood blocks and scrap metals and in the case of Donegal and especially the northern part of Donegal, where we are so far away from the centres at which these are used or re-used or made into other articles, the cost of transport means <Col N="884" /> that it is uneconomic to have them transported long distances.  There is a ready market convenient from the point of view of distance in Northern Ireland.  There is a concession given in the case of trees, timber and certain types of firewood blocks but in the case of scrap metals there is no concession. I made representations previously to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that because of the long distance and the ensuing high costs that part of Donegal which has some facilities in the case of timber should have for the same reasons the same licensing facilities in respect of scrap metals such as iron, steel, copper and other non-ferrous metals.  If this were granted, we could avoid a pile up of scrap metals of various sorts which are lying about in different garages and other places and there would be a demand for them.  As well as the export drive, it would help to clear some of what now are derelict sites or eyesores.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would urge the Minister to reconsider this and in the case of Donegal, or at least the further away part of Donegal, to consider the issuing of licences for the export of the commodities I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <P>My own belief is that if raw material is imported here for re-export in a finished garment, the duty would not be payable and there would be no advantage to the English manufacturer who could get the raw material without duty because if it is coming into this market he would have to pay duty.  I gather the Minister is writing to Deputy Cosgrave giving him the full explanation but it does not come under this legislation so I have not got the necessary information here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked what goods are restricted under the Rhodesia Order. They are arms, ammunition, aircraft, motor vehicles, plant and machinery, <Col N="885" /> mineral oils.  The full list is on the order made.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Cunningham's question, timber and other goods like sheepskins come under another Act which is a permanent Act and does not have to be renewed.  The scrap iron is to protect our own industry as the Deputy knows, and I gather that the price paid in Donegal is the same as any place else.  I am sure the Minister will take note of what he has said but whether we can give special terms to Donegal would be another question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was discussing the particular problems of urban areas <i>vis-à-vis</i> rural areas.  I would like to dwell for a moment on some actual figures as distinct from the theoretical arguments which have been adduced by the Government in an effort to justify giving 40 per cent deviation to certain parts of the depopulated areas of this country.  We were asked to accept that because of a higher population of people under 21 years of age in urban areas than in rural areas the principle of one man one vote was not respected where the ratio between public representatives and the people was on the basis of population rather than on the electorate.</P>
      <P>We did extract from the Minister that the percentage of electors to population in rural Ireland is about 56 and in the urban areas, it is 61 per cent, giving a variation of only five per cent.  It is quite clear you cannot under any canon of justice decide that it is fair to allow a 40 per cent deviation to compensate for a theoretical five per cent differential; yet that is what the Government are doing.  They want a bias which is eight times greater than the percentage difference of the electorate to population of our land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give some actual figures as distinct from the theories which the Government have propounded.  When in 1959 the Government introduced an Electoral (Amendment) Bill to rearrange constituencies, they did then <Col N="887" /> what the courts said was unjust, unconstitutional and unfair.  They gave preferential representation to some areas.  What the Government are now seeking to do in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is to provide power in the Constitution to do what was considered to be unjust, unfair and inequitable.</P>
    <P>The exact figures for some constituencies are very interesting.  The number of Dáil electors per seat&mdash;I am dealing with electors and not population&mdash;under that arrangement which the Government now seek to include in the Constitution, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was 14,370 electors per TD.  In Galway, it was to be only 9,439 electors per TD.  There were to be 5,000 electors fewer in Galway than in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. That is what the Government say is fair, proper and just and are now seeking to ask the people to accept.</P>
    <P>Under the same arrangement in 1959, which they now seek to include in the Constitution, Dublin South-East had 14,522 electors per TD and Galway West had 9,961 electors per TD, again just 4,500 more electors in Dublin per TD than in Galway.  Do not think for a moment that this was confined to Galway.  You had the same low number of electors per TD in Monaghan, Wexford, Kerry and Donegal.</P>
    <P>That was the situation in 1959 based on the 1956 census.  At the time that Bill was introduced, the actual figures under the system which was in existence up to 1959 were: in Dublin County, there were 24,689 electors per TD; and in Galway South 9,439 electors per TD.  You had nearly 15,000 more electors per TD in Dublin county than you had in Galway.  Again, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown had 20,450 electors per TD as against Galway with 9,961 electors per TD.  Here we have the actual figures showing 150 per cent disadvantage against Dublin.</P>
    <P>The figures at the moment, in 1968, which are based on the census of 1956 are even more atrocious.  This is again what the Government are seeking to <Col N="888" /> enshrine in the Constitution and regard as fair, proper and just.  At the moment you have the situation that in some Dublin constituencies there are almost 30,000 electors per TD and some of the constituencies in which it is intended to give advantageous representation have little more than 8,000 electors per TD.</P>
    <P>That is what we are asked to accept as fair and proper.  The Constitution, and the only course open to people in determining what the boundaries of constituencies will be, allows the calculation to be made only on the basis of known figures, figures ascertained in the immediately preceding census.  If we are not to use that basis, the only other basis would be the electorate ascertained in the immediate preceding register preparation.  This takes no account of the inevitable trend which will increase the population of urban areas in every 12 year cycle. The Department of Local Government, the Central Statistics Office, the Taoiseach's Office, several Government agencies and several local authorities will confirm that the population of Dublin is expected to increase by at least 100,000 in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Any rearrangement of constituencies which is now made will give no attention whatsoever to that inevitable shift in population, so that even if an effort is made to be strictly fair on this preparation of constituencies now and to have an equal ratio between population and TDs, it is bound to be put out of joint in the next ten years. It is bound to be put out of joint in one year after another, just as the 1961 arrangement is now completely out of joint giving three times higher degree of political power to constituencies in depopulated rural areas against Dublin and other urban constituencies.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that in the preparation of the electoral arrangement in 1961, the Government were aware that the constituencies in Dublin were again going to have their population increased.  Although it would not have been improper for them to bear that in mind, they did quite the reverse. Under the 1961 arrangement, the population per TD of Dublin North-East <Col N="889" /> was the highest in the whole country. Dublin North-East which was a constituency in which there was bound to be substantial building, in which the population was bound to rise by the better part of 100,000 in the ensuing ten years, started off by being the furthest away from the national average by having the largest number of electors per TD.  The next in line was Dublin County which again was bound in the ensuing 12 year period to have its population multiplied because it was, with Dublin North-East, the only region contiguous to Dublin city which had development land.  That is Dublin County and Dublin North-East.  From Clontarf to Howth and back to Ballymun, there was land ripe for development, land that had been dormant for years because of lack of development and was just then ripe for development because the new Dublin drainage scheme had been completed.  No provision was made for the population that was bound to come into existence during the next 12 years in those areas.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on the Oireachtas to take cognisance of the inevitable increase in population but one would consider that it would be more relevant to do so than consider all kinds of imaginary inconveniences that some Deputies think they have and the personal burdens they have to bear.  Under no acceptable canon can we approve any election system which will give 40 per cent additional power to some sections of our people.  I do not think our people want it.  I do not think that is what was in mind when this State was established and when so much was sacrificed to establish it and when so much has been sacrificed since we must maintain a degree of justice and equity for all sections of the people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night, and I reiterate, that rural Deputies have immense advantages and their constituents have immense advantages which are not available to people in the urban areas. The greatest of all advantages is the provincial press which gives detailed news about townlands and parishes in the local news columns, where pages are taken up with every little detail of communal activity, family activity and personal achievements and personal <Col N="890" /> happenings throughout the length and breadth of the areas in which the newspapers circulate.  Any Deputy worth his salt will raise a substantial amount of publicity in the local newspaper if he is doing a modicum of work.  Every meeting he attends and every branch meeting will be reported in the local press.</P>
    <P>None of these benefits is available to Deputies in the urban areas where the most a hard working Deputy can get is his name in the newspapers in relation to a contribution in Parliament.  It is common knowledge that when rural Deputies raise questions here they cannot get down to the general office fast enough to get copies of replies and have them circulated to their local newspapers where they are certain to be published.  Dublin Deputies have no newspapers to publish their deeds or misdeeds other than the occasional newspaper when they are involved in national or international news.</P>
    <P>I am not making a personal complaint. I have no personal grouse in this regard but I mention this as one of the important rural advantages.  When rural Deputies say they are suffering disadvantages, they might bear that in mind.  It is also common knowledge that people in rural areas are not so preoccupied in their daily existence with the daily pressures which are forever pressing in on the people in the urban areas, with the result that people in the rural areas are always full of information about their neighbours and areas, their own parishes and adjoining parishes and also their county.  The same does not happen where you have thousands in certain areas, where the population can be up to 4,000 or 5,000 people per 100 acres.  That would be a density some 500 times greater than the density of population in parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The loneliest place in the world by far is the large city.  The lonely person suffers much more acutely when living in crowded areas.  That is the experience of people in large urban areas.  There is a much greater need to have closer representation in the urban area than in a rural area.  The only inconvenience which has any validity is the one which requires rural Deputies to travel long <Col N="891" /> distances.  But, in that regard, the Minister for Lands, speaking recently of the great benefits of going to Castlebar, told civil servants that they should not be grousing about going to Castlebar because they would get much faster to their work in Castlebar.  Even if living in towns 20 miles away, they would get much faster to their work with less irritation, inconvenience and cost than if they were to remain in Dublin where it takes, in the Minister's words, half an hour and often more to cover even a mile.  This is common knowledge, but these things apparently are to be ignored when we come to the immensely impossible distances through impassable territory where the pioneering Deputies of rural Ireland are perpetually to suffer in their imaginations.</P>
    <P>The longest distance in mileage between the extremities in any constituency in the country is 79 miles and most Deputies would not have to do that in one day.  The average distance for any Deputy within his own constituency would not exceed 30 or 40 miles.  That is putting it at a generous figure and I venture to say that quite a number would have far less trouble in traversing that distance than it takes Dublin Deputies to get around their constituencies because of the traffic problems we have to face.</P>
    <P>These are unimportant matters.  The only reason I mention them is that these are the only arguments that have been advanced as to why we should change the electoral system.  We have had arguments about electoral systems which are in operation in countries thousand of miles away and thousands of miles in dimension.  Many people forget that although Canada is our next door neighbour, although there are Irish people there and it is an English-speaking country, although it may appear to be close to us in many ways and is a young nation like ourselves, there is a longer distance from the east to the west coast of Canada than from Canada to Ireland.  Similarly in Australia, the distances are beyond our comprehension.  Indeed in Australia even though the eastern seaboard may be sophisticated and developed, there are vast jungle or bush areas and <Col N="892" /> deserts to be crossed when moving across land to reach the west.  Any electoral systems which are thought to be convenient in those geographical circumstances are not likely to have any relevance to our own, in which, as we have seen, the average journey a Deputy would have to take to represent his own people is 30 or 40 miles.</P>
    <P>However, these are nothing compared with more fundamental rights. We can wax indignant on liberty, equality and other political rights, as we call them.  We are living very much in the past, spending so much time being concerned with political rights when it is with social rights we should be preoccupied.  Our political rights ought to be sacrosanct.  One of them is the right to an equal say in the selection of the Government, in the selection of one's public representative.  The Government seek to interfere with that right which every democracy and republic has recognised since the days of the French Revolution&mdash;the qualities of liberty, equality and fraternity.</P>
    <P>Where is equality in any system which will give 40 per cent more say in voting to one section of the community? That is clearly a negation of what the revolutionaries in France and those who followed them believed in. It is an interference with fundamental political rights to attempt to destroy the priceless privilege of equality in political influence.  But I am concerned with social rights which I consider to be just as fundamental as the political rights of freedom, the liberty of the individual, the freedom of States. These are critically important things but the day has gone or should be gone when any of these should be qualified or challenged in any way.</P>
    <P>What we need to concern ourselves with are the social rights without which man cannot develop properly. In a just society, which we have not got in this country, social rights would rank equally with political rights.  On an equal footing with fundamental political rights should be fundamental social rights and they include the aspirations of every man to work, to education, to have a home, to full family rights, to be relieved of the agony of seeing his children emigrate, <Col N="893" /> to social and medical assistance, to rid himself finally of poverty, insecurity and bad housing and, to the greatest extent possible, to be freed from the inequalities imposed by nature or society.</P>
    <P>These are the fundamental rights, these social rights about which we should be concerning ourselves in the spring and summer of 1968.  We should be concerned with the many ways in which we as a society fall short&mdash;the giving of these fundamental rights to the people.  We should be concerned with closing the gap, removing the inequalities imposed by nature and society.  What we are doing is something of which we should be ashamed, something in respect of which we should ask God to forgive us.  We are wasting the nation's time and the nation's energies by endeavouring to infringe on what should be unchallengeable fundamental political rights, when we ought to be preoccupied with trying to confer on all our people equal social rights which are fundamental and essential if man is properly to develop.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the Constitution and to refer to Article 41 to illustrate one thing I have in mind. We provide, in section 2, paragraph 1:</P>
    <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved. </P>
    <P>In our society an increasing number of married women are obliged to go to work, and this is particularly true in cities and towns, to supplement the grossly inadequate incomes of husbands. What is the State doing about recognising the rights of the woman to be at home to look after the family? What are we doing in the spring and summer of 1968 to improve the lot of families?  We are doing nothing.  What we are trying to do is the reverse&mdash;to reduce the voting power of innumerable families in Dublin and other urban centres whose women are obliged to work in factories and domestic service because the family incomes the husbands can bring home are grossly inadequate to maintain the homes in a proper degree of comfort and to maintain <Col N="894" /> children and give them the opportunities for education and development which should be theirs.</P>
    <P>Article 45 of the Constitution gives a directive on principles of social policy and it is terribly important we should read this Article because it is not cognisable by any court.  It is for the general guidance of the Members of these Houses and it behoves us when considering the Constitution to look at this Article which has been directed to us to see to what extent, if at all, we are fulfilling our obligations to give the people the opportunities and the social policies they should be enjoying.  We find, for instance, in that Article:</P>
    <P>The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing the protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life. </P>
    <P>How can we say we are promoting the welfare of the whole people when we are proposing to interfere with the very basis of our parliamentary system by depriving masses of our people of any representation in the House unless they happen to be lucky enough to back the winner first past the post. They are to be deprived of all representation in the House and that is not having regard to the welfare of the whole people.  It is not a system which represents the virtues of justice and charity, nor could it ever be said that any Dáil elected under the British system of first past the post could be a just institution, an institution which was having regard to the need for justice and charity in national life.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the same Article provides:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
    <P>i.  That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs. </P>
    <P>We know that is not so: we know <Col N="895" /> there are many homes which are below adequate, social, financial and economic standards and which do not afford all our citizens equality of opportunity. Yet we are not concerning ourselves in the spring and summer of 1968 with these matters.  We are concerned rather to qualify the political rights of some members of the community.</P>
    <P>The same Article provides:</P>
    <P>That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable. </P>
    <P>It is because the Fianna Fáil Government, now in office for more than 30 years, have failed to establish on the land in economic security for as many families as shall be practicable that they are now endeavouring to diminish their responsibility by taking a crack at the people in urban areas to compensate for their lack of activity in establishing and maintaining as many families as practicable in adequate security on the land.</P>
    <P>We find also in the Directive Principles of Social Policy:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to safeguard with especial care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community and, where necessary, to contribute to the support of the infirm, the widow, the orphan, and the aged </P>
    <P>Yet we are giving the same infirm, widowed, orphaned and aged pensioners paltry pensions which are insufficient to provide for them a diet which would save them from starvation. It is common knowledge that there are hundreds and thousands of old people in this country who are simply dying of malnutrition.  Yet, in the spring and summer of 1968, this Dáil and the Irish people are prevented from taking steps to remedy these unfortunate people's circumstances because we are, by Government direction, to preoccupy ourselves with disqualifying the electoral effect of some sections of the Irish people.  I do not want to go any farther.  I think I have drawn enough attention to the matter to show that the Constitution is concerned with <Col N="896" /> matters other than political advantage.</P>
    <P>I cannot too strongly condemn the Government for wasting so much time and effort in this attempt on their part to ensure the creation of rotten boroughs in rural Ireland with the assistance of rotten money to maintain a rotten Government in office.  When we leave aside all the theory and all the arguments concerning which is the best and most suitable means of electing members to the national parliament of Ireland, we come down to the real purpose of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that the Fianna Fáil Party have unlimited funds.  I am quite convinced that they have received immense funds from a large number of highly questionable sources. They have sailed as close to the wind of corruption as any Government could ever sail.  Machiavelli was a saint compared with them.  One of their purposes in having this referendum at this time is in the hope that it will financially ruin their political opponents. They are less concerned with whether or not they can win the referendum than they are with having an expensive referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>This is a Dáil in which we have had, every year since this Dáil was elected in 1965, a major electoral campaign&mdash; a Presidential election in 1966, local elections in 1967.  I think the country was entitled to look forward to a year in which it would not have any elections other than by-elections.  There is no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Party can fight general elections, referenda, Presidential elections and by-elections without batting an eyelid because their corrupt funds are limitless and they have no shame whatsoever in their efforts to get them.</P>
    <P>Far from being sorry, whenever charges of corruption are made, the Taoiseach and all his Ministers and all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party delight to hear these charges made because they want the people of this country to believe that rights and privileges and facilities are not obtainable unless people corrupt themselves to the Government and they hope that that will continue.  They would love to cheer Deputy L'Estrange and others <Col N="897" /> when they make charges of specific cases of corruption.  The Government could not care less whether or not the charges are true.  They want people to believe that that is how government in this country is run because it gives them unlimited funds.</P>
    <P>The anxiety of Fianna Fáil is that, in this referendum campaign, their political opponents will become bankrupt because of the money they will have to expend.  Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum, it is not unlikely that a general election will follow, under the existing or a new system, not because there will be any cogent political or moral reason for having the election but because the Government would hope, immediately after the referendum, to rush a general election in which they would find their political opponents without funds to fight their campaigns.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Government that if the Irish people have to beggar themselves to get rid of Fianna Fáil they will do it.  By heavens, there is a day of reckoning coming for those who have endeavoured to corrupt the political institutions of this country in the way Fianna Fáil are encouraging them to do.  Each and every one of those people will be exposed for what they are&mdash;the most despicable scum this country has ever had the misfortune to house.  Those who tried to buy this country with the Act of Union and to buy the members of Grattan's Parliament were, like Machiavelli, saints compared with what is going on now under the guise of respectability.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Government that, notwithstanding their best hopes, the Fine Gael Party will not be beggared by any referendum campaign or any general election.  We have the masses of the small people of this country behind us.  When the rights of the Irish people were challenged or at risk before, when sacrifices had to be made, the poorest of the poor gave their one shilling a week&mdash;and that was over 150 years ago when one shilling a week was given by the poorest of the poor&mdash;and that was a great deal of money then.  That money worked against the might and the wealth of <Col N="898" /> the British Empire and the ascendancy of this country.  Be comforted with the knowledge, people of Ireland, that, once again, the ordinary people of this land, the little people, the people who have respect for decency in public life, will rally to the cause and will butcher the might of the Fianna Fáil Party. The day of reckoning to which I refer is fast coming.  It cannot come soon enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening for the past few weeks to the many statements about our electoral system and to a general discussion on the merits and demerits of proportional representation. Deputy Ryan began to speak at about 8 o'clock last night.  He repeated his statements many times but he made very few statements of fact. I have been asking myself what is really getting at him.  I remember the local elections and how his Party failed miserably in Dublin city and can therefore excuse him for not having yet got over the jitters he suffered on that occasion.</P>
      <P>We in this Party are asking the people to change our system of election from proportional representation to the straight vote.  I have been in the by-elections.  I heard speeches outside chapel gates.  The whole theme by the Opposition seems to be that this is the arrogant Fianna Fáil Party and the cheek of Fianna Fáil to bring this matter before the people and that the people will give them their answer.</P>
      <P>To listen to some Opposition speakers, one might think that this Government are some sort of dictatorship that took over overnight.  Fianna Fáil have been in power many years and it has always been at the will and pleasure of the Irish people and, for that matter, they have been elected through the system of proportional representation.  Fianna Fáil are putting this question to the people in a proper, democratic fashion and the people will decide whether or not they want to change the system of election. There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition speakers say the referendum will cost a lot of money which could be spent in a better way.  This country demands that we should have <Col N="899" /> a strong stable Government and it is very little to pay if, thereby, we can avoid falling into a period of stagnation and a period when one Party would not have an overall majority.</P>
    <P>I am amused to hear Opposition Deputies&mdash;especially members of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;speak about the amount of money this referendum will cost when I reflect on the position in their Parties.  They should consider how many of their own Deputies are in favour of having this referendum and of getting rid of proportional representation. At their Party meeting they decided, by a very tight decision, to support the maintenance of proportional representation.  I have listened to that Party, and it is really amusing when you think that the present leader of the Fine Gael Party was always a strong advocate of the straight vote; when you think back further to the man whom he succeeded, Deputy Dillon, who is also on record as decrying the PR system.  We can go back to Deputy Costello when he was leader of the Party, and he also opposed the PR system of election.  It is no secret that that Party would not be attacking the Government for trying to get rid of PR, were it not for a number of backbenchers who are afraid of losing their own seats and who are really putting their own personal affairs before those of their country.  It is they who decided that the Party should try to maintain PR.</P>
    <P>We hear many people saying that if we got the straight vote, Fianna Fáil would be in power forever.  This is sheer nonsense, as can be proved by looking at other countries which have the straight vote.  Britain, for instance, changes the Government from time to time.  Some of us who are not very old have seen a Conservative Government in power by a large majority, and then being thrown out and replaced by a Labour Government.  We have also seen some Labour Governments fall again in the eyes of the people.  It goes to prove that under the straight vote the Government can be changed if the people so desire.  All that is required is that the Parties in opposition put a <Col N="900" /> proper policy before the people.  If they do that, I have no doubt people will always vote for it.  What is wrong is that there is no real strong Opposition party in this country, no Opposition party with a set policy of their own.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that if the straight vote came in, a new party could not arise, that small Parties would disappear, and that the minority would not have a chance.  Recent events across the Channel have proved that wrong.  At the moment there are nationalist movements in Wales and Scotland, and very recently in a by-election a nationalist candidate was elected to the British Parliament.  He put his policy before his own people. It may have been a matter of local interest or that he was concerned only with his own country, but the point is that he was a new voice; it was a voice that campaigned hard and as such got elected even in a by-election. It goes to prove that any Party that can formulate a policy and get the people to approve of it, will even under the straight vote, still be able to get seats in Parliament.</P>
    <P>I was amused at the remarks of my friend, Deputy P. O'Donnell, in saying that small Parties would disappear and that minorities would not be represented. He then went on to state how he himself got into Dáil Éireann. It was with the help of the Clann na Poblachta Party; it was a simple elimination and a transfer of votes from that Party to Fine Gael that elected him.  However, we should always remember who did away with Clann na Poblachta, which Party did away with Clann na Talmhan, which Party absorbed them.  The very Party to which Deputy P. O'Donnell belongs absorbed these small Parties.  Now Fine Gael are shedding crocodile tears for them. In the past they were needed to form coalition Governments, but first Fine Gael made sure to absorb them so that they would not grow.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about minority groups, but we must bear in mind that what any country wants is a strong Government.  A country without a strong Government has no hope of survival.  If we are to join the EEC, we will want a strong, stable Government. <Col N="901" /> Everyday events in the world prove that a nation which has not got a strong Government is completely lost as far as progress is concerned.</P>
    <P>If at all possible, we should avoid going through another period of Coalition Governments.  We had two Coalition Governments and the point was that prior to the election the Parties did not announce that they were going to form a Coalition.  The people voted for them independently, and once they had been elected, they came together to form a Government.  It should be borne in mind that when those Governments were formed, ministerial posts were offered not on the credentials of the candidates who filled them but on the basis of allowing so many posts to each Party.  It made no difference whether or not the man was capable of filling the post or not; each Party got its quota.  That is something we do not want to happen again.  It is better that we should have a strong Government, whether it be a Fianna Fáil Government, a Fine Gael Government or a Labour Government, but at least let it be strong and have the confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Ryan telling us about the rural areas and how convenient they were for Deputies, telling us about all that the rural people have to be thankful for and telling us also what difficulties the city people have when they want to meet their TDs.  I doubt if he knows much about the rural areas&mdash;perhaps he does&mdash;but he was not correct.  I believe in the single-seat constituency because it provides a smaller area in which the TD has to travel in order to see fewer people.  It allows him to give the people a better service and they would be better represented. Listening to Opposition speakers, one would think that all you had to do was to sit in your car and travel for miles to meet somebody, but how many people in the rural areas are living seven, eight, or ten miles from their work, perhaps in a factory in a town, or perhaps in the Forestry Division, or working on the roads, or they may even be farmers working late in the fields, and if they have an <Col N="902" /> urgent problem about which they want to contact their public representative, they may have to travel from 20 or 30 miles to do so.  Many of them cannot afford to hire a car.  They might be young married people with young families and it is very hard for them to meet their public representatives.  Compare that with those living in the cities. It is well known that a 6d bus ticket will take you to your public representative. Of course, maybe he cannot be contacted.</P>

      <P>It is not very far for you to travel.  If the Deputy does not know his constituents, it is his own fault.  The Deputy was trying to tell us how easy it is in the country, that you have cumann branches of the Parties and the announcements of their meetings are sent to the local paper and everybody is supposed to read them.  However, that is not getting to the root of the matter.  A lot of people will have private matters to discuss. It is to that end that we badly need the single-seat constituency so that people will be able to meet their public representatives without having to hire a car and travel 30 or 40 miles at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night.</P>
      <P>I regret that in this debate there seems to be developing a kind of rural versus urban bias.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties seem to have combined together to form an anti-rural group. Under the tolerance vote the whole principle is to give one man one vote. I heard figures being thrown out here in regard to different constituencies, and it was also said that if you had 20,000 people in a district in Dublin city, there might be as few as 11,000 or 12,000 voters whereas in the country a population of 20,000 could include 16,000 or 17,000 voters.  That could be a difference of 4,000 or 5,000 voters between country and city, according to the population.  It is well known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It can be 15 per cent. It must be remembered that people are still coming into the cities, into the Civil Service and into business generally, and at the time of election, many thousands of those may not be on the register.  That is a point which has been missed.  What is going to happen is that in the finish the cities are going to be over-represented.  We should be aware of the fact that rural populations are producing as much and exporting as much as their city counterparts, and many are producing more.  That cannot be denied.  The main Opposition Parties are against this tolerance vote.  If the Deputies opposite from Mid-Cork, one Labour and one Fine Gael, are going to vote against this, I will be surprised. If they do, we will have a big discussion outside chapel gates later in the year. However, that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>I do not know what relevance it had to the debate but we heard a discussion about all the things Fianna Fáil had not provided for&mdash;in regard to pensions, people leaving the land, and so on.  These matters have nothing to do with the Bills we are discussing.  We want a system which will provide us with a strong Government all the time. We do not want to return to the days of the last Coalition Government when they left office, not because they were beaten in a vote in the House but because they fell out among themselves. It was enough that that happened in the past without having it again and it should be a warning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies think there should be a law prohibiting Deputies and Senators from being members of local authorities.  I could not subscribe to that view.  It is a matter for the people when they go to their different Party conventions to put forward whom they like.  It is a democratic method and if they are not satisfied with their local Deputy, they will not be long telling him so.  It would be a bad thing if such a law were passed.  We are one of the <Col N="904" /> few countries in the world which still have the system of PR as we know it. They have the system in Tasmania, Malta and Gibraltar which are more or less subordinate legislatures, but it is a system which is dying out in the world and the people would be wise to change to the straight vote, no matter what arguments are put forward. We had arguments about candidate A getting 7,000 votes, B getting 6,000 votes and C getting 5,000 votes and so on, but what you will get is the candidate whom most people want, being elected.  It is a fairer system than one in which a candidate gets 10,000 votes while three others get 5,000, 4,000 and 3,000, and finally one of them is elected by some 300 votes.  If we had the straight vote, we would be sure that the man who heads the poll would be the man whom most people will want elected.</P>
    <P>It has been said that once a man is elected, he will become a dictator in his own area.  We can look around across the Channel to see that that is not true.  One leading figure across the water was recently defeated in his own constituency because his own people did not approve of him. That proves that under the straight vote we could have changes very often. It is evident that on the straight vote the wind of change would blow more evenly throughout the country and that if the Government were in favour, their vote in each constituency would go up and if they were not in favour it would go down.  That would mean that we would probably have a change of Government often.</P>
    <P>In 1959 when the referendum was held, it was stated by the Opposition Parties that Fianna Fáil wanted to get rid of proportional representation in order to hold on to power.  At that time the people voted in favour of retaining PR and strange to say, they also voted since then that we should also hold on to a Fianna Fáil Government, under PR.  Looking to the future and in the interests of the nation, I have no doubt that the best system for us is the straight vote. Arguments have been advanced against it but I have no doubt that if it were left to a free vote of the House, there <Col N="905" /> would be a large majority in favour. There would be well over 90 Deputies who would vote for the straight vote. Some 90 Deputies out of the 144 would return to their constituencies to campaign for the straight vote, but because of Party rule, one way or another, they will not be allowed to do that.  It is a pity and I should like to see a free vote for then we would know what people were really thinking.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years we have had a strong government.  Many Governments have got into difficulties but we can boast at the moment that we have a sound economy, and it is sound because a few years ago when the Government saw the trend of events, they took certain remedial measures which have borne fruit.  Those measures could not have been taken unless there had been a strong Government. It is vital for any country's survival to have a strong, stable Government. I would appeal to the Opposition Deputies to have a special look at this tolerance vote.  There is an effort being made to disfranchise the country areas.  It is bad enough to live in rural areas, many of which have not the amenities which people in towns and cities have, perhaps without sewerage as many of them live at the foot of the hills, at the foot of the Comeragh Mountains, for instance&mdash;but now they are not to be fairly represented in Dáil Éireann.  That is a slur on these people and Deputy Ryan cast a slur last night when he referred to the intelligence of the voters in Clare and said that they voted Fianna Fáil and always returned Fianna Fáil with a strong majority because they used not to meet their TDs or see them very often.  That is a slur on the people who have represented republican Clare down through the years.</P>

I have a fair idea what would happen if the Deputy were dividing <Col N="906" /> the constituencies.  We, in Fianna Fáil, have put a great many by-elections over us in the past few years.  We can be satisfied with the results and we are looking forward with confidence to this referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing here two Bills, one dealing with what has become known as tolerance and the other dealing undoubtedly with the perpetuation of intolerance, the sort of intolerance we experienced in this House last week when a Minister of the Government threw at a Front Bench Member of the Opposition such epithets as &ldquo;swine&rdquo; and &ldquo;cur&rdquo; simply because that Member thought it fit and right as his duty to bring to the notice of the Minister, of the Government, of the House and of the people, who will ultimately decide their own fate when it comes to voting on things such as referenda and general elections, that certain irregularities, which reeked of corruption, had taken place, were taking place, and should be stopped.</P>
      <P>The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is obviously intended for one purpose and one purpose only.  If one looks back over the pattern of Fianna Fáil conduct in the last decade, one will discover that every time Fianna Fáil get frightened of the electorate, they take refuge in an assault on the Constitution.  The 1959 referendum was thrust upon us because in that year the then leader of the Fianna Fáil Party saw fit to remove his immense prestige from the Party and, fearing that, without this prestige, the Fianna Fáil Party would not get an overall majority, we had the 1959 referendum.  As a result of happenings, such as the Presidential election last year and the local elections, the Fianna Fáil Party have got a very plain intimation from the people that the day of an overall Fianna Fáil majority is gone.  It is not just in jeopardy.  It will be gone when the people speak in the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Haunted by the same fear as that which haunted the Fianna Fáil Party in 1959, Fianna Fáil are attempting now the same strategy, with the result <Col N="907" /> that, within a short period of ten years, the Irish people are being asked again to change the Constitution, the document in which are enshrined their fundamental rights.  If anybody were in any doubt about Fianna Fáil misgivings and the reasons for this Fianna Fáil manoeuvre, they need only listen to Deputy Meaney.  He made it quite clear to the House that Fianna Fáil realise that under the present system they will not come back again ever as an overall majority Party and the only way they could govern would be by combining, as they did before, in a coalition.  Deputy Meaney made it quite plain to the House that Fianna Fáil will not have that and, if they can prevent this disaster to the Fianna Fáil Party, they will do so by amending our Constitution.  Deputy Meaney also said it is up to the people to decide whether or not they want the Constitution amended.  Fundamentally, that is, of course, absolutely true and that is why one of the most important aspects of this forthcoming referendum, if we have it, is that at this stage the people should be given some intimation as to what they will be voting upon when and if they vote on the Third and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bills.</P>
    <P>Is it a fair question to ask the average man and woman: Are you in favour of the terms of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968?  That question entails a great deal and, in case this Bill never gets on the Statute Book, it is just as well, I think, that the full terms of the Bill should appear in the Official Report of this House.  In asking the ordinary man and woman are you in favour of the terms of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, you are presupposing in the first place that they have read and studied Article 16 carefully and have had a copy of this Bill and, having had that copy, that they understand its intention.  The almost invariable practice in legislation is to put some sort of Preamble to a Bill: an Act to procure a better form of rent restriction, etc., etc.  But, in this Bill, there is no Preamble of any description, no few short sentences pointing <Col N="908" /> out the fundamental issues on which the people will be called to adjudicate. In effect, the ordinary man and woman, the hawker in the street, the business man, the farmer and the farm labourer are being asked do they approve that:</P>
    <P>WHEREAS by virtue of Article 46 of the Constitution any provision of the Constitution may be amended in the manner provided by that Article:</P>
    <P>AND WHEREAS it is proposed to amend Article 16 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED BY THE OIREACHTAS AS FOLLOWS:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  &mdash;Article 16 of the Constitution is hereby amended as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the sub-section set out in Part II of the Schedule to this Act shall be substituted for sub-section 3º of section 2 of the Irish text,</P>
    <P>(b)  the sub-section set out in Part II of the Schedule to this Act shall be substituted for sub-section 3º of section 2 of the English text.</P>
    <P>2.  &mdash;(1) The amendment of the Constitution effected by this Act shall be known as and may for all purposes be referred to as the Third Amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>(2)  This Act may be cited as the Third Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>A determination of constituencies shall be so effected that if</P>
    <P>i.  with respect to each of the constituencies, the number of members to be elected for it is divided into its population (as ascertained at the census last preceding the determination), and</P>
    <P>ii.  the average of the quotients of the divisions is ascertained,</P>
    <P>none of the quotients shall be greater, or less, than that average by more than one-sixth of that average.</P>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing requirement of this sub-section, regard shall be had at a determination of constituencies to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and the need for securing convenient areas of rerepresentation and, subject to those <Col N="909" /> considerations, to the desirability of avoiding the overlapping by constituencies of the boundaries of Administrative Counties (other than boundaries between those Counties and County Boroughs).</P>
    <P>Is that a fair question to ask any average elector in this country?</P>
    <P>When you go on to the provisions of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the problem posed is much more difficult.  We have heard three or four Government Ministers, including the Head of the Government, talking here on these proposals and not the slightest scintilla of information has been given to the people in regard to the type of question which they are to be asked in the referendum.  It is only fair at this stage, before the debate reaches its final stages, that some spokesman on behalf of the Government should indicate to the people that when they vote on this referendum, they will be enabled by the simple nature of the questions asked, to know what they are voting about.  A similar stratagem was resorted to on the occasion when the last referendum was put to the people and many people on both sides of the political fence were completely mystified by the question posed to them when they went into the polling booths.</P>
    <P>We must remember that those people do not make a habit of voting.  It is very seldom they get the opportunity of voting and even the most experienced voter gets quite nervous when he or she goes into a polling booth, but when they are posed a question of this nature, unless there is something on the paper to indicate to them: &ldquo;Look, what you are really voting about is PR or the straight vote&rdquo;, we are not giving the people a fair opportunity of answering the question put to them.  I would appeal to the Government at this stage to make clear their intentions in respect of the type of question which is to be put to the people.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by the Government when they indicate that they think the straight vote is the proper form of voting is that PR is more difficult to understand and that the straight vote is easier to understand. <Col N="910" /> If that be the principle which the Government wish to enshrine in respect of balloting of any description, surely it is only right that they should simplify, in so far as it is possible, the issues which are being put to the people of Ireland in respect of an amendment of the document in which is contained the sum of their individual rights and their rights as members of the nation.</P>
    <P>Let us return to a point I mentioned a short time ago, that is, the Fianna Fáil suggestion that it is necessary to remove the proportional representation system because, <i>inter alia</i>, the people do not understand it and people spoil their votes and that therefore sections of the community are disfranchised by the retention of the system.  I do not think the Government are as naive as they pretend to be in this matter.  Most of them have attended count after count and they have seen the almost monotonous regularity with which properly availed of papers come out of the ballot boxes. They have seen the dwindling number of spoiled votes over the years.  The statistics show very plainly that more and more people are finding it more and more easy under the proportional representation system properly to exercise the franchise.  Way back in the early years of PR, the statistics were possibly unreasonably high.  For instance, in 1922, the percentage of spoiled votes was 3.08.  In the general election of 1923, the percentage of spoiled votes was 3.66.  As the years went on, the statistics for succeeding elections showed plainly that the Irish people were beginning to understand how PR worked and the average of spoiled votes went down year after year so that by 1961 it had fallen from the 3.66 of 1923 to .96 of the total vote and there was a further improvement in the last general election of 1965, when the total average of spoiled votes was .91 per cent.</P>
    <P>Similarly a greater proportion of the Irish people are availing of PR.  People are not frightened off voting by the fact that they have to operate the PR system and more and more people troop to the polls each year.  Thus in the 1922 general election, only 62 per cent of the electorate availed of the <Col N="911" /> immense privilege of voting and in the 1923 general election, only 61 per cent of the electorate availed of their vote, but as the years went on, year by year the average number of people voting increased so that by 1961 instead of 61 per cent that availed of their vote in 1923, 70.6 per cent of the electorate voted and in 1965, 75.1 per cent voted. I know somebody might say: &ldquo;Oh, well, these were freak years.&rdquo;  It could be said that if there is an election on a fine day, more people come to cast their votes because it is more convenient for them to do so, but the statistics of the intervening years between the years I have mentioned show plainly that the number of people using PR has gone up year by year so that examining those statistics, we can use the words of Mr. de Valera when he was leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  With great truth, we can say: &ldquo;The system we have we know.&rdquo;  That is the PR system.  We can echo the words of that skilled politician.  He gave one of the reasons why we should retain PR and it was that the people know it.  He said: &ldquo;It has worked out pretty well.&rdquo;  Each of us here could echo those words and use the whole phrase: &ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.&rdquo; I am quoting from volume 67-68 of the Official Report, column 1343. What the former Taoiseach said was true.  It has worked out pretty well.</P>
    <P>Possibly the best comparison between the effects of the PR system and the straight vote is an analysis of the events that happened here under PR and what has happened in Britain under what Fianna Fáil are pleased to call the straight vote.  In 1933, which was quite an average year, Fianna Fáil and Labour between them had 717,000 votes.  They got 49.7 per cent of the total vote and 50 per cent of the seats.</P>
    <P>In the British general election of 1924 in the southern counties of England, there were 82 seats available to the electorate.  The Conservative Party, which is the Party of the southern counties, received 1,500,000 <Col N="912" /> votes and of the 82 seats, they captured 81.  The Labour Party on the same occasion got 922,000 votes, very nearly 1,000,000 votes, and they got one out of the 82 seats.  Examples like that could be multiplied in the recent history of the operation of the straight vote.  They have been multiplied here by Members who have spoken before me and I do not intend to keep the House in giving further examples. However, it shows the crooked way the straight vote can work.  It shows the crooked results the straight vote can produce and it shows the crooked sort of representation the straight vote can throw up in parliament.  To me it shows the crooked conduct of the people in the Party which at the moment are advocating a change to the straight vote in this country.  First of all, the people do not understand it; secondly, they are afraid to use it; and thirdly, as Deputy Meaney says, we must have stability and strong government.</P>
    <P>There are very few countries in the world which can show such a history of stable government over the past 20 years as we in this country can show. What exactly does stability mean?  On that side of the House, it obviously means it is stable only when the Fianna Fáil Government are in power with an overall majority, but to the average man and woman in the street who look on stability in parliament as meaning the number of years each parliament exists, there is comfort in the thought that since 1944 we have had more than reasonably stable Governments. The parliament elected in 1944 lasted three years and seven months; the 1948 Dáil lasted three years and three months; the 1951 Dáil lasted two years and ten months; the 1954 Dáil lasted two years and eight months; the 1956 Dáil lasted four years and six months; the 1961 Dáil lasted three years and five months; and the present Dáil is going strong.  Could there be anything more stable than that?</P>
    <P>Could the Fianna Fáil Party explain what they mean when they say there is a lack of stability as the result of the retention of the proportional representation system in this country?  We could, looking at the statistics which <Col N="913" /> I have just given to the House, echo the words Mr. de Valera used in this House in volume 67-68 of the Official Report, column 1343, and could say what he, having looked into his heart, said: &ldquo;We have to be very grateful that we had the system of proportional representation here.  It gives a certain amount of stability?&rdquo;  It was giving it then when those words were spoken by the then leader of that Party.  He was there then and he was using his prestige and the various other elements which contributed to making him an effective leader.  It was stable then and it was stable until he left the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was stable until they felt in 1959 that once he left, the sheep would be scattered because the shepherd had gone.  When they found out that this was not so, they were still able to survive and they were quite happy to go ahead until they got the ominous rumblings of the Presidential election and the still more ominous rumblings of the local elections, and the sheep suddenly felt they might be scattered again.  The sheep suddenly decided that this was an unstable thing&mdash;unstable for the Fianna Fáil Party but not unstable for the carrying on of the system of proper government in this country.</P>
    <P>As I say, Mr. de Valera presented the proportional representation system as giving a certain amount of stability. A certain amount of stability is the most that we can expect from any electoral system.  There is no doubt that it gives more stability than the straight vote.  We have been told that the straight vote in Britain gives stability. Examine the history of the House of Commons over the past century or more and you will find that for more than half of that period, coalition governments, the mention of which made poor Deputy Meaney shudder in horror some time ago, ruled.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion made by the Fianna Fáil Party was that which emanated from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am quite sure we on this side of the House can be pardoned for rejecting Deputy Colley's ingenious suggestion that proportional representation is being abolished in <Col N="914" /> the interests of the Fine Gael Party so that at some stage Fine Gael will replace Fianna Fáil on that side of the House as the Government.  If we reject this dissimulation, it is not purely because we are instinctively doubtful about everything which emanates from that side of the House, but we cannot make Deputy Colley's ingenious suggestion tally up with things which happen on that side of the House at even higher level than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  During the 1959 debates here, when Deputy Dillon was making the suggestion which I am making now&mdash;I was here myself then&mdash;that the reason proportional representation was being wiped out by the Fianna Fáil Party was that Fianna Fáil had been put out of office under it in 1948 and 1954, the then Taoiseach, who was not the present Taoiseach and not Deputy Lemass, the former Taoiseach, but his predecessor, said &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the last proportional representation debate, the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Blaney, who is as astute a politican as the Fianna Fáil Party ever had, said that when proportional representation was gone, not only would Labour, Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan have had it, but Fine Gael would have had it, too.  Which is correct?  Which version of the Fianna Fáil attack on the proportional representation system is correct?  Is it the kindly assertion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that in the interests of democracy, Fianna Fáil will elevate us to government and will gently recede back into Opposition here, or is it the more realistic one of the Minister for Agriculture, that he wants to wipe out every minority element in this House and wants back into power in this House a Government who will spread right round those benches so that nobody can raise his voice in protest; in protest against the type of thing which is being protested against here, or that the Minister for Local Government would be in a still stronger position when he throws epithets like &ldquo;cur&rdquo; and &ldquo;swine&rdquo; at Deputies on this side of the House under the present regime?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> The Fianna Fáil Party are deliberately, for the second time in a decade, assaulting proportional representation because they know that their day is done under that system and that if they cannot have recourse to the straight vote, they are not coming back as a Government Party with an overall majority.  So they have recourse to a system under which it is notionally possible for a Party that gets 34 per cent of the votes to come back here as an overall PR Party.</P>
    <P>The Government know that every investigation that was held into the straight vote system in this country, having regard to the last local elections and to the last general election, showed plainly that there would be only one result of a general election under the straight vote system in this country at the moment, that is, a huge overall majority for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Industry and Commerce had tried to investigate the situation generally, he would know as well as we do that what he said here was laughable and a travesty of truth. With the Fianna Fáil Party with 90 to 100 Deputies in this House, how can any of the other Parties arise from the ashes created by the straight vote again?  Two out of every three people in this country who had occasion to go to a Deputy, irrespective of that person's own political belief, would have to go to a Fianna Fáil Deputy and we know how the Fianna Fáil process would press these people down and make sure they got no assistance unless they paid tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party by openly associating themselves.</P>
    <P>If you rob the other Parties as you hope to rob the other Parties of their representation in this House, you will rob them of their organisation; and that is the cold, deliberate intention of the Government Party, to grind down every element of opposition in this country and to drive them out of the House and to drive their supporters and their leaders into the wilderness.</P>
    <P>On us 144 Deputies here depends <Col N="916" /> largely what will happen to all the people.  On the availability of free and open criticism in this House depends the standard of our Government and the absence of corruption, and at least, if corruption is here, an assurance that it will be carried out openly in the full light of publicity which will be given to it in this House.  Must we banish this construction?  Must we banish the inquiring mind?  Must we banish the people who come into this House to embarrass a Government on issues on which they are entitled to be embarrassed?  That is what is contained in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and that is why I believe that the people, irrespective of what they do in a general election, would still solidly reject the Fianna Fáil proposal to reject proportional representation.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here by Deputy Ryan last night that the Fianna Fáil Party eventually getting second thoughts about this, have applied market research organisations to investigate the mind of the people.  I can tell them this.  When I went down to Clare canvassing, I expected the reception I got.  It was courteous but firmly pro-Government, and having tried to sell the candidate and having found there was not that extensive market for him, I tried to sell proportional representation instead and I may say there was a more receptive market.  People supporting my namesake, Deputy Barrett of Clare, assured me that when it came to proportional representation they would vote against the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the situation and the sooner the Government realise it the better.  I rejoice they are doing this.  They will leave on themselves a stigma the Irish people will not forget.  They will be looked on as a spendtrift Government who purely as a gamble are throwing away £100,000 of the people's money in this venture in the hope that in some strange fashion PR will be rejected and in the course of <Col N="917" /> the next few years will benefit to the full Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The issue contained in the first part is sufficiently important to leave it stand alone.  That is the substitution of the relative majority system by the single non-transferable vote.  Why should the elector who goes into the polling booth to adjudicate on that have to deal with another measure as well?</P>
      <P>The other portion deals with the number of constituencies and the setting up of a boundaries commission. I would have thought that as the Government are having a referendum and as they are seeking to amend certain sections of the Constitution, the proper approach to this would be to leave this particular issue of proportional representation stand by itself and if necessary, have a third issue put before the people in a third Bill dealing with the setting up of the boundaries commission.  The Government should seriously consider this.  As I indicated at an earlier stage of my speech, the man or woman who goes into the polling booth in the absence of a fair approach by the Government as to the framework of the Oireachtas will be more than sufficiently confused in answering yes or no for retaining proportional representation without this extra measure thrown in.  In the absence of a good reason which has not been given us by any Government spokesman, the Government should do the right and fair thing for the Irish voter and should put a third issue before him on a third ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to keep the House any longer.  I simply wish to repeat my belief that the Irish people will reject with the scorn it deserves the proposal which the Fianna Fáil Party are putting, not in the interests of the people, not in the interests of getting a fair return from the electoral process, not even in the interests of the democratic idea, but purely in the interests of a Party who want to swell and swell.  Yet they know that in the absence of a victory in this PR assault, they will never again in the foreseeable <Col N="918" /> future come back to this House in the numbers with which they now infest it.  They know that without the destruction of PR they will never again come back as a majority Party.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience in my constituency and from my experience with the voters in Clare&mdash;even those Fianna Fáil voters who retraced the name &ldquo;S. Barrett&rdquo; and voted for &ldquo;Mr. S. Barrett&rdquo; on their papers&mdash; that they are against the Government, and unless the Government wish to stigmatise themselves in the manner I have indicated, they should withdraw the measure they now have before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that when the Government decided to seek to amend the Constitution and introduce these measures in the national Assembly they hoped for fair, intelligent and dedicated discussion.  What we have had from the Opposition has been abuse and charges of corruption against the Government.  This does not do the national Assembly any good. It helps to recall that when the Nazis sought power in Germany, they began by bringing democracy into disrepute, by launching charges of corruption against the democratically elected government.  As a result, the people voted in Hitlerism as a solution and an alternative to the alleged corruption. We know now how the German people paid for it in the following years.</P>
      <P>It would be a good democratic exercise if we were to throw away temporarily parliamentary privilege so that if any Member of the Opposition or of this side of the House wished to make charges against people who were not here to defend themselves he would have to do so without the protection of privilege.  Last week the Chief Whip of Fine Gael made accusations against a person who was not here to defend himself.  The victim of that assault is no friend of mine: I do not even know him, though I know of him.  The Fine Gael Deputy would not repeat those charges outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael and Labour are not serving this Assembly by these charges and <Col N="919" /> I can foresee a day when democracy in this country will be brought into such disrepute that some extreme leftwing or right-wing lunatic fringe may try to seize power.  Fine Gael in the past have shown Fascist tendencies and it could well happen again that that lunatic fringe might get power in the Party and try, even by force, to take power here.</P>
    <P>A member of the Labour Party speaking in the House said that he would fight a civil war, should this referendum be accepted by the people. I do not know if his Party have rapped him on the knuckles for that nonsense, but I suggest that the people of this country will clearly see which side has made a case.  Neither Fine Gael nor Labour have even bothered to meet the case we have made.  Both have been satisfied to fling scorn, abuse and charges of corruption at the Government. The referendum is to be held because the provisions in the Constitution which this Government gave to the people&mdash;and I am old enough to remember the fierce opposition with which Fine Gael and Labour tried to stop it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They came along then with the same charges.  They said women would be put in nunneries, that they should have no rights, and that the president would be a dictator. Luckily, the people did not believe them and went ahead and enacted the Constitution.  It is ironical to hear Fine Gael and Labour Members now telling us about the great Constitution we have.  They tell us it is sacrosanct, that it is not to be touched.  All this indicates how old-fashioned they are.  They are not with it, not even in the twentieth century, in political and social thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise on this side that PR has been good to us, that unless it goes, Fianna Fáil are likely to be in power forever.  Built into the PR system is a safeguard against major swings either way.  Fianna Fáil could lose a few seats but would still be the biggest Party, fit and capable to form a Government.  That situation could be <Col N="920" /> defeated only by a coalition and we know there are forces in both Fine Gael and Labour working hard to bring that about.  I wish to heavens they could.  One of these Parties must be sufficiently strong to form an Opposition&mdash;I can never make up my mind which; some people say both&mdash; and we must have an Opposition.  Our reason for wishing to change is to enable the people to be represented properly, to speak effectively, so that the country can be provided with a good Government and an Opposition.</P>
    <P>I have always been in favour of the single-seat constituency.  We hear criticism of Deputies not doing their work properly, but many Deputies trying to do their jobs well know that it is an almost impossible task.  The area I represent or misrepresent is far too big.  My constituency stretches from the Poolbeg Lighthouse in Dublin Bay to Templeogue.  It is quite a territory, shared with me by Deputies J.A. Costello and Seán MacEntee.  Both are much more experienced than I and they, too, know how difficult it is to say that they can serve the whole area all the time.  Give us the single-seat constituency and each Deputy, whether Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael, will be able effectively to serve the people better.  They will know their people better, they will be at the grass roots, closer to the people, unlike the present system which gives us huge areas to cover, meaning, in turn, that it is very difficult to keep in touch with all the people.  The point is that an election is held to give the country a Government.</P>
    <P>I deliberately avoid going back and telling the House about what Deputies said 30 years ago.  I listened to an Opposition Deputy yesterday and after two hours he had reached only 1912. I had to leave the House.  Thirty or 40 years ago, the social and political set-up was much different.  We had alleged minorities who, because of the change in the set-up, had real fears that they might become swallowed up by the bigger Parties.  Today minorities are still there but they are integrated in our political life.  The Party to which I belong have people of all faiths but we share the common bond of being <Col N="921" /> Irishmen.  They know Fianna Fáil would never try to introduce legislation that would hurt minorities.</P>
    <P>When the PR system was praised 30 years ago, the praise came in the light of the circumstances then existing.  But they have changed since. To suggest that there should be no change is utterly ludicrous in this age and in this part of the 20th century.  We can point out that Britain has operated the straight vote system for a century. We can point out that the British Monarchy system has given stability to that country.  All over Europe, royal heads have rolled but it has not happened in Britain because they have had stable government there.  There are many minorities in Britain but, on the whole, they are not penalised. There are some ways in which they are penalised but they could be penalised under proportional representation or under the straight vote system which is the system they have there.</P>
    <P>I often wonder, if Fine Gael allowed a free vote on this issue in this House, how many people, voting conscientiously, would vote against the proposed change.</P>

      <P>We are giving the people an opportunity of voting on this issue just as we did in 1937 in relation to the Constitution, which also was opposed by Fine Gael. Despite their opposition, the people in their wisdom and intelligence voted for it.  The point I want to make is that if it is good for the people then we should change the system.  We in Fianna Fáil believe it is good for the people but we want the people to decide the issue for themselves.  There has been talk of dictatorship but that is ridiculous because the people who try to make these allegations&mdash;the Fine Gael Party&mdash;are the only Party who tried to be dictators of this country but the people sensed it and would again.  Deputy Ryan will admit that in a single-seat area, a Deputy can serve the people better than in a multiseat area.  Mathematics will prove that contention.</P>

      <P>I shall tell the Deputy about it now and he can say something in reply on the next Stage.  The straight vote system has worked very well in other countries and I am sure it will work well here.  A lot of silly things happen under proportional representation. The man who tops the poll is not necessarily elected.  The wishes of the biggest single unit of people who give their first preferences to a certain candidate are not heeded because of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh counts.  Some years ago&mdash;I was not a candidate at the election&mdash;I saw <Col N="924" /> a man get 6,500 first preference votes only to be defeated by a man who got only 2,500 first preference votes because his partner pulled him in on the second and third counts.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins suggested we should have better Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how perfect we may be on this side of the House, we could attempt to gild the lily and try to get a better type of Deputy.  We believe that the straight vote system which we recommend will bring a better type of representative.  If it achieves that, I think it is worth while to make this effort.  At the same time, I appreciate the worthiness of many members on the Labour and Fine Gael benches, some of whom work very hard.  However, because of the multiseat constituencies, and the amount of work to be done by each one of them, they cannot give the time to come here and to legislate, which is their primary duty.  They are bogged down writing letters, calling on people and meeting people who call on them.</P>
      <P>The area I represent has one of the highest number of voters in the whole country.  It is difficult to serve all the people.  For that reason, we seek the change in the Constitution.  There is no point or truth in saying that we want dictatorship.</P>

      <P>We seek the common good just as we have always sought it. The people have appreciated this and have returned us to office in one election after another.  They will continue to do so until we get a good Opposition which has the makings of a <Col N="925" /> Government within it.  Having heard members of the Labour Party and of the Fine Gael Party make charges of corruption against Fianna Fáil, all I can say is that the people will know how to assess the value of such charges.  Fine Gael continue to underestimate the intelligence of the people and, accordingly, Fine Gael pay the penalty.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to hear really constructive criticism of the proposals.  I had hoped people would say: &ldquo;This is a good thing&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is a bad thing&rdquo; and that we would have discussion on the merits of the proposal.  So far, I do not think one Opposition Deputy has spoken on the merits of this measure.  He has spoken about Taca, about corruption, about planning permission, about everything. Indeed, in an attempt to blacken the Government, one Deputy almost suggested that Ho Chi Minh is a member of Taca.  Such tactics do not serve democracy.  When the Irish people read reports of what is going on in this Assembly they cannot be blamed for thinking it is corrupt.  Let Fine Gael not forget that mud cannot be thrown without some of it sticking to themselves. I appeal to them to cease this abuse and, if necessary, to propose amendments to this measure.  I appeal to them to do a job for the country, for the people and for this Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, in the eyes of the Irish people, this Assembly has fallen to the very nadir.  People are questioning: &ldquo;What are the Opposition doing?&rdquo; Abuse is not a good tactic.  Will the Opposition please get down to their job now and discuss the merits and demerits of proportional representation versus the straight vote system; the single-seat area versus the multi-seat area?  We on this side of the House believe that we can serve the people better on the straight vote system in the single-seat area.  Members of the Fine Gael Party may be cynical. This is our ambition.  It is not to perpetuate the Fianna Fáil regime.  We do not believe that and we do not want it. In order to have a democracy there must be some change some time but there will be no change until the people <Col N="926" /> see that there is a worthy Opposition to replace the Government.  When the people feel that, they will act accordingly. No matter what the Opposition may do, they will not hasten that day until they prove to the people that they are a worthy Opposition, worthy of Government and they can move over here then.</P>
    <P>It is often said that a country gets the Government it deserves.  I can never make up my mind whether that is true or not but we should give to the people the very best machinery for electing the best Government we can have from the people who go forward. A Party with a policy should have the means of having this policy tested in the most efficient and effective way. The system which we propose to the people is the most effective.  Thirty years ago there was some case for having the PR system in order to assure the minorities that their rights would be respected.  That day is past. The minorities now are part of our society.  They are working, as we are, for the betterment of the country and have no fears that we will do anything against them.</P>
    <P>I heard a most dishonest case being made by an Opposition Deputy yesterday when he compared the straight vote in this part of the country with the system in the North.  He suggested that because there was not PR in the North the minorities there were given less representation.  Of course, he knows very well that the North has a very unhealthy political climate and that it would take more than a change of voting system to change that.  Let us welcome the signs that there are in the North of change.  Winds of change have blown through most places.  In the North they were not winds, merely wisps blowing along the corridors of Stormont.  It is unjust to make any comparison between the Six Counties and the rest of the country.  Any minority here that can get sufficient support under either system will, of course, have representation but it is not the duty or it is not the purpose of the exercise of an election to give every minority a vote here.  If that were taken to its logical conclusion one can <Col N="927" /> picture the Parliament that we would have.</P>
    <P>There are lots of people in the city here who have all sorts of parties.  They will never enter this House, I hope, because of the lunacy of their outlook. Yet, PR encourages the lunatic fringe to seek representation here.  This is one of the things which the straight vote would stop.  It might have the effect of making Labour and Fine Gael coalesce, which might not be a bad thing.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate.  I know that Deputy Kyne wants to make his contribution which I should like to hear but, unfortunately, I have to leave.  I would appeal to the Opposition, if they are going to take part in this debate, to discuss the proposals and stop the mud-slinging battle in the House, which is not doing their own Party any good and certainly not doing this National Assembly any good.  The people are talking about the attitude of the Opposition as regards corruption. If there is corruption, where you see it there are ways and means of bringing the people to law.  We do not employ the Attorney General for nothing. If people who have proof, or say they have proof, of corruption will only give this to the Attorney General and let him investigate it, they will be doing a far better day's work for the country and their own Parties.  I would ask the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to rise above themselves this time and discuss, for once, what is on the Order Paper here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start off by saying that I have no intention of attempting to attack Deputy Moore whom I recognise as a very decent, honourable Deputy.  I disagree with him violently on many of the things he said, but I believe in his sincerity.  He has appealed to us to deal with PR and PR only and not to attempt to deviate to attack failures on the part of the Government. The subject of this debate is PR and that is what I intend to deal with in my very limited time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputy Ryan speak for approximately three hours and I heard Deputy John A. Costello making a most interesting speech on PR, very relevant to the point at issue.  I want to treat the subject as I see it as an ordinary man-in-the-street, which is <Col N="930" /> how I regard myself, although slightly prejudiced because of the fact that if PR is abolished I probably will lose my seat.  I cannot help the fact that the desire to remain in Parliament exists in me as in most of us here but the fact is that I can regard the question in the normal way that the ordinary man-in-the-street will see it.  When I rudely interrupted Deputy Moore, not intending any offence to him, to say that outside the House I would be prepared to make a bet with him, I felt also that I would be betting on a certainty.  That is beside the point.</P>
    <P>I was not impressed by the Taoiseach's opening statement in connection with the reasons why PR had to be abolished and we had to adopt the North of Ireland system which Fianna Fáil do not like&mdash;the North of Ireland system of gerrymandering. That is exactly as I see the intention of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is true a British Labour Government is in under the same system, but that does not give it any particular significance to me.  In Britain there is a clear cleavage between the capitalist class and the working class.  The only cleavage in Ireland is between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in regard to what side they took in the Civil War.  That is the only difference I recognise between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>They both might have been of the same Party as far as I am concerned.  I am a socialist and have ever been so.  I come in here under the name of a Labour Deputy, but my policy is the policy of Connolly, possibly of Marx and other socialist thinkers.  I do not know whether I should include Mao Tse Tung because I have not read all his philosophies, but he certainly has done more for the people of China than was done for them under the old Dynasties.  I am quite sure that the coolies in China, whom I went to see 34 or 35 years ago, are far better off under the present system, whatever they call it, socialism or communism, than they were before they got this uplift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is beside the point. <Col N="931" /> We are a small country on the extreme western tip of the continent of Europe. The Taoiseach told us that by abolishing proportional representation we would have a better type of candidate who would give more attention to his duties.  Surely that is ridiculous?  Surely competition is the greatest thing in life?  If I am competing against, as I am, two Fianna Fáil Deputies in the constituency of Waterford, I will go all out to give service to the people of Waterford who voted for me and even those who did not vote for me with the intention of winning them over to the Labour Party.  If I had two Deputies who were not as attentive to their duties as I am&mdash;I am not saying they are not&mdash;and if by doing that, I could win votes for the Labour movement, am I not entitled to do it?  Under the new proposals I would be isolated, if I had the good luck to be elected, which is a different thing.</P>
    <P>I had experience of Fianna Fáil in 1961 when they reduced the Waterford constituency from four seats to three, adding it on to South Tipperary.  They decimated my county to within six miles of where I live and gave over 7,000 votes to South Tipperary with the intention of returning Deputy Loughman. Of course, they failed because even the Fianna Fáil people in my constituency rallied behind me and voted so strongly for me that not only was I elected&mdash;I normally was elected fourth out of four&mdash;but in 1961 I was elected first out of three with 1,200 votes in excess of the quota.  I could go out and celebrate my victory and leave Fianna Fáil to decide who was going to be the unlucky man.  Unfortunately for him, it was Deputy William Kenneally, Senior, who had to take the hammer.  I was not sorry for him because he voted for it and had to accept it.  Deputy Teddy Lynch came in.  Deputy Seán Ormonde was another unfancied Fianna Fáil man at the time. Deputy Ormonde, Deputy Lynch and myself were returned because the people of Waterford would not accept from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any Party that they should decimate the county and push more than a quarter of the votes into South <Col N="932" /> Tipperary to help Deputy Loughman.</P>
    <P>It worked two ways.  It helped my colleague, Deputy Seán Treacy, who headed the poll in South Tipperary.  If they had not decimated Waterford, I probably would have had to fight for the last seat.  I would say I probably would have made it.  This was the response of the people to a dirty deal by Fianna Fáil.  I might say it was admitted to me by prominent Fianna Fáil people&mdash;I will go no further than that&mdash;that the attempt was not to get me out, because they were not too bad about me, but they would have loved to have got the late Deputy Lynch out. Unfortunately, Fine Gael were too entrenched to allow any possibility of getting him out and the next best was to push me out.  Luckily for me, the people of Waterford did not agree. They gave me 1,200 more votes than the quota.  It was the first time I ever got it and I suppose it will be the last. Nevertheless, I got it.</P>
    <P>Not only the Taoiseach but any of the Fianna Fáil Ministers who spoke made a very poor case.  We have had few speakers on this from Fianna Fáil. We had a few backbenchers, innocent people who would follow the Party line irrespective even of their own interest.  But has anything been said to justify this change?  Deputy Seán Moore referred to the opposition from Fine Gael to Mr. de Valera's Constitution of 1937.  I am not so sure there was that opposition from the Labour Party at that time.  I have been in the Labour movement since 1926 and I do not remember campaigning against that Constitution.  In particular, I do not remember campaigning against PR being included in that Constitution. Mr. de Valera at the time, and all credit to him, riveted in this form of election.</P>
    <P>We should take pride in the fact that we are intelligent enough to use PR as it should be used.  A great Fianna Fáil friend of mine recently said to me that, if and when PR does not give stable government here, surely the Fianna Fáil Party should give credit to the people that they will then accept a proposal like this.  I have here a copy of <i>Trade Union Information</i> for <Col N="933" /> February, 1968, which gives a record of the Governments elected here, the proportions elected under PR and how they functioned.  If we look back we find it is a fact that this country has had more stable government than Great Britain had from 1923 to the present day.  There is the problem of uncertain government.  General de Gaulle had it in France.  He had to amend the Constitution.  The point is that there was a clause in the French system of election, or of forming a Government, to the effect that if you threw out one Government, you did not have a general election.  You had a shuffle up of the Parties and people combined to pick out a Coalition or an inter-Party Government&mdash;call it what you like.  They formed this Government rather than face the people. In Ireland that never happened.  When a Government were defeated, we never had an attempt not to have a dissolution but to have an inter-merging of the Opposition Parties to see if they could form a Government.  That never happened here.  I hope it will never happen.  General de Gaulle had to get that amendment through.  So that argument is not right.</P>
    <P>The other argument I understood the Taoiseach to make was that you would have a better type of candidate, a younger type who would be confined to an area and would have more time in Dáil Éireann.  I am sure Deputy John Lynch is as much a Deputy as I am.  I came in here at the very same time as he did, with just as much experience of Parliament as he had.  I am quite sure my intelligence is pretty well as good as his is.  I have used my 20 years in Parliament to know how to get elected, just as he has.  I do not think he has a God-given right to tell me now, because he is Taoiseach, that he knows what the country wants and is prepared to put it to the country.  It was put to the country nine years ago. I think it was Deputy Healy who said that if Fianna Fáil are re-elected, they will continue putting it to the country.  I doubt that, because I think that after the referendum they will not put it to anyone.  The only thing they will be putting to the country is whether or not they are going to <Col N="934" /> govern again.  However, that is another question, and one on which I am not committing myself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked me to talk about the referendum.  First and foremost, I want to say that the failure of Fianna Fáil to put this over was due to one thing and one thing only.  They were not telling the truth.  The real truth is that now, due to the coincidence of a number of deaths and victories in by-elections&mdash;and victories they were; let me be very blunt about it&mdash;they have now secured five out of the six vacancies; they do not have to depend on a number of Independents either being absent, or being here and assenting to what they are doing, or being here and moving out when a vital vote comes along; they have a complete overall majority.  It is in these circumstances only that they could get this through Dáil Éireann in the first instance and put it to the public.</P>
    <P>If they told the truth they would say this is an effort to continue Fianna Fáil in power indefinitely&mdash;my estimate is for about 20 or 30 years because of the fact that the Irish people change very slowly.  The effects of the Civil War will take a long time to die down. Those who fought with Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal will vote Fine Gael, and those who fought on the other side against Collins and the others will still vote Fianna Fáil.  The Labour Party are in the unenviable position of being in the middle and trying to reason with them.  Thank God, the young people are beginning to see that.  The proof is&mdash;if proof were needed&mdash;that in the Dublin local elections we defeated Fine Gael.  We got more councillors and aldermen elected than Fine Gael did.  We did not get more than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In the Cork by-election when we had a new Taoiseach facing his first by-election in his home city, Labour gained 2,500 votes even though the contestant had no chance.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael dropped votes.  Labour were the up-coming group, and they will be.  Why?  I was down there working and I was in charge of 20 university students, the coming doctors, teachers and professional people if <Col N="935" /> they do not have to emigrate.  I am hoping their enthusiasm for a socialist republic will continue right to the end and that the day will come when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will merge as the capitalist class which they are.</P>
    <P>Never mind talk of Taca or talk of that kind.  It irritates me.  There are people who are employed, and people who are employers.  It is a clear distinction. It operates in Britain and in most countries in the world.  We have it here in Ireland.  We represent the people who work and other people, and we are beginning to think we are entitled to a fair share of the wealth of the country which our labour helps to produce. We are not satisfied that Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will give it to us. We feel we are a separate Party and completely distinct from any other Party.</P>
    <P>The issues before us are amalgamated in the discussion on the Third and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bills.  On reading these Bills as an ordinary person in the street would look at them, here is what I assimilated: (1) the straight vote to be introduced; I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary will not disagree with that; (2) the single-seat constituency in which the straight vote would be exercised; (3) a commission to be set up to deal with the single-seat constituencies; (4) a differential in certain areas in the country as a whole which the Government of the day would be empowered to implement.  I do not think anyone can contradict me when I say those four issues are there.  There may be other side issues but they are the four fundamental issues, as I see them, which the ordinary man in the street will have to decide.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with those four issues.  I do not want to talk about Taca or even of unemployment or emigration except incidentally where they affect the question of this differential which would give the votes of people in a particular area more value than the votes of other people in other areas.  Other than that I have no intention of broadening this into a general discussion on how Fianna Fáil have carried out their duties here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> The straight vote simply means depriving a number of people of their right to express their view as a second preference.  I heard a lot of talk from a number of speakers about &ldquo;your second vote&rdquo;.  You have no second vote.  You have one vote, and one vote only.  That vote can be used only once. It goes to the man you choose and if he can use it to help him to be elected, it cannot go to anyone else, but if it is not of any use to him because he has been eliminated, it can be transferred. You have one vote.  As I see it, this question of the second and third and fourth vote, if I know PR&mdash;and I have studied it pretty well&mdash;does not arise. It is not correct to say you have a second, third, fourth or fifth vote; you have not; you have one vote but you have the right to say that if that vote does not help, or cannot help, or is not necessary to help, the man you have chosen, you have a second preference and it should go to a second man and, should he not need it, it should go to a third man.  Surely that is the essence of democracy?  Why should Fianna Fáil attempt to deprive the voter of that right?  If there is any reasonable argument that Fianna Fáil can put up for that, I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>Under the straight vote system, a man with 26 per cent of the votes can be elected to represent the whole electorate with 74 per cent of the people not in favour of him.  To give another instance, if there are 1,000 voters in a constituency&mdash;you can multiply the figure by 30 if you wish&mdash;where there are four candidates for a single seat and two of them get 250 votes each and one gets 249, the man with 251 votes can represent the total electorate. Or, in the same constituency, the four candidates can get 250 votes each, and I wonder how the Parliamentary Secretary would suggest they would decide who would be elected.  He might not like to comment on that.  The only thing I can suggest is a draw from a hat.  I know that can happen under PR but there are many devices that can first be tried.</P>
    <P>Supposing, in my constituency, Deputy Kenneally, Deputy Browne <Col N="937" /> and I stand in this one-seat constituency, when they have cut off Waterford, and we all get say 3,000 votes each.  Who will get the seat?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <P>I do not want to mention religious groups because I think that is played out, but I can see the NFA feeling sore about the Government, as they do, deciding to run a farmers' candidate. Because of the limited number of farmers, say, in the Waterford constituency, they would probably&mdash;they did before&mdash;get 6,000 or 7,000 votes but they have no hope of getting a voice in this House under the system now proposed.</P>

They will favour Mr. Loughman as they tried to do then.  The leopard is not going to change his spots.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the straight vote and these interruptions tend to put me off the point.  As I was pointing out, a candidate getting 26 per cent of the votes could be elected provided four candidates stand&mdash;and it would not be beyond the power of a wealthy Party or Parties to put up stooges and pay the £100 deposit to run perhaps a disgruntled Labour or Fine Gael candidate so as to split the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in <i>Trade Union Information</i> of February, 1968, that with 30 per cent, one can secure a seat under the system now proposed.  That means that 70 per cent of those who do not want the candidate will be deprived of representation. I want to warn the NFA, the trade union movement of which I am a member and any other group, religious or otherwise, that if they vote for this system, they will be depriving themselves of the right to criticise or comment on any action of the Government. I am quite confident&mdash;and that is why I offered to make a bet with Deputy Moore outside the House&mdash; that this proposal will be defeated not <Col N="939" /> only by 33,000 people, as was the case nine years ago, but by at least twice that number.</P>
    <P>At that time the proposal was coupled with the magic name of Mr. de Valera but intelligent Fianna Fáil people saw fit to elect Mr. de Valera as President and refused to give Fianna Fáil this monopoly which they attempted to get.  If and when Fianna Fáil dare put this to a referendum&mdash;I believe they will never put it as it is proposed in this Bill&mdash;I am quite sure that Deputy Norton, a former Labour man, is being used to put up an alternative that Fianna Fáil will be very happy to accept.  But it will be opposed by the Labour Party completely and, I hope and believe, by Fine Gael equally so.  There will be no compromise on this.  This will be a straight issue: either we hold PR as it is or have the straight vote; the alternative vote is not a substitute.  Deputy Costello has encouraged me to believe from his speech yesterday that that would be the Fine Gael view.  There will be no compromise on the lines proposed by Deputy Norton, perhaps on his own, perhaps inspired&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but certainly looking at the results of by-elections over the past session, Fianna Fáil will be very happy to accept as second best Deputy Norton's amendment.</P>
    <P>The question of candidates offering amuses me.  It is argued that under the new system, there would be select young candidates going forward.  What are Fianna Fáil afraid of?  Can they not put up as many candidates as, say, the number of seats in a constituency? Can they not give the people the right to vote for the Fianna Fáil man they like?  I can go back to a time when Mrs. Morrissey, widow of the late Deputy Michael Morrissey, was selected by a Fianna Fáil convention in Waterford in 1947 to contest Waterford. She was turned down by the Executive and then Deputy Seán Ormonde was put forward and won.  I contested the election and lost the seat. Why not let the Fianna Fáil supporters select the candidates by their votes, one, two, three, down the panel as they <Col N="940" /> normally did, and let the best survive? Operating the straight vote and imposing one candidate on one particular area is no choice.</P>
    <P>What happens if, for instance, the constituency I represent, Waterford, is divided into three areas?  Perhaps Dungarvan would be an area: supposing a Fianna Fáil man got in there, would all my supporters have to go to him if they had problems about social welfare, about health, about old age pensions, about injustices or grievances that needed to be ventilated?  Would they have to go to a Fianna Fáil man?</P>

I do not believe that my Labour people in Waterford would be happy to have either of my colleagues in Waterford. I say that with no disrespect.  They are both very good friends of mine and people I respect very much.  However. I do not believe my Labour people would dream of going to them or would get the same satisfaction from going to them as they would get from coming to me as their representative.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I believe sincerely that this is an attempt to take away the rights of a sectional interest of the Labour Party in Waterford.  The trade union movement is a sectional interest, consisting of the ordinary roadworkers, farm labourers and so on.  They have nothing in common with factory managers, big shopkeepers or big traders.  They have entirely different problems in regard to social welfare, old age pensions and so on.  If the people of Waterford vote for this proposal, they are cutting their own throats, and that is why I am talking here.  This is a dastardly attempt, a shocking undemocratic attempt, to fasten Fianna Fáil into power for the next 20 or 30 years, because they fear one thing and one thing only, that at the next election they will not have an overall majority. They are worried about what the Labour Party will do.  The Labour Party will have the balance of power.  I doubt if even the Parliamentary Secretary will deny that at the next general election, if PR remains, we will have the balance of power.</P>

      <P>I know that.  That is why Deputy Norton is proposing the amendment.  It suits the bigger Party. The bigger Party will win the by-elections because of the use of the alternative vote, which is as near as possible to the straight vote.  When the Labour Party made up their minds in Wicklow that they would advocate voting down the panel, then Fianna Fáil got the result.  We could have done it in Waterford where there were 1,500 plumpers, and where you still won by 600 votes.  If I, not because of who I am but as the Deputy in the area, advocated at that stage voting down the panel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had a lot of talk about going into the EEC but are you not aware that there is a European Parliament and it will not be elected on the straight vote?  Most of the countries in the EEC, apart from Britain, which you do not like copying, and the North of Ireland, have not got the straight vote.  I am sure that they do not favour the straight vote system.  If you could tell me what countries in the EEC, apart from Britain and the North of Ireland, favour the straight vote, I would be interested to hear of them.  There are different types of PR systems.  We have the minimum PR with the smallest number of seats, three to a constituency, with five as a kind of maximum. I remember that under Cumann na nGaedheal there were seven-seat constituencies. I remember Waterford and South Tipperary returning seven Members. Ex-Senator Jack Butler, Dan Breen, Seán Robinson, Nick Phelan, two Sinn Féin, or whatever they were called, and a farmer were elected.  If we go into the EEC, are you going to convince them that you are right, that Britain and the North of Ireland are right, and that they are wrong?

      <P>Tom Kyne might not be elected.  I know he will be but I do not like saying it.  It is a hopeless position. Are we not working perfectly well as we are?  We have two more Fianna Fáil Deputies for the time being.  That is only until the next general election when Fine Gael will win back the seat&mdash;that is obvious to everyone&mdash; and rightly so, because they have 8,500 electors who want a Fine Gael Deputy and it is right that they should have <Col N="946" /> that Fine Gael Deputy.  We have only 7,000 electors and, if they want a Labour Party Deputy, he will be elected.  Fianna Fáil have only enough electors to elect one Deputy.  If they had enough to elect two, they would get them.  It is because they have not enough to elect two that they want to deprive the people of their rights.</P>
      <P>The really important matter is the Commission which will decide how to re-arrange the constituencies.  I have read this Bill carefully and, if I am right in my interpretation, this Commission will consist of three Members of Dáil Éireann nominated by the Taoiseach and three Members from the Opposition.  That means three Fianna Fáil Deputies, two Fine Gael and one Labour.  Now Fine Gael and Labour do not always agree.  If there were disagreement, the three Fianna Fáil Deputies could override the others.  Even supposing we were unanimous and the Fianna Fáil Deputies took the opposite view, then the chairman, a High Court judge, will decide.  I do not hold judges in disrepute, but, if I were a High Court judge appointed by a particular Government, I would be inclined, no matter how impartial I wanted to be, to favour, without even knowing, perhaps, that I was doing so, the view of the prevailing Government, just as the Ceann Comhairle is compelled to vote in this House for the status quo or, in other words, support the people in power.  Even if the chairman did not do that, even if he decided to vote with the Fine Gael and labour Deputies and overrule the three Fianna Fáil Deputies, is it not true that in the Fourth Amendment Bill, power is taken to override that decision?  By a clear majority of Dáil Éireann, it is possible to revise the constituencies ourselves and say &ldquo;To hell with the Commission.&rdquo;  In the Fourth Amendment Bill, there is provision for Dáil Éireann, by a clear majority, to override the Commission, including the High Court judge.</P>

And Fianna Fáil have that straight majority.  Fianna Fáil can rearrange the constituencies if they disagree with the report of the Commission.  I say that is gerrymandering in its most blatant form and I believe Opposition Deputies have not yet really cottoned on to the fact that this is there. Deputies should know it.  The press should know it and publicise it.  The people should realise that Fianna Fáil, having set up a Commission, have also put in a proviso that, if they do not like what the Commission does, they can change matters to suit themselves.</P>

Deputy Carty is here and he will appreciate this: the only reason the differential is wanted is that down in the west of Ireland, Fianna Fáil have got more people in than Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil feel that if they hold the West with the same number of seats, they will be all right and by this ruse here, they want to maintain their present strength in the West, despite a falling population.  That is an objectionable practice.  Fianna Fáil should come out into the open and say that the West is their strong point and they are not going to lose Deputies there because of emigration.  I promised I would keep to proportional representation but I have to bring in emigration in this particular instance.  The people are emigrating, possibly for reasons beyond the power of any Government. It is a bleak place.  There is no living there and the people are leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>James Connolly said that the Ireland he believed in was not the hills or the valleys or the mountains; it was the people.  If the people are not in the West, why should Fianna Fáil attempt to give to the hills and the mountains and the valleys and the remaining few <Col N="948" /> people there an equal vote with a numerically superior population in other parts of the country?  This is purely a ruse to return an extra one or two Fianna Fáil Deputies as against Fine Gael, in this case, because the Labour Party have not unfortunately penetrated into the West to such an extent as to have a serious contest there.  Possibly we shall do that later. Seven votes in Dublin, five votes in Connemara if this goes through.  I assume this is where the ruse will apply &mdash;Connemara, Clare and other western areas.  Seven votes in Dublin will equal five votes in the West.  That is an end to the principle of one man, one vote that democracy demands.  We had enough of that under an alien government when the landlord had two votes to every one of the ordinary people. Now Fianna Fáil want to bring back that system.  Shades of the Republic! It is a very odd Republic now.</P>
    <P>I dealt with Deputy Norton's amendment. If not inspired by Fianna Fáil, it certainly suits Fianna Fáil to have this amendment.  I would not be a bit surprised if Fianna Fáil accept this as a compromise to help out the Labour Party and Fine Gael!  I heard Deputy Costello speaking last evening and I only hope Fine Gael will stand firm on this issue.  We will beat the attempt to abolish proportional representation if Fine Gael do not accept this wishy-washy amendment, which would really mean giving a definite advantage to Fianna Fáil, as things stand.  I hope Fine Gael will listen to my words and decide this is a straight issue.  Either they are for or against proportional representation.  The transferable vote in the single-seat constituency is not proportional representation, and never was, notwithstanding what the Constitution said in 1937.</P>
    <P>During the by-election in Wicklow&mdash; I did not have an opportunity of going to Clare&mdash;we had impassioned speeches from the Taoiseach, Ministers and Deputies explaining that proportional representation was not the issue in Wicklow.  What did they think the people in Wicklow, or Clare for that matter, were?  Proportional representation was certainly the issue. Fianna Fáil had gone all-out, saying <Col N="949" /> what they intended to do in June, and we were perfectly entitled to go out, as we did in Wicklow, and say to the people: &ldquo;Vote for anyone other than Fianna Fáil; having voted Labour, go on down the ballot paper.&rdquo;  Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, Liberal and Independents were all anti the abolition of PR. Nobody can accuse Sinn Féin of trying to do away with PR.  They cannot accuse the Liberals or the Independents of that and certainly Fine Gael have made their point clear, and thank God, seven out of ten, I understand, of the Labour votes were transferred to Fine Gael, not because we wanted Fine Gael in but because we wanted to defeat Fianna Fáil and the proposal to abolish PR.  We succeeded in doing that and we will adopt the same attitude if there is another by-election, as unfortunately there will be.  We adopted a different attitude in Waterford, in South Kerry and other places, but when the issue of PR and the rights of the people come into it, we will forget any differences we have with anybody and will insist that our voice will be heard in exercising PR to its fullest against the Party attempting to deprive the people of their democratic right.</P>
    <P>I feel sure Fianna Fáil have learned their lesson and they are regretting it now.  Do not tell me you had a victory in Clare.  If I put up an old coat in Clare and put FF on it, it would be elected.  We all knew that.  I think the Labour Party had the greatest victory in Clare because we increased our vote by 50 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that everybody who voted Labour knew they had not a hope of winning. It is a wonderful thing to be on a losing side and be able to fight your battle and stick to your principles. So many on other sides do not do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne exposed the attempt of the Government to muzzle even TV. I know that is denied.  I know there is a commission set up inside Telefís Éireann to investigate the leakage but it was quite clear and a copy of a directive given to the people who deal with &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; that they were not permitted to discuss the pros and cons of PR was published in the <i>Sunday <Col N="950" /> Independent.</i>  I would like to ask why. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister when he is replying why and what this new commission which has been set up will do about it.  All the people of the country are satisfied that that directive was given and was not given by the head of Telefís Éireann on his own behalf.  It was whispered over a table in some hotel in the country: &ldquo;This is a Government view.  We are not telling you to do it but if you do it will be looked on with pleasure and in the future the Government will be grateful to you.&rdquo; It was the most disgusting thing we had.</P>
    <P>I have had my doubts about even news announcements from Telefís Éireann.  I have noticed for quite a long time that when there is an official strike it is labour news but when there is a two-years agreement on no strikes as there was in the Waterford chipboard factory, it is a trade union agreement&mdash; a slight difference.  It is labour news when it is disaster, but when it is good news, it is a trade union agreement. Maybe I am just suspicious, but I have been struck continuously by the way our news announcers present news. Labour is attached of course to a political Party, even though we are very proud to have the trade union movement in with us.</P>
    <P>In the Wicklow by-election, we were told not to talk about PR.  There was plenty of reason for us to talk about other things.  However, we did concentrate on PR.  There was the question of emigration.  Is it not true that even OECD reports that 18,000 people a year have emigrated over the past ten years from this country as an average?</P>

      <P>I only wanted to throw in as an interjection the waste of time it is dealing with the straight vote because I know, and I know from Fianna Fáil people, that Fianna Fáil will be beaten by at least twice as much as they were beaten previously. They made an attempt in the early stages to parcel up the Third and Fourth Amendments together.  Thanks to the daily press which played a very prominent part in this&mdash;outside of the <i>Irish Press</i> of course&mdash;they were forced to change that but perhaps that may, as Deputy Costello said yesterday, suit them.  I am glad at least that the people have an opportunity of voting on the individual question of whether or not they want the straight vote as against PR.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this with prominent, intelligent Fianna Fáil people who, while admitting that they have voted for Fianna Fáil in the past and perhaps will in the future certainly are determined that the rights of the people of Ireland which they have had since the foundation of the State in 1922 will continue to be there, that they will be permitted not only to elect a Government but to elect by PR the particular individuals who will form that Government.</P>

      <P>Review of road transport facilities for merchandise in general and livestock in particular is a continuing process. In December, 1967 I decided to extend the scope of operation of certain merchandise licences so as to allow countrywide livestock haulage.  To date some 370 licensees have availed themselves of this concession.  At present 470 merchandise licensees, including CIE are authorised to carry livestock anywhere in the State and 300 other licensees can carry livestock in restricted areas.  There is no evidence to show that adequate livestock transport is not now available for the carriage of livestock.</P>

      <P>Regulations on weights and measures for which I <Col N="964" /> am responsible are contained in the Weights and Measures (General) Regulations, 1928, made in pursuance of the Weights and Measures Acts.  In general, these regulations relate to the methods of testing weights, measures and weighing and measuring instruments including the tolerances to be allowed in the tests.  I consider that the provisions of these regulations are adequate to cope with present needs in the field with which they deal.</P>
      <P>Modern developments, however, particularly in relation to pre-packaging make it necessary to supplement weights and measures legislation, and I propose to introduce a Bill which will provide for the labelling of certain pre-packed goods with the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure or number, and will permit of the standardisation in certain cases of the quantities which may be contained in a pre-packed container.  Preparation of the Bill has reached an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>I listened to the discussion in this House for the past three weeks and other than the Taoiseach's opening statement, no Fianna Fáil person has given us any further reason why we should have this referendum.</P>
      <P>The last Fianna Fáil speaker, Deputy Moore, got up here this morning and at great length criticised both Fine Gael and Labour for their incompetence&mdash;I think that was the word&mdash;in dealing with this Bill.  He said that as far as Fine Gael and Labour were concerned, all they were concerned with was throwing mud on the Government. We were not given constructive criticism or any reasons why PR should be retained.  Deputy Moore by his utterances proved to me that he must be extremely ignorant of the state and the history of this country or otherwise he is extremely naive.  I do not think he would still be in this House if he were as naive as he leads us to believe.  He said in the House this morning that the Fine Gael Party have always tried to destroy democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore, I imagine, is of my own day, or a little older, and he must <Col N="966" /> know that our predecessors on this side were the people who brought democracy to the country.  I hate perpetually to be looking over my shoulder and asking: &ldquo;Where were you in 1916, 1921 and 1922?&rdquo;  However, remarks like those of Deputy Moore should not go unanswered.  Our predecessors in this House were the people who restored democracy to this country and W.T. Cosgrave was the man who finally got the Fianna Fáil Party to recognise democracy and to come into the House.  He must have known in 1927 when he did that that he was putting them on the road to Government; yet he did it for the good of the country.  We have always stood for and always will stand for democracy.</P>
    <P>For that reason we are defending the right of the people to retain PR.  I believe PR is the fairest system, no matter what the Taoiseach says.  I read his speech, which I thought was in poor form.  He looked to Tasmania and to France.  I should not like to look too closely at France where the President is the power and Parliament only a rubber stamp.  Let us look closer to home, to Britain and to Northern Ireland.  Nobody likes to look at Northern Ireland but let us now look at it and at the straight vote system there and see how fair it is.  I do not think even the Taoiseach would have the gall to tell us that they have a fair system of election in the North.</P>
    <P>Here we have a fair system under which the people get the Deputies they want and minorities are represented.  A number of Government spokesmen have said minorities do not count any more because each Party look after religious minorities.  I should like to remind them that there are more than religious minorities: there are political minorities.  I am in a political minority in my constituency where Fianna Fáil have 21,000 votes and we have 19,000. We are in a minority but we are entitled to representation in proportion to our minority.  That is what PR is all about.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the straight vote would give a better type of Deputy.  I do not know what kind of <Col N="967" /> backbencher he has over there: some of them utter so little that it is hard to know.  I know that it would be very hard to get a better type of Deputy than we have on this side of the House. I should like to remind the Taoiseach of the danger in the straight vote system that headquarters could impose its will on the people in the constituency. Let us suppose Fianna Fáil have a strong majority in a constituency. There is nothing to prevent Fianna Fáil headquarters saying that A would make a good Fianna Fáil Deputy, that he would be elected whether he was the people's first choice or not.  In the present system, there is a panel and people within the Party can decide which Deputy they would wish to have.  During the 11 years I have been in the House, I have seen men who have been a long time in the House, who perhaps had gone beyond work, in the constituency sense, and yet, through loyalty in the organisation, were not asked to stand down because they had given 35 years of service.  But the people do not accept that.  They may elect a younger and better man of the same Party.  Time and again it happens.</P>
    <P>The people do not have that chance in the straight vote system, in which there is also a danger for the West.  One Party might have a majority there and I believe a Deputy might be chosen for election to the Dáil as a political perk, a little reward for favours rendered. He would be told: &ldquo;If you do your work for the Party, we will guarantee you nomination in the Loughrea area.&rdquo;  There is a shocking danger in this and instead of getting better Deputies, you would get worse Deputies.</P>
    <P>I was at a function recently, not in my constituency, and was sitting beside a Minister.  There was a man on the other side who is not a citizen of the country.  The Minister said to him: &ldquo;What do you think of PR&rdquo;?  He said he believed in PR.  The Minister then asked me what I really believed about PR and I said I really believed in it as the fairest system.  He said: &ldquo;We cannot go on having this set-up <Col N="968" /> within the constituency.&rdquo;  I asked him &ldquo;What set-up?&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;This throat-cutting that goes on.&rdquo;  We know it goes on, that there is terrific competition within each Party to secure the seat.  That Minister does not like it.  I believe it is good for the constituency because it brings out the best.  It means that Deputies have to be on top of their form because there are these bright young councillors and others ready to jump into the breach.  This competition within Parties produces good Deputies.  It is the very life of trade, as it were, this competition within constituencies.  It keeps Deputies on their toes.</P>
    <P>There is one little thing about PR that intrigues me.  In one of the Bills before the House we seem to be catering for people&mdash;a Deputy will serve the people better in a smaller constituency, we are told.  Then we turn our attention to the towns and in this instance the Government are thinking in terms of the Deputy, particularly in relation to the West.  When the Government speak of tolerance, their real motive is to maintain Fianna Fáil representation in the West.  They are losing a little ground in the West.  In my constituency we are entitled to only four seats and I believe the seat that would go is a Fianna Fáil seat.</P>
    <P>People may say: &ldquo;It might be your seat.&rdquo;  My reply is: &ldquo;All right; I will walk the plank.&rdquo;  It is well known that in politics once you are out of sight, you are out of mind.  I have been in the House 11 years; I have got a good run. I have worked hard but if the people of East Galway do not want me, that is their business.  They are still entitled to the right of one man, one vote, whether that vote be for a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael Deputy.  I can understand the Government preaching tolerance to the West in order to maintain their position there, but why not be honest and say it?  There is no other reason for their doing it.  I do not believe they think that extra Deputies will do more for the West.  Deputies in the West may be hives of industry but it will not save the West.  Neither will all the lip service which is only <Col N="969" /> another kind of throw out of the slogan: &ldquo;We will give you extra Deputies in the West as representation.&rdquo; It is not democratic or fair.  We should have one man, one vote and the matter of being east or west of the Shannon should not make any difference. I do not agree we should have extra Deputies in the West because I do not see what extra advantages that would bring.  The Deputies there work hard and any loss in representation would mean Deputies there would have to work harder.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Local Government for an hour and a half talking about re-arranging constituencies to give a little here and a little there.  At one stage, according to him, I had no constituency at all because part went to north Mayo, another to south Mayo, another to Laois-Offaly and another to Clare.  He amused himself re-arranging constituencies and explained that under PR that was impossible&mdash;they could not be changed in any way; they must be kept within county council areas.  Instead of amusing himself for one and a half hours, he should have done the honest thing and said: &ldquo;We will have one seat less in each constituency but leave the constituencies as they are.&rdquo;  It would save all this sort of rearranging that he said would be so difficult and so cumbersome to have in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Then he explained to us that the people themselves want this referendum. I may be very dumb or I may not be able to read the newspapers accurately, but that is not my understanding of the situation.  The only way we have of getting public opinion is by reading the newspapers &mdash; except for television, which is not very fair; there is always a slant to it.  According to the papers, this referendum is not wanted. I do not read the <i>Irish Press</i> but I suppose they want it.  The <i>Cork Examiner,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> have never advocated a change to the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to remind us that the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis looked for a change and that this resolution was carried at the Árd-Fheis.  The Minister <Col N="970" /> must be very naive if he thinks, after being as long in politics as all of us are, that one cannot have an inspired motion at an Árd-Fheis.  A motion can be inspired and one can organise matters so that it will be carried.  I am quite sure the Minister has not got so far in public life without knowing that these things can be organised.  If a person has enough anxiety to do so, he can organise a motion at an Árd-Fheis. It can be done at any Árd-Fheis.  It can be done in any organisation throughout the world.  If one cares enough about it, one can work up sufficient enthusiasm in any section of the community to produce, as was done at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, an inspired motion and get it carried.  That means nothing.  It means simply that a few Fianna Fáil people want a change to the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>Why do they want a change to the straight vote system?  Let us be perfectly clear.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says they want a change to the straight vote system because the Government are worried about the position of Fine Gael and Labour.  We are not fools in this House and the Fine Gael and Labour supporters throughout the country are not fools.  The Government want to change to the straight vote system because they want to cement themselves in government for, as near as possible, forever.  As the <i>Irish Times</i> editorial aptly put it, Fianna Fáil feel they have not the people completely nailed down yet and they want to have a last chance to do so.  That is the real reason.</P>
    <P>The people do not ask for a change and do not want it.  In fact, if we want to know what the people are thinking, let us study the verdict of the people of Wicklow in the recent by-election.  If the people want proportional representation, the verdict of the people of Wicklow can prove the position.  With the straight vote system, Miss O'Neill would have been elected to this House, which would have been very unfair because she polled little more than one-third of the votes. Under the straight vote system, she would have been elected.  Surely that would not be fair?  It would be in <Col N="971" /> complete disregard of the wishes of two-thirds of the people of the constituency. The Government got their answer in Wicklow and, believe me, they will get their answer in the country when they go to look for it.</P>
    <P>My constituency is difficult to work &mdash;I admit that.  However, I have worked it for 11 years.  I heard a Dublin city Deputy say this morning that his constituency is ten miles by something.  Mine is 100 miles by 105 miles.  Over the years I have been in this House, I have got to know every inch and highway and byway of my constituency and, while it is difficult, I do not mind working in a big constituency, and I do not think any other Deputy does, either.</P>
    <P>Supposing we had single-seat small constituencies.  Supposing we lost a seat in the original East Galway constituency. It would mean that my supporters in the old South Galway constituency would go either to Deputy Coogan or to Deputy Donnellan; they certainly would not go to the Fianna Fáil Deputy for the constituency.  I have proof of this.  Since Deputy Murphy died, I have received a great number of letters from Clare which proves that the 10,000 people in Clare who were represented by him will not go to the Fianna Fáil Deputy but will turn to the nearest Fine Gael Deputy.</P>
    <P>Instead of making life easier in a single-seat constituency, it will be just as hard because the public representative will have a certain loyalty to the people who supported Fine Gael in the past, whether or not they are in his constituency.  I do not believe for a minute that the old Cumann na nGaedheal and the Fine Gael supporters in the constituency would go either to Deputy Carty or to whomsoever they would be left with.  I believe they would go to the nearest Fine Gael man which would only make life extremely difficult for him.</P>
    <P>If I happened to lose my seat, I am convinced that, after a few general elections, that seat would not be recontested and we should end up with a position such as obtains in Northern Ireland where seats are not recontested. <Col N="972" /> Let us face the fact that elections cost a great deal of money.  I do not know the Fianna Fáil set-up but most candidates spend a lot of their own money at election time.  To stand time and time again, without a hope of ever being elected would mean that, eventually, the person concerned would ask himself or herself: &ldquo;Can I afford to spend this money?&rdquo;  Unless one belongs to a Party organisation with unlimited funds&mdash;as I believe Fianna Fáil have&mdash;where a person can be asked to stand for a constituency and told that the organisation will give him £500, one will not find many prospective candidates willing to stand just for the sake of going through the motions of having an election when they know they will not be elected.</P>
    <P>We are too conservative in this country.  In rural Ireland, we do not get the gigantic political swing one gets in Britain.  In Britain, there are big urban areas, whereas we have only one such area&mdash;Dublin city, which swings this way and that way, as everybody knows&mdash;but it is not enough to control the fate of a Government.  In regard to whatever Government would obtain office under a straight vote, nothing short of a revolution would shift them because we do not get the swing in rural Ireland.  Perhaps the reason is the accident of birth&mdash;because we were born of one political view or the other.</P>
    <P>I think it is true, in respect of any country that has had a civil war, that it takes practically a century to grow out of the direct feelings of civil war. Whether or not one likes it, rural Ireland is still greatly coloured politically by the civil war and people vote for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael&mdash;certainly in the West&mdash;because their people before them did so.  There is a slight change but the percentage is not big enough to get the big swing that is to be noted in Britain.</P>
    <P>I was amused to read&mdash;I think in the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;that the Government Party are employing a market research agency to advise them on the proportional representation situation.  I do not think they want a market research agency.  I think somebody in Fianna Fáil became alert to the fact that their proposals were not being too well <Col N="973" /> received.  I think somebody whispered a wee word in Deputy Norton's ear and that he was encouraged to put down his amendment.  We shall get time to discuss the amendment: this is not the place to do it.</P>
    <P>If the Government want any kind of a pointer or a leader as to public opinion in regard to the proposed change in the electoral system, I advise them to study the results of the Wicklow by-election, to look at the ballot papers.  A month or two ago, when we were first getting this package deal&mdash;the two questions all in one&mdash;the Government kept a close eye on the newspapers.  When everybody howled, through the columns of the newspapers, that this was not fair, they withdrew the package deal and the questions are now to be put separately.  As to the form of the questions to be put in the referendum, I hope they will be clear and precise and that people will know how they are voting.  There is a tendency to try to put the questions into Civil Service English and to cloud the issue and people will not know whether they are voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In regard to the last referendum almost nine years ago, people said to me when they came out that they did not know exactly what was the answer to the questions.  They knew they wanted PR retained but the question was framed in such a way that they did not know whether to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in order to express their wishes.  This time no effort should be made to fool the people.  If we are to be in any way honest, give them a fair chance to answer the questions according to their wishes.</P>
    <P>There is one thought that comes to mind.  Supposing, as I have no doubt it will be, the proposal to change the Constitution is defeated, are we again to be faced with this question in another ten years?  Is there no limit to this ridiculous question?  Will it be asked every ten years?  Surely the money spent in this way would be better spent in providing employment in the West or on anything you like in the West?  The sum of £100,000 would go a long way on projects other than having a referendum on the same question <Col N="974" /> every ten years.  I fear this.  Every time Fianna Fáil get an overall majority, the first thing that comes to their mind is that they must nail the country down good and proper.  The last time that they did it they had an overall majority.  Now they have an overall majority.  This is a danger.  We should be given some guarantee by the Taoiseach that if this proposal is defeated in the referendum, we will not get the same question put again in another ten years' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be but they must have some sort of standard.  They may shift him too if they are defeated in the referendum. There is another thing.  If the people want a referendum, there are so many questions that could usefully be asked. I do not think anybody wants the referendum.  I do not think the expenditure is justified.  There are a great many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who do not want it, but, being members of the Party, they must accept the majority decision.  They will not kill themselves working to have PR abolished, I can assure you.  It will be like the last time, when a number of Deputies did not do a hand's turn.  The same will apply this time.</P>
      <P>The people understand PR.  They know that it is fair and they will hang on to it.  The Government under-estimate the intelligence of the average citizen.  The people are highly intelligent. They know their rights.  They will try to hold on to them.  No fancifully worded Amendments to the Constitution, no fancy speeches asking us to look at France and Tasmania, will encourage the people to vote for the Fianna Fáil proposal.  I believe, and I think the people believe, that if the Government get away with this, they may end up with the situation where they will have between 90 and 100 seats in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hate to see the day when any Party in this country would be in that position.  Fianna Fáil have been a long time in power now and they have become very dictatorial with a bare <Col N="975" /> majority.  Given a situation where they would have a complete and absolute majority, they would do what they like.</P>
    <P>I believe absolutely that absolute power corrupts.  There is no doubt about that.  It is very easy to get absolute power under the straight vote system and it is very easy to corrupt Fianna Fáil.  Maybe it is not fair to cast smears only at Fianna Fáil.  We have never been in that position since 1932 but I would hate to see our own Party with 100 seats in the House, human nature being what it is.  I do not think we would be as easy to corrupt as the Fianna Fáil Party but I would not like to see our Party in that position. The people are aware of that and more than anything else that is what frightens them.  They do not want to see any Party with absolute power. They do not want to see a dictatorship in this country.</P>
    <P>Remember, it is only a comparatively short time since we got our independence and were freed from dictatorship. Surely we are not going to set up another dictatorship even though it is of Irish origin and nationality?  It would be a very sad day, an absolute tragedy, if we arrived at a situation where one Party would have complete and absolute monopoly in this country. I would hate to see that day, and for many reasons.  I would hate it for personal reasons.  I would hate to have to bring up my children in a country where, unless they were Fianna Fáil, they would have no future.  In fact, I am alert to that fact already.</P>
    <P>I believe that my children and the children of other Deputies would not have a &ldquo;look-in&rdquo; in this country.  We might as well educate them and prepare them for emigration if you had a situation where only Fianna Fáil would be tolerated.  That is what would happen when they had absolute power. They would walk absolutely on everybody else.  It would be jobs for &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; and &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; would be only those who voted Fianna Fáil.  It is bad enough as it is.  There are enough jobs for &ldquo;the boys&rdquo;, without making it absolute.  That is why I am appealing to everyone to hold on to PR.  We <Col N="976" /> fought hard enough to get the right to vote and we are not going to throw it away for a mere whim.  That is all it is&mdash;a mere whim.</P>
    <P>Some people say that it is because Mr. de Valera is now getting on in life and the Fianna Fáil Party want to present him with this last bouquet. They should have more in their minds and more concern for the country than the presentation of bouquets at this stage of life.</P>
    <P>We have emigration; there is the housing situation; the farmers are crying out for help and all they can think of is changing the system of election when there are so many other pressing problems.  The longer I am in this House the more worried I become.  We all in this House have a social conscience and a social duty and a moral responsibility.  The housing situation should worry everybody in this House who has any social conscience at all. Obviously, it does not worry the Government one bit.  This frightens me. People may ask what are the Opposition doing.  What can one do when there is not time to discuss these questions?  I am sure I am out of order now.  These are the problems the Government should be turning their mind to, not to wiping out a system of election that we all know and that very many people on the Government side are grateful to have, that is a fair system of election, that gives representation to minorities, not only religious minorities, every minority.  People who talk about minorities think of religious minorities only but there are all sorts of minorities, political minorities and other minorities, every sort of minority. PR gives a fair crack of the whip to everyone, and why not retain it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal, first of all, with the question of the Amendment dealing with tolerance so far as representation is concerned in the various areas.  Arguments have been put forward to try to show that it is essential that every vote should have equal value.  At the outset, I want to make it perfectly clear that there is only one way in which this can be done and it is a way which no Member of this House would tolerate <Col N="977" /> for a moment, that is, by adopting the general European arrangement where, with the exception of France, constituencies do not exist and the voter casts his vote for a Party only.  Each Party produces a Party list, a list of its own candidates, and if a party gets 25 per cent of the votes it is entitled on its own, without any selection by the electors, to nominate some of its candidates to 25 per cent of the seats. If anyone wants that sort of system, I should be very much surprised.  It is an abominable system but it does give a mathematical accuracy which, to my mind, is of no value whatsoever except for the satisfaction of pure abstract theoreticians.  As matters stand, each vote is not of equal value and it cannot be because constituencies are of different size and have different populations.  But even if each constituency had exactly the same number of voters you still would not have achieved the ideal unless you could ensure that the percentage vote in each constituency was exactly the same.</P>
      <P>Let us get away from this stupid chanting of the refrain: one man, one vote.  That gets us nowhere.  One man, one vote, simply means that each voter is entitled to one vote and one vote only as opposed to the system in Great Britain years ago when certain people were entitled to more than one vote and many people were not entitled to vote at all.  Now we have universal suffrage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely certain because the Constitution makes that provision.  Unless there is a further referendum and a further vote of the people, there can be no alterations. That is the sort of interjection I might have expected from the Deputy, but it does no credit to his intelligence.  Let us forget about this one man, one vote slogan, which is a slogan and nothing more.  No democracy has achieved this mathematical division of seats into votes cast except by way of the pure Party vote and the Party list system. <Col N="978" /> Even there it is not quite accurate because it depends on the percentage of voters who cast their votes in each election and that may vary considerably from one area to another.</P>
      <P>On the other proposal&mdash;the single seat constituency and the straight vote &mdash;the question has been asked and is still being asked by many people: why do the Government want to act now when everything seems to be running smoothly?  There is an answer to that which I am surprised so few people realise.  What we are trying to avoid is a situation where it becomes impossible to form a Government because of the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are trying to avoid the situation where it has become impossible to form a Government after a general election.  That is a situation which can very easily arise under a proportional system.  Where it is impossible or extremely difficult to form a Government a crisis arises.  Then the public begin to say: &ldquo;How have we got ourselves into this position and what are we going to do about it?&rdquo; Then people might say it is time we made some alteration in our electoral system so that we do not get caught that way again.</P>
      <P>By the time it becomes essential to carry out such electoral reform it is already too late and that is the invariable experience of European countries. The only time you can carry out electoral reform is when you have some strong and stable form of Government in operation.  It is only at that stage a Government can carry a measure such as this through the House and put it fairly and squarely before the people.</P>

      <Col N="979" /> The second question being asked&mdash;it was asked by Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins only a few moments ago&mdash;is why we should be having a second referendum after only nine years.  You might just as well ask why have a general election after only five years.</P>

      <P>You could just as reasonably suggest that Fianna Fáil have been in office for the last 11 or 12 years and it is hardly necessary to confirm the verdict again.  I cannot imagine the Opposition accepting that as a proposal.  They say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, the people have a right to change their minds.  They may very well have changed their minds by the next general election.  We cannot trust any Party in power for more than five years at a maximum.  I think that is a right and reasonable attitude.  But to say that the Irish people nine years ago have made a decision and that it is an insult to them to refer the matter to them again at this stage is nonsense. After all, there are hundreds of thousands of people who voted in that referendum who are now dead.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who will vote in this referendum who had not a vote the last time.  It will be an entirely different electorate.  Even if it was exactly the same it is no more wrong to have a second referendum than it is to have another general election. People can change their minds, do change their minds and very often want to change their minds.  If they do not want to change their minds and do not want to reverse the decision they do not need to do it.  But we believe they will.</P>

After you have been in power for 30 out of the last 36 years you can hardly expect the Party to be unduly nervous about its future.

That in itself shows what an empty charge this is.  We already have got all the power we could ever ask for or ever hope for, and there is no conceivable chance of our ever losing it in the foreseeable future.  Why should we be looking for any more power than we have got? Why should leading members of Fine Gael be so keen to join with us in this operation?  There is only one answer. There is no question of power craziness at all, but it is simply because we on this side of the House, and a number of genuine politicians in the Fine Gael Party, see the necessity for an electoral system which will guarantee the formation of Governments, and which will also give a reasonable opportunity for the formation of alternative Governments.</P>

      <P>If I am upsetting Deputy Harte I am sorry.  I can understand that hard facts are upsetting to him, but if he cannot take it he should feel perfectly free to withdraw.  At the moment what alternative Government is there to a Fianna Fáil Government?  The answer is none, because in spite of the suggestion from Deputy Dillon in his speech that there was still a possibility of Fine Gael and Labour joining to oust Fianna Fáil, that offer was not taken up with any enthusiasm by Labour.  Most people in Fine Gael are not interested in another Coalition and without Coalition it is obvious, as Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said, that it would take an utter landslide to make any alteration in the present set-up. Consequently Fianna Fáil are home and dry already at the next election and the next election after that, and there is no chance of an alternative.</P>
      <P>I was talking to a man only yesterday and he said: &ldquo;I am no supporter of Fianna Fáil but what I constantly ask myself is what the hell is the alternative.&rdquo; To my mind that is a dangerous situation.  The electorate should always be faced with a choice between one Government or another Government.  At the moment the electors have no such choice.  They have a choice between the Fianna Fáil Government or a chaotic bunch of independent small groups.  We and the politicians in Fine Gael feel that is a dangerous situation which should be ended at a time when it can be ended. We have no intention of waiting until the danger signals are showing because it is too late to act at that stage.  This is the time to act, and that is why we are going on with it.</P>

      <P>It is always thrown at us that this straight vote system is unjust and that it is unjust that somebody should have the right to be elected when there are more votes cast against him than for him.  To help Deputies of limited intelligence, such as Deputy Harte, let us assume there is a constituency with 10,000 votes cast and we have the famous three candidates, A, B and C.  A gets 4,500 votes; B, 3,500 and C gets 2,000 votes.  You can play any games you like with this result under the proportional system or the transferable vote but that would be pure imagination.  Under the straight vote, A would get the seat with 4,500 votes out of 10,000.  The howl of horror goes up immediately that this is unjust because there are 5,500 votes against <Col N="985" /> him.  Look at B.  He got only 3,500 votes for him and 6,500 against him. Who is going to say that B has a better claim than A?  He got 1,000 fewer votes for him and 1,000 more against him.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the question of the straight vote, I was pointing out that, to my mind, it is obviously fairest that the person who gets the most votes for him and the least votes against him should be the successful candidate as opposed to the person who got fewer votes for him and very many more votes against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go on to the question of the purpose of an electoral system.  The purpose of an election, basically, is to form an executive government, to form a parliament out of which an executive government can be chosen, but there are those who regard the whole exercise as more in the nature of a popularity poll.  It is anything but that.  We must stress to the electorate that voting is a hard-won right; it is a privilege and a duty which is not to be taken lightly.  If anybody comes along at election time and says: &ldquo;All I want <Col N="986" /> to know is who are the candidates and I shall vote for whomsoever appeals to me most,&rdquo; he would be as well employed in filling in the coupons for the Sunday newspaper competitions. It is not a matter of a popularity poll; it is a matter of electing a democratic parliament and eventually forming an executive.  It is no different from all the other elections which take place in different forms of human society, football or darts clubs, golf clubs, debating societies and so on.</P>
    <P>When you want to elect a committee&mdash;I ask each Member of the Opposition; I should say both Members of the Opposition since there are only two, to note this&mdash;to such a society or club do you decide that the first thing you want to do is make sure the entire membership of the society or club and all pressure groups therein are all fully represented; that you want somebody to represent the over fifties, somebody to represent the ladies, somebody to represent the teenagers?  You will never form a committee that way and Deputies know that well.  When you want to form a committee, you first decide whom you want to have as chairman, who is the person to co-ordinate the work of the others, control the committee and get the most out of it, get them working as a team, and then you elect the best man for the job.</P>
    <P>Then you want a secretary, somebody who knows the rules of the society or club, who is good at correspondence and record keeping, and you appoint him as secretary, not because he represents any body or any section but because he is the best man for the secretaryship.  You want a treasurer.  All right; you want a man who is scrupulously honest, who knows something about keeping accounts and who will be able to advise the society on its financial affairs and make sure that expenditure does not exceed income and so on.  The members of the committee are the people who will most readily and most devotedly work together in the interests of the society. The idea of representation as such does not exist and should not.  You are appointing an executive for a <Col N="987" /> limited period to do a certain job and report back.  That, to my mind, is the essence of the democratic parliamentary system, that you have got to elect somebody to take charge, to take control, to exercise power.</P>
    <P>You will always get bleating noises from the Opposition: &ldquo;What about the minorities?&rdquo;  I remember Deputy Hogan, as Ceann Comhairle, having to explain to the Opposition that there were the rights of the majorities as well as the minorities and that it was not overbearing on the part of a majority Government to do what it felt to be right.  At times the Opposition make out that it is very naughty of the majority Government to do what it believes to be right, and they feel that we should yield to the minority and to do what the minority want.  I cannot see any justification for that.  I am one of the few who can speak as a member of a minority.  I have been in a minority all my life and always will be.  I have got used to the feeling and learned to live with it.  One thing I have learned is that there is no use in bleating about your minority all the time.  What you must do is to try to join with the majority, to accommodate yourself to their wishes and to make sure only that on any matter of principle your own conviction shall be heard and respected.</P>
    <P>The idea that every minority should be represented is just too crazy.  There are plenty of minorities in this country, plenty of pressure groups, and if they are all going to be represented as such in Parliament we are going to get nothing but hot air.  We certainly will not get decisions, if we are going to have a representative of the shorthorn breeders being opposed by a defender of the preservation of the Grand Canal. This is the sort of pressure-group politics which we have to keep out of this House, because we must legislate for the whole community, bearing in mind the amenities of the Grand Canal and bearing in mind the cattle trade, the tourist trade and every other aspect of national life.  However, we must avoid the multiplicity of parties, the danger of which is always with us.</P>
    <P>That danger, as the Taoiseach has <Col N="988" /> said, has been greatly reduced simply by reason of the old loyalties and hatreds stemming back to the Civil War period.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins confirmed that herself when speaking before.  It is only that catastrophic division in our society which has prevented an even greater number of Parties than we have had already. There have been 13 Parties represented in the Dáil over the years, and that is far too many, because most of those 13 were not full-scale political Parties in a national sense at all; they were sectional pressure groups and no more.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the desirability of stability of government. For exactly the same reason as I have mentioned, we have had so far quite remarkable stability, simply because even with minority government the Independents preferred to go with the Government rather than against the Government in order to keep their seats.  Stability on that basis is an illusion and a dangerous illusion, that any Government should ever have to be looking across at the Independent benches to say: &ldquo;Will he come with us on this issue, or will we have to trim our sails in order to bring him with us?  Or will we have to have a general election simply because one Independent has changed his mind?&rdquo; We must never have the balance of power wielded by an irresponsible Independent, and most Independents are thoroughly irresponsible.</P>

      <P>I have learned plenty. <Col N="989" /> but nothing to make me change my mind on that question.  Deputy Dillon said it was most undesirable that we should have strong government.  He said he preferred a Government which was always looking over its shoulders. We have a certain university professor who has exactly the same sort of approach to the whole question of government.  There is also a substantial volume of public opinion in the country which does not like government at all. It prefers to go its own way, and it has an inherent distrust of any direction from an executive Government.  People say: &ldquo;We do not want any interference.&rdquo; Of course you do not as long as you can get your own way, but as soon as a bigger fellow turns up who is pushing you around that is when you want interference.  That is why a strong Government is necessary and that is why I would disagree with Deputy Dillon altogether.  It is a damnably dangerous situation to have a Government which is dithering.  A strong Government is one which is able to take unpopular decisions, to take them rapidly and decisively and produce results.  The Opposition will say this is overbearing, this is bullying.</P>
      <P>Take a case like the recent foot and mouth epidemic in the United Kingdom where strong measures, brutal measures, had to be taken to protect this country against the infection spreading here.  That was the action of a strong Government here.</P>

      <P>The overbearing majority created by the straight vote&mdash; let us look at that situation.  We do not need to look any further than Great Britain in regard to the present Labour Government.  What has happened there is that while they have a very safe majority does it enable them to disregard public opinion?  Not on your life.  Technically speaking they have a majority of 100, although it is dwindling, but the ordinary Labour Member of Parliament is becoming increasingly conscious of the resistance of his constituents to the policy, or lack of policy, of Mr. Wilson's Government and that is leading to growing rebellion within the Labour Government.  An overbearing majority?  Not on your life, because Mr. Wilson, the Prime Minister, is realising the hard way he is facing rebellion among his own Members.  I do not see any future for that Government, not in spite of its big majority but because of the swing of public opinion against that Government. That swing is immediately reflected in the actions of the back bench Members of the Party who are refusing to go into the Division Lobbies or are going blantantly across to vote with the Tories.</P>

      <P>It is quite the reverse. Deputy Harte cannot be that thick really.  I will assume that he is not. I will just ignore the remark.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even though it has a technical majority, but because a technical majority, because public opinion is turning against it and because Labour Members are turning against their Leader and abstaining or rebelling openly.  That Government is just as susceptible to a swing in public opinion as if they had started with a majority of only three or four.  There is no question of a Government becoming overbearing in face of outraged public opinion.  This is a democracy in which each member has to face his constituents regularly.  If any of us is getting the works from our constituents about Government policy you can bet your life we get on to the Minister straight away and tell him, leaving him in no doubt that such-and-such is taking place.  There is no question of an overbearing majority and in actual fact you get a much greater freedom of debate where there is a strong Government, where Members of the Government Party can speak their minds freely without thereby endangering the whole fate of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people say that the straight vote would wipe out Fine Gael or Labour.  I see no danger of that happening as long as these two Parties can really form themselves into national political Parties with a fully comprehensive national policy.  I was talking to one Fine Gael backbencher&mdash;I will not mention his name&mdash;and he assured me that this was the end of Fine Gael if the referendum went through.  I said: &ldquo;How on earth would that happen?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;On a quick check, Fine Gael cannot get a seat in the city or county of Cork, nor in Meath, Cavan or Monaghan.  It would be doubtful in Galway.&rdquo;  He said that <Col N="992" /> they would not get a seat anywhere. I said to him: &ldquo;If you cannot get a seat anywhere, you might as well pack your bags and look after your fields or something, if you have no hope.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes; there are two brothers who sleep very happily in chairs facing each other, but they are both Members of Fine Gael.  If any Party go before the people and say: &ldquo;We have not a hope of getting to the top of the poll in more than five or six areas,&rdquo; they have admitted defeat before they start.  I do not believe this will wipe out Fine Gael, but I believe that it will put new life into them, and above all give them an opportunity if they have the guts, and some of them have, of forming a really possible alternative Government.  It would not need such a huge swing of votes to put Fianna Fáil out under the single member constituency as it would under PR, but some of the Fine Gael and Labour Members do not want power or responsibility. They prefer to be the hurlers on the ditch indefinitely.  If that is where they want to stand, do not let me stop them.</P>
      <P>People have asked: &ldquo;Why have you gone for the straight vote and not maintain the transferable vote for a single seat constituency?&rdquo;  I found tremendous support generally for the single seat constituency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall not be regarded as interrupting Deputy Harte if I continue.  On this question of the single transferable vote in the single-member constituency, I find myself, rather surprisingly, absolutely at one with a very old and redoubtable opponent, Miss Enid Lakeman, of the British Proportional Representation Society, who recently wrote a very strong letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> commenting on this proposal, which was alleged to be that of Deputy Norton, and saying that the transferable vote in the single member constituency was complete nonsense.  She did not use the words that Deputy Dillon used, but she might very well have described the proposal as a fraud and a cod.  I thoroughly agree with her in that.  I do not think it would make the slightest difference to the result and one reason why I have always been in favour of the straight vote is because I prefer to make a clean breast of the thing and not try to give any impression to anyone that I am in favour of any <Col N="994" /> element of proportionalism whatsoever. You cannot have proportional representation in a single member constituency. You can have only one member in a single member constituency. If, for any reason, people say they want to vote one, two and three, that is just a habit; they do it like filling up a football coupon.</P>

      <P>It is also improper to interrupt but that does not stop the Deputy.  If people want it one, two and three, that would not come between me and my sleep.  I am not in favour of the transferable vote but I shall not weep any salt tears so long as we have the single-member constituency. That is the main thing.  If we have the transferable vote, let it be made perfectly clear that it is even more of a cod and that it will not give any proportional result.  In actual fact, it will not affect the result to anything more than a marginal extent.  I should be afraid, if I were to advocate that, that people would say I was trying to cod them into believing they were getting proportional representation.  I want to get rid of proportional representation and all its works.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish, Deputy Treacy and others said we should at this stage be trying to become more European and that we should adopt the European parliamentary and electoral system, which has given rise to such stability on the Continent.

      <P>Maybe it is bad indigestion. I am sorry if I upset the Deputy because he is bound to get a duodenal ulcer very shortly.  Let us start off with France and see what the situation is there.  The Taoiseach's reference has been completely misinterpreted.  What actually happened &mdash; Deputy Harte would not remember&mdash;was that in 1957-58 there was a situation in France in which Governments were flashing in and out at such a rate that one could never keep track of them.  Eventually the situation became so impossible&mdash; Prime Ministers were lasting only a matter of hours at a time and Cabinets likewise&mdash;that an appeal was sent out to General de Gaulle to come and get a grip on the situation.  Only a very able and resolute man could do what General de Gaulle did and it was only by reason of his record and his standing that he was able to do what he did. Mark, you, he has not finished yet. But, in 1958, he managed to get some electoral reform pushed through the Assembly out of sheer desperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That illustrates to me, and it should illustrate to the House, the point I was trying to make earlier, namely, that by the time electoral reform is essential, it is almost too late to do anything about it.  It was not until complete chaos had broken out in France in 1957-58 that General de Gaulle was able to get this electoral reform through and have, for the first time since 1936, <Col N="996" /> a general election with single-member constituencies.  That was the matter to which the Taoiseach referred.</P>
    <P>One has only to read General de Gaulle's speeches to see his absolute horror of multiplicity of parties, such a multiplicity as existed in France at the time.  Many of these parties he denounced as not being parties at all. Very correctly, he denounced them. They were party groupings, small pressure groups, splinter parties of all sorts and sizes.  In that political situation, he managed to get a new system of single-seat constituencies, but with a double ballot, which, to my mind, is an abomination. At the election in 1958, there were 12 major political parties, big enough to put up 75, or more, candidates. But the political situation was so confused that you had 2,978 candidates for 465 seats.</P>
    <P>The first ballot was held and, for Deputy Harte's education, I might mention that on the first ballot the only person elected is the person who gets the quota, as it were, and if nobody gets the quota, nobody is elected, and one has to move on to the second ballot where the straight vote majority system operates.  After the first ballot, 1,000 candidates retired from the field of battle and 500 others were eliminated, because they had not got sufficient votes to qualify for the second round.  If you did not get more than five per cent of the votes, you were not allowed to play again.  Eventually he did manage to form a Government but he had not managed by any manner or means to overcome the problems which he inherited through the multiplicity of parties.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the last election in March, 1967 where he had to rely eventually on the help of a group called the Independent Republicans. They wanted to call themselves the Gaullist Republicans but he would not allow his name to be attached to that party, so they called themselves the Independent Republicans.  With their help and the help of three Independents, he just managed to scrape a majority, but he is still bedevilled by a multiplicity of parties.  He has one called the Democratic Union of the Fifth Republic, the Independent <Col N="997" /> Republicans, Progressive and Modern Democrats, Federation of the Left, Communists and Independents.  That is what General de Gaulle must wrestle with.  He is a very resolute man and I think he will make progress but he is wrestling with a fearful problem which was bequeathed to him by a proportional system.  He is trying to wipe out most of these small groups and splinter parties and knowing him I believe he will do it and he will leave a much better parliamentary democracy behind him than he found when he came in.  Let us not cod ourselves either, it is not a parliamentary democracy at the moment, it is virtually a Presidential Government verging on dictatorship but not quite.  That is all because of the fragmentation of the proportional system.</P>
    <P>We go to Germany now.  German history under proportionalism is equally bad.  It was under a proportional system that the Nazi Party gained strength and was able through using democracy to defeat it and it was when complete confusion had broken out in Germany that the President had to call on Adolf Hitler as the only person who seemed to know where he was going and who was in charge of a party which was held together and was able to do something. We know the disaster that was.  That was entirely because the ordinary process of government forming had broken down completely.</P>
    <P>After the war, they tried again, and with other Members of this House, I visited as guest of the President of the Bundestag, the Parliament in Bonn and also made a tour of the country.  One of the leading German politicians said to me: &ldquo;What is your reaction to our system?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I have not been here long enough but I am studying it and I am interested.&rdquo;  He said to me: &ldquo;Please be sympathetic because remember, we are trying only for the second time to run a parliamentary democracy.  The first one we ran led to Hitler and we are in danger of doing the same again.&rdquo;  How right he was. Look at the last general election in 1965.  There were various major parties and five smaller ones.  The major parties were the Christian Democratic <Col N="998" /> Union, the Christian Social Union, the Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party, the German Peace Union.  After the election, out of 494 seats the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union together managed to get 245 seats with 47.6 per cent of the votes.</P>
    <P>Here you have a system where you vote for the party and find out what the total percentage party vote is and then the party allocates the seats, a thoroughly unsatisfactory system.  In that position no party had an overall majority and a Cabinet was formed of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union with the Free Democratic Party.  What a job it was to form that Government and this is what always happens under the proportional system where you have to have a coalition.  Before they could get that coalition in 1965 there were strong objections lodged by Dr. Adenauer and others to the inclusion of Dr. Schroder as Foreign Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an awful lot of sin around for many years. There were objections by the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union.  They would not have Dr. Mende of the Free Democratic Party as the vice-Chancellor.  This was the price of the Free Democratic Party.  They said: &ldquo;We will play ball with you as long as our Dr. Mende can be vice-Chancellor&rdquo;.  The others objected, but in the heel of the hunt, this comparatively small party, with only 49 seats, 9.5 per cent of the votes, were able to appoint the vice-Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.  This is crazy but that is what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Federal Democrats went on to insist that Herr Strauss be excluded and they won that one, too.  They were <Col N="1000" /> fairly threshing around at that stage. Then the Christian Social Union came back and said their union must have the portfolios of Foreign Affairs and Defence, or they would not play ball. All this bargaining went on.  This is a crazy way of setting up a Government. If they were united they would be in the same party but they did not agree. They hated each other's guts in many cases.  They disagreed on policy and all this huckstering went on in the background.  Consequently the constitution broke up in 1966 when the Free Democratic Party in the Coalition would not weather the budget.  They said: &ldquo;No.  We are not going to have that amount of taxation.&rdquo;  That wrecked the government.</P>
    <P>There is this feeling that there is stability in Europe simply because you do not have so many general elections. That is simply because defeats of government and parliament as such just wait for the formation of a new Government. The existing coalition government broke up when the Federal Democrats pulled out.  At the same time Dr. Kiesinger succeeded Dr. Erhardt as Chancellor.  It took a whole fortnight of bargaining behind the scenes, a whole fortnight of negotiations, before the new Cabinet could be formed.  It is a damned dangerous situation to have no Government in power, no Executive for a whole fortnight.  Anything could happen.  A new Cabinet was eventually formed between the Christian Democrats, the Christian Socialists and the pure Socialists, Herr Willi Brandt and his socialists.</P>
    <P>There you have a coalition which is most unhealthy in so far as it controls 477 seats, leaving an Opposition of only 49.  I do not know whether you consider that as hopeful, helpful, or wise.  I consider the present situation in Germany is critical simply because of this wretched proportional representation system which has got them into this state in regard to a coalition Government, a Government already split right down the middle.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this more clearly shown than in regard to foreign affairs where you get the Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger supporting the President of France and <Col N="1001" /> his Foreign Minister denying he made the remarks which, if he did not make them about General de Gaulle, he would have loved to have made.  Everyone knows that Herr Brandt is utterly opposed to General de Gaulle and everyone knows that Dr. Kiesinger is supporting General de Gaulle.  That is the situation which you should not have and which should be terminated in the interest of peace and safety as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Let me go to another part of Europe, Greece, where the present system of election before 1963 produced such a system of chaos that they amended the system and introduced a reinforced proportional representation system which eliminated altogether any Party which did not hold more than 15 per cent of the votes.  That did not give any great help to minorities. It wiped out a whole lot of minorities. Even then in 1963, the election gave no majority and the Government lasted only three months.  The next election gave a majority to a Coalition, but during that time six Cabinets resigned over various issues, the last of which was electoral reform because they at last got the message that they would have to reform the system still further, but they had not the majority to get it through.</P>
    <P>They resigned after several break-up of Cabinets, and while there was no Government, the army took over.  Here we have a situation where, as happened repeatedly, the system of proportional representation has led to the breakdown of Parliament.  Dictatorship has had to be introduced to avoid chaos. We know that the situation in Greece is a disastrous one and we do not want that to happen here.</P>
    <P>We now look at Italy.  The Italian system at the time of the war was not unlike that of Germany.  There was proportional representation with a multiplicity of Parties incapable of forming a Government until Mussolini was sent for.  He was the only person who happened to have any body of organised opinion behind him.  He started off quietly enough and we know how he finished up.  When that system was adopted in 1919 one of <Col N="1002" /> the politicians of the day Signor Alessio said: &ldquo;The application of this system of election would lead to a very bad functioning of the Chamber which would make it impossible to form a lasting Cabinet and would bring about in the long run a paralysis of public life.&rdquo;  That is what happened. He saw this system was bound to lead to that.</P>
    <P>The 1963 general election had 630 seats and 303 Party lists alone to be looked at.  There were 5,750 candidates. The largest Party, the Christian Democrats, got 38 per cent of the seats, the second, the Communists, got 25 per cent.  A Government was formed.  The first failed instantly.  It was only formed and disappeared at once.  The second was formed as a minority, temporary Government which lasted only four months.  The third was a coalition of Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, Italian Socialists and Republicans and lasted only six months.  It then broke up and had to be reformed after bargaining. It has gone now and there is a general election pending.  How could you have a reasonable Government formed out of Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, Italian Socialists and Republicans? Is there anything in common between them?  If there was at that time, they would all be in the same Party.  It is because they are all different and have different opinions that this has given rise to ineffective government.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands, a general election took place in February, 1967. There were 23 parties alone which contested this proportional representation election in 1967.  As a result of a certain reinforcement of the system, only 11 Parties were represented in the final figures.  The percentage of votes cast for each party ranged from a maximum of 26.5 down to a minimum of 0.86.  How in the name of all that is wonderful could you form a Government out of a conglomeration like that?</P>
    <P>Negotiations for a new Cabinet lasted from February to April.  Imagine a country without effective government from February to April while the politicians are discussing among themselves: <Col N="1003" />&ldquo;What will you give me if I give you that?  If you press for me I will give you&mdash;&rdquo;.  This sort of bargaining which went on without any reference to the electorate is pure huckstering.  I do not like that.  I know it happened during the Coalition here the last time, and I did not like it then.  When it takes from February to April to form a Coalition Government&mdash;we know this is the ecumenical age&mdash;between the Catholic People's Party, the anti-revolutionary Party and the Christian Historical Union, what kind of Government can you have?  The last two are Protestant Conservatives.  You do not find those three sitting down and shaking hands. If they were really in agreement about national policy, they would all be in the Catholic Party, but in actual fact those are all independent of each other, with different views about national policy.  That is too damn difficult.</P>
    <P>In Belgium, there was a general election in May, 1965.  There were 212 seats.  The biggest party got 77 seats. There were nine parties represented in the final figures.  They included language groups and two groups of Communists, one pro-Moscow and one pro-Peking.  How further can you go than to get a Belgian group calling themselves a pro-Peking Communist Party?  There was a resignation of the Cabinet immediately and a crisis under the caretaker Government and two months' bargaining before they formed a Cabinet.  They got a Cabinet of a sort which fell a few weeks ago and the King is still trying to find somebody to form a Government.</P>
    <P>The reason they fell rests on two issues, a language issue and a university issue.  Let nobody say that can not happen us here either.  What does a strong government do?  It took a strong government to make a decision and a strong Minister, God rest him, to make a decision that UCD and TCD would merge.  The Belgians were not so lucky. They got tangled up on a language issue and on the siting of a university to such an extent that the Cabinet tore itself to bits and disintegrated simply because there was nothing to hold it</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> God protect us from anything of the sort of a European system.  In Denmark nine Parties contested the election&mdash;Social Democrats, Radical Liberals, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, a Single Tax Party, Communists, the Liberal Centre and the Independent Party.  How can you have that number of national political parties?  These are purely political pressure groups and a minority government that had to be formed by the Social Democrats with the qualified support of the Socialist Party, but this may be withheld at any moment and bring the whole thing tottering to the ground.</P>
    <P>Labour have held power in Norway for 40 years.  Now they have lost power because Labour had only 68 seats out of a total of 150 and you have a Government of Conservatives, Liberal Party, Centre Party and Christian People's Party.  That reminds me very much of home.  None of these has anything in common except they all hated the Labour Party.  As Deputy Dillon makes clear in our case the main thing to do was to see if by any chance some grouping could be made to get rid of Fianna Fáil, not because he had anything constructive to offer but simply because he hated our guts. That feeling is shared by a number and it is destructive.  Nobody is entitled to say he is against a Party if all he has to say is: &ldquo;God, how I hate them.&rdquo; We have to have something more than that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that nine years ago I fought all around the country: I argued in the country and I argued in the House to convince the people that the single-seat straight vote system was the best.  Everything that happened since that issue has confirmed me in my belief and made it stronger still.  The European parliamentary system is an exact parallel and we cannot ignore the fact that proportionalism has led to disasters time and time again.  This is the time, when we have stability, when we have a strong government, to take this step and I think we will be able to do it.  I believe the people will come with us.  There was confusion the last time partly because of the Presidential Election at the same time but there was only a <Col N="1005" /> small majority vote against the referendum.</P>
    <P>The people now have got the message so far as the single-seat constituencies are concerned and the great majority want it.  I should like to make a clean break and have nothing to do with PR and have the straight vote.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Harte would rely on facts rather than on prejudice he would be better employed.  I always feel he is one to whom facts are always embarrassing.  I would ask him to screw up his courage and look up his history.  I am sorry misinterpretation has taken place, but I do not think we have any reason to fear the result except that there is complete apathy.  I am satisfied that the whole kick has gone out of this issue.  The last time there was a tremendous battle going on.  Now it is obvious they are with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do hope we will be successful in this because I am convinced <Col N="1006" /> that this will be a tremendous improvement of our whole system.  I think we will probably get the same Deputies but we will be able to do our job very much better and those of us returned under the new system will be much better for it.  We will have a smaller area to look after.  We will be finally responsible for that area and it will mean that by-elections will be a more realistic operation than they are at present.  If there is a by-election for a seat which was previously for one political Party, it will be doubly interesting to see if there is a swing of votes for that Party.  That would be an assistance to the Government generally in a much more real way than can be done under the present system.</P>
      <P>Above all, we must in this present condition of stability not lose the opportunity of taking this action which will ensure for the future that we will never be faced with the situation in which there is difficulty in forming a Government.  This can be utterly catastrophic and all the experience has been that it is catastrophic.  Now is the time to do it&mdash;now, when everything is quiet, when everything is stable, when everything is right.  If we leave it until it becomes obviously necessary, it will already have been too late.  We cannot wait that long.  We might be able to go on for quite a long time, but whatever happens, it will be more in Fianna Fáil's immediate interest to retain the system which has kept them in power during 30 out of the last 36 years and during the last 12 years consecutively.</P>
      <P>I for one much prefer a system which would give us a strong Government faced with strong Opposition. The weakest part of our present system is that we are faced with no Opposition at all.  There is no alternative Government.  Labour are far too small; Fine Gael are far too small. They hate each other.  They will not co-operate in spite of the tentative offer of Deputy Dillon.  We know they will not coalesce again, except under tremendous pressure, and that if they do, they will fall out again, like they did the last time.</P>

Fine Gael say they will be all right under this new system; Labour say they will be all right under it.  We know we will be all right, so let us all go in together. There is bound to be a certain change. Governments will tend to be slightly larger, which will give members a much greater freedom to speak their minds and to criticise members on their own side, which is very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a majority of only one, there has to be strict Party discipline: nobody dare go sick or go into rebellion. That is not healthy.  It is far better to have give and take in the Government benches and we must have a system under which that can happen.  Then, if the Government lose the confidence of the people, the people will have a chance to sweep another Party into power, with enough power to rule.  The essence of democracy is the giving of absolute power to an Executive for a limited period on the ground that at the end of the period they will be held accountable for what they did.  That is <Col N="1008" /> healthy; that is the right way of doing it.  I am 100 per cent behind this and I believe we shall get it this time.

May I intervene again at this stage to say: Let us get down to a system of election which will produce a Government unlike those which the present system has consistently failed to produce in Europe.  There is not stability in Europe.  There is stagnation simply because parliaments will sit waiting for the executives of parties to strike bargains and form groups at the top. That is a denial of democratic principles. People must have their say in these matters.  I am all for the people having it.  Europe has nothing to teach us but we have much to teach them. The Germans are seriously considering the straight vote.  De Gaulle has gone a certain distance and wants to go further and faster than he is going at the moment.
