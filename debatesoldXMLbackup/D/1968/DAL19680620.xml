      <P>I have not much more to say.  I think I can welcome the Opposition attitude as disclosed by this amendment as apparently indicating a change in their opposition to these Bills.  It is obviously a tacit concession that they now recognise that at least the Third Amendment Bill will be accepted by the people.  I think this shows that Deputies opposite have realised that they are wrong in the attitude that they are taking to this Bill.  They have appreciated that what they are seeking to do is to perpetuate a system that requires injustices to be done on the people and that they are now inclined to return to what was obviously their original decision to support this particular amendment because, as I pointed out last night there could be no other reason for their demand that we should change this proposal of ours into two separate proposals than that they intended at that time to support one and oppose the other only.  It shows that they are now beginning to appreciate that this changed decision of theirs, based on their consistent policy down the years of opposing principles purely and simply on the basis that they were brought in by Fianna Fáil, was a misguided decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is this changed attitude merely due to the fact that those who see the injustice that the Party decision to oppose this amendment would inflict on the people have refused to conform to the Party attitude and that they have refused in fact to conduct the campaign which will obviously in their own constituency result in a considerable injustice being done to the electorate there, or have they <Col N="1389" /> actually been authorised to adopt a different attitude from the official Party attitude.  I cannot help wondering whether or not this also applies to the almost 50 per cent of the Fine Gael Party who were in fact in favour of our full proposal in any case.  It is quite clear that, now that they have come around to tacitly agreeing that the Third Amendment Bill is bound to be passed by the people, we can almost assume that before the debate concludes they will be equally prepared to accept the inevitable and that is that both Bills will be endorsed by the electorate, in other words that they will accept that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party will have his way in spite of the Party which he leads.</P>
    <P>In so far as we are concerned we have confidence in the people and we have confidence in the ability of our voluntary organisation to break through the paper wall erected by the Opposition newspapers and to overcome the one-sided propaganda disseminated under the masquerade of factual reports. After all, Fianna Fáil have experienced this right down through the years and we have been successful in spite of this consistent effort to present only the case against Fianna Fáil and against what Fianna Fáil propose. We see in today's papers a foretaste of what to expect, the almost complete suppression of the replies to the Opposition speeches yesterday, and we also see the political correspondent of one of the papers, the <i>Irish Times</i>, resorting to deliberate falsehood.</P>
    <P>I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of today:</P>
    <P>One Bill seeks to obtain a uniform tolerance of about one-sixth as between rural and urban voters so that it might take 23,000 votes to elect a Dublin Deputy and possibly 17,000 to elect a rural Deputy.</P>
    <P>Now, that statement, as the gentleman who wrote it knows, contains two deliberate falsehoods.  I admit that these two falsehoods have also been uttered here by Deputy Fitzpatrick and other Opposition spokesmen, but it is known that there is no proposal in this Bill to operate a uniform tolerance of about one-sixth as between rural and urban <Col N="1390" /> voters or as between rural and urban population as in the census report.</P>
    <P>It is known that the Bill in fact lays down certain conditions in which this divergence from the national average can occur and that it is only to take account of those factors that this can be operated, and in any case it is not on the average of voters that the one-sixth divergence can be applied but to the average of population, which is a completely different thing.  The gentleman who put those deliberate falsehoods into his papers, following on the same falsehood as was stated here by Deputy Fitzpatrick last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;knows it is not correct that anything approaching the figures he gave could result from the operation of this.  He knows it is untrue to say it might take 23,000 votes to elect a Dublin Deputy and possibly 17,000 to elect a rural Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are none so blind as those who will not see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what is behind the opposition to this proposal, which is merely to re-establish the position that operated here consistently from 1922 until the Fine Gael manoeuvre in the courts in 1959 obtained this legalistic interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution. As I say, this is a repetition of what Deputy Fitzpatrick has been saying but it is something both he and the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> know to be a falsehood.  We are well aware of the policy decision by the Coalition newspapers to resort to every means to try to perpetuate the present potentially dangerous and blatantly discriminatory system we have and we have seen in today's paper a distortion of the facts and in this case deliberate falsehood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not surprised nor indeed particularly concerned, but since Deputy Fitzpatrick repeated this particular falsehood last night again, it is desirable to put the facts on record so that anyone who is interested in the <Col N="1391" /> facts rather than the falsehoods in the <i>Irish Times</i> can obtain them.  The fact of the matter is that the total population of this part of the country, as asserted in the last census, is 2,884,002 people and the total electorate, in accordance with the 1967-68 Register of Electors is 1,713,466.  That means on the basis of 144 Deputies the national average of population is 20,028 and on the basis of 144 Deputies, the national average of votes is 11,899, so that even if the one-sixth were to be applied to the national average of votes, nothing approaching the figures which are given as facts in the <i>Irish Times</i> and by Deputy Fitzpatrick could in fact result. As everybody who has paid any attention to this proposal knows, it is to the total population per Deputy that this will apply and they also know that it is the retention of the present requirements of absolute equality of population per Deputy which will result in a differential voting power for some parts of the country compared with others and that, generally speaking, the extra voting power will be given to the urban population and not to the rural population, and that the only aim is to correct that to ensure that overall the value of a rural vote and of an urban vote will be almost the same.</P>
    <P>The attempt that is being made is to deliberately downgrade the value of the rural vote.  Deputies opposite and people like the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> think the urban people are fools and think that they believe this type of distortion of the facts and of the figures, and they also think that they want to get this extra value attached to their votes as compared to the value of rural votes.  We just do not think that.  We do not think urban people want to have extra voting power as compared with rural people. Fine Gael, Labour and other people, such as the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> think they do.  I think all anybody wants is that votes generally all over the country as a whole will have the same effect in electing Deputies.  I do not think, for instance, that the people in County Louth would be in any way worried if it took marginally more votes in <Col N="1392" /> Louth to elect Deputies than in Monaghan, and I do not think the large number of 7,500 roughly transferred from Louth in order to comply with the present constitutional provision and who were uprooted from the county they lived in all their lives and transferred to Monaghan, would believe that they have gained any democratic right by being transferred into Monaghan so that it would take roughly the same number to elect a Deputy in Louth as in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I do not think they are particularly worried because if they were left in their own county they would have been entitled, in accordance with the rigid interpretation of the Constitution to 3.3 Deputies instead of three and that in County Monaghan they would only have been entitled to 2.7.  As I say the operation of this maximum divergence we propose all over the country as a whole will only have the effect of equating the value of rural votes to urban votes as against the present interpretation of the requirement in the Constitution, as every Deputy here knows, and as every political correspondent of a newspaper knows, if he has been doing anything to justify his position as a political correspondent.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, on Tuesday, 26th March, I gave in reply to a question put down by Deputy Gerard Collins all the figures which are required for anybody who is sufficiently interested in justice to the people as a whole, to acquaint themselves of what must happen now if this change is not made. One of the columns in this statement, which was circulated with the Official Report, gives the electorate as a percentage of the population in each existing constituency.  It will be seen there that the average percentage of the population that the electorate comprises in this country as a whole is 59.41 per cent, but that the electorate as a percentage of the population in different constituencies ranges from 50.96 per cent in Dublin North West to 67.74 per cent in South West Donegal. It is obvious that that means that if the present requirement of the Constitution is not amended and if we <Col N="1393" /> are required to revise constituencies on the basis of strict mathematical accuracy of population per Deputy in every constituency, this must result in the position that it will take 10,206 voters to elect a Deputy in Dublin North West and 13,567 voters to elect a Deputy in South West Donegal.  It is to get rid of that requirement of the Constitution to perpetrate an injustice on the rural voters that this Amendment to the Constitution is proposed, and it is to retain that situation, perpetrating this injustice of downgrading the value of rural votes plus the injustice of transferring population from one county to another, that the Opposition are opposing this and that the newspapers are suppressing facts and publishing falsehoods such as this.</P>
    <P>They also know quite well that this maximum divergence of one-sixth which we propose can only operate in certain circumstances which are clearly defined in the Bill and that any revision of constituencies in which it could be shown that this divergence from the national average was utilised for any other purpose would be unconstitutional. It is known then that contrary to what the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> states today, there may be no question of a uniform tolerance, as he describes it, as between rural voters and urban voters.</P>
    <P>This amendment, as I said last night, proposes to have the provision of a constituency commission in each of these Bills with a condition that if the Fourth Amendment is enacted by the people the part of the Third Amendment would not be operative. This is absolute nonsense and I am advised that it would not be in accordance with the provisions laid down for the amendment of the Constitution to put a hypothetical proposal such as this to the people.  Any proposal to amend the Constitution must be a definitive one which when approved by the people must become part of the Constitution.  Therefore, it is just not practical to ask the people to make provisions for two constituency commissions. We are suggesting to the people that they should support both of these amendments and we confidently <Col N="1394" /> expect that they will enact the two reforms to the electoral system which we are putting before them.  If they do we will have this constituency commission.  As far as has been officially made known to date the Opposition are opposing both of these proposals.  Why then, if that is so, do they want to insert this constituency commission into one if they are going to oppose the two.  It is obvious that both or neither will be passed.  It is obvious that certain of these Deputies who see the injustice that failure to enact this amendment would perpetrate on the people of their own constituencies having refused to put this proposition to their own constituencies, know that we will find it possible, despite the suppression of our case by the Opposition newspapers, to let the people of all constituencies know what we are doing.  It is for that reason that the amendment is now proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick and it is clearly an admission that this proposal will be accepted by the people, and I have no doubt that before the campaign is long under way and possibly before the debate concludes here they will also admit that the people will give themselves the more rational system of election and representation which we are proposing in the other Bill.  In other words, Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, will have his way in spite of the Party he leads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of our Party was to ensure that these measures would be brought to the people with the least possible delay. We, therefore, deplore the unnecessary holdup in the proceedings which we have been experiencing here in the past few weeks.  I would not have intervened in this debate at this juncture were it not for the off-hand and disdainful approach of the Minister to this reasonable amendment by Deputy Fitzpatrick which made clear to us once again the overall purpose which is intended in these measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is unquestionably a political power-grab engineered by the Minister for Local Government who is dragging his Party behind him sticking them <Col N="1395" /> into this referendum, the majority of whom know they will get a terrible thrashing in the process.  The request for some semblance of fair play in respect of the revision of our constituencies which must be carried out under our present laws is purely a reasonable request and the fact that the Minister rejects this reasonable request is an indication of his deplorable outlook.  He wants to take on to himself the duty and respons bility of daring to carve up our consti uencies in his own way.  It is reasonable to suggest that this should be done in the interests of Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil only.  It will be done to buttress them up in every area in which the Minister sees this possible and it will be done specifically to ensure the annihilation of opposition everywhere this Minister sees it.</P>
    <P>We have had evidence, Sir, of this in the past.  Prior to the 1961 general election in which I participated and was sent into this House at the head of the poll, you had a taste of what Fianna Fáil could do, and did do, in spite of the gerrymandering of constituencies.</P>
    <P>We saw therein their utter disdain and disrespect not merely for the Opposition as such but for the will of the people, for traditional boundaries and the like.  We saw the evidence of a ruthlessness that one would only associate with North-East Ulster&mdash;a brutal carving up of county boundaries in order to entrench Fianna Fáil in power, in order to gain that extra seat or possibly defeat some members of the Opposition, Labour Deputies or Fine Gael Deputies or Independents.</P>
    <P>We know too, that this was done without any regard whatsoever for fair play or for impartiality of any kind. Not only was there not a commission of any kind set up with a chairman who would be a member of the Supreme Court; not only was there not any representation from the Opposition; but we know now what transpired was that maps of the various electoral areas and their hinterlands were hung up on the walls of the Party clubs, in the rooms of the Party in this <Col N="1396" /> House, and the Fianna Fáil Members were asked to decide how best to manipulate these areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to suit the advancement of their Party.  The whole purpose was to try to grab extra power by fair means or foul and the foulest means were adopted.  It is an incontrovertible fact that the views of the then Fianna Fáil Deputies were ascertained and he who was regarded as the most ruthless organiser for the Party was charged with the responsibility for the butchering.  I know that to be a fact in respect of my own constituency.</P>

The most ironic aspect of this whole debate is the reference to tolerance, and the regard which the Minister purports to have for tolerance and for proper representation in rural areas.  I do not think I do the Minister any disrespect when I say, from what I know of him in this House, that tolerance is not one of the Christian virtues with which he is endowed.</P>

      <P>The only tolerance he knows is the tolerance to let Fianna Fáil lead on.  This is a last desperate gamble to achieve that aim.  It is a desperate gamble because the Minister has lined up against him &mdash; he has castigated them here today&mdash;the mass of the Irish people and the united Opposition in this House, and the Press and all the mass media also are against this evil design, which is an affront to the will of the Irish people as registered on this issue only nine years ago. It is an audacious attempt causing widespread indignation among all fair-minded people in this country.  They <Col N="1397" /> resent deeply this attempt to impose on them a petty tyranny, and this claptrap which the Minister has gone on with within the past week that this is in the interests of the nation, in the interest of democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the interest even of a good Opposition is poppycock, rubbish.  It is merely an attempt to put on this despicable trick the veneer of decency.  This amendment asked for some semblance of fair play in the revision of our constituencies &mdash; that there would be some impartial observer there to see that what was reasonably fair and just in the circumstances would be done but the Minister would not have that.  He has arrogated to himself and to his Party henchmen the right to do this.  Let us not forget that in this process of abolishing PR and establishing single-seat constituencies, ensuring that Fianna Fáil are first at the head of the poll, contained in this whole system and device is the secret weapon which the Minister and his Party propose&mdash; the weapon to gerrymander.  Therein the terrible danger lies, therein the real injustice lies; and therein lies a threat to the democratic way of life.  We had hoped the Minister would see the wisdom and the writing on the wall and withdraw these proposals.</P>
      <P>He has not done so.  He is renowned for his steadfastness, for his ruthlessness, renowned for his arrogance, and all these unsavoury attributes are being demonstrated all the way through in this debate, and indeed outside of these debates on other matters.  The barbed tongue of the Minister has indicated his lack of respect practically for God and man.</P>

      <P>This is patently untrue. Unfortunately our rural vote has fallen drastically in recent years under Fianna Fáil rule and Fianna Fáil now realise these are the political facts and I defy contradiction of them.  The evolution of politics in this country has demonstrated that Fianna Fáil are losing power and control in the cities, in the big built-up areas of this country and they want to hold on fast and maintain their stranglehold on the rural areas, especially in the counties of the West.  In order to do that, they are now seeking permission to manipulate the voting system in order to maintain the same number of seats in the West at all costs because quite a lot of them are naturally Fianna Fáil seats.  They are seeking to ensure to offset the fall in population.  They want now to ensure that a lesser number of votes will elect Fianna Fáil Deputies in certain rural areas as against the number of votes required to elect Deputies in the built-up areas of our cities and larger towns.  We believe in the principle of one man, one vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Voting is concerned with people, not with animals or even the beauty of our counties.  This is a human problem, and if the West is denuded of its population it is not our fault; it is the fault of Fianna Fáil.  It is particularly audacious of them now to pretend to try and save the West by this means, by giving to any section of the people a preference that their brethren in other parts of Ireland do not enjoy.  The people of the rural <Col N="1399" /> areas do not want preferential treatment in respect of votes.  The people of the rural areas must be told, as I am telling them now, that this device is not for their benefit or for their proper representation in this House.  It is for the benefit of Fianna Fáil, to enable them to continue to dominate people's lives in the rural areas and in the West of Ireland.  The people of these parts must ask themselves who is responsible for the situation whereby this manipulation is now taking place.  I contend that these people must be fed up to the teeth with this regime and will see through this attempt to fasten themselves on to power in these areas by this unfair means.</P>
      <P>The Minister calls our present system a dangerous and a discriminatory system.  On what grounds does he contend that this is so?  Have we had instability of government here in recent years?  Have we had social unrest of a serious kind?  Have we had a multiplicity of parties here in this House in recent years?  Where is the threat to democracy in this country that the Minister alleges there is in this &ldquo;dangerous and discriminatory system&rdquo;?  The facts are that, outside the totalitarian states of Eastern Europe, the Minister's Party have fastened on to power here for over 30 years under this PR system.  They have enjoyed power in this House continuously for the past 11 years, and basically there are only two other Parties represented in this House in opposition.  Far from there being anything dangerous or discriminatory in this system, it is a fair and just system. It is the system best suited to our needs in this country, and we have the say-so of the former Taoiseach, President de Valera, for that fact.</P>

    <P>The dangerous system is the one which the Minister is now seeking to impose upon the Irish people, the system of the single-seat constituency, the straight vote, and the right which he allocates to himself to gerrymander. Herein lies the threat to our democratic way of life.  Other Members much older and wiser than I, like <Col N="1400" /> Deputy James Dillon, have forewarned the Minister, and I myself in my contribution on the Second Stage of these Bills also pointed out the dangers inherent in a change of this kind.  If, heaven forbid, the designs of the Minister were carried by the people and we did have an overbearing Government in power to the exclusion of minorities in this House, it should clearly be understood that the Irish people, being a freedom-loving people, would never tolerate a situation in which there was being imposed on them by unfair methods a tyranny, whether Irish or foreign, and they would take upon themselves at the first possible opportunity the ways and means of overthrowing that tyranny.  I contend that it is the Minister, by his arrogance and his disregard for fair play, his tampering with the pillars of our society upon which democracy and liberty are founded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he has said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.  This is an indication again of the real designs of the Minister and his Party, that this is a power grab at all costs, and the people in the Opposition are not to have any effective say in it.  These are the views I wanted to convey in the dying hours of this debate, and it is simply not <Col N="1401" /> good enough for the Minister to say that we are all out of step except himself. It is not good enough for the Minister to castigate the Opposition, to castigate the Church, to castigate everyone who dares challenge him or dares show him any opposition.  That is typical of the whole intention and purpose of this measure.  It has all the ingredients of ruthlessness and tyranny, through which the Irish people have seen.  We await the opportunity when the Irish people will be asked to decide on this matter, and they will give back the answer to the Minister in most telling fashion.  It will be made known to him that liberty is a precious thing in this country, that people have been properly alerted to the threat, that this last desperate gamble of his will founder on the rocks, and that Fianna Fáil will have to face the consequences of going into the wilderness for a long number of years in Irish politics.  I would hope that the Minister would show some regard for the consensus of opinion on this amendment and the fact that he has confirms in our minds the feelings and fears we have about his intentions in this matter.  He has confirmed the fears we had in that regard.</P>

I am pointing out to the House and taking the Minister to task and, indeed, trying to enlighten Deputy Burke as to what the position will be, should the Minister refuse to accept this amendment.  I am pointing out to the House that, when the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, was speaking here a fortnight ago, keeping very true to form since he first introduced these two Amendments, <Col N="1408" /> he confused the issue.  He is trying to persuade the people of Donegal that, should we not go along with this pure thinking, everything evil will happen in County Donegal, particularly in the very southern parts of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan wants to watch the Minister because the truth of the matter is that Donegal's population, because of Fianna Fáil administration, has fallen in the past ten years from 124,000 to 108,000.  Because of this, the Minister now wants to have further power to gerrymander as did his colleague, the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney.  He gerrymandered that constituency to such a degree that he almost left the Ceann Comhairle without a seat.  However, no matter what way he tried to gerrymander Donegal, the past is rapidly catching up on the gerrymandering tactics employed by Fianna Fáil since 1932.  A three-member constituency used to be the Fianna Fáil desire.  They believed that a Party with one vote more than 50 per cent could get two seats out of three.  This is a straightforward mathematical calculation. They believed that in an area in which the Opposition could get one vote more than 50 per cent the best thing to do was to make it a four-seat constituency so that this would neutralise the support of the Opposition Parties when it came to voting in this House. This just does not suit.  The wheel is turning the full circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must here disagree with Deputy Burke.  Because they believe more in Fianna Fáil than they do in the country there are fewer people in the west of Ireland now, where Fianna Fáil had more strength than in the cities, it is now necessary to amend <Col N="1413" /> the Constitution to give the Minister power to perpetuate the position in spite of the fact that his Party have let down the people in the western areas miserably, particularly the people in Donegal.  If this amendment is not accepted by the Minister, no one, particularly an Opposition Deputy, will be safe in this House.  There will be no guarantee that if Fianna Fáil are returned to office with the strength that political commentators suggest, further legislation will not be enacted to make this an elected dictatorship instead of a free democratic society for which people paid the supreme sacrifice. These are the reasons I rose to speak briefly on this amendment and not for the reasons Deputy Norton suggested. I do not have to invite any member of my Party to speak his mind.</P>

This is an amendment which the Minister should accept and because of his refusal to accept it, he has demonstrated to the House the way in which he would wish to see members of the Opposition Parties go and he is warning the members of his own Party that, if they do not toe the line, they too will go the way he would like to see members of the Opposition Parties go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, what the reaction of decent, honest, right-thinking people, who cherish the fact that they are Irish and the thought of being free, and who cherish the idea of belonging to a society which is a pure and simple democracy, will be when they examine the proposals of the Minister and look closely at his attitude, and look to the future.  Consider the question of realigning constituencies in Donegal: if the Minister does not accept this amendment, what guarantee have people who do not support the Fianna Fáil Party or, at some future date, some new Party which may emerge, that this democracy will remain pure? Is this not a take-over bid by the Fianna Fáil Party?  Would it not be an abdication of responsibility on the part of Opposition Parties to allow the Minister this power?  Would it not be an abdication of responsibility on my part to remain silent and allow the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, who is just as ruthless and just as irresponsible as the Minister for Local Government, to carve up Donegal any way they think fit?  The Lord forbid.  If the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1416" /> and Fisheries had the scissors in his hand, I, for one, would be without a constituency.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are so entrenched at the moment and the jobbery is so rife that they have taken over the country. Irrespective of the views of the left wing of the Labour Party, irrespective of whether people support Fine Gael, Labour or some other Party opposed to Fianna Fáil, they must ask themselves can Members of this House, who disagree fundamentally with the concept of government other than single-Party government, stay silent and allow a dictatorship, to which the Minister aspires, to be elected to control the country in the years ahead?  This is a very serious situation.  In Donegal, which is the constituency I know best, unless one belongs to the Fianna Fáil club and unless one brings with one a member of the Fianna Fáil Party on a deputation to Leinster House, one is not wanted.  That is the situation which has developed over the past ten years.</P>

Without being personal, we know the Minister is not concerned about democracy.  Indeed, his own backbenchers know that, too.  I contend, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that one of the reasons why the Minister should accept this amendment is that, bad and all as he is, he may not always be Minister for Local Government.

My view is that the arrogance of the Minister for Local Government is demonstrated very forcibly in his attitude in refusing to accept the amendment and, of course, the arrogance of the Minister for Local Government only mirrors the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and spotlights the great danger to our society if this Party succeed in convincing the electorate that there must be a change in the Constitution.  It is my contention that the Labour Party must look at this in a reasoned way.</P>
      <P>If there are forces in that Party and, indeed, if there are forces in the Fine Gael Party, which said that they would rather be in Opposition or in Government on their own, there is one thing in common between these two Parties, that for the sake of the Irish people, we must do everything in our power to put the Fianna Fáil Party out of power.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I find it necessary at this stage to remind the House that my amendment proposes to insert in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill a Commission which will arrange the constituencies, a Commission consisting of three members of the Government Party, three members of the Opposition Party or Parties in the House, with an independent chairman who will be a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court.  That is my amendment.  I found it necessary to put forward this amendment because there is such a provision in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which proposes to abolish proportional representation but there is no such <Col N="1422" /> Commission provided for in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill which proposes to give a tolerance of one-sixth either side of the national average and, notwithstanding what the Minister has said, which proposes to provide a Deputy for a population of 23,333 in one constituency and proposes to give a Deputy to 16,667 in another constituency.</P>
      <P>It does not matter whether those constituencies are urban constituencies or rural constituencies.  It may be that a population of 16,667 in one rural constituency will be entitled to a Deputy, while it will take a population of 23,333 in another part of rural Ireland to be entitled to a Deputy.  Those are the facts.  What the Minister states was printed in the <i>Irish Times</i> this morning I have not an opportunity of reading yet.  It is correct and is in accordance with the law as it will be if the people are foolish enough to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, it is of vital importance that the constituencies, which may differ so vastly between one part of Ireland and another, should be arranged by an impartial tribunal such as this amendment proposes. The fact that the Minister has refused to accept this amendment proves conclusively that he is not interested in electoral reform but that he is interested in political gerrymandering, in rigging the constituencies for political purposes.  Not alone did the Minister fail to accept this amendment, as indeed a great many people on both sides of the House thought he would, but he failed to deal with the amendment in his speech last night and this morning.  He talked around the amendment.  He talked about tolerance which is, in effect, irrelevant on the amendment.  He spent a considerable portion of his time trying to prove that the Fianna Fáil Party are united on these proposals and that the Fine Gael Party are not united.  Therefore, I think I am entitled very briefly to deal with that matter raised by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Bills dealing with electoral reform were ordered to be printed by this House on 21st February last. Presumably, before they were ordered <Col N="1423" /> to be printed, they had to come before the Cabinet and I assume they had the approval of the Cabinet.  But it is quite clear to me that these Bills, and in particular, this tolerance Bill without a commission, did not come before the Fianna Fáil Party and had not the approval of the Fianna Fáil Party. When these Bills saw the light of day, they were immediately considered by the Fine Gael Party.  The Fine Gael Party there and then, after full consideration and in a democratic way, took a decision to oppose both of these Bills.  They have not changed that opinion since.  They have not reconsidered the matter.</P>
    <P>These Bills, and particularly this measure with which I am dealing now, have not the approval of the Fianna Fáil Party.  As I said, the Bills were ordered to be printed on 21st February. That is four months ago almost to the day.  The Bills have been going through this House in one form or another since then.  The Fianna Fáil Party have met week after week.  They have considered and reconsidered this matter.  While we had the Minister sitting in the Taoiseach's chair in the House protesting that the Fianna Fáil Party were unanimously of the opinion that these measures were good for the country, we had in fact lobbying and counter-lobbying going on between the Fianna Fáil Party to decide whether or not they would go on with the Bills, whether or not the Minister would be told to withdraw them.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They allowed themselves to be bullied into a decision by the Minister.  They held meeting after meeting since 21st February but only in the dying hours of this debate, when the Bills are about to leave the House, do we have a <i>communiqué</i> issued by the Taoiseach that at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party held yesterday it was decided to go ahead with these Bills.  Why were we wasting the time of the House for the past three months if the Cabinet and the Fianna Fáil Party had not made up their minds?  Is that the sort of thing that this Parliament is to be held up to, that we are here oonsidering a measure introduced by the Government and that at the same time the Government Party are unable to decide whether or not to go on with it?  I say that is a public scandal, a public disgrace and an insult to the democratic institutions of this country. So much for that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has failed to give one solid reason why he should not accept this amendment.  Indeed, not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party has spoken to give a reason against inserting the commission provisions of the Fourth Amendment into the Third.  I note that the Minister stated yesterday evening that this proposal of mine could be in only one of those Bills.  I do not accept that.  It is in the Fourth Amendment Bill.  I see no objection to putting it into the Third, especially in the form in which I have put it: that if the Fourth Amendment becomes an Act, the provisions of the Third stand repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in saying that he cannot put this provision into the Third Amendment, is in effect saying that the sovereign people of this country have <Col N="1425" /> no right to amend the Constitution. Unless his words mean that, they mean nothing.  The people are supreme.  If they decide in accordance with the terms of the Constitution to amend the Constitution, they are entitled to do so.  The Minister said that there is only one proposal and also that that proposal was separated to satisfy a demand from the Fine Gael Party. Once these proposals saw the light of day when they came before the House, they came in the form of two separate and distinct proposals.  The present Minister for Education did fly a kite on television, and he and Deputy P. J. Lenihan from Longford-Westmeath have been flying kites since up to as recently as one o'clock yesterday in an effort to get this changed, but once these proposals saw the light of day, they came as two separate and distinct proposals.  Therefore, it is quite wrong for the Minister to say that the Government changed their opinion at the request of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>We have two proposals here and, in my opinion, neither of them will be accepted, but it is possible that one of them will be accepted and in that eventuality we say it is necessary that the commission provisions should go into the Third Amendment Bill.  The Minister said here this morning that the fact that I put down this amendment means that I am now accepting the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  It means no such thing.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That does not mean I accept it is going to be carried and the Minister need not think he will get anywhere by trying to score small debating society points in that way.  He knows perfectly well that it is the duty of an Opposition Deputy to amend that legislation, even legislation with which it does not agree and even legislation which it is prepared to fight tooth and nail.  I think the people are entitled, if this matter goes before them, to have it before them in the best possible form and that is what my proposal means. That is all it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> I want to deal with another point raised by the Minister this morning in relation to my allegation and the article in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> to the effect that one constituency with a population, I think, of 16,667 may be entitled to a Deputy while another constituency with a population of 23,333 would be entitled to only one Deputy.  The Minister goes out of his way to say that we should not be talking about populations but about electors. But the Minister knows of course that Article 16 of the Constitution, which he does not seek to change, provides that representation shall be on a population basis.  If he thinks that is ridiculous or absurd, why did his Party put it into the Constitution in the first instance?  If he now thinks we should be arranging constituencies on the number of electors rather than on population, why does he not change it? I do not mind whether he changes it or not but let us be consistent.  He cannot have in the Constitution a provision that constituencies shall be based on population and then say that is not sensible at all and that we must have regard to electors.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that when a TD is elected, he is elected to represent the population in his constituency.  He is elected to look after the interests of the children from the day they are born until the day they get a vote just as much as the voters.  I know that the Minister and his Party have more regard for voters and that they play up to the voters, but the duty of an elected Deputy is to be responsible for the welfare of the people living in his constituency, whether they have votes or not. The Minister's entire argument based on this simply does not hold water. Therefore, the fact is that there is a one-sixth tolerance given by this Third Amendment Bill and that what the <i>Irish Times</i> say and what the political commentators said until they were put off Telefís Éireann by the Minister, afraid to tell the truth to the people, and what I am saying is correct, that is, that while a population of 16,667 will be entitled to one Deputy in one part of rural Ireland another constituency must have a population of nearly 24,000 before it is entitled to a Deputy.</P>

He knows that perfectly well and the Fianna Fáil Party know it, and that is why the harangue went on from 21st February until one o'clock yesterday.  They know it perfectly well.

    <P>This amendment has been prepared following the undertaking which I gave, during the Committee Stage debate on amendment No. 5 moved by Deputy Fitzpatrick, to consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide that a determination of constituencies <Col N="1436" /> shall not take place during the interval between the date on which a census is taken and the publication of the definitive results of that census.</P>
    <P>I explained on Committee Stage why it is not practicable to base a determination of constituencies on the provisional results of a census.  The provisional results do not give a breakdown of population figures for constituencies or for wards, district electoral divisions and other areas used for defining constituencies.  I am advised also that the preliminary results, while sufficiently accurate for general purposes, can be up to 4,000 out&mdash;normally erring on the low side.  A discrepancy of this order could possibly affect the maximum number of Deputies allowed by the Constitution and might result in under- or over-representation of particular constituencies.</P>
    <P>I also said on Committee Stage that it would be necessary to clarify the question whether or not the amendment would qualify the 12-yearly maximum period between revisions which is laid down in the Constitution.  Adoption of this amendment would mean that if the 12-year period happened to expire during the interval between the date of a census and the publication of the relevant final results thereof, a determination of constituencies could not take place during that interval but could be made either before the census is taken or immediately after the results are ascertained.  This will ensure that the Oireachtas will not be forced to make a determination in such circumstances on out-of-date figures but may await the results of the new census.  The final population statistics for constituencies and other relevant areas are published in Volume 1 of the Census Results which is published about a year after the date of the census.  This is the best that can be done to meet the principle of Deputy Fitzpatrick's Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that the Oireachtas should be prohibited from making a revision of constituencies on the basis of a census taken more than a specified period beforehand, <Col N="1437" /> say, nine to 12 months before as he suggested. This would unduly limit the discretion of the Oireachtas in timing revisions.  As to the timing of the census itself, I am advised that it would not be practicable to determine the timing on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis&mdash;in practice a link with constituency revision would necessitate a decision three years in advance of the revision because of the preparatory work needed.  Moreover, varying intervals between successive censuses would detract appreciably from many of the uses of the census.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not wish to say much on this.  The amendment goes some of the way to meet my objection to the Bill as originally drafted.  In effect, it means, I think, that if a revision of the constituencies is not commenced before the census is taken, it cannot be done until after the final figures of the census are known, even if it means it is over 12 years.  That is my understanding of it.  It is an improvement and for that reason I accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>A factory has recently been established at Birr for the manufacture of shotguns, mainly for the export market. The law in some of the countries to which this factory will be exporting prohibits the sale of firearms unless they bear a mark indicating that they have been tested in accordance with recognised procedures and that they comply with specified minimum standards of safety. The testing is required to be carried out, either by one of the recognised proof houses in these countries, or by a foreign proof house established by law and recognised by the authorities in these countries for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The Birr factory is at a disadvantage because of the lack of a proof house here as their guns have to be sent abroad for proofing.  The main purpose of this Bill is to remedy this situation by providing for the establishment of a proof house which will be capable of securing the recognition of the authorities of any country to which Irish manufactured guns are being exported.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, I think, agree that the body to which the duty of proofing guns should most appropriately be given is the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The Institute is already charged with the responsibility for testing commodities intended for sale or for use by the public and it has the necessary technical resources and experience to provide a service of this nature.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for the proof house is already available at the Institute and premises there are being adapted and equipped to enable proofing to be carried out.  It is the intention, once the Bill becomes law, to lose no time in making the necessary regulations provided for in the Bill prescribing the methods to be employed on the testing of firearms, the mark or marks to be used to designate compliance with the proofing requirements and the fees to be charged for proofing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike other countries, there are no restrictions here on dealing in unproofed <Col N="1439" /> firearms.  Because of the dangers arising from the use of guns which may not be up to the generally recognised standards of safety, the power is being taken and it is, in fact, proposed, as soon as the Bill is enacted and the necessary proofing facilities are available, to prohibit, by order, the export, sale or hiring of unproofed guns.  Similarly, the power is also being taken to enable me to prohibit the actual use of unproofed guns.</P>
    <P>As an example of the effect of an order made under these provisions, which are contained in section 4 of the Bill, the hiring-out of unproofed guns on commercial shoots would be prohibited&mdash;or even, if considered necessary, the use of such guns whether hired or not. It will be appreciated that accidents on commercial shoots, especially if they involved out-of-State visitors, could create bad publicity for game shooting in Ireland.  On the other hand, it would be unreasonable if, for example, a visitor could not use his own favourite weapon solely because it did not carry an Irish proof mark, even though it carried the mark of a responsible foreign authority.  The section, as drafted, will make it possible for my Department to pursue a reasonably flexible policy in such matters.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals contained in the Bill will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals contained in the Bill will certainly be accepted by the House.  It is very acceptable to me because I spent five months of my life in bed as a result of an accident in which a gun discharged. As I understand it, the matter of proofing in this Bill refers largely to the barrel of the gun.  It is of great importance that the proofing is properly done and the possibility of an explosion, of a bursting barrel, which might destroy the person discharging the gun, is something that we cannot disregard even if guns nowadays are of a standard and quality and workmanship that do not lend themselves to this sort of accident.  It does not mean <Col N="1440" /> that we should not take the proper precautions.</P>
      <P>The Birr factory had to send the guns abroad for proofing up to now and the proper agents to have this done are the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  This, therefore, is a step forward if only because every new industry we provide here in any new field&mdash;this is obviously a new one&mdash;is something we can approve of. It is interesting to know, as an historical matter, that some local authorities, including Dublin and Drogheda Corporations, had the right to stamp firearms as far back, possibly further back, than 100 years ago.  Whether they had proofing houses I do not know.  I merely know that they stamped firearms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they stamped as being up to standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were stamped &ldquo;Drogheda Corporation&rdquo;.  I cannot say where the proofing house was.  I understand Dublin Corporation also stamped firearms a long time ago, presumably having satisfied themselves that the manufacture was legitimate and proper.  There is very little evidence of anybody losing his life because a gun barrel exploded but there is one assurance I should like to have from the Minister.  Though we are talking about the proofing of barrels, the locks of guns are probably as dangerous, if not more so, as the barrels.  Therefore, faulty locks also should be considered and I should like to know if the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will not only look at gun barrels from the point of view of proofing but if they will also consider the locks.  I suppose the intention is that when we put our stamp on the gun we shall also have considered the locks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, and I have handled a good few shotguns in my time, the position is that the locks of guns are not stamped in the manner in which barrels are stamped &ldquo;nitro-proofed&rdquo;. I do not know if code numbers are put on them.  Deputy Sweetman probably can go into this in more detail.  I have not seen guns with the <Col N="1441" /> locks stamped as a guarantee that they are good, proper pieces of workmanship and that they are safe.</P>
    <P>This Bill presumably is to keep abreast of international practice but will there be any guarantee in the stamping arising from examination of the guns that the locks of guns are safe both for the people in the proximity of the guns and for the users?  As I have said, this Bill is a step forward in our industrial field.  It is necessary it should be done and it is also an illustration of the impact of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We also welcome the Bill but I should like some information on it.  I should like to know, first of all, does it propose simply to deal with new weapons.  In my opinion, if it does not deal with existing weapons every effort should be made to have all the existing stock of guns in this country examined and proofed.  I agree with Deputy Donegan that the locks of guns are very often far more dangerous and that it is important to ensure they will be safe as well as the barrels because most of the barrels are safe.  The tendency may be to stamp a gun because the barrel is safe when the gun itself may be highly dangerous. This matter should be looked into.  I know we cannot jump off and do everything in a hurry but it has taken us so long to reach this stage that the Minister should ensure the whole position will be covered.  Another point has to do with faulty guns.  That is why Deputy Donegan had an accident.  I am glad to see it was not a serious one, though it was serious enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difference.  Nowadays, accidents occur every week and people are injured through handling faulty guns.  Of course, the average adult ensures that his firearm is in proper condition but it is amazing the number of old firearms <Col N="1442" /> which are never used until the boy grows big enough to carry a gun, and then an accident occurs.  The Minister should take the opportunity, when this Bill is before the House, of ensuring that the job is done properly. If it means the slow, tedious checking of every licensed gun in the country, that should be done.  Firearms are not toys.  We should know that, but unfortunately they are treated as toys.  So many people have got into the habit of being so familiar, or of giving the impression they are so familiar, with firearms that they do things no sane person should do, and they are a menace to themselves and to anybody who happens to be near them.  For that reason I would appeal to the Minister to try to ensure that the proof house of which he is speaking here will deal not only with new guns which are made here but also with existing guns, many of which are, in my opinion, in a highly dangerous condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what the other speakers have said.  This Bill is a very proper one. There is no question about the necessity for it; the only point is whether the Minister should take this opportunity of taking larger powers to himself in this matter of controlling the standard of firearms.  I for one&mdash;and I take it other Deputies would agree with me&mdash;would have no objection to the Minister taking the widest powers in this regard.  I would even go so far as to say he should take the widest powers and put himself in the position of being able to control by order. Whether these powers are already inherent in the Bill a closer reading will disclose; we have not examined it in Committee yet, and perhaps what we are saying is superfluous.  However, the point is worth making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proofing, as Deputy Donegan has said, is very often considered to apply merely to the standard of the barrel and the chamber.  The mechanism of the weapon is another story, but it can be an equally vital factor in accidents. A defective firing mechanism may mean that a gun goes off prematurely &mdash;by the word &ldquo;gun&rdquo; I mean any kind <Col N="1443" /> of firearm; it may mean that it goes off in the process of loading, which can be quite a dangerous thing.  Apart from the question of the proofing of the material in the weapon, there is involved the whole question of the design of a firearm.</P>
    <P>Modern firearms manufactured by any reputable firm, whether here or abroad, will normally be safe enough, but it is not unknown, if a market for any commodity becomes available, for inferior products to find their way to the market, and to find people stupid enough to purchase these inferior products merely because they are cheaper, but they pay more dearly in the long run.</P>
    <P>The net point then is whether the Minister, as well as having the powers in regard to proofing, should enable the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to have a function in regard to the whole question of the design of firearms.  When one talks about firearms, one is frequently talking about shotguns.  The modern shotgun is either the double-barrelled high precision weapon into which it has developed, or it is a repeater in which you have very definitely more complicated mechanism. Then there are the various types of sporting rifles, mainly of .22 calibre. In this country people are not encouraged to have anything of a heavier calibre, and again the question of design arises here.</P>
    <P>Also on the question of proofing, one must make allowances for any development in propellants.  Many years ago there was a change in the propellant used in .22 rifles which brought about high-powered, high velocity cartridges which did require a higher standard in the mechanism and in the weapon than the ones that went before.  These problems do seem to call for attention when the appropriate time comes.  Apart from completely agreeing with the propriety and desirability of this piece of legislation, I should simply like to say that if there are any other powers that could usefully be attached to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter at Committee Stage that are not already in the Bill&mdash;it may be adequate for all <Col N="1444" /> I know&mdash;I think the House, without question, would grant those powers to the Minister.  This is a particular case, in any event, where the specifics can confidently be left to determination by ministerial order.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully has drawn attention to the most important aspect of this Bill: if a gun is proofed, how long does that proofing stand, and is proofing an indication of safe usability?  If it is not, then, proofing means nothing at all.  I assume that in setting up a gun-proofing establishment, we shall be working on international standards.  There are standards already set in other countries, and presumably we would, more or less, have to accept those standards, particularly if we are importing guns from them already and for some considerable time.  However, unless it is a standard which ensures the overall safety of a gun, that standard is worthless.  It is merely an indication that a new gun brought out for the first time is safe. New guns nowadays, by and large, are safe guns.  They are like cars.  Most cars are good cars when they are new, and the same thing goes for guns.  Unless there is some sort of renewal of inspection at intervals of a year, two years or three years, there will continue to be these accidents with guns.  I would say that more than 50 per cent of the guns in the country at the moment could be regarded as unsafe, because they are never inspected.</P>

      <P>They are dangerous, and probably all of us have used dangerous guns from time to time.  I am sure Deputy Tully has used dangerous guns; if he has not, I have. People do not realise that the weapons they have in their hands can be the cause of their own destruction or that of other people within range of them. I have seen a few very close things in my time with guns where people were missed by inches.  It is extremely difficult to impress particularly on young people starting to carry a gun how important it is to see that the gun is in good shape.  I am talking about the ordinary gun with which people go <Col N="1445" /> shooting game.  If they can push the cartridge in any way at all and close the gun, they have no worry whatever, and then unfortunately it is too late to do anything about it when the accident occurs.  It is far more important to provide for periodic inspection of guns before licences are granted, than for the initial proofing of a new gun.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan raised a question about whether the locks on guns will be included in the inspection and subject to proofing.  The answer is &ldquo;yes, that is included&rdquo;.  It is also true that the proof mark is placed only on the barrel but in fact it covers the lock as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but I am not aware of it.  The main point Deputies have been making is that we ought to have a system of checking at periodic intervals to ensure so far as possible that unsafe guns are not used. I sympathise very much with that view but I do not think it is appropriate to this Bill or, indeed, to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 4 subsection (1) of this Bill, there is power to prohibit the use of unproofed guns.  In this Bill we are dealing only with the proofing of guns and, as Deputy Clinton says, this relates to new guns.  We are taking power to prohibit the use as well as the hiring of unproofed guns.  So far as we are dealing with new guns, I think this goes far enough.  In regard <Col N="1447" /> to checking up on the use of older guns which may be dangerous, this does not seem to me to be appropriate to this Bill, the purpose of which is largely industrial, nor is it appropriate to my Department.  It seems to me that it would be more appropriate perhaps to the Department of Justice which deals with licences.</P>
    <P>I should say in this regard that it is estimated that the number of existing guns in the country is about 80,000.  To have a system of periodic checks before a licence is issued on these would be a fairly major undertaking. It would involve each owner of the guns concerned in paying some kind of fee.  It does not appear to me at the moment, on the limited information available to me&mdash;because it is largely outside my territory&mdash;that the situation is such that it would justify the setting up of such elaborate machinery as would be necessary to carry this out, and the imposition of an additional charge on the owners of the guns.  It may be that if one had all the relevant information this would be justified but, on the limited information available to me, I cannot say that it would.  However, even if it would, I repeat that I do not think it would be appropriate to this Bill which deals only with the proofing of new guns and is largely an industrial matter in order to enable this new factory to operate effectively.</P>
    <P>We have taken the opportunity to take certain powers which do not relate to the proofing of new guns.  This does not relate in any way to the checks which should be applied to the older ones.</P>

      <P>There are some high-class guns in the country the barrels of which are referred to as Damascus barrels.  They are made of compressed steel.  They are made up in pieces rather than one piece: they are in a coil.  I do not think those guns have a proof stamp on them.  The Minister is taking power to prohibit the use of any gun which is not stamped.  Has he taken these guns with Damascus barrels into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said when introducing this, the position up to now has been that there has been no legal obligation to have a proofed gun and no prohibition on the use of unproofed guns.  This is the first introduction of any kind of restriction of that nature. Section 4 provides that the orders can be made with regard to the prohibition of the sale, export, hiring, or the use of unproofed guns.  I think this is sufficiently flexible to enable us to make orders which would not conflict unduly with the position as it is.  In other words, if guns are being used at the moment which are safe and which do not bear a proof mark, we would endeavour to cover that situation in any order we would make.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 27 to 31.</P>
      <P>Section 31 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, prohibits the registration of a trade mark containing the letters CE&mdash;Caighdeán Éireannach &mdash;or IS&mdash;Irish Standard.  The effect of the subsection would be to ensure that the Minister would not be precluded by that section 31 from registering a proof mark which will in fact consist of an adaptation of the present standard mark comprising the letters CE. It would not preclude the Minister from registering that as a certification trade mark under the Trade Marks Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was drafted, the Patents Office have revised their view of the situation.  They now advise that it would not be appropriate to seek <Col N="1450" /> registration of the mark as a certification trade mark under the Trade Marks code.  It would appear that there are sufficient safeguards contained in section 6 against the misuse of the proof mark.  It is, therefore, not proposed to seek formal registration of the mark under the Trade Marks Act.  For that reason, I propose in this amendment to delete the subsection.</P>

It <Col N="1451" /> could be an antique.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not visualise any such order being made under this Bill which would prohibit the keeping of an unproofed antique gun.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But section 9 very definitely states that they may seize.  If somebody starts to use an unproofed gun and, as a result of that, an inspection is carried out and other unproofed guns, which are antiques, are found in the place then, according to this section, they would have the right to take them away.  I should like that point cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be on the assumption that the order, in the first place, covered this kind of gun.  Next, the Deputy will notice that this power is given by reference to section 21 (2) of the principal Act.  Section 21 (1) of the principal Act gives authority to any member of the Garda Síochána to enter specified classes of premises or vehicles.  Subsection (2) of the principal Act empowers the Garda to inspect any firearms or ammunition, or any case, box or package found by him in any premises entered by him under the authority of this section or upon or in any public place, and may open any <Col N="1452" /> such case, box, or package which he reasonably believes or suspects to contain firearms or ammunition, and may seize any firearms or ammunition found in any such place as aforesaid and which he reasonably believes or suspects are being imported into or exported from the State or are being or have been removed from one place to another within the State.  This is a ready-made machinery which we want to use for this purpose but it would be used here only in so far as an order made under this Bill, when enacted, applied.  I do not visualise in any circumstances an order being made under this Bill which would cover something like an antique gun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that there are guns which might be antiques but which are capable of being used.  This is the whole point.  Deputy Donegan mentioned a few minutes ago that the system of boring through the barrel of the handarm is quite easy.  However, if it is a gun which is being kept for antique or sentimental reasons and can be used&mdash;all of us know of such guns&mdash; it can be seized by somebody who is officious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remedy taken by the Garda authorities was to say: &ldquo;Bore a hole through the side of the barrel and it is no longer a gun&rdquo;&mdash; which seems the sensible thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think it is.  This is primarily an industrial Bill.  The objective is to ensure that the situation in regard to unproofed new guns can be dealt with.  I think the situation Deputy Tully has in mind is, to say the least of it, most unlikely to arise under an order made under this measure.</P>

      <P>The power to make these orders is very flexible.  It is visualised that any order which might, in rough terms, be deemed to be operating outside the normal industrial approach to this matter would be made only after consultation with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands from the point of view of his responsibility in regard to game and shooting.  The House may rest assured that no order will be made under the Bill except with reference to the existing situation.  I am speaking now of an order other than one dealing with new guns, where we propose to impose the obligation of proof of having had it.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Wool Marketing Bill, 1968: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (2), page 12, line 11, after &ldquo;fails&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;without reasonable cause.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will not have any great objection to this amendment and to amendment No. 24 which is related.  Subsection (2) of section 24 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> If any person wilfully delays an officer of the Minister in the exercise of any power under this section, or fails&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;here I want to have inserted the words &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to produce any record or other document which he is required in pursuance of this section to produce...</P>
    <P>That is the first part of it.  Any one of us could visualise a situation where it might not be reasonable to expect somebody to have on tap and produce a record or other document which is required.  This is a reasonable thing to insert in the subsection.  A person should be protected and cannot unreasonably be held to have committed an offence.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that this is desirable.  The same applies to amendment No. 24.  The subsection goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...or refuses to give to the officer any information which such officer may reasonably require with regard to the entries in such record or document...</P>
    <P>At the time he is approached, he might not have the information for which the officer was looking and it would be quite unreasonable to have it said that he committed an offence.  That danger should be removed.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Clinton is aware, his two amendments are well catered for in the section as it stands. Officers of the Minister who are authorised in writing may &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo; look at any of their workings&mdash;may &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo; and indeed in reasonable circumstances. The Deputy again is creating difficulties where they do not exist.  The point is well covered in the subsection as drafted and I do not think that adding these two amendments is going to strengthen the section or indeed make it any the more acceptable.  However, in view of the fact that the Deputy has pressed this point, I will accept his two amendments. They are really superfluous in-so <Col N="1455" /> far as it has already been accepted and is implied in the drafting of the Bill that it would be reasonable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 3 after &ldquo;office&rdquo; to add &ldquo;on the recommendation of An Chomhairle&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section states that &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove a member of An Chomhairle from office&rdquo;.  It would add something to the Bill if the Minister just did not do this on his own as the political head of the Department. He is setting up An Chomhairle on which he is going to depend a good deal in relation to the carrying out of this scheme and if a member of that body should be removed for some reason, the best people surely to decide that are the people working along with him.  The Minister must get his information from somewhere that this is an unsuitable member and obviously the most suitable group to give him that information would be An Chomhairle of which he happens to be a member. Unless he is abolishing the whole Comhairle at one stroke, it is reasonable to assume that they would be reliable people to advise him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would place An Chomhairle in a very invidious position if they had to <Col N="1456" /> recommend the dismissal of one of their members.  Indeed, it could lead to a lot of peculiar thinking on the part of the dismissed member, that it was for some unsuitable reason, not connected with his functioning on the Comhairle itself, but perhaps for personal or commercial reasons.  From that point of view, the Deputy will agree that it would be much better to leave it as it is and not have An Chomhairle put in the invidious position of having to recommend the dismissal of a member.  From that point of view, I am afraid I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that it is far more difficult to put a body of ten or 12 people in an invidious position than it is to put one man in an invidious position, namely, the Minister, and, since the Minister is the political head of the Department, he is suspect from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Here you will have a body on whom the Minister will rely. If they are a responsible body and if there is a &ldquo;wrong 'un&rdquo; among them, the first thing they will try to do is to have him shifted.  If I were a member of a board, I should have no hesitation in taking the first step towards removing an undesirable person from that board.  I cannot understand the Parliamentary Secretary's thinking at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Clinton.  It does appear that the Minister will have the right to remove from the board.  Will the Minister in his office be able to see what is happening and will he be able to say: &ldquo;We will dump this fellow because he does not suit us?&rdquo;  Will he take a recommendation from someone who, having been at meetings of the board, will say that the fellow is not the type who is wanted on the board?  In each case, instead of having the majority of the Comhairle making the recommendation, the Minister will take advice from one of the members or, worse still, from one of the officials who may be giving secretarial help.  What I should be afraid of is that the Minister might be tempted, for political or other <Col N="1457" /> reasons, to change the personnel by removing someone from the board.  If there is not a set regulation laid down under which a recommendation can be made, then we must take it that the Minister will be taking political advice and that will be the reason for the removal.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has more experience of this than we have and perhaps he would say what is the general ruling with regard to boards of this kind.  Is this the way this is usually done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Surely Deputies realise that, were we to accept the amendment, An Chomhairle would have to meet as a body and, in the presence of the member concerned, recommend his removal from the board.  I do not think any Deputy would recommend that procedure as the ideal solution.  Such a situation would automatically weaken the board. All the members must be of the very highest calibre and if nine are required to sit in judgment on a colleague and move his dismissal from the board, the situation would be very embarrassing indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is assuming a situation in which possibly someone would be dumped.  I do not think that will happen.  These will be people of the highest calibre and we would be wrong-footing from the start if we made it incumbent on them to dismiss a member.  In every case in which individuals have been removed from boards, the removal has always been done, as it were, <i>in absentia.</i>  I do not think there is any likelihood of what Deputies suggest happening here.</P>

      <P>That may be the method adopted in circles across the floor.  It is certainly not the method we adopt.  I am all for saying whatever has to be said to the man's face and in his presence.  I think it is absolutely wrong to leave this in the hands of the Minister.  There is no indication as to where the Minister will get his advice about the individual to be dropped. That leaves him open to the accusation that someone is dropped for political reasons.  Deputy Tully said &ldquo;for political or other reasons&rdquo;; I say political or related reasons.  It is wrong in my opinion, for the Minister to retain this power in himself, and unnecessary, in my view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I am concerned also.  I do not think we should be buying boats from outside if, in fact, it is possible to provide them here but in so far as competition or lack of it is concerned, this is not quite the case, because there are agreements now of a somewhat similar nature with two continental countries and the value for money that is being offered in these boats from either of the two sources is regarded as fair and the provision of the loan money over a period during which the fishermen will pay it and the boat will be duly purchased is a facility and inducement.  This money is being provided as a facility, as an <Col N="1463" /> inducement, but the basic thing is that the boats themselves are regarded as value for money.  In that sense, people are not being pushed into giving any sort of price merely because if they buy from such a source, they will get the money on loan.  That is not the case.  There is value for money in the first instance.  The facility of loans being available from those who provide the boats is undoubtedly an attraction to buy from those people rather than to buy from other people, but I would emphasise again that the prices of the boats are regarded as good value.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is open to this sort of abuse because they are tied to going to them for money?  There is no option. People cannot decide to buy boats in Ireland because no money is available to finance the loan.  We are dependent on foreign finance for these boats.</P>

      <P>The entitlement to unemployment benefit of any individual claimant depends on the fulfilment of certain statutory contribution conditions. In the present case, these conditions were not satisfied, on a claim from the 23rd April, 1968, because of the failure or neglect of an employer to pay contributions in respect of employment from August, 1966 to April, 1967. <Col N="1478" /> The benefit lost by the insured person through this default is a legal responsibility of the employer concerned and the insured person has been advised of her statutory rights to recover the amount from him, if necessary, through the courts.</P>

As she is in an impoverished condition, she is unable to pursue the matter. Would the Department take up the case on her behalf?

With the best will in the world my intervention in this case would not seem to hold out much prospects.  We have already taken action and got a decree for a certain amount but have since been unable to recover the £2 weekly payment, not in respect of this case but in respect of the non-payment of contributions on a previous occasion.  We are now seeking to enforce the court order, and in the meantime I think it would be futile, so far as the immediate benefit to the contributor here is concerned, to take any further action, but I am pursuing the case.</P>

      <P>It is estimated from the claims recorded in my Department that between 1st May, 1967, when the Socal Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, came into operation, and the 31st March, 1968, approximately 603,000 days were lost owing to incapacity due to occupational injury or disease.  This figure would include cases where injury or disease occurred prior to the 1st May, 1967, and incapacity continued, but would not include odd days of incapacity which did not give rise to claims to benefit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The retail sale of amphetamines, including methedrine, is already controlled under the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, which provide that the substances in question may not be sold to the public by persons other than pharmaceutical chemists, dispensing chemists and druggists and registered druggists and may not be dispensed except on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon.  As I have already indicated in reply to previous questions, and in a recent press statement, I propose to strengthen the existing powers of control by making the unauthorised possession of such substances a punishable offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's suggestion <Col N="1496" /> that I should take steps to curb the right of private medical practitioners to prescribe methedrine, it would be a serious step to interfere with the right of a doctor to prescribe the drug of his choice for a patient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carter is using the word &ldquo;addict&rdquo; loosely.  In the Mental Treatment Acts, an addict is defined as a person:</P>
      <P>who by reason of his addiction to drugs or intoxicants is either dangerous to himself or others or incapable of managing himself or his affairs or of ordinary proper conduct or by reason of his addiction to drugs, intoxicants or perverted conduct is in serious danger of mental disorder.</P>

These people are in need of help and by having their names on a register, they would get a continuation of their drugs by normal means and not by every subterfuge known to them to get drugs from doctors and pharmacists. I would appeal to the Minister seriously to consider the setting up of a drug register for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is aware of the existing statutory controls which apply to certain drugs, under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, and the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, and I take it that his question relates to the proposed measures to deal with the unauthorised possession of what are generally termed &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs (amphetamines, barbiturates, LSD etc.).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The report on the survey of limb deformities which might be attributable to the use of thalidomide was in the form of a series of tables which included the incidence of certain congenital defects by counties, and contained clinical details of the precise nature of the defects.  As it might be possible to identify individual cases from the data shown it would not, in my opinion, be in the public interest to release it.  The situation disclosed by the report has, of course, been made public, through information given on the 4th June, 1964 on the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Health for 1964-65 and in reply to a number of Parliamentary Questions.</P>
      <P>The primary object of the follow-up report was to establish whether the incidence of congenital abnormalities returned to the earlier level after the withdrawal of thalidomide.  The report showed <i>inter alia</i> that it had done so.</P>

      <P>No comprehensive survey of the incidence of disabling arthritic conditions has been carried out in this country.  I have asked the Medico-Social Research Board to carry out a continuing hospital inpatient survey and this should provide information in relation to the patients suffering from these conditions who are admitted to hospital.  The Medical Research Council provides funds to assist research projects which they regard as being worthy of support and they would be in a position to consider research proposals in relation to arthritic conditions.  The Dublin Rheumatism Clinic would also be in a position to provide facilities for worthwhile research in the Dublin area.  The Clinic carries out studies as to the effectiveness of new drugs in association with the drug manufacturers but I am not aware of any other specific research proceeding in this country at present.  The National Rehabilitation Board in association with the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire and with the various voluntary organisations working for the disabled has a responsibility for organising the rehabilitation both medical and vocational of those disabled by arthritic conditions.  I should, of course, add that a great deal of work in terms of treatment and reactivation is carried on for these patients in the general and orthopaedic hospitals.</P>

The term is used to describe a particular illness but it is also used to cover a number of different mental illnesses of childhood.  At present statistics of the total number of children in this country in need of psychiatric care are not available, and, indeed, reliable statistics are not available for any country.  Children from any health authority area may be referred to centres in Dublin and Cork for assessment.</P>
      <P>There is a residential unit of 30 beds for mentally ill children, including autistic children, at St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, County Dublin, and a day-centre for such children at St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the position in my constituency in relation to the Land Commission? Is he aware that business and professional people are buying up land all over the place, as far away as eight miles from their places of residence in some cases, and I wonder is it in conformity with the rules of the Land Commission to allow such purchases? Is the Minister further aware that the small farmer in the West is being virtually squeezed out of existence because, due to lack of capital, he cannot compete with those wealthier people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already pointed out to the Deputy, this matter was the subject of court proceedings in the Circuit Court and my information is that in that particular area, congestion is not very acute; there is a holding at present on offer to the Land <Col N="1505" /> Commission which, if acquired, will satisfy the requirements of the local people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the purchaser of this land is a businessman who lives eight miles from the farm?  Is he aware that court proceedings will not be finalised until 1st July?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>That is not my information. My information is that the Circuit Court in May last confirmed the sale.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if he is prepared to allow business people to buy land eight miles from their places of residence when there are small uneconomic holders in the area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands the amount of land held by the Forestry Branch of his Department in County Wexford; the pool of land available for future planting; and if such a pool guarantees full maintenance of present employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The total productive area held by the Forestry Division of my Department in County Wexford on 31st March, 1968 was 19,098 acres of <Col N="1506" /> which 16,612 acres were under woods and plantations leaving a reserve of 2,486 acres nominally available for planting.  The extent of the plantable reserve is only one of the factors influencing employment and any given level of plantable reserve could not of itself be regarded as affording a guarantee of maintaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a guarantee that those who are at present employed in forestry in County Wexford will have continuity of employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy, in reply to a specific question he put down, that the extent of the plantable reserve is only one factor and it cannot be taken on its own as affording a guarantee of retaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister help me by telling me what the other factors are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the factors which affect employment are the increased use of machinery and the increased use of chemicals: they are factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortage of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not shortage of money.  The ones I have mentioned are the principal factors, I would say.  We are endeavouring to acquire more land under a new price structure which will, I hope, be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's answer, but he will note from my question that I am endeavouring to find out if there is likely to be continuity of employment for those presently employed and can he give me a reassuring reply to that question?</P>
