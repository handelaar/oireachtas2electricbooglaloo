      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill have their origin in the unanimous request which was made to me and the Government by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, on which all Parties are represented.  The request of that committee was supported by each of the three parliamentary Parties.  As this is a matter which I believe to be of fundamental importance to the management of our affairs and the ruling of our country I think it is important that we secure the greatest possible degree of public understanding of what is involved.  It would appear that there are still some in our midst who think their public representatives should be paid very little, if at all.  This is perhaps partly a survival from the time when parliamentary representation was the preserve of a wealthy leisured class. The primary purpose of this Bill, however, is to ensure that no person who thinks he has a contribution to make to our public affairs will be prevented from offering himself for election because of his material circumstances. This I regard as an essential element of our democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> I would like also to get across in the context of this Bill a much more accurate and true-to-life picture of the average public representative in this country and the work he does.  Unfortunately few outside the political arena itself can see the full picture and make a proper assessment.  The State today exercises an influence over practically every aspect of the daily life of the citizen, raising taxes, distributing benefits and controlling and regulating a wide area of activity.  In this sort of situation the public representative has a vital part to play. I do not believe that that role can ever be undertaken by any sort of official ombudsman, as some would suggest.</P>
    <P>An elected representative of the people is something more than an official can ever be.  An elected representative's job is to stand between the individual and the bureaucratic machine.  He has to be thoroughly familiar with a maze of schemes affecting the lives of those he represents. He must be able to advise and explain their rights under these schemes.  He does not get anybody anything they are not entitled to but he can make sure that they get what they are entitled to.  No bureaucracy is perfect and mistakes and injustices can occur.  When they do there is no one who can take the place of the public representative in trying to put matters right.  When some of our pundits talk in a derogatory way about the social welfare aspect of a Dáil Deputy's work I believe they do not really understand the complexities of modern life as they affect the ordinary man and woman.  In a modern society there is an absolute need for more and more communication and understanding between the Government and the people at every level.  People today wish to understand before they will accept.  Any community in which authority becomes remote from the people is heading for trouble.  The job of promoting that understanding of what is being done and why it is being done can be done only by an experienced body of public representatives.</P>
    <P>This task of helping and explaining and communicating is not an easy one. <Col N="921" /> It demands hard work, patience and understanding.  There are countless callers to be seen, letters to be written, calls to be made, deputations arranged, questions put down and so on.  If the average Dáil Deputy were to itemise and cost out a typical week's work on behalf of his constituents in the way, for instance, that a solicitor does&mdash;so much for an interview, so much for a letter, and so on&mdash;the amount involved would be very substantial indeed.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there is a Deputy's work as a legislator.  As a member of the Dáil he must deal with the continuing process of legislation, with many complex Bills, financial business, and a whole variety of issues with which he must be familiar, able to discuss and able to take an intelligent decision upon.  To cope with all this we must have people who are willing and able to sacrifice a great deal, if not all, of their time and energy to public affairs.  The people we need must not be prevented through lack of means from entering public life.</P>
    <P>This is the main consideration which influenced the Government in settling the salary figures set out in this Bill. There are, of course, other factors which must also be taken into account. As many of us know to our cost a Deputy has no set hours of work.  He is expected to be constantly at the disposal of his constituents.  For him and his family, public life involves the sacrifices of his personal time to a degree that has few parallels, if any, in other walks of life.  Anyone entering public life must also to a greater or lesser degree neglect his own private affairs.  He may have to employ extra help for his home or business, or even give up his job altogether.  As a public representative he has no security of tenure.  At any time he may find himself forced to try to take up again the threads of his former life. It is quite unrealistic to expect persons of the type we need for the efficient discharge of public business to undertake the risks and uncertainties inseparable from public life without giving them a reasonable recompense in return.</P>
    <P>There are two very popular misconceptions <Col N="922" /> about these allowances with which I should like to deal.  One is the mistaken belief that they are tax free. That is not correct.  Since 1960, as we all know, tax is paid on these allowances the same as on any other income. The second notion I should like to dispel for the benefit of the public&mdash; because I do not think there is any need to dispel it for the benefit of members of this House&mdash;is the notion that the individual member here gets anything like the full amount of the allowance for himself.  His outgoings will vary from place to place and from individual to individual but, as we know, in all cases they will be substantial. Many have to employ either full-time or part-time secretarial assistants to enable them to cope with their work.  There are constant appeals for all sorts of desirable causes which have to be met, charities to be supported, and subscriptions of all sorts to be made.  By the time they have all been dealt with the total involved is quite formidable.</P>
    <P>What I have been saying about these matters applies chiefly to Dáil members. It also applies to Senators in a modified form.  Admittedly their parliamentary and other public work does not make the same inroads on their private time as does that of members of this House.  They are, however, still expected to cater for local or vocational interests, to serve on local committees and deputations, and to examine and criticise the mass of the Government's programme.  They have also, though on a lesser scale, many of the expenses of Deputies.  This is reflected in the lower rate of allowance which they receive.  The Bill proposes a broadly proportionate increase for them to that proposed for Deputies.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the salaries of members of the Government and similar whole-time offices.  The salary of the Taoiseach is being increased from £3,300 to £5,500 a year, those of Ministers from £2,200 to £3,500, and those of Parliamentary Secretaries from £1,320 to £2,250.  The salaries of the Attorney General, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad <Col N="923" /> are being increased on much the same lines.  I think there is fairly general agreement that the present salaries are quite unrealistic.  It is a fact that the remuneration of the Taoiseach is substantially below that obtaining for a top management job in commerce or industry, or at the top of the professions.</P>
    <P>Ministers are in a similar position and many Ministers have people under their jurisdiction who are paid a great deal more than they are.  It would be very bad for our system of Government, and for the future of our country, if men who would be eminently suitable for the most responsible posts in the service of the State had to turn away in order to protect the interests of their families.  In looking to the years to come one must consider what calibre of man is likely to be attracted to public life, as Deputy, Senator or Minister, if the reward is a great deal less than that available in the much less exacting and far more secure private sector.  There is therefore, I believe, a solemn obligation on the Oireachtas to see to it that the right people are attracted to its service now and in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to revise the basis on which Ministerial and Secretarial pensions are paid to bring them into line with general practice.  These pensions will in future be calculated as a percentage of the salary payable at the time office ceases to be held.  At present the pensions are flat amounts varying according to the number of years of service, and are based upon flat rates introduced by the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, as increased by the various pension increases since 1962.  If the proposal is agreed to, the pensions of those who retire after the Bill becomes law will be calculated at specified percentages of retiring salary, the appropriate percentage depending upon the number of years of service.  These percentages represent, in fact, the proportions which the original flat rates, introduced in 1938, bore to the salary rates then obtaining.</P>
    <P>Finally the Bill proposes an increase <Col N="924" /> in the assistance given to the two main Opposition Parties to enable them to discharge their parliamentary duties efficiently.  The increasing complexities and scope of modern Government demand that, to ensure the effective functioning of Parliament, the Opposition Parties must have at least a minimum of administrative and research assistance available to them.  The existing allowances of £3,360 for the Leader of the main Opposition Party and £1,680 for the Leader of the smaller Party are now entirely inadequate for this purpose and the Bill proposes that these allowances should be increased to £10,000 and £5,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said will help to put the proposals in this Bill in their true perspective.  What we are trying to do in this Bill is to ensure that the best talents among those who feel drawn to public life will not be prevented through lack of means from serving their country in this way.  The hard fact is that the effectiveness of future Government will depend on the calibre of the young people entering politics now.  We cannot afford to let the situation deteriorate because of a reluctance to face some temporary unpopularity.  We must provide now allowances for Ministers and Members which will cover their necessary expenses and give them a reasonable standard of living.  Economic and social pressures affect them the same as anyone else.  Increasingly public service becomes more demanding in time, energy and money.  Those who are elected to give this service should be suitably recompensed.  I therefore recommend the proposals in this Bill to the House and to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this measure and this Bill originate from a request made to the Minister and the Government by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In a matter of this kind it is well that we should recognise and advert to the fact that a proposal to increase the payments made to Members of the Oireachtas and the Government is a matter not lightly to be entered upon, and is a step that has to be carefully considered and carefully <Col N="925" /> weighed.  There is the sanction of public opinion.</P>
      <P>It is well to bear in mind that what is being done in this Bill has to be done by legislation, has to be done openly, and with a full disclosure of the reasons for it.  There is in that respect a marked distinction between this and other payments and other salaries, particularly in the Civil Service and places of that kind, where adjustments can be made frequently and in accordance with the fall in money values without requiring legislation. So far as members of Parliament and certain other groups are concerned, legislation is necessary.  I think it is right that that should be so. It may carry the risk which has got to be faced that there are people outside only too anxious to jeer, only too anxious to sneer and only too anxious to denigrate this Parliament and those in it.</P>
      <P>This Parliament has functioned for almost 50 years.  It is well to recall that in that period of almost 50 years, there have been only five adjustments of allowances and payments to Members of Oireachtas Éireann.  Originally, on the formation of the State, there was an allowance of £30 a month.  The complexity of work in Parliament probably was not as great as it is now but £30 a month&mdash;£360 a year&mdash;was regarded as the appropriate allowance at that time to pay to a Member of the Dáil. A concession existed then that it was an allowance and was not subject to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned in his introductory speech, when an adjustment was made in 1960 it was decided that the parliamentary allowance should be made subject to income tax. The Minister has said, and it is no harm to repeat it and to emphasise, that whatever allowance will be paid as a result of this Bill to Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann will be subject to precisely the same income tax law as affects any payment made to anybody else.  I mention that because I was astonished to read some letters in some of our daily papers where the writers made the point and emphasised that, in fact, Deputies' allowances are <Col N="926" /> not subject to tax.  They are subject to tax and have been so for the past eight years and will be under this Bill also.</P>
    <P>It is well also to make reference to the fact that we, as Members of Oireachtas Éireann, in our own way, having regard to those who, in years gone by, have given a great part of their life to the service of Oireachtas Éireann and who may continue to do so, have established, under the appropriate organisation machinery, a pension fund which is contributed to solely by Members of Oireachtas Éireann. This pension fund was necessary to meet the known cases, at the time it was introduced, of men and women who had given considerable service and who, in fact, were eking out an existence in circumstances almost of destitution.  It is well to mention that six per cent of whatever allowance will be paid under this Bill will go towards the pension fund which means a payment from Deputies of £150 a year.</P>
    <P>In addition, since there should be a full disclosure in this matter, it is well to refer to the fact that all Deputies who are members of political Parties&mdash; and that is almost 100 per cent of the present House&mdash;also pay a substantial Party subscription.  This is paid, certainly in relation to my Party and probably in relation to others, out of the monthly instalment of the allowance paid.</P>
    <P>It is well also to mention that Deputies in the different political Parties are nowadays by no means the free agents they might have been five or six decades ago.  Not only does a member of a political party now, to the best of his talents, do whatever work he can do in Dáil Éireann on legislation and on policy but he also has to do a great deal of what I might call political work in the field.  He has got to assist the fortunes of his Party not merely in his own constituency but whenever the call to battle is sounded. It is no harm to mention in this House, where many of us bear the scars of battle inflicted one upon the other, that a by-election for Dáil Éireann today is no longer the cosy, local contest it used to be some decades ago. Each by-election now, to a very large extent, is a national contest and, once <Col N="927" /> the imminence of the writ becomes apparent, Deputies from each Party are summoned into the arena and down they go.  It costs them money and it costs them time.  I do not want to suggest figures but I have very strong evidence that the amount of money Deputies have to spend at by-elections and other contests, from which we never seem sufficiently removed, is quite considerable.  That factor should be borne in mind in relation to the question of how much a Member of the Oireachtas gets for himself from whatever allowance is paid.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the ordinary calls upon a Deputy in a political Party.  In addition, of course, every Deputy, in relation to his constituency, has to meet calls which cannot be refused. There is always the cup or the prize at the local agricultural show that has to be put up.  There are always various charities that must be met.  It is not a question of keeping up with the Joneses or oneupmanship or anything of that kind.  Being in a public position, a Deputy feels he must give a lead, within his resources, for charity, when called upon to do so.  He does not do it for the sake of political advantage, because there is not any in it.  He does it because, to some extent, he is a leader of public opinion in his constituency and he must set the example which he thinks it is appropriate to set. Nowadays a Deputy, apart from the extra constituency involvements, has to meet increasing costs in his own constituency. The Minister has mentioned secretarial assistance.  I do not know what the reason is, but nowadays it seems that more people call on their Deputies than ever before about problems and difficulties diverse in their complexities. The secretarial work is very considerable and that has to be paid for by the Deputy out of his own resources.</P>
    <P>Some of these matters should be mentioned, not that I am giving a complete picture of the costs and expenditure that a Member of Parliament must meet, but I am endeavouring to give my own view because I regard, and I think a vast majority of the Deputies also regard, public life as <Col N="928" /> an honourable life, one in which those of us who have found ourselves in it seek to make a contribution to the welfare of the country.  At times we make mistakes and perhaps do not set about our task as well as we should.  We all suffer from a variety of faults of our own but generally a good standard of public service has been given by Members of the House in the past 50 years. I am certain that nobody giving his work in a dedicated way in public life makes money out of politics.  If there are those who are quick to criticise and point the finger of scorn, they should have sufficient charity to appreciate that Deputies of all political Parties have no 40-hour week.  There is no situation in which any of us can say that the demands on our time can be put aside until later on.  We have to fit in, often at the expense of family life and leisure, as best we can the demands continually made on us and none of us I believe would grudge what we endeavour to do.</P>
    <P>It is a full and demanding life, a life in which a Member of the House endeavouring to serve the country has to meet many costs.  We have no security of tenure.  Those who came in in the last election may go out in the next.  The person who thinks he has a fixed right to a seat here may find very quickly that he is sitting on thin air and, without security of tenure, it is often difficult for a family man with responsibilities to assess his right perhaps to put the security of others at risk.  But that is what we do and that is what political life means.</P>
    <P>This is a measure which came from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges upon which all political Parties are represented and which therefore has the agreement of the Parties here.  I hope that people who write or think of this debate will not say: &ldquo;Ah, there they are; on everything else, they disagree, but on this one thing there is instant agreement.&rdquo; We are open to that critcism, that jibe, that sneer, but be it so, I believe the case has been made for this adjustment and these increases.  It is right that it should be made in public debate and it is right and proper that those people who are the paymasters and the <Col N="929" /> judges eventually should appreciate that political life is no bed of roses and that Members of the House who are endeavouring to give a service should be indemnified to some extent in relation to the expenses involved.  I say &ldquo;indemnified&rdquo; because I do not believe that in the end there is any profit in what is being done here.  It is merely a step towards meeting demands which in some cases have become too great for the individual to meet.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with Ministerial salaries and I think the case for an increase in these salaries has been established a long time ago.  It has always been a matter of concern to many people, and perhaps of some public concern, that a Minister in charge of a Department was in fact being paid less than not only the permanent head but quite a number of the higher civil servants of his Department. Again, the fault has been largely that of successive Governments&mdash;I do not exclude the Government of which I was a member&mdash;because it was felt that to take the necessary step at the proper time might lead to complications elsewhere and frequently, as a result, nothing was done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that from time to time a Minister may be called upon, not with his consent, to take up the threads of his former life.  That is so. Let us hope it will happen more frequently than it has happened in the past.  I was a Minister in the Government and I was paid the handsome salary of £1,501.  I am one of the few ex-Ministers who do not qualify for a pension.  I was made to take up the threads of my former life rather suddenly without my consent and I found that my liabilities to my bank were twice what they were when I entered upon the service of the State.  I found the threads of my former life had to be woven again while certain people who depended on me waited in expectation and suspense.  These things must be faced.  I certainly feel that the proposal regarding Ministerial salaries is perfectly justified.  It is right and proper and I feel no grounds for criticism regarding it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> May I raise the question of Ministerial pensions as a person who does not qualify and who has no vested interest in it?  I discussed this matter with some of my colleagues and I understand that certain views have been expressed to the Minister but it is well that I should raise them here.  As I read section 10 it appears that what is being done now is that a member of Government who has had over eight years service and who resigned or left Government would now qualify for a pension of 45 per cent of the new salary scale, whereas a member of Government who retired last year or the year before and who had the full pensionable service would enjoy a pension on a much lower scale.  There is something to be dealt with here, because Ministerial salaries should have been increased long before this, in my view, and the mere fact that there has been this delay to this stage should not bring about a result in which there is a disparity in pensions being earned by men who in the same time gave the same service to Government and to the country.</P>
    <P>The allowances proposed in this Bill to the political Parties again is something that can stand examination anywhere. I am not going to discuss in this House the internal problems of my Party, but we, as the main Opposition Party, endeavour to examine critically the problems affecting the country and, within the resources available to us, to outline our solutions. That means for Members of our Front Bench and, indeed, generally for the Party itself, that men have to contribute their experience and thought in committee work.  This is in addition to the calls on time made from the constituency point of view and from a legislative point of view; and involved in that is the necessity for considerable research.</P>
    <P>The plain fact was that in many instances assembling the necessary material meant for us that we had at times to press unduly on the kindness and indulgence of people who found it difficult to do what was asked of them but who did it.  This allowance will make it possible for the Fine Gael Party and, I have no doubt, for the <Col N="931" /> Labour Party, to get together the kind of information we require more easily and efficiently.  The House and the country will benefit as a result.  It is well that the discussion of national problems should be conducted by sides who are at least equally well briefed, and these allowances represent no fruitless expenditure.  They represent a constructive investment in the public and political life of the country, and I think they are fully justified.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that a measure of this kind, open to misconstruction, potential ground for criticism, is not something that this House lightly embarks upon.  It is generally recognised that the status of a Member of Parliament today has changed drastically and dramatically.  He is more and more involved with more and more of his time in complexities and problems that formerly never existed. The idea of olden days where a Member of Parliament dropped into the House to hear what was going on, and regarded it more or less as a very congenial club where he might meet interesting people, discuss the topics of the day and then go off to have his dinner and perhaps worry about something else&mdash;that is gone.  Public life today is a demanding occupation, demanding on time and energy.  There is no old boys' club here in Leinster House.  With the change of status, with the increased demand, I believe that this measure, embarked upon after due consideration by the Government, is fully justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a time now since it became publicly known that there were proposals in hand to increase the salaries of those who are engaged in parliamentary work and who are parliamentary representatives. So far there has not been any public comment from me as the Leader of the Labour Party, because I believed that this Second Reading debate was the appropriate time to give not only my own views but those of my Party as well.  In view of some of the criticism by a limited number of people in the country, it is necessary that all the facts in regard to Deputies' and Ministers' <Col N="932" /> salaries, their duties, functions and responsibilities, should be made known in a debate such as this.  The Minister has outlined most of these facts, and Deputy O'Higgins has done the same.  I think I am a little longer in the House than either Deputy O'Higgins or the Minister for Finance and can claim to have the same appreciation, if not a slightly better one, of this subject than either of the two who have spoken before me.</P>
      <P>In this we are discussing the fifth round of salary increases for Deputies. When we are talking about rounds of increases, they are usually related to the post-war period, but what we are discussing is the fifth round increase since 1922, since the establishment of the Second Dáil.  I suppose if anybody is at fault in this matter it is Dáil Éireann itself, because it ought to be said that the figure which is now proposed should have been gradually aimed at over the past 45 years.  I do not think the public are generally aware&mdash;if they are, they do not want to believe this fact&mdash;that there have been only four increases since 1923 and that there have been very long intervals in between.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has said, the salary or allowance in 1923 was £360; it was not increased until 1938, to £480; nine years afterwards, it was increased to £624; and 17 years afterwards to £1,000.  It is true that the question of increases for Deputies and for Ministers was mooted many times over the years but was postponed because it always appeared to somebody to be inappropriate.  My view and that of my Party always has been that there should have been a proper rate fixed for the job and that the salaries should have been increased at much more frequent intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that has been posed by the Minister and by Deputy O'Higgins is: Do we want the choice of the people to represent them here in Dáil Éireann or is representation in Dáil Éireann be the preserve of those who can afford to be Members of Parliament merely because they have other means?  One of the co-founders of the Labour Party, James Connolly, whose 100th anniversary we celebrate this year, commented <Col N="933" /> on MP's salaries when the Home Rule Bill was on the Westminster Statute Book.  In this particular piece of legislation, there was no mention of payment of Members and to this Connolly objected strongly.  He said it was a deliberate attempt, and it can be recognised that it must have been, to prevent proper Labour representation in Dáil Éireann, particularly at that time.  He insisted that MPs should be paid and paid adequately.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why we believe that the proposal of the Minister for Finance is fully justified today. If we underpay, only those who can afford it will enter politics.  Politicians as such are not very popular people in this country and they are subjected to the type of abuse and sneer and denigration to which Deputy O'Higgins referred. We are talking about salaries of Members of Parliament; we are discussing Parliament and those who constitute Parliament and not necessarily those who are here today but Members of Parliament in the future and for many years to come.  Along with a discussion on the salaries for Members, we ought on this occasion to avail of the opportunity to discuss other matters as well, the functions of Parliament, the duties of Members, fair salaries for them, and a revision of the functions of Parliament and whether or not we should have full-time politicians.</P>
    <P>The Members of Parliaments are elected by the people and there is not sufficient appreciation of or deep thought given to Parliament and those who constitute it.  The Parliament elects the Government and the Government run the nation's affairs. Parliament is in effect the supreme authority, although of course we have the President in certain circumstances and the courts of law.  The Minister mentioned this and I should like to emphasise it so that the people will understand what Parliament is and what responsibilities the Members have. Parliament decides how much money should be invested from the money raised for housing, agriculture, industry, harbours, transport and power, hospitals, schools and other things.  It decides the yearly current expenditure on such things as social welfare, health <Col N="934" /> education, justice, and agriculture.  It decides how money is to be raised, either by way of loans, taxation or savings.  It decides what laws are to be enacted for every section of the community and the betterment of the community as a whole.  In fact, Parliament decides the type of society we live in and influences our way of life. I do not want to appear to criticise in any way, but as I say, we are discussing Members of Parliament and their salaries.  I suppose the temptation in a discussion like this is to compare salaries here with those of other people.</P>
    <P>I know that the professions I am going to mention are an important and integral part of the community but we should relate their functions, duties and responsibilities to those of Ministers and Members of Parliament.  There are people who say that £2,500 is too much.  The average economist, or should I say, the economist who receives the average wage, earns by the time he is 30 years of age £1,500; by the time he is 40 he earns £2,500 and by the time he is 45 years of age, he averages £3,000.  The accountant by the time he is 30 gets an average £1,400; by the time he is 40, £2,000 and by the time he is 45, he gets £2,400.  The architect by the time he is 30 years of age receives £1,600 per year; by the time he reaches 40, he gets £1,900; and by the time he reaches 45 he gets £2,300.  One could go on <i>ad infinitum</i> about engineers and others in the professions and in private industry to demonstrate how much higher these salaries are than the present salary paid to Members of Dáil Éireann and indeed the salary proposed in this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the duties of Members of the Dáil, to those who must be legislators, debaters, public speakers and public servants.  Apart from this, because they are Members of Dáil Éireann, they have public engagements outside the Dáil.  Few people referred to the fact that this is a seven-day per week job with no special hours.  This is no nine to five job and it need hardly be mentioned that there is no overtime.  A lot of people assume that the work of Members is confined <Col N="935" /> to the 100 days on which the Dáil meets.  They assume that a Member has nothing to do during the Summer Recess or during the breaks at Easter and Christmas.  This indeed is not the end of his work for he must travel his constituency, and indeed a majority of the Members of the various Parties must now travel outside their constituencies during by-election periods.  The letters, the calls to the Departments and the interviews with people and various other work of this kind take time and there is not much time left for leisure. Every Deputy will agree that one of the worst things is that he is engaged on political work on practically every Sunday in the year.</P>
    <P>It is about time the critics of Members of Dáil Éireann and the proposals in this Bill remembered all these things and had regard to these facts which I have mentioned and which were mentioned by the Minister and Deputy O'Higgins.  Again every Member knows that every person one encounters is a potential client.  Everyone assumes that you are very busy, that you are very hardworking and they say that they would not have your job for £10,000 and they ask you how do you stick it, but as soon as they say that, they mention some problem they have either in regard to themselves or friends or relations. That does not concern us.  We know this and we gladly accept the problem or the job that is given.  The Minister mentioned that there was little privacy at home.  This again is something to which we do not object but I emphasise it as another one of the difficult tasks the Deputy has to meet.</P>
    <P>These services are rendered&mdash;the letterwriting, the calls to local offices and to various Departments and so on&mdash;because the public want them. This sort of service is not peculiar to Ireland; it is done by practically every Parliamentarian in Western Europe. Somebody described us as ombudsmen and I suppose we are.  The Minister was right when he described us as the liaison between the Government, Government Departments and the ordinary people.  In my view, it is a vital role and a role which must be engaged in by the Members of Dáil <Col N="936" /> Éireann.  As far as these salaries are concerned, I believe, and I am sure every Deputy believes, that every citizen over 21 years of age is entitles to become a Member of Dáil Éireann and no one should be debarred because he finds it financially difficult to do so.  The policy of the rich and the well-off is to keep the salaries low. Indeed, the last time we had a similar discussion here there were comments from some Members to the effect that this should not be a salary at all; it should be an allowance and should be regarded as such.  I have always believed that it should be, as it is now and has been for the past four or five years, a salary because this is a full-time job.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise again that if we keep the salary low, the result will be that many people who could contribute to the public life of the country here in Dáil Éireann will be debarred from doing so.  If Deputies' salaries are to be less favourable than the salaries of others, whose responsibilities are not nearly so great, who do not work as long hours, or bear the same expenses, then we shall be blocking efficient politicians from Dáil Éireann.  We shall limit the choice of politicians to those who can supplement their incomes by some other means.</P>
    <P>There is an attitude in the country on the part of a number of people that the Dáil Deputy on a salary of £1,500 a year lives a life of luxury.  Is it to be suggested that a TD should be regarded as inferior to persons with larger salaries who have not the same responsibilities and who are not subject to the same glare of publicity&mdash;aye, and in recent times, personal criticism, not alone by word of mouth but in the written article by people whose salaries are not so much depleted by expenses as are the salaries of those they criticise?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the various expenses Deputies have to meet.  I am sure every Deputy can detail his own. It may sometimes look like putting on the poor mouth to mention all the little expenses that have to be met. There are people who assume that every time we step into our cars our expenses are paid.  The travel that a <Col N="937" /> Deputy does in his constituency and the cost of that travel every year is formidable.  He has to pay hotel bills inside and outside his constituency and they can be a pretty big item.  There is scarcely any necessity, I suppose, to talk about the subscriptions that are demanded every day and every week in the year.  These subscriptions must be paid.  The Deputy who would refuse to contribute to this or that fund, to this or that football, hurling, rugby or soccer club would very soon find himself out of favour with his constituents.</P>
    <P>Again, and I do not know why it should have to be repeated, but it must be emphasised, the newspapers are pretty poor in their approach to this. I do not know whether or not they know it, but Deputies pay income tax. How many more times will this have to be said?  Letters appear in the evening papers&mdash;it is usually in these papers that the criticism appears&mdash; which usually end up with something to the effect that Deputies' salaries are not subject to income tax.  It should be known, once and for all, by those who write to and in newspapers that Deputies have the same obligations as other individuals where income tax is concerned.  The only difference is that the first £500 is not subject to income tax.  When that is mentioned, it is, of course, assumed that there is a saving of £500 in income tax.  The salary of £1,500 that a Dáil Deputy receives is not a net sum; it is not a take-home pay packet.  It is a return for labour. It is also for the purpose of meeting expenses and, if one deducts expenses from that £1,500 and calculates the amount of income tax paid on the balance, there is very little left.  Yet, there are people who regard this salary as luxurious.</P>
    <P>I and the other members of my Party visualise part of this increase being used for secretarial assistance. One of the great defects in our system here is the fact that there is no provision for secretarial assistance.  Let no one be under the misapprehension that a full-time assistant can be employed even out of £2,500 per year, but I firmly believe that secretarial assistance, even on a part-time basis, <Col N="938" /> will allow Deputies to engage more extensively in the more important work of attendance here in the Chamber and participation in legislation.</P>
    <P>I said, and the previous speakers agree with me, that letter-writing and phone calls are a necessary part of the work of a Deputy.  I do not accept that Deputies of an Irish Parliament should have to spend so much time answering letters by hand, as they do now, and as they are required to do under our present system.  They answer hundreds and hundreds of letters every week.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it was possible for some Deputies to engage secretarial assistance.  It is not possible for those whose only income is the salary they receive as a Member of Dáil Éireann and anybody who engages secretarial assistance does so out of some other income.  I fail to see how such assistance could be afforded out of £1,500 a year.</P>
    <P>The public do not seem to appreciate the fact that approximately every three years Deputies, and others of course, have to contest a general election&mdash;a long, strenuous and expensive campaign. As far as our Party is concerned, those contesting elections get some financial assistance from the trade unions, but there are others who find themselves after an election with pretty heavy bills, bills they try to pay off over the next two, three or four years.</P>
    <P>In the end, it is the people who will decide.  If my constituents believe I am wrong in voting for an increase for Members of this House, they will tell me so in the next election.  They will tell me either by reducing my vote substantially or putting me out.  I am prepared, for the reasons given by the Minister and for my own reasons, to put myself before the people on that particular issue.  I have sufficient confidence in my constituents and in the electorate in other constituencies in which we have Labour representation to believe that they will appreciate the reasons for fixing a proper rate for the job.</P>
    <P>We have been asked of course what qualifications have we?  There are people who would suggest that we <Col N="939" /> should all be university graduates or have undergone some special courses. The only qualification we should have is that we are elected by the people. One does not have to be a university graduate to know what people want. One does not need any special training to ensure that the wishes of one's constituents or of the country as a whole are represented here in debate.  We are elected by the people, as has been emphasised, for a while.  We have the strictest employers anybody could have. A civil servant is recruited through examination or interview and he remains in the Civil Service, unless he does something very drastic, until he is 65 years of age.  The same position obtains in local government.  Some of these people have far more by way of salary than Deputies or Senators have. We have, as I said, the strictest employers.  Our security of tenure is most uncertain.  We have to go before our employers to be re-elected, to get our jobs back, every three or four years.  On this particular issue, on the issue of the Budget, on the referendum, or anything like that, it is the people who will judge and decide whether or not we should continue to represent them.</P>
    <P>There are other arguments also that should be commented upon.  Deputies are put into different categories.  We are told that there are the legislators, the letter writers, a combination of legislators and letter writers, and professional people who give part-time service to the position of Deputy of Dáil Éireann.  There are arguments, of course, that some Deputies should get the increase and others should not.  Of course, when a constituent meets a Deputy, he is wont to say: &ldquo;I think you are worth it all right but there are others in Dáil Éireann who are not worth it at all.&rdquo;  This is a daft sort of argument.  If we are to bring this to its logical conclusion, we should have different rates in accordance with their alleged ability for dispensary doctors, civil servants, plasterers, carpenters, labourers, journalists.  This, as I say, is the rate for the job and the people will find out the laggards, the people who do not answer letters, those who do not make contributions in Dáil <Col N="940" /> Éireann and those who are very part-time politicians and attend only occasionally in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is suggested, of course, that £2,500 is excessive and comparisons are made with social welfare recipients and the lowly paid workers.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we have nothing to be ashamed about as far as our record goes.  We need no reminding that old age pensioners, widows and orphans, those on the dole and those who are sick have a very low level of allowance.  We understand and appreciate, particularly those of us in the trade union movement, that there are tens of thousands of lowly paid workers, even in the Government service, and tens of thousands all over the country who have inadequate wages but I do not think that anybody on any side of the House would suggest that this is because of lack of effort by the Labour Party or by the trade union movement.  As far as we are concerned, we will try, as we always have tried, to ensure that as far as these people are concerned, and those who are lowly paid, they will be &ldquo;upped&rdquo; as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is only fair in a discussion on salaries that we should also discuss the functioning of Parliament.  Frankly, I must say that my Party have been discussing the functions of Parliament over the past few months.  It would be an understatement to say that we are entirely dissatisfied with the type of machinery that we have here to consider legislation, to consider Estimates and different other business that comes before Dáil Éireann.  I may be corrected on this, but, as far as I know, we have the same machine and the same old routine we have had for the past 46 years.  I do not believe that the best use is being made of Parliament or, should I say, I do not believe the best use is being made of the Members. The system we have at the present time is inefficient and, as I have said, Deputies are not utilised to the full.</P>
    <P>If one has regard to, say, Committee Stage discussion, one must notice, and I am sure the public must notice, the low attendance.  We have advocated here no more than two or three weeks <Col N="941" /> ago to the Taoiseach that there should be a system of committees.  That would not be unusual because, as far as I know from the experience I have had in the Council of Europe, the European system provides for a number of committees, not alone in the Council of Europe, but in the various countries that constitute the Council of Europe.  I believe that we could do much better work and much more efficient work if we were to establish permanent committees for reviewing proposed legislation. I believe that outside this Chamber, but within the House, or even in a Department, we should have sitting, say, a committee on financial affairs, one that would deal with budget planning and foreign trade; one on economic affairs that would deal with industry, agriculture and labour, that is, the legislation for these, and, indeed, any other proposals; one for social welfare that would deal with health, education and housing; one for home affairs that would deal with local government, justice and, say, the Gaeltacht; and, certainly, one for foreign affairs&mdash;this is one that we need very badly indeed, in view of the absence of information and the light and slight discussion that we have in this House on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Another one that has been suggested by various Members of the House, even by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, is a committee that would review the management, practice and policy as laid down by the Government for State and semi-State bodies, because we have to remember that in respect of these State and semi-State bodies there is an investment by the State, if you like by the taxpayer, of £200 million.</P>
    <P>Members must concede that we have many debates in this House that are in themselves futile.  Even though they have more or less the same sort of machinery in practice in Great Britain, they seem to be much more efficient and, certainly, seem to be able to get through their business a great deal faster than we do even though their problems and the extent of their administration are far bigger.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deny the right of any Deputy to talk on the Budget and <Col N="942" /> to talk as long as he can but during the lifetime of this Government and even of the inter-Party Governments, we have had Budget debates that went on for three weeks.  I do not deny the right of every single person in this House to talk on the Budget but, to some extent, it is waste of time.  The Minister has said that we operate under the Party system.  I do not think there would be any difficulty, from my point of view, in having, say, selected from the Labour Party a limited number of Deputies to talk on the Budget. Similarly, it would be with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  There is a certain futility about the type of debate that we have had that went on for three weeks and, indeed, the type of debate we are having now on the proposal to abolish proportional representation.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle must find himself in a very difficult position at times.  Not wanting to go into the merits or demerits of the referendum, I must say that we have had, <i>ad nauseam</i>, the same argument by the same people for the last five or six weeks.  There are many more important things that could and should be discussed in Dáil Éireann.  Surely there are things such as I have mentioned that could well be dealt with in committee by selected members of the various Parties in the House and their final report could come back to the House to be decided upon by the entire 144 Members?  I do not think that is asking too much. We are wasting time here.  We are working on a system that is certainly outmoded.  In any case, only one thing can be debated by the Members of this House at a time by reason of the fact that this is the only place where matters of national importance are discussed. The Marts Bill was important but there were other things that were more important when we spent weeks and weeks on that Bill in this House last year.  In any case, in this House the discussion takes a broader line. There is no opportunity for Members, nor is there any tolerance for Members, to go into details of certain legislation. Ministers, or should I say, parliamentary draftsmen, have got away with murder in this House for <Col N="943" /> years and years, again by reason of the fact that it was impossible, even at such distance as, say, from where I am to the Minister, to be able to question him and to get information on something that is obscure or very difficult to an ordinary Deputy.</P>
    <P>I believe also that we should be prepared to work longer in Dáil Éireann. We should have all-day sittings.  The British House of Commons, as far as I know, works five days per week and starts in the morning.  I do not think we have achieved a great deal, for example, in the past three weeks.  I do not think we have made any world-shaking decisions or nation-making decisions here.  It has been argued that it is impossible to start business in the morning because Ministers must look after the affairs of their Departments and that if divisions were called, they might not be able to be available, <i>et cetera.</i>  I think this is a lot of cod, too.  In view of the fact that we have in many cases set times for divisions, this argument about Ministers having to be present for divisions does not stand. We should be prepared to sit in the mornings and sit the day through.  I do not know whom that will or will not suit.  This is the view of my Party. Serious consideration should be given to it, if not by the Minister for Finance, then by the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>We are asked to be an effective Opposition.  When one has regard to the practice in Dáil Éireann, it is evident that the fullest facilities are not available for an Opposition to work properly.  I am not talking about allowances now.  Opposition time is completely inadequate.  I do not know how much Private Members' Time we had in this session since last October: I would say about eight hours in all, if that.  It must be remembered that we, too, are part of the machinery of Parliament.  There is an assumption, in the House particularly and maybe in the country, that all initiative comes and must come from the Government. The Constitution intended that the Opposition could also have certain facilities for promoting Private Members' Bills and motions.  These facilities <Col N="944" /> are practically nil.  Very little can emanate by way of initiative from the Opposition because so little time is given for Private Members' Motions and Bills.</P>
    <P>There is no opportunity of introducing emergency measures.  We must wonder sometimes when something happens in Britain, Rhodesia or some part of the world having relations with Britain that there can be a debate in the British Parliament on that day or the following day.  But here if something we believe important happens in the country or something happens that should not happen, what do we do? We put down a question.  We must give four or five days' notice.  The Taoiseach or a Minister answers, refuses supplementaries, and then the Ceann Comhairle must call the next question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not take him to task for that now.  We get through very little effective work in Dáil Éireann because everything must be debated and teased out here.  I do not mind it on the Second Stage debate but when it comes to detail, it should go to a committee representative of the Parties in the House while the broad debate should take place in the House itself.  Having six or seven committees working, we could do far more effective work, get more decisions and get them sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe these reforms of the Dáil would necessitate a better management of Deputies' time.  This is on the assumption that he is to be relieved of the colossal amount of letter writing and the other small incidentals he has to do.  He must be freed of the drudgery of having to write hundreds of letters.  Betimes people come to the Gallery and see ten or 12 Deputies here.  They wonder where the rest are and assume they are in some other place.  Some of them assume they have gone to the bar or are out the city doing their private business.  If the truth were known, if these people had access to the various committee rooms, they would see these Deputies <Col N="945" /> from Kerry, Cork, Wicklow and Wexford writing letters to their constituents, one of the essentials of representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the provision of proper facilities for Deputies.  I do not want to compare this Parliament with other Parliaments, but as far as facilities are concerned, we must have the lowest in Western Europe.  I do not know much about other parts of the world.  There should be a proper research service.  This was mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins as well.  The £5,000 the Minister offers the Labour Party will do very little of the job that requires to be done by a Party in Opposition.  I do not think it would be unfair to compare it with the assistance and facilities provided for members of the Government and Parliamentary Secretaries.  The proposal is that the Leader of the second Opposition Party should get £5,000. You can do very little with it.  We should also dispel the notion that Deputy Cosgrave gets as his personal income £10,000 and that I get as my personal income £5,000.  If there is any change needed in this Bill, it is something to the effect that this sum is for secretarial and research services for the Party.  I do not believe this is widespread but there are people who assume that this is the income of the Leader of the Party at the time.  Note should also be taken of the accommodation for Deputies here.  In one of the Labour Party rooms, there are six people in a room about 12 feet by 14 feet.</P>

      <P>There is one phone and a mad scramble to get on to this, that and the other Department.  At times the six of them have to try to deal with their correspondence on one small table.  This is ridiculous and is something that should be looked into by the Minister as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supporting the new rates for Deputies because with it we are looking for a reform of the Dáil and an enlargement of the role of the Deputy. We believe politics is a full-time profession <Col N="946" /> and one of the most important professions in the country.  We believe there should be full attendance at the Dáil and Seanad.  We hope that with the improvement in the salaries and the improvement in secretarial facilities this will be possible.</P>
    <P>Let me come back now to the criticism that the Opposition is not effective in Dáil Éireann.  I do not believe the straight vote will improve that. There are other things that should and could be done if the Opposition is to be more effective than it is alleged to be.  The biggest drawback is the lack of research facilities for the Party as distinct from the individual Deputy.  It would not be unfair to consider the facilities for research at the disposal of the Government.  At any particular time any particular Minister has a team of well-trained civil servants to assist him.  Even in this non-controversial debate, the Minister has three advisers alongside him.  If he misses anything, they are there ready to provide him with information.  In respect of any subject, he has hundreds of civil servants&mdash;I do not begrudge them to him&mdash;who can condense any information the Minister may request and so enable him to present it immediately to the Dáil.  He can get the best brains, both inside and outside the Civil Service, to act for him on commissions and so on.</P>
    <P>Up to now the allowance to the Labour Party has been £1,680.  It would not employ a good clerical officer and these are the circumstances in which we are expected to be a good Opposition.  If I want information, I have to get somebody who will act in a voluntary capacity to get it for me. Willing as people are, they are under no obligation to do it.  They promise to do it and they promise to have it the next day.  Anybody presuming that there would be proper research facilities for £1,680 per year certainly needs to have his head examined.  Legislation every single year is becoming more complex and expert advice is needed more and more as the days and the months go by.  It is needed by all Parties.</P>
    <P>As far as the EEC is concerned, if <Col N="947" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance is to make contribution, he will get the views of every single Department of State.  This he gets as a matter of practice but on every aspect of the Treaty of Rome, he can call upon those thousands of civil servants to dig out information and have it condensed.  I am not suggesting that anything like that should be made available to the Opposition Parties but at least there should be available a sum of money that would allow them to employ three, four or five so that they would be fully armed with any information that might be required for such as, say, the very complex Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>We are now doing our best to assimilate the tons of statistics that are sent out to Deputies each day.  I wonder how many Deputies read even a hundredth part of the various documents that come from semi-State organisations and from the various Government Departments.  We should have such people, but even the £5,000 per year would employ about three persons. If one divides three into £5,000, it would mean something like £1,600 or £1,700 per year each.  You will not get good top-class researchers at that rate.</P>
    <P>Criticism is likely to be made while we in the Dáil are making these decisions about these increases.  These proposals should not ever again come before Dáil Éireann in this fashion. On other occasions when increases were proposed, there was always a suggestion, and a very right one, that some outside commission should do it. I think, now that these proposals are before us here, the Minister should indicate that, in respect of the Members of the House and members of the judiciary, they ought to be decided by an outside body.  Now that the rate for the job has been fixed, it need not be such a difficult task to adjust the salaries in the future.  There should be some outside mechanism for the adjustment of Dáil salaries and get them into line with other incomes and wage levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> We are all concerned about greater productivity and various Ministers of State have exhorted those in industry and agriculture to produce more.  I think we should also seek greater productivity from Dáil Éireann and from its Members.  I believe in the suggestions I have made, sketchy as they may appear to be, with regard to the establishment of committees and greater expediency in dealing with legislation, Estimates and that sort of thing.  If we are to reform Parliament on those lines, if we require politicians on a full-time basis, if we require all-day sittings&mdash;I mean morning sittings &mdash;in Dáil Éireann, we will have a future Parliament with much changed and streamlined machinery, in view of the fact that it has not been changed since 1946.  This parliamentary machine we have was designed on Victorian lines which in modern times we should not be following.</P>

      <P>I am glad the proposals in the Bill have been received in the manner in which they have by the Leaders of the other Parties.  I do not think any particular comment is called from me at this stage.  I think the proposals and the need for them on the background against which they are being put forward have been very fairly and properly outlined by me and the other two speakers.  I hope we can find the same amount of understanding among the general public because, as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins rightly points out, these proposals, above all proposals put forward in the Dáil, have to stand up to the test of public criticism.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, I propose to look again at this particular section and perhaps discuss it again with the two Parties before we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points put forward by Deputy Corish, there is perhaps a great deal in a lot of what he says.  I would not like anybody to think, however, that in this Assembly we are all that inefficient.  As I read the reports of other Parliaments, particularly the Parliament in Great <Col N="949" /> Britain, even though they seem to have a great deal of difficulty with the system which they are operating, it would seem to me that perhaps there is room for improvement here, but I feel the difficulties are arising more from the nature of the work we have to do rather than from the machinery we are using to do it.  We can recollect that it is not long since there were energetic protests in the House of Commons against the kind of system they are operating.  I do not think we should just look at what they do and adopt it here automatically.  For my part, I like better than anything else a good Committee Stage debate in this House and personally I would regret it if that were to be discontinued.  This Dáil is almost exceptionally at its best when it gets its teeth into Committee Stage legislation.  This may be a luxury we cannot afford and from now on it may be that some committee system may have to be devised.  I think I am right in saying that the Taoiseach indicated here before that these are matters that can be brought forward and discussed by the Leaders of the different Parties with the Taoiseach, and I think he has indicated that such discussions can be held any time.  I do not think, no matter what we do, that we can rule out the possibility of improvement; the volume of work we have to do is so great and so complex that we will have difficulties.</P>
    <P>I perhaps have a special responsibility in regard to the machinery of Parliament here.  The Taoiseach, I suppose, is basically responsible for business and the conduct of business. In so far as the facilities available to Deputies on all sides of the House and the different Parties are concerned, I suppose this comes especially within my ambit as Minister for Finance.  I am perfectly prepared to listen to any proposals that might be put forward by Parties or by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as to how we can improve matters.  I accept that perhaps there is considerable scope for improvement.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office, and for payment of certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this Supplementary Estimate.  The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to seek the approval of the Dáil for the expenses of a Board which I am setting up to facilitate the changeover to decimal currency.  As I said in my Budget speech the changeover will commence on 15th February, 1971 and it is desirable to put the necessary preparatory work in hands now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board will be responsible for working out and supervising the detailed arrangements for effecting the changeover.  Its task will be to encourage firms and organisations to make arrangements well in advance for such matters as the training of staff, the conversion of £ s d machines and the re-organisation of internal accounting <Col N="952" /> systems.  It will consult with and advise retail organisations and other cash-handling bodies on how best to overcome any difficulties that may arise during the transition period when both the old and the new currency will be in circulation.  The Board will also be responsible for devising and directing a comprehensive publicity compaign to prepare the public for the change.  To ensure satisfactory planning of the machine conversion programme, which is probably the biggest problem of the changeover, the Board will have to keep in close touch with the machine companies.</P>
    <P>I invited some of the bodies mainly concerned with the changeover to suggest the names of suitable persons from amongst whom I might select members of the Board.  I am now in a position to anounce the appointment of the following persons to the Board:</P>
    <P>Mr. S.F. Murray, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Mr. M.D. Corbett, Financial Director of P.J. Carroll &amp; Co. Ltd.</P>
    <P>Mr. E. Graham, Assistant Secretary, Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Mr. Eoin McCarthy, Assistant General Manager, Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>Mr. P.E. O'Brien, President, Federation of Trade Associations.</P>
    <P>Mr. H. O'Sullivan, General Secretary, Irish Local Government Officials Union.</P>
    <P>Mr. D.F. Shanley, Director of Planning, Bank of Ireland Group.</P>
    <P>Mr. C. E. Sowman, Secretary, Royal Bank of Ireland Ltd.</P>
    <P>Mr. G.L.M. Wheeler, Chartered Accountant.</P>
    <P>Mr. S.F. Murray will act as chairman and the secretariat for the Board will be provided by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the denominations of the coins for the new system will be 10 new pence and 5 new pence instead of the present florin and shilling, 2 new pence, 1 new penny and the half new penny worth 1.2d.  The designs for the new coins will be drawn as far as possible from the <Col N="953" /> designs on the existing coins.  Legislation will be required to provide for the issue of the new coinage and to cover the conversion of £ s d amounts in statutes and other legal documents. I shall introduce the Bill in the Dáil as soon as the necessary provisions can be settled.</P>
    <P>No special compensation will be paid in respect of the costs of conversion or replacement of business machines. As I indicated in my Budget Statement, these costs will be offset to a large extent by tax reliefs.  In view of the benefits to be gained from decimalisation, it is only reasonable to expect machine users to meet some of the costs themselves.</P>
    <P>There are no grounds for suggestions in recent press reports that there have been unnecessary delays in reaching a decision on the choice of a decimal system for this country and in making preparations for the change.  The Working Party on Decimal Currency which reported in 1964 recommended the adoption of the ten shilling system. At that stage the British Government had not made any decision on the system to be adopted there.  When it became clear at the end of 1966 that the British Government intended to adopt the £, new penny, half system it was necessary for the Government here to reassess the position.  It was decided to give a final opportunity to representative organisations and the public at large to make known their views.  This was done with all possible speed and there was no unnecessary delay subsequently in deciding on the system to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there need be no concern about the adequacy of the time available to make the arrangements for the introduction of the new currency. The Decimal Currency Board will have almost three years in which to prepare for the changeover, the same time as was available to the Australian Board.  In fact the Working Party on Decimal Currency recommended that a preparatory period of two years would be sufficient here.  Given the cooperation of all involved, there is plenty of time in which to get ready for the change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> I am also establishing an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate the arrangements for the changeover within the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As distinct from the decision to adopt the same system as the British which, I think, is generally recognised as one which does not leave us a good deal of objection, has the Minister or his advisers considered problems involved in it?  I understand that the present decision means that in respect of taxes such as the turnover tax or the wholesale tax, percentage and such problems will arise.  Will these fall to be considered by the advisory committee?  Are this Committee solely concerned with the mechanical and technical problems of putting into practice the decision to operate the decimal system?  The Minister referred to the Australian decision. A very considerable amount of research and discussion was undertaken there. Most of us know that recently the Chairman of that Committee visited here and had some discussions.  I think it was generally recognised that the particular work which the Australians did was of a very high quality.</P>
      <P>There is some concern, and it has been expressed to me, that the practical difficulties of operating the wholesale tax and the turnover tax on the basis of denominations will present certain difficulties.  While it is recognised that if the British adopt particular units, our very close day-to-day trading arrangements and the inter-changeability of the currency make it difficult to consider any alternative, at the same time, trade and business and commercial undertakings generally would like to be satisfied that every aspect of the matter will be fully and adequately considered by this Committee before final decisions are taken in respect of the actual system put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give that assurance.  We are fortunate in this country in that we are doing this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concluding on decimal currency?  If he is, I want to say a word on it.  One thing <Col N="955" /> the Minister said was not absolutely clear.  Possibly I did not hear him correctly. He said that part of the cost of the changeover to the new machines would be met by taxation allowances. My understanding of the Budget decision as announced is that the whole cost of changeover would be proper deduction for income tax and corporation profits tax, and that therefore it would be correct to say that the expense to the machine user of the changeover is the expense after full deduction of allowances against both corporation profits tax and income tax. In the phraseology I heard the Minister use a minute ago, it could be taken that only part of the cost was an allowance for taxation purposes and I do not think that is what the Minister meant and it is better to get it quite clear.</P>
      <P>Secondly, am I correct in thinking that the effect of the changeover will be that after changeover, there will be two types of coins and notes running side by side for a considerable period in ordinary everyday life, that every time an old coin or note comes back into a bank, it will be taken up?  I was a few minutes late and if the Minister dealt with this at the beginning of his statement, he will have to excuse me. Is it clear that every time the present issue&mdash;shall I call it that&mdash;comes into a bank, the bank will exchange it, or is it proposed that the Central Bank will issue only a fixed amount of the new money each year and that fixed amount will be used to take out of circulation the existing currency, or, once the changeover date is arrived at, is it the intention to do everything possible to withdraw from circulation existing coins and existing notes at the very earliest possible opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I think it desirable that there should be a categorical assurance from the Minister, as I am certain is the case, that this changeover and the adoption of the new money&mdash; shall I call it that&mdash;does not in any way affect the right of any holder of existing legal tender at any time to get that legal tender converted by the Central Bank.  It would be unthinkable that there would be any other decision <Col N="956" /> but some people are pretty stupid and it would be as well that people who are apprehensive in that way should have their apprehensions completely allayed by a categorical statement from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I ask is it proposed to issue specimen sets or gift or token sets&mdash;whatever the word is&mdash;of the new coins immediately on the day of issue in the same way as people collect stamps on the first day of issue?  I feel that would be something that would meet with an appreciative and ready sale.  People would like to obtain them, and the process would be something worthwhile as a means of acclimatising people to the changeover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I think we are in a way fortunate that we are coming to do this after other countries have successfully accomplished it and we can call on their experience to the fullest extent.  Indeed, we have already been doing that and have studied all aspects of the changeover in the other countries which have recently made the change.  Our people who went to these countries received the fullest possible co-operation and we are assured that all the benefits of their experience will be at our disposal.  This I think is enormously important from our point of view, very reassuring and very encouraging. A distinguished visitor from Australia who was with us recently was very helpful and very reassuring on all these points.</P>
      <P>In the main, this Board will be responsible for technical matters, publicity and so on, and questions of principle will still be the responsibility of the Government.  I am thinking of matters like price control, the avoidance of overcharging, matters affecting taxation and so on.  These will still be the responsibility of the Government to decide.  Of course, the advice of the Board will be available.  However, in the main, the Board will be responsible for the machinery of the changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost, the question raised by Deputy Sweetman is a valid one.  Perhaps I should explain that when I used the phraseology I did, which was to the effect that these costs will be offset to a large extent by tax <Col N="957" /> reliefs, what I meant was that the full cost to the people concerned cannot be recouped simply by tax reliefs.  Perhaps I should repeat what I said in the Budget Statement:</P>
    <P>The cost of converting machines to the decimal system will be offset, to a large extent, by tax relief.  Expenditure on adapting existing machines will be deductible as an expense in computing profits for tax purposes.  Expenditure on the purchases of new machines or on major adaptations of existing machines will be eligible for capital allowances.  Outside the western areas, there will be an initial allowance of 60 per cent of the expenditure and annual wear-and-tear allowances on the usual basis.  In the west, free depreciation will be allowable under the provisions introduced last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Budget Statement, is it not?  My criticism was not of that but of what the Minister said a few minutes ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, but when I used the words &ldquo;partly offset&rdquo;, I just meant that tax relief cannot recoup the full cost.</P>
      <P>The idea will be of course that the coinage to be superseded will be in fact withdrawn as quickly as possible. Nobody need have any great apprehensions on this score.  In some of the countries, I think the period allowed after the changeover was two years.  New Zealand actually allowed one year but again these are all matters which will be decided upon and arranged to the best possible advantage by this Board when it gets into operation.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,410,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office <Col N="958" /> of the Revenue Commissioners, including certain other services administered by that Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood: I thought we were going to do all the Supplementary Estimates first.  In relation to the Estimate for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, I should like to have from the Minister some indication of how the computer is, for want of a better word, acting up. Naturally enough, there were very considerable teething troubles in the beginning.  In the beginning, it was pretty regular that complaints were coming in about mistakes having been made in the computer.  I do not know whether it was in the programming, the feed, the computer itself or the method.  I must confess I have received far fewer complaints recently and I am assuming on that account that the teething troubles have been to a large extent resolved.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to the general position of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I presume this is the right Vote on which to raise the matter&mdash;I should like to hear from the Minister what progress has been made in relation to the printing of the volume on death duties.  The Minister must be getting pretty tired of my queries in that respect.  Of course, if that is so, it is to some degree his own fault for not having delivered the goods on time, as promised.  The volumes that were issued by the Revenue Commissioners on stamp duty and the loose-leaf income tax volume have been most helpful.  It would be very desirable indeed that the similar death duty publication should be produced with all possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, there is another volume that should be produced in the same way, a volume which will not require nearly as much work but certainly is very desirable for the taxpayer, for the practitioner and even for Revenue itself, that is, a similar collection of Acts relating to corresponding procedures, which, as the Minister knows very well, is a comparatively recent task but yet at the same time one in respect of which the various nuances and amendments of statutes <Col N="959" /> down through the years cause considerable trouble to all concerned, even to the members of his own Department and the Revenue Commissioners in their endeavours to collect them.  On this, too&mdash;perhaps I might leave it until we get to the Finance Bill, which I suppose we will probably be taking next week if it is issued to us in time&mdash; I might get some categorical announcement by the Minister in relation to the exact form in which he is going to deal with the change announced in the Budget that there will be no Schedule A or Schedule B tax for next year.  I do not know whether I should deal with it on the Estimate as such or on the Bill next week.  May I take it we will be seeing the Bill in the course of the next day or so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  It is cleared by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I suppose the printing of it must be something that is a matter of very short delay.  I am a little intrigued in relation to the Estimate itself as to why there is such a very large percentage increase under Subhead D, an increase of about 35 per cent.  I should have thought that the charge for security printing was something which would more or less flow from year to year without any very great variation.  The bill for the Revenue Commissioners is an extremely large one and at the same time, one which is, I have no doubt, necessary for the proper collection of taxes, but yet one which makes it clear that every possible opportunity should be taken to ensure that modern office methods are introduced into every section and not only into the central computer section in the Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember during the course of the year suggesting to the Minister that the test for the purchase of office machinery that was adopted by his Department was not the right test, that the test whether it was possible for the office to get on without the machinery was the test which had been laid down perhaps many years ago, but that the test should be not whether it is possible for the office to get on without the machinery but whether it could be more efficiently run with the machinery <Col N="960" /> in question.  One sees, going through governmental offices, from time to time, quite a considerable amount of manual totting and multiplication. That day is gone and should have been gone with the quill pen.  It is an utter waste of time and the only result is that the people having to do it are imbued with a sense of frustration and the taxpayer on the other side waiting for it feels, and correctly so, that this is an antiquated procedure.</P>
    <P>One can say that the most notable case of this is the Estate Duty Office.  I also raised with the Minister at the time it appeared, from what I could ascertain, that the Estate Duty Office were very short of staff and that in consequence, the delays in the office were quite extraordinary and were adding to the feeling of frustration that existed, as well as losing considerable moneys to the Minister, because after the lodgment of the accounting affidavit, many delays which occur in the office every day mean that the Minister is losing the use of the money and of course interest cannot possibly be charged to the taxpayer.  I understood also from the Budget Statement that we were to have about now a White Paper on TVA.  Presumably this will be produced by the Revenue Commissioners, and again this is a matter which me might hear about under the heading of this Vote.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints that the Revenue Commissioners have not made available to the taxpayers all the information, courtesy and reliefs to which the taxpayers are entitled.  I want to put it on record that this is not my experience.  One must expect naturally that a person who goes in to pay a tax bill which he does not think he should pay is probably not in the best of humour, but officials dealing with a person in that category must make allowances for the fact that none of us in any walk of life likes paying taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I shall deal with the matter of Subhead D. The increase of £6,430 in this Subhead is accounted for mainly by two items. The first is the provision of £2,000 for the printing by the recess process of a commemorative stamp by a commercial <Col N="961" /> firm.  There is another provision of £2,200 for the reconditioning of a rotary letterpress machine and the replacement of certain parts.  The balance is due to the provision for new engravings for the multi-commemorative stamp and other general increases in printing demands for 1968-69.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill will, I hope, be circulated fairly shortly.  I believe that the understanding is that we will be taking it next week.  The procedure we have in mind at the moment for dealing with the abolition of Schedule A and B tax is that the present Finance Bill will simply give statutory effect to the decision.  Assessments will not be raised under Schedule A and B from next year onwards.  Various tidyingsup will be necessary as a result and will be done, if possible, in a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill in the autumn and, if not, in next year's Finance Bill.  The actual abolition <i>in toto</i> of Schedules A and B and the consequential amendments necessary is a very tedious business, involving the examination of countless statutory provisions. We would not be able to have the full job carried out and incorporated in this Finance Bill but we would hope that all these consequential provisions will be included in a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman talked about the situation in regard to the computer.  As he is aware, the Revenue Commissioners replaced the original computer with a new and much more powerful installation which was delivered during the autumn of last year and has been in operation for some time now. The original computer was taken out of use at the end of January of this year.  Computer procedures are being extended to PAYE and to the annual preparation of certificates of tax-free allowances.  Also the payroll of the Revenue Commissioners' staff is being automated.  The result is that there have been teething troubles, and there still are unfortunately, although they are gradually being overcome.  It is true to say that at the moment they are a great deal fewer than they were. I hope it will not be very long until the full benefits of this computerisation <Col N="962" /> will be available to us, without any hitches or temporary sets-back.</P>
    <P>I know there have been complaints about the staffing position in the Estate Duty Branch.  As a result of queries raised here on a previous occasion, I called for a report on the position.  That report has now been completed and is under consideration. It will probably mean a re-organisation of the work there and, I hope, the introduction of a great deal more expedition into it.</P>
    <P>The final proofs of the proposed loose-leaf volume containing the Acts relating to death duties are now in the printers' hands and will, I hope, be available for the public within a couple of months at the latest.  The White Paper on TVA is also at printing stage. Again this is a question of trying to get it out as quickly as possible and having the various corrections made at proof stage for final printing.  We hope that will be very soon now.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimate, 1968-69. - Vote 10&mdash;Civil Service Commission.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £51,800 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Civil Service Commission and of the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on this.  As Deputies know, the purpose of this Estimate is to provide finance for two well-known and long-established bodies, the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.  The function of these two bodies is of importance in recruiting the necessary staff for the Civil Service and the local authority service.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, most permanent appointments to the Civil Service are made through the Civil Service Commission.  The Civil Service is growing in size, and this growth in size is due to the development of the demands made on the public service by all the different sections of the community. This, of course, means that recruitment to the Service continues to increase. In fact, we are now making appointments to the Civil Service at the rate of 3,000 a year, so the Civil Service Commission has to process an increasing number of applications annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The written tests now involve the correction of the papers of 11,000 or 12,000 applicants, and the interview boards have to deal with about 4,500 applicants every year.  This throws an increasing burden on the Commission. That work, I think, will continue to grow as a result of some decisions I have recently taken on behalf of our young people who are interested in applying for Civil Service posts.  I mentioned some of these decisions in the Budget Statement.  I indicated on that occasion that entrance fees have been abolished since 1st June, 1968.  Fees for <Col N="964" /> the medical examination of candidates are also on the way out.  I am sure these steps will be welcomed by parents of schoolchildren who are looking to the Civil Service for their careers.  We are also making the following improvements: there will be visits on a wider scale to schools and universities by the staff of the Commission and, in some instances, indeed, by the staff of my Department to tell young people about the Civil Service and the careers in it; there will be attractive brochures about the competitions to be held; and we shall revise and improve the format of advertisements and make, I hope, better arrangements for the reception of the general public when they call to the Commission's officers.</P>
    <P>Efforts are also being made to ensure that the interval between the examination and the publication of the results is a great deal shorter than it has been up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All these innovations will, I hope, result in a greater number of applications for posts in the Civil Service.  While they involve some extra expense, I am quite satisfied the extra expense will be well worth while.</P>
      <P>As I am talking about this matter, I should like to say a special word of thanks to all who assist the Civil Service Commission in discharging their functions.  Two groups, in particular, deserve praise in this respect&mdash;(1) the teachers who prepare the students for the examinations and (2) those many citizens who give of their time freely as members of the different interview boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am a little surprised to hear a Minister for Finance boast that he is taking 3,000 people a year into the Civil Service when I remember, particularly, the Minister's predecessor, in 1957, during the period of office of a Fianna Fáil Government, telling the House solemnly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in-take.  It is not a gross increase.  People are going out at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="965" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know; I am coming to that.  I am not suggesting the Civil Service is growing at the rate of 3,000 a year.  The country can stand a lot from Fianna Fáil but it could not stand that.  I remember that, in 1957, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan&mdash;now Senator Ryan&mdash;came into this House and, with a flourish of trumpets, told us he would streamline the Civil Service and that we should have a complete El Dorado of governmental administration: of course, we could not possibly afford the number of civil servants we then had and of course the number could and would be brought down.</P>
      <P>Time has passed and there has been a variety of Ministers for Finance over there.  I think, without exception, in the reign of each one of them, in the period each one of them was in office, the number of civil servants has grown year by year.  I have not seen the result of the last count of civil servants on 31st December last: I am sure the Minister has the information.  He talks of an in-take of 3,000 civil servants. Perhaps he will tell us, for example, the number going out in the past year so that we can see how much of the number was an increase, as apart from a mere replacement.</P>
      <P>I am a little surprised by the Minister's suggestion that the staff of the Department of Finance will give lectures on the Civil Service in schools. Without question, that is an innovation and I am not at all sure I like it.  It may tend to detract from the apparent impartiality of the Commission itself. Where there is any necessity for the publication of openings and for the dissemination of information about careers, and so on, I think the Commission more properly should do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have travelled a long way since the time the inception and institution of the Civil Service Commission was bitterly opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party 40 years ago.  We are all glad they have grown up and educated themselves and been educated during that period.  It is undesirable that anything be done that would give any impression, however remote, that the Civil Service Commission are not away and apart from ordinary departmental activities.  Therefore, I dislike the idea <Col N="966" /> the Minister has just indicated as an innovation.</P>
    <P>It is highly desirable that the time between examinations and the publication of results be cut down as much as possible.  I am very glad indeed to hear from the Minister that it is hoped to make that time very much shorter.  I wonder if he is in a position to give the House any information on the average period involved and by how much he hopes to cut that average period with the new arrangements he has suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 3,000 which I mentioned by way of interjection represents gross in-take into the Civil Service in a year.  Of course, that has to be counterbalanced by retirements, resignations, and so on.  I think the best thing I can do to help here is to give figures of total Civil Service numbers on 1st January in a number of recent years and indicate what increase in total numbers they represent.</P>
      <P Just="Center">1st January, 1963&mdash;29,728.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they include temporary postmen, and so on&mdash;the total Civil Service.  I am speaking of 1st January in each case:</P>
      <P>1964&mdash;30,383, representing an increase of 655.</P>
      <P>1965&mdash;31,675, representing an increase of 1,292.</P>
      <P>1966&mdash;32,609, representing an increase of 934.</P>
      <P>1967&mdash;32,965, representing an increase of 356.</P>
      <P>At 1st January, 1968, there were 33,688, which represented an increase of 723 on the total at the same date in the previous year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Something like that, yes.  I do not think Deputy Sweetman need be worried about the question of members of my Department attempting <Col N="967" /> to promote recruitment to the Civil Service.  I think this will become a problem for us in the years ahead.  The old procedure under which the brightest students in the school automatically opted for the Civil Service is gone and we now shall have to try to attract people to apply for Civil Service posts at all levels.  There are some very critical situations regarding recruitment at different levels already and it is clear that this is the sort of problem that will become more and more accentuated.</P>
      <P>I recently attended a school debate where a civil servant, I think a member of the staff of the Department of Finance, was present at the invitation of the school and he gave an excellent discourse on the Civil Service as a career and the opportunities it offered.  I thought this was a very good thing.  What I did say was that visits by the staff of my Department are, I think, in the main, usually confined to the universities.  I think members of the staff of the Department of Finance have always gone to the universities in this connection.</P>

      <P>I have a note of it here.  Pensioners who retired before 1st November, 1961, which was the date of the eighth round pay rise, now have pensions based on not less than the seventh round pay&mdash;that was on 15th December, 1959&mdash;generally plus 28.24 per cent.  Those who retired after that date of 1st November, 1961, have, in general, pensions based on not less than the eighth pay round plus 22 per cent.  A further 5 per cent is being given to these categories with effect from 1st August next.  That is the 5 per cent mentioned in the Budget.  That means that from next August pre-November, 1961, pensioners will have pensions based on seventh round pay plus 35 per cent and those who went out after that date will, in general, have pensions on the eighth round pay plus 28 per cent.  I just cannot relate that to the cost of living increases at the moment.</P>

      <P>I mentioned on another occasion to the Minister the desirability of resurveying many parts of the country particularly those on the outskirts of towns because the Ordnance Survey maps are, in very many instances, entirely out of date.  I hope that the increases there are in subheads (a) and (b) of this Vote mean that there will be a further improvement in that respect.  I understand the position is that facilities for storage of ordnance maps at the Government Publications offices are such that they are unable to keep any stock other than one copy of each map.  That is unsatisfactory and certainly it is unsatisfactory when it means, as I understand it does, a couple of days between ordering and delivery.  I suggest there should be some better sales arrangement as regards stocks and some better provision or if that is not possible at the premises concerned that there would be at least arrangements so that there could be deliveries with telephone orders from the Park down to the Government Publications Office in a matter of a half day.  To have to wait when maps are required urgently is not satisfactory, as I think the Minister will himself readily admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also includes the Valuation Office.  I wonder are we satisfied that the procedures adopted in that Office are the best from an office efficiency point of view.  I am thinking particularly of inspections and so forth. I must say again, as I said in relation to the Revenue Commissioners, that I find the greatest courtesy from the officials in that respect but I am not <Col N="972" /> too happy that the procedure laid down by the Commissioner is appropriate to 1968.  It might be desirable that this Office would be one of those that will be examined from an O. &amp; M. point of view.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the provision of large-scale maps is that this is done on the basis of selected areas, and the last area to be provided was County Carlow, which was completed in 1965.  The revision of Dublin City and County commenced in 1966.  County Dublin will be completed early in 1969, and Dublin city is expected to take at least four years from now to complete.  In regard to Deputy Sweetman's constituency, I do not think we can hold out much hope of County Kildare for some time yet.  I will look into the other point he mentioned about the availability of maps and also the organisation of the Valuation Office. We are not sure how much we have advanced with it but we have had work initiated on the consolidation and perhaps modernisation of the Valuation statutes.  The work of the Office could also be looked at in connection with that.</P>

      <P>The position is that if premises were rented to a private person and then a Government service took over those premises, then the rates are payable, not as they had been, on the premises but on the rent, and the person who received the rent is, in consequence, at a very great loss.  This is a problem that I know has been considered for some time in the Department. I was wondering whether any progress towards the settlement of a very thorny problem had been made.</P>

    <P>Under this heading we are seeking the approval of the Dáil for increases in public service pensions, including military service pensions and special <Col N="974" /> allowances with effect from 1st August, 1968.  As Deputies know, in the Budget Statement we undertook to increase all public service pensions by five per cent. The actual cost in the current year is expected to be £223,000.  In the Budget speech I mentioned £200,000, but the more detailed calculations which have been made since then indicate that this increase will require £223,000.  The main classes of pensions concerned are those of former civil servants, national teachers, and so on.  As regards increasing local authority pensions, part of that cost will fall on the Exchequer, but the Estimate contains only a token provision of £10, as it is not expected that any claim will be presented by local authorities before the end of this financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is always a possibility.  I wish to say a few words by way of explanation of this additional Estimate.  Deputies may recall that the then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, when replying to the debate on the Estimate for his Department on 1st July, 1964, gave the Dáil an assurance that the writing-off of the accumulated losses of the Industrial Engineering Company Ltd., Dundalk, would, in due course, be brought to the notice of the House.  This Estimate <Col N="975" /> has been introduced in fulfilment of that undertaking and to enable me to relieve the Industrial Credit Company of its liabilities to the Central Fund in respect of advances made to the Credit Company for re-investment, on behalf of the Government, in the Dundalk company.  The advances to be written off are £3,273,115 that is, the total Industrial Credit Company investment in the Engineering Company.  All this amount has not been lost, however.</P>
      <P>Three of the main subsidiaries of the Industrial Engineering Company Ltd. have been sold.  One of them, Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd., has been purchased by the S and S Corrugated Paper Machinery Company of New York and two others, Commercial Road Vehicles Ltd. and Agrotiller Ltd., by a group led by Mr. Ivan McCulloch of Dundalk.  These sales, together with the proceeds of the disposal of the remaining assets of the group, are expected to realise about £626,000 so that the net loss on the Dundalk investment after the realisation of all the assets will be approximately £2.65 million.  The exact amount of the loss will not be ascertainable until some of the remaining assets can be realised, nor will the total purchase price be paid at once.  In order, however, to enable the Industrial Credit Company to discharge the Central Fund liabilities it has incurred on behalf of the Government in respect of Dundalk, I propose at this appropriate stage to make it a grant equal to its total investment in the Industrial Engineering Company, that is £3,273,115.  Industrial Credit will use this grant to reduce its debt to the Exchequer by an equal amount and will write down its Dundalk investment which will then disappear from its accounts.  The debentures which the Credit Company holds in respect of purchase moneys outstanding will be transferred to me.</P>

      <P>As these moneys are paid, the corresponding debentures will be written down.  For the benefit of <Col N="976" /> Deputies who may not be familiar with the history of the Dundalk undertaking, I propose to explain the background very briefly.  In order to mitigate the threat of very serious unemployment in Dundalk on the termination of the Great Northern Railway Company's services, the Government decided in August 1957 to set up a company to be known as Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd. to promote alternative industrial activities and manufacturing processes at the former railway engineering workshops at Dundalk.</P>

      <P>I am really only going into the history of the undertaking and it is not really essential from the point of view of what we are discussing.  All we propose here is to write off, as far as the Industrial Credit Company is concerned, its full investment in the Dundalk Engineering Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I am obliged to the Minister for a copy of his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall proceed with the history of these events.  I mentioned that the Government decided to set up the Dundalk Engineering Works Limited to promote alternative industrial activities and manufacturing processes at the former railway engineering workshops at Dundalk. This was an interim arrangement. Towards the end of 1958, permanent arrangements were completed.  These provided for the establishment of a public holding company, independent of direct State control, to be known as the Industrial Engineering Company Ltd., with five wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiaries, also public companies. Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd. became one of the five subsidiaries <Col N="977" /> and ceased to be a State company.</P>
      <P>The GNR Engineering Workshops at Dundalk had for many years employed about a thousand men, which was a substantial factor in the economic existence of a town of 20,000 people. The Board of the Industrial Engineering Company was faced with the formidable tasks of devising new programmes capable of employing large numbers of men, of converting the character of the workshops to a commercial basis and re-training the staff to fit them for entirely new engineering techniques. The desirability of avoiding prolonged breaks in the continuity of employment added to the difficulties of the situation.</P>
      <P>The principal activities undertaken by the company and its five manufacturing subsidiaries were engineering, foundry work, assembly of commercial road vehicles and caravans, the manufacture of rotary cultivators, Agrotillers, and, for a short time, of Heinkel cars.  It was hoped that with the development of the group of companies at Dundalk, ownership would eventually pass to the private sector of the economy through a public issue of shares.  In fact this never proved feasible as the group consistently incurred losses and the venture was financed almost entirely by the Exchequer through the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the companies succeeded in winning valuable orders in the face of stiff competition on the home and export markets but they were unable to attract sufficient new business to earn profits.  During 1961 a new group management and technical team were recruited who, with the aid of consultants, re-organised the enterprise.  Despite these measures, losses persisted and it became increasingly clear that the Dundalk complex could never become viable as then organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government then decided that a Receiver should be appointed to carry on the business of the group with a view to the sale of the company and its subsidiaries as going concerns.  Mr. <Col N="978" /> Niall Crowley was appointed Receiver by the Industrial Credit Company, the debenture holders, in February, 1966. The Receiver was empowered to reorganise the activities of the companies so as to render them more saleable.  Additional Exchequer funds were made available to him for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Efforts to dispose of the group were not assisted initially by the restrictions on credit which were severe in 1966 in Europe and the USA.  However, a substantial number of inquiries continued to be received.  Many of these inquiries were tentative but a number of firm offers emerged.  Besides the price factor, I gave considerable weight, in considering the offers made, to the probabilities of the individual bidders being likely to run the companies successfully and so to secure the maximum continuity of employment&mdash;if not increased employment&mdash;in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>By these standards, the offers by a group led by Mr. I. McCulloch for Commercial Road Vehicles Limited and Agrotiller Ltd., and by S and S Corrugated Paper Machinery Company of New York for Dundalk Engineering Works Limited were the most attractive. The plans of these concerns offered the best prospects of continuity and are indeed expected to lead to an increase in the level of employment within the next couple of years.  As I announced on 2nd May, these offers have been accepted and the three companies have been sold to Mr. McCulloch's group and to the S and S Company.</P>
    <P>As I explained at the outset, the purpose of the Estimate is to enable the Industrial Credit Company to be relieved of its investment in the Industrial Engineering Company Limited and to bring accumulated losses of the latter company to the notice of the Dáil.  I would like to make it clear that no net cash transaction is involved as the grant will be used immediately by the Credit Company to repay an equivalent amount of Exchequer advances.  I, therefore, recommend the Estimate for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very large sum, and although I accept and understand <Col N="979" /> what is involved in this Supplementary Estimate, at the same time it is almost the final chapter in the provision of a payment by the taxpayer of £2,650,000 which has gone down the drain.  That is a serious matter at any time but I can remember when this matter first became urgent with the closing of the railway engineering works of the Great Northern Railway at Dundalk and the suggestions which were then made for the amelioration of conditions for the men employed. Everyone of us on every side of the House was in favour of steps being taken, on the one hand, to preserve their employment and on the other, to provide alternative employment.  Many of us felt the steps that were being taken by the Government at that time were the wrong steps; yet we were equally emphatic that for the sake of those people and the town of Dundalk it was essential that proper steps be taken which would mean the establishment of a permanent basis of employment in Dundalk, as apart from merely temporary relief.</P>
      <P>The views that were expressed at that time from this side of the House were grossly misinterpreted and twisted by various members of Fianna Fáil.  The fact that we were right and the Government Party were wrong is proved by this Estimate.  I am disappointed that the Minister has given us no assessment of the employment content that will be involved; the House is entitled to receive some estimate from the Minister in that respect, as well as some breakdown of individual items, to which I shall refer in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on 6th June last, Deputy Donegan asked the Minister a question at column 689; there is an error in it.  It is stated that the debentures are in the name of the Industrial Engineering Company.  That is wrong; they are in the name of the Industrial Credit Company and it is because they are that this Estimate has been introduced. The debentures were given by the Industrial Engineering Company to the Industrial Credit Corporation and are in the name of the latter, not in the name of the company creating <Col N="980" /> them.  If they were in the name of the company creating them, there would be no necessity for this Estimate to ease the title transactions.  This may be a printing error.  It is not all that important, but it is just as well the record should be put right on revision.</P>
    <P>Many of the activities undertaken were undertaken with enthusiasm but, until recently, until before the appointment of the Receiver, the paramount cause of the failure of these several undertakings was at management level and the Government must take responsibility for that.  The initial arrangements made by the Government were not commercial arrangements.  They were political arrangements and it is because the Government were in the beginning endeavouring to play politics that £2,600,000 of the taxpayers' money has gone down the drain.  If a proper commercial set-up had been completed at an earlier stage and if, in fact, Mr. Grace had been given a free hand at an earlier stage to organise the company on a purely commercial basis, we would not be witnessing today the very large loss of public money involved. We all accept that it was undoubtedly necessary that some public money would be expended without any hope of subsequent recoupment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs must take a very large share of the blame for this.  It was an operation that was dealt with, as I say, under the cloak of the Industrial Credit Corporation and in a manner that was, in fact, purely political.  I am right, I think, in saying that it was the experience in Dundalk that was one of the main reasons for the institution of Taiscí Stáit.  If that be so, we have at least got something out of the experience, though it was experience pretty dearly bought.  I am sure the Minister has the breakdown of the loss involved between the five manufacturing subsidiaries. It is desirable that that breakdown should be put on the records of the House before the money is voted to-day.</P>
    <P>As I said, there were 1,000 men employed and the fact that the works were going to fold-up over night would mean very great hardship for 1,000 families in Dundalk.  It was right and <Col N="981" /> proper, therefore, that steps should be taken.  The only tragedy is that the wrong steps were taken in the beginning. We hope now that these will be put on a permanent basis.  It is appropriate that the Minister should give us now some indication of the employment content, particularly male employment, as visualised by the companies in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Since the Receiver was appointed, I do not know whether any people have been employed there, other than on a care and maintenance basis.  If there are, is it clear that they will retain their employment and will be taken over by the new concerns?  Finally, when does the Minister hope the final disposal and the detailed arrangements to which he referred will be concluded?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully </NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very substantial amount of money and, while we all agree something had to be done to try to keep the very substantial employment going there, nevertheless we also believe that the wrong steps were taken.  For quite some time, I and my Party have been advocating State intervention in matters of this kind and the establishment of State-run industries where private enterprise falls down on the job.  In this particular case, we seem to have the worst of both worlds.  The companies were set up in such a way that one did not lose money: one appeared to have made money but the remainder seem to have fallen down very badly.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether or not it is true that one of the companies to which the product was being supplied for distribution was, in fact, making money while the others were losing money rapidly.  As far as Dundalk is concerned, the result has been that Dundalk has been hammered, not for the first time and probably not for the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of male employment had serious repercussions.  A number of skilled tradesmen left following the closing down.  When an effort was made to try to pick up the pieces, untrained employees were taken on, but a number of trained personnel returned to work and they subsequently <Col N="982" /> found themselves on the labour exchange and they also left Dundalk.  It has been a severe blow to a thriving town and, so far, nothing has replaced it.  The closing of the boot factory last year added insult to injury. I am not blaming the Minister for Finance.  He cannot wave a wand and solve all these problems overnight. There was no proper planning.  Do not let anybody tell me that because it happened so quickly, nobody knew what was going to happen.  Everybody should have known that the GNR works were going to close down and proper planning should have taken place before they closed down.</P>
    <P>It was not necessary to concentrate on the type of work done in Dundalk. The most severe blow was given by reason of the failure of these companies to carry on and the substantial loss of money involved.  When the boot factory subsequently closed down, instead of attempting to find an industry which would have taken over at that stage and making available a sum which would have represented not very much more money to keep it going, the company simply gave a handout to the employees and said: &ldquo;We are very sorry but here are a few pounds to take you to England.&rdquo;  That was the most serious blow.  The Government should not adopt that type of procedure again but should try to recreate employment.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, I would be anxious to know how soon it is likely that employment will restart; how many people are likely to be employed. I am sick and tired of listening to talk&mdash;it used to be by the Minister for Industry and Commerce but it is now by the Minister for Labour&mdash; about potential employment.  Usually, the potential is given at not less than 500.  After 12 months, we find that in a great many cases the 500 has still one nought missing and the position does not seem to get any better.  If the people who have taken over in Dundalk are giving employment, it is important that those who live in the area who are leaving school should know whether or not there are employment prospects for them.  I am near enough to the area to be interested <Col N="983" /> in what is happening and if the Minister for Local Government is right, I might be more interested later on.  Whatever is done, an attempt should be made to encourage the employment of male labour there rather than of young girls whose employment does not add as much to the economy as does the employment of male labour.  If the Minister can give any information on that point, I should be very glad to have it.  The potential is, I suppose, the best he could give now but I should like the approximate date of restarting.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether or not Dundalk could not have been treated as Shannon is being treated at present, as an industrial estate.  Perhaps the idea had not been accepted by the Government at the time as being the proper thing to do.  Dundalk is mainly a working-class town, and because it is so near a port and beside the Border, there was very great potential if there had been proper planning.  Is it too late now to ask the Minister, in any future development of industry, to recommend to his colleagues that Dundalk should not be forgotten?  To do what we are doing here, namely, writing off a very substantial sum of money, is likely to have the effect that it will be said: &ldquo;We failed there before and should not get our fingers burned again.&rdquo;  I would hate to see that sort of thing happening.  As to the amount of money received, the difference seems to be pretty small&mdash; less than three-quarters of a million pounds.  This is a very substantial undertaking.  Would the Minister say if this is absolutely the best that could be got?  I was under the impression that the property was valued at very much more than that.</P>

      <P>Public time, public money, national effort are all being dissipated by a terribly useless and dangerous exercise in relation to the electoral system which has the poor Minister for Finance so fatigued that he cannot answer a simple sum in arithmetic posed by Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue we have to consider today is whether or not blame is to be laid at the door of the Government for the arrangements which they made in Dundalk which have resulted in a loss of over £2½ million to the taxpayer. There is a tendency, whenever criticism is made of an enterprise that has suffered loss, to say that it is justified because it must be taken in the context of all industrial investment and that one must accept losses if one is prepared to accept that risks must be taken to achieve success.  That is all right as a general argument but it is not an answer when we are obliged to consider the operations of a particular concern. It is no answer for the directors of the company to say to its shareholders at the annual meeting that they should not be blamed for their failure because other companies have operated successfully either in the same or some other field.  The simple truth of the matter is, as Deputy Sweetman said, the Dundalk arrangement began as a political <Col N="985" /> gimmick and it was extremely badly managed in the critical years when it could have been put on the right tracks, and by the time steps were taken to replace the inefficient directorate, which had been appointed by the Government, by people who could do something about it, it was too late to plug the holes in the sinking ship.  The result is this colossal loss for some terrible blunders made by the Government in the people that they selected as managers and the mistakes made by those managers.</P>
    <P>The town of Dundalk and the people of Dundalk are to be praised that, notwithstanding the several body blows that industry in Dundalk has suffered over the years, they have succeeded in maintaining a reasonable degree of industry and commercial activity in that town.  Dundalk deserves a great deal better than it receives from the Government and from the managers appointed by the Government.  One would fear, however, that one of the trends in our industrial activity in recent years has been to grasp at the tailend of certain runs of industrial production.  We have had it in relation to some electrical equipment; we have had it in relation to oil heaters; we have had it in relation to bubble cars in Dundalk.  It is quite extraordinary that several large industries which are worldwide, several large industries whose financial worth is established, have declined to come into this State, even after exploring the possibilities, and have established themselves, instead, on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>There are several modern industries which are commencing new lines of industrial production.  I do not want to name any particular firms because they may have their own reasons for not coming here; I do not know what they are.  I think it fair to say here that there must be something radically wrong with our programme of industrial development when some of the large concerns which have built industrial empires now in the six northern counties did not come here.  When we compare that with the fact that we did invite in here and give public money to several industries which were at the end of their period <Col N="986" /> of growth we must be very concerend.</P>
    <P>We are also keenly aware of the fact that many long-established Irish industries have been unable to get assistance. That may be because they were not in a position to export as much as would be hoped for.  But it seems to us it would be preferable to give assistance to people who have their roots in Ireland and owe their loyalty to this country rather than to people who come in from abroad with an anxiety apparently to answer their own immediate production problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me this is more appropriate to the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because we did not consider these matters carefully enough in relation to Dundalk that we ran into the trouble we did.  Because we regarded the production of bubble cars as the answer to the need to provide employment for 1,000 people in Dundalk, we ran into the trouble we did.  If there had been thorough market research, it would have established that the day of the bubble car was coming to an end.  The production of these cars was fair enough as an <i>ad interim</i> arrangement.  Unfortunately, what happened was that a few temporary expedients like that were accepted as a long-term solution.  When they were operating, steps were not taken to provide something more worthwhile on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>This is a very disappointing result for the immense public investment and hope put into this company.  If it is to be of any value, it must be taken as a lesson to the nation of what is not to occur in future.  We must ensure that never again will Dáil Éireann be asked to pardon people for mistakes costing £2½ million.  People who have been responsible for mistakes of that kind, be they either in Government or in management appointed by the Government, deserve to be censured and censured severely.  These losses should have been anticipated and avoided. The fact that the Government did not take remedial steps in time is something in relation to which they should be censured.</P>

      <P>First of all, I shall deal with the last query raised by Deputy Sweetman, who asked me to reconcile figures given in reply to a Parliamentary Question and the figures I have given now.  I indicated that the indebtedness of the Dundalk Engineering Company to the Industrial Credit Company at 31st October, 1967, was £2,613,599.  That figure can be reconciled with the figure I am giving to-day by the addition of the following: first, since 31st October, 1967, there have been additional advances of £175,000 and there is also a figure for share capital invested by the Industrial Credit Company in the Engineering Company of £484,516.  Add these to the figure I gave and you get the figure we are dealing with to-day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully suggested that the amounts which have been salvaged from the wreck are disappointing.  Of course, I must agree.  I want to assure him that in all these negotiations and discussions, I gave a directive that the important thing was to try to ensure continuity in the expansion of employment and that, if it were to be a choice between getting a better offer for the assets or the possibility of a more viable enterprise in the future, we were to opt for the latter.</P>

      <P>Or to sell them off at scrap value.  The whole emphasis in the negotiations and discussions was on continuing the enterprises and making them as viable as possible.  At present there are about 340 people employed there, divided evenly between the enterprises taken over by the S and S Company and the McCulloch Group.  There are 170 in each of these two different factories. The S and S Company hope that within a period of 18 months, the 170 they are employing will have expanded to about 250.  The McCulloch Group hope to expand the 170 they are employing to 220 over a period of two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The next query put to me was the question of dividing up the money between the various companies.  Perhaps I had better repeat again the make-up of the totality in Dundalk.  First, the Dundalk Engineering Company Limited, which carried out medium to heavy contract engineering work, has now been sold to the S and S Corrugated Paper Machinery Company Limited.  Then Commercial Road Vehicles Limited which assembles heavey commercial road vehicles, does specialised body building and diesel engine overhauls is being sold to the McCulloch Group.  Then there is Agrotiller Limited, a company which manufactures Agrotiller farm machinery. It also has been sold to the McCulloch Group.  Then there is Dealgan Steel Founders Limited, a steel foundary which is out of production. Its assets are being disposed of on a break-up basis.  Then Heinkel Cabin Cruisers Limited, which assembled cars and has been out of production since 1961.  That company has been sold to the McCulloch Group.  These are the five companies and what is happening to them.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Sweetman will appreciate that where you have this sort of situation with five companies, a holding company and common management there is a certain amount of administrative expenses common to the whole five and it is difficult to allocate the losses on any sort of exact basis.  To try and help I give the following figures.  The last audited accounts we have for the different companies are those at 31st March, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going back to the last firm figures we have.  At that stage the total losses of all the companies amounted to £1,842,000.  Of this the Industrial Engineering Company accounted for £309,000, the Dealgan Steel Company, £354,000, CRV £60,000, the Engineering Company, £465,000, the Heinkel Scooter Company, £566,000, and the Agrotiller Company, £86,000.  I am giving these figures as a sort of rough guide to the scope of the losses involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister cannot break it down exactly between each company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The losses since then have been a further £470,000 in total. On the general question, I do not suppose any of us would regard what happened in Dundalk, or the final outcome, as satisfactory.  I can only say with regard to the accusations made that all the Government were concerned with at any time was to endeavour to provide continuing employment for the people who were looking to this complex for their livelihood.  Every effort was made, so <Col N="990" /> far as the Government could make an effort, to ensure that this enterprise would continue to be successful and provide employment for those involved.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, certain limited successes were achieved by the management at different times but, on the whole, the enterprises could not continue as viable entities, and we arrived at the position which we have today.  We sought to carry on the divisions of this complex which were capable of being carried on and hand them over to people who, in our judgment, were capable of making a success of them and providing increasing employment there.  With regard to the other sections, we had to cut our losses and write off the amount concerned.  The Government made a determined and sincere effort to look after people concerned in those enterprises.  It can be said that at any rate the Government did not let these enterprises go to the wall through lack of any willingness to help and provide money.  The resources of the Exchequer were mobilised to ensure that every possible attempt would be made to keep as much employment as possible in existence in Dundalk.  That is why we are faced with the write off of this loss today.</P>
      <P>The only criticism that can be made of the Government is that in their anxiety to help to maintain employment in Dundalk, they were perhaps more generous than they might have been.  The only criticism that can be made of the Government in regard to this whole affair is that they were determined that in no circumstances would the enterprises be allowed to fail simply because of lack of resources. If you like, perhaps we tried too hard to ensure that the enterprises would be kept going.  In all these matters, the Government have to face difficult decisions.  It would be very easy to be ruthless and say: &ldquo;Close the thing down.  Throw the people out of employment.  We are not spending any more money.&rdquo;  That is what Mr. McGilligan did on a famous occasion when he closed down a whole lot of enterprises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; because that was the way he looked at things.  We look at them in a different way.  We think that to the greatest extent possible at any rate the Exchequer should be available to try to ensure that anything with any chance of survival gets a chance to survive.  That is what the Government tried to do over the years in Dundalk and continue to do.  If we had been coldly calculating and looking at this from the purely financial aspect, we could perhaps have sold various things and got a little more money for them. That was not what we did.  We tried, as I said to Deputy Tully, to err on the side of more employment and continuing economic activity in the future.</P>

      <P>Although representations have been made by Bord Fáilte to the Burns and Laird Company, I understand that there is no prospect that the company will resume passenger shipping services between Glasgow and Derry or Donegal.  As I explained in reply to previous questions by the Deputy on this subject, the shipping company found itself unable to continue the Glasgow-Derry service for economic reasons.  I understand that <Col N="997" /> the alternative services between Glasgow and Donegal via the short sea routes are operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The general trend in cross-channel shipping is against the low-standard multi-purpose ship carrying livestock and general freight as well as passengers and cars.  The present trend is towards modern drive-on/drive-off car ferry vessels capable of a quick turn-round and high utilisation.  There is no likelihood of a reversal of this trend.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.  The matter of regular air services to and from County Donegal is one for commercial enterprise.  I understand that since April this year Ulster Air Transport Ltd. are operating an air service daily, except Sunday, from Eglinton, near Derry, to Glasgow, providing 32-36 passenger seats.  Over the past few years two companies were authorised to operate air services between Dublin and St. Angelo, Enniskillen, but these did not materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the considerable exchequer investment in our existing three airports, I would have to find convincing evidence of worthwhile results before considering capital investment in another large scale airport whether north or south.  I am always prepared <Col N="1000" /> otherwise to support local effort and in the case of the provision of aerodrome facilities in County Donegal, to give technical advice.  Subject to certain safeguards, some financial assistance could also be available.</P>
    <P>As regards assistance from Bord Fáilte, I am informed that they will look sympathetically at any new service to Donegal likely to pay its way and be of benefit to tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture was flown back to Dublin a fortnight ago by a firm which is anxious to set up something to solve the transport problem in Donegal, would the Minister be serious about this?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Minister to be serious about this and enter into discussions with the people who are operating the service from Ballykelly to Glasgow? Donegal is being isolated and, in my opinion, the Government think it is not in the 26 Counties at all or that it has disappeared.</P>

    <P>The Ballydehob-Dunbeacon area is in the Board's Schull rural area.  The Board carried out a preliminary canvass there earlier this year.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy was informed on 17th November, 1966, the extension of the main electricity supply to Cape Clear island would be extremely costly. <Col N="1003" /> Even under the new rural electrification arrangements announced last month, householders would have to be asked to pay very high special service charges.</P>

A major trunk cable which is planned for this route is expected to be completed within three years.  In the meantime every effort will be made to improve the service on the existing route.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the desirability of having self-feed silage units erected on every farm in the country in order to feed dairy cows properly during the winter and also in order that cattle can be fit for sale in the spring when the price is reasonably good and not have, as very frequently happens, a glut in the autumn?  Is the Minister aware that only a very small fraction of farmers, especially small farmers, have self-feed units, and would he be prepared to give a higher grant to farmers under a certain valuation to encourage them to erect these self-feed silage units?</P>

As regards differentiating in favour of the small farmer, this is a matter which is not new to me, and if the opportunity arises and it is the proper thing to do, there will be nobody to do it quicker than I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey undertaken by my Department has shown that, with the exception of a few isolated pockets, the number of cattle affected with warbles is very low.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, arrangements are in operation under which free treatment is available for all affected animals reported to my Department. In the circumstances and having regard to the danger that a resumption of general dressing might result in the development of a warble fly resistant to the dressing, I do not consider that the dressing of the entire national herd this year is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is really the loophole the Deputy would appear to think it is.  If the cattle that are exposed for sale show an incidence of warble fly infestation, then it can be taken that that reflects the general infestation that may exist.  It is the only true guide we can accept.  I do believe that the progress made has been sufficiently satisfactory, having regard to the fact that 97 per cent of the national herd is free and has been seen to be free for the past couple of years.  To insist on dressing in an attempt to deal with the other three per cent does not make sense, seeing that we could, by overdressing and continuance of dressing, breed a fly resistant to the dressing, which would leave us in a worse position than the first.  Together with that, we took the precaution of making available dressings free to those who report instances of infestation in their herds.  This is the manner in which we feel this disease can be kept under control in the future.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties for those herdowners outside the clearance area who find that they have brucellosis infection in their herds. While my Department has been examining the prospects of giving some assistance in disposing of infected animals for slaughter, it has not yet been found possible to devise a practicable scheme.</P>
      <P>The Brucellosis (Certified) Herds Scheme is at present open to herdowners whose herds have been tested and found free of the disease.  Once a herd is accepted under the scheme all further testing is free and any reactor discovered is taken up at full market value for slaughter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The premature introduction of eradication measures in the south would not only be extremely costly but would cause serious inconvenience to herdowners. This is because of the widespread use of live vaccine there in recent years and the consequent impossibility of deciding whether an animal <Col N="1009" /> reacting to the test has the disease or is reacting only because of the use of live vaccine.  This major difficulty will of course pass over the next few years and in the meantime I am considering the possibility of arrangements to encourage the use of the new &ldquo;killed&rdquo; vaccine on breeding heifers which does not produce the reaction to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government on what authority and for what reasons Dublin Corporation imposed a 7s 6d per week rent retrospectively in respect of sub-tenants living in corporation houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority for the charge to which the Deputy refers is section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966. Prior to the making of the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967, on 13th April, 1967, a tenant of a local authority dwelling who kept a sub-tenant in the dwelling was acting illegally and stood in danger of having his tenancy terminated.  Under Article 6 of these Regulations, a tenant is permitted to keep a sub-tenant, but in order to ensure proper control and to prevent housing estates built up at such cost from deteriorating into new slums through overcrowding or other abuses, the consent of the local authority is required.</P>
      <P>By circular letter H.5/67 of 14th April, 1967, local authorities were advised to make the consent the subject of an agreement between the authority and the tenant and that the terms of the agreement should provide for the payment by the tenant of a sum in addition to his ordinary rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation publicly announced and applied these arrangements in July, 1967 to sub-tenants and lodgers whose occupation commenced on or after 1st July, 1967.  The arrangements meant no change for tenants on differential rents to whom a similar <Col N="1012" /> charge had applied since the inception of the differential scheme in the early 1950s.  In the case of fixed rent tenants, however, the corporation applied a charge of the same general order as in the case of differential tenants, but in this case subject to a maximum rent of 7s 6d a week.  The charge applies only to sub-tenants and lodgers in the wage and salary earning category and does not apply to a tenant bringing dependants to live with him.</P>
    <P>I may add that the arrangement is associated with the new arrangements under which subsidy at the higher rate may be paid, on the usual terms, for the re-housing of corporation sub-tenants or lodgers.  Only houses provided for new sub-tenants or lodgers authorised not less than three years previously by the authority may normally qualify for this higher rate of subsidy.  It is, therefore, in the interest of every sub-tenant or lodger who thinks he will, at some time, be seeking a local authority house to ensure that his occupancy is authorised by the authority.</P>

      <P>The road to which the Deputy refers is a main road.  The formulation of proposals for execution under the annual Main Road Improvement Grants made available to Kerry County Council is a matter in the first instance for the local authority.  I understand that the local authority have at present no proposals for the widening and improvement works in question, having regard to the existence of more urgent works elsewhere in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether with reference to a reply of 8th May he will now state (a) the number of revisions of rateable valuations which have been made in Dublin city in the past year, (b) the number of such revisions which have been appealed against and (c) the total number of undetermined appeals, in view of the fact that this information has not been made public by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To put this matter in its proper setting, I should explain that revisions of valuations and determination of first appeals against valuations so revised, are the statutory responsibility of the Commissioner of Valuation, in which the Minister for Finance cannot interfere.  The respective rating authorities have a statutory responsibility to refer to the Commissioner each year the lists of properties made out by rate collectors and ratepayers as requiring revision of valuation and, subsequently, the notices of appeal against valuations so revised.  The rating authorities are also responsible under statute for the publication of the following relevant particulars:</P>
      <P>(i)  Lists of properties to be referred to the Commissioner as requiring revision of valuation; this is done in June each year.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Revised valuation lists made out by the Commissioner and showing the decisions resulting from (i); this is done in March of following year.</P>
      <P>(iii)  Lists of decisions by the Commissioner on appeals against revised valuations; no date is set by statute&mdash;they are now usually ready for publication in August or September each year but may be later in some districts.</P>
      <P>The Statute (section 21 Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852) enjoins that each list at (iii) should show all cases in a given district; there is no discretion to publish the decisions piecemeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should, therefore, not be necessary for the Minister for Finance to have to give details of such activities, <Col N="1028" /> since the local authorities are statutorily charged with the publication of information concerning them.  Such information will readily be made available to Deputies by the local authorities.</P>

These industries must obviously be subject to close revenue supervision.  The excise regulations do not, however, impede or prevent modern maintenance and technological development.</P>
      <P>A firm may have to seek the approval of the Revenue Commissioners before altering its methods of working or undertaking work of an experimental nature.

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1044" /> for Social Welfare if he is aware of the injustice and hardship being caused by the long delays in paying sickness benefits; and that these delays often range from four to six weeks; and if he will make arrangements to have such payments made in future at local level, instead of from his Department as happens in Sligo; and if he will have payments expedited.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are many families in my constituency, especially in the town of Sligo, who suffer grave hardship because of long delays in the payment of benefits?  This is a general matter.  It is general in my constituency and throughout the country, I think.  Is the Minister further aware that this hardship is especially felt in homes where there are young families and the where there is no money coming into the house for four to six weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that general statement as being correct at all.  The Deputy may know of individual cases where there are delays. On a number of occasions in recent weeks, I had a look at the overall situation in the Department.  Considering that we have 50,000 cases currently in payment at any particular time, that last year we issued 2¼ million cheques, and that the disbursal this year was almost £11 million, the number of delays is a very small percentage of the whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must appreciate that this is a problem.  In most of the cases in my experience, it is not the fault of the Department. There are unfortunate people who have not the ability to fill in the form correctly. When there is an omission or wrong information, the Department have to query it.  Would the Minister not consider designating somebody in the local employment exchange to assist <Col N="1045" /> these people?  There are people who are paid as single men who, in some cases, have a wife and maybe ten children. They omitted to reply to the question whether they are married or single, the number of children, and so on.  It is my experience in my constituency that it is usually the fault of the person who applies for the benefit.  Nevertheless, that does not get away from the problem.</P>

      <P>Sometimes a local representative claims he assists in the filling-up of the form, thereby expediting results.  While it is important to have the initial information properly detailed, the main delay is due to our not having an up-to-date record at the time the application comes in.  For instance, the card has not been surrendered, the books are not submitted. The only way we can verify this is to look at his record.  The employer may not have submitted it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to a report regarding <Col N="1047" /> pensions officers enforcing the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, on non-contributory old age pensioners and seeking to recoup overpayments made since 1962; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the reports in question.  They are obviously based on the fact that in a number of cases it was found that the pensioners had not reported increases in cash income but had continued to draw pension as if there had been no change in their means.  Under section 16 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, the claimant in such cases is liable to refund the difference between the amount of pension he received and what he would have got if he had reported the increase in means at the due time.  Each pensioner is notified of his liability to report any increase in cash income or property and the requirement is repeated on the cover of current pension books.</P>
      <P>There are certain misleading statements in the articles.  The overpayments were not due to mistakes made by the Department nor has there been any change in the official attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody likes to pay back something he has already got.  This involves the whole principle of means.  Unless we completely disregard the means test, we must pursue this matter in the way we do.  Only one person was mentioned in that particular report.  I examined the case and I must say I had not a lot of sympathy. The person concerned had a reasonably good amount of pension from the county council.  It was not dealt with in any way harshly whatever&mdash;except that he got every benefit within the statutory regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what old workings the Deputy has in mind.  I am, however, arranging to have a survey of disused workings in the area carried out with a view to having any of these shafts which may be found to be dangerous rendered safe.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; apart from the question of making them safe and finding out what is dangerous, in order to establish liability, it would be necessary to carry out this survey.  Some could be the responsibility of private <Col N="1053" /> owners and some could be the responsibility of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  We are talking about abandoned workings.  In some cases the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered to take steps to make them safe but he has not a statutory responsibility in that regard.  Apart from that, State responsibility could arise in the case of private ownership of some of these workings or in the case where the minerals are State owned, there could be statutory responsibility on the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a supplementary question?  I think I mentioned on a previous occasion&mdash;perhaps it was to the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;the peculiar problem that arises.  As we are catching up on the necessity for providing accommodation for mentally retarded children, the institutions available at present are extremely reluctant to accept children other than children in the four to six years category when they can be more readily adapted to institutional training.  There is a residue of children in the eight to 12 years group whom we have failed to accommodate and whom institutions are reluctant to receive, and who, if they become unmanageable, are in danger of finding themselves in mental hospitals.  The result is that there is accumulating a non-recurring number of children of between eight and 12 which special institutions for retarded children are profoundly reluctant to accept.  Would the Minister consider that anything could be done to persuade these institutions, in the light of the fact that it will be a non-recurring problem as we catch up on the demand for such accommodation, to take these children <Col N="1057" /> and so save them from being moved into mental hospitals when their families are no longer able to provide adequately for them.</P>
