      <NameTxt>Mr. Stephen D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course his introductory statement on the Estimate, the Minister said very little to relieve the anxiety of parents, teachers, school managers and educationists generally throughout the country.  It is all very well to provide building grants, free transport, free tuition and things like that, but that is not enough. This is a fact generally accepted by the elements to which I have referred&mdash;parents, <Col N="2050" /> teachers, educationists generally.</P>
      <P>If we are to be happy about the education of our children, we must staff our schools with the best possible teaching material, and though we may pay tribute to the quality of the teaching material generally throughout the country, we must also take into consideration that many sections of the teaching profession are depressed, believing they are being overlooked by the Department.  Adequate salaries for teachers are not enough if we are to get sufficient teachers to take care of the larger numbers of pupils coming into post-primary education. We must not just give adequate salaries: we must give attractive salaries to attract not just more teachers but more qualified persons into the teaching ranks.</P>
      <P>As I have said, though we can all pay tribute to the teachers at present engaged in all sections of education in this country, we must not lose sight of the fact that many teachers, particularly secondary teachers, are frustrated and discontented about the manner in which their salary needs are being dealt with by the Department of Education. Frustration and discontent are the sorts of things that can spread from the rostrum down into the class.  This would be a very bad thing.  In this House recently, the Minister told, I think, Deputy Lindsay that he had ironed out his differences with the ASTI, the organisation of secondary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Stephen D. Barrett Mr. Stephen D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stephen D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister did say it, by now he must be disillusioned. It is not true that he has ironed out his differences, neither is it true that the ASTI are satisfied with the proposals the Minister put to them.  In this matter, not alone are we dealing with the ASTI but with Catholic and Protestant headmasters throughout the country who have been expressing their anxiety about this matter.  I have been told that they have so informed the Minister.  They have told him that they support the ASTI demand for just service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a ballot for secondary teachers <Col N="2051" /> taken in my constituency recently, the Minister's salary proposals were beaten by 149 votes to five.  That is a significant figure.  My constituency was not alone in expressing its views on the Minister's salary proposals.  In West Cork, in East Cork and South Kerry there have been massive votes against the Minister's proposals.  I inquired in Dublin yesterday and I have been told the situation is the same here.</P>
    <P>If the Minister hopes to introduce the advanced leaving certificate in the early 1970s, it is imperative that highly qualified people should be not alone attracted but induced by every possible means to enter the teaching profession and, having entered it, should be induced to remain in it and not to find after a few years there that they belong to a sort of Cinderella of the public service and, as a result, make efforts to get into some other profession or calling.  It is only right that when the Minister is considering salary proposals of this nature he should advert to the rewards in other spheres of life&mdash;that he should try to ensure that the rewards which will come to secondary teachers will be at least commensurate with those available to people with equal educational qualifications in industry and the public service generally.</P>
    <P>While I am on the salary proposals, I understand they include special remuneration for what the Department describe as posts of responsibility.  In the first place, &ldquo;posts of responsibility&rdquo; is a horrible expression.  Every teacher's post is a post of responsibility. While I know the Department are only putting a tag of some description on it, I would suggest that at some stage somebody in the Minister's Department should start thinking again about the tag that should be attached to what at the moment they are describing as posts of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to correct the Deputy, it is posts of special responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Stephen D. Barrett Mr. Stephen D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stephen D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Posts of special responsibility.  My remarks still apply.  Each teacher has a post of special responsibility.  Some other tag <Col N="2052" /> should be put on the person who is appointed to this post.  I should be very glad to know what exactly the Department have in mind in regard to these posts of special responsibility.  The Minister should make quite sure that these posts do not become just sinecures and that they do not go purely by seniority.  I agree that seniority should be one of the things to be taken into consideration but it would be a dreadful thing if the posts of special responsibility&mdash;or whatever tag the Minister would like to put on them after further consideration&mdash;were to go to the oldest inhabitant in each school irrespective of his or her worth, irrespective of how he or she has moved with the times in a sphere which is moving very rapidly indeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones, discussing this Estimate, made a very excellent speech to which I should like to subscribe.  He sounded a note of warning about something which is certainly disturbing every section of the teaching community throughout the country at the moment&mdash;the lack of liaison between the Department and the teaching professions. When the Fine Gael Party was producing its education policy as part of the <i>Just Society</i> it sought, and it was most generously given, the assistance and co-operation of people engaged in all elements of the teaching world &mdash; primary, post-primary, vocational and university.  If the Minister made an equal effort he would get exactly the same co-operation.  I have heard complaints.  All I can do is voice them.  I have examined them as deeply as I can and I believe there is truth in the complaint that there is a grave danger that teachers will believe&mdash; many of them already believe&mdash;that people who never taught a class for one hour in their lives can make farreaching decisions without adverting to the difficulties which will spill over from these decisions into every classroom in every school and college in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one small example.  Late in August the Department suddenly announced that secondary schools would have a five-day week.  I am not complaining at all about the decision because I think it is probably quite a <Col N="2053" /> wise one but what I am complaining about is the fact that this was announced very late in August and if the people who made the announcement had adverted to the manner in which secondary school programmes for the forthcoming year are prepared they should have realised that many school managers had by the time the announcement was made already prepared their school programmes for the year on the basis that there would be a six-day week.  The result was that there had to be a very hurried reappraisal of these arrangements.  The Minister may say that that only meant that the school managers had to stay home and do a little extra homework for a few nights.  That may be true but the fact that the decision was made and announced in this way was symptomatic of one thing, that the Department are out of touch with the manner in which the schools which they are supposed to be helping and assisting are run.  I know that, while the decision was welcomed by many school managers, that welcome was coupled with the most caustic remarks about the manner in which the Department manage their business.  The Minister must agree that there is ground for legitimate criticism in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another thing which has drawn forth much criticism from the teaching profession is that according to the rules and programmes for secondary teachers with regard to the intermediate certificate examination of 1969 certain texts were named in the syllabus for an oral examination in French and this information was given to teachers in September, 1968 but in October the teachers were told that there will be no oral examination in these texts at all, although the texts had been purchased by teachers and by children and various books prepared on the texts had already been purchased.  They were purchased in late September and were out of date, because of Departmental interference, by October.  I wonder why teaching elements were misdirected in this matter and why parents were obliged to buy texts on which their children would not be examined.  I asked the Minister a question on the matter.  I did not think his reply was <Col N="2054" /> very satisfactory.  No really good explanation has yet been given as to why this happened.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his decision to appoint teachers as advisory examiners for intermediate and leaving certificate examinations but I think the decision to require each teacher to examine officially his or her class in oral sections of all languages was not a good one.  I do not think a teacher who examines his or her own students in competition with students from classes all over the country can be objective and, again, you will find almost invariably that teachers have their likes and dislikes in classes.  At some stage the Minister should consider some other manner by which children of this type should be examined orally.</P>
    <P>I am told&mdash;I am open to correction&mdash; not alone by one teacher but by many teachers and the statistics, again I am told, bear this out, that in the correction of papers in both the intermediate and the leaving certificate examinations an effort is made to ensure that the same, or roughly the same, percentage of honours is given in each subject in each year.  I think that is bad.  I am told, in fact, that those who are correcting the scripts are directed during the course of the correcting of scripts to lower or higher their sights in order to bring about the happy but misleading situation that the same standard of honours, or approximately the same standard of honours, will be reached each year. Surely it would be better that the papers should be examined without any advertence to what happened last year or the year before or the year before that?  The Department's policy in regard to this seems to be to make sure that if anybody calls for the statistics they will be quite happy that there has been no deterioration in the standard of education in post-primary schools during the previous 12 months, because the Minister can say the percentage of honours was so much last year, that it was very much the same the year before, and very much the same the year before that.  On the other hand, say, for argument's sake&mdash;and I believe it to be true&mdash;that education standards are improving generally <Col N="2055" /> among students, due to the system which I am now criticising this would not be manifested in the statistics of the percentage of honours which would be issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a very bad thing that the credibility of such statistics can be quite sincerely impunged by me here, rightly or wrongly, and I should be very glad if the Minister would see if what I say is so.  If the Minister is dissatisfied with what I have told him, and if he doubts the wisdom of what I am saying, let us get back to the question of liaison between the Department and the teaching profession.  Let the Department ask the teaching profession what they think of the system.  Let the Department ask the people who are correcting the papers what they think about it.  I do not know if the Department have done so, but if they have I am quite certain, from the inquiries I have made from teachers all over the country, that they have found universal condemnation of this.</P>
    <P>On the question of free post-primary transport, students who are living more than three miles from the post-primary school are eligible for free transport.  I know also that students who are living less than three miles from the school will still get free transport if they are studying through the medium of Irish.  This leads to anomalies which are bound to cause a reaction against the Irish language. You can have two students living next door to each other travelling on the same day, the same bus to the same school; one of them goes free because he is doing his studies through the medium of Irish and the other puts his hand into his pocket and pays because he is not studying through Irish.</P>
    <P>The larger proportion of students are not studying through Irish, and they are left with the feeling that they are regarded as second-class citizens and are being made pay their bus fares because they are not studying through Irish.  The ironic thing about it is that these students go into school and find displayed there the 1916 Proclamation assuring them that Ireland cherishes all the children of the nation equally.  There is a contradiction of <Col N="2056" /> that in the experience through which these students go because they are taking their courses through English and the little boy next door is taking his through Irish.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if in our approach to university problems we are really keeping up with the times and thinking ahead as we should be thinking. We were all assured, and I would accept, that a massive building programme for universities must be engaged in if the present approach to university education is to be continued. None of us would like to deny to any gifted student who has finished his post-primary education the right of having a proper higher education. However, I wonder is the Department looking far enough ahead.  Some of these buildings will not be constructed for years and years.  Children starting their university education come up to the university at a relatively tender age.  They leave their home surroundings to come to a large city where many of them become very lonely, and some of them get into company which their parents certainly would not consider very desirable.</P>
    <P>Has the Department ever considered two ways of dealing with the matter, one by having a correspondence course for the first year, by means of which students could study at home, in the home atmosphere with their own friends and in the atmosphere to which they are accustomed?  It would be a test of these students' stamina and of their application in as much as they would be working by themselves without much supervision.  The student who would work well in these circumstances could certainly be received for a second year at the university in the knowledge that he had worked well and truly during the preparatory year at home.</P>
    <P>There is another approach possible still more in the future so far as this country is concerned and is already being used extensively in other countries. I refer to the growth of television and radio as a medium of education.  I understand that in Japan as far back as 1965 there were 46 purely educational television stations making educational programmes of the kind to which I have referred, and in addition <Col N="2057" /> there were 283 relay stations reaching schools all over the place.  Therefore, as far as education is concerned, even in a country like Japan there are no remote places.  Before we finalise the expenditure of substantial sums on building very large educational edifices, we should consider the possibility of educating students through the use of TV.  I know that educationists will be appalled by that, and will say the most important thing in a student's life is the student-teacher relationship.  One criticism that can be levelled at that is that it depends on the teacher as to whether the student-teacher relationship will be beneficial or not.  I read somewhere a comment by a Japanese student on the system of teaching by TV.  Somebody was criticising it and saying that the student did not get the same personal touch that he would get if he were at the university.  The student demolished the argument by saying: &ldquo;In the class the teacher speaks to the class but on TV the teacher speaks to me.&rdquo;  There is something to be said for that; certainly it is arguable and should be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stephen D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If this system is ever considered, the greatest consideration should be given to those who will conduct these TV programmes. The important part these people will play in the lives of students is indicated in the remarks of the Japanese student to which I referred. These teachers will be locked away in a room day after day speaking personally to the professional and business men of the future on matters of great importance.  Therefore, it is very important that only men of the very <Col N="2058" /> highest educational and other standards should get these posts.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the fact that under the present system students have to come to a university city, perhaps, far from their homes by our standards of distance, and go into poor or not very good digs.  They are lonely and find it hard to settle down. I read in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday of the difficulties of students in Dublin and I think it was alleged that about 1,000 each year have to see a psychiatrist.  We might ask the Minister to consider whether it would be a good thing to keep boys and girls at home under their parents' influence as long as possible.  We hear a great deal now about how people should have some say in the running of universities. The students rightly, I think, insist that they should have more say in the running of their universities than they have at present.</P>
      <P>While I do not believe in students dashing out into the streets with banners to meet all sorts of situations, I entirely agree that students should agitate in regard to and speak on subjects which affect them as students. There is the problem of the professor who does not give a damn about the class and there are many such professors. Students should speak out and protest.  They should have some say&mdash; to what extent I would not like to specify&mdash;in the curriculum to which they are subject.  I am glad that much of the student agitation in this country is confined to that sort of thing.  The one thing that I feel students might be criticised about is that they seem to think that there are no other young people whose needs must be met or, in fact, no other section of the community that should get the same consideration as they claim.  I suppose they act on the same assumption as all pressure groups, that if they do not shout about their needs nobody else will.  It is important to remember that there are many other areas of public expenditure that must be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know children in post-primary education in my constituency who go to school from dreadful slums where it is impossible for a student to study when he goes home from school.  We should remember all these things in <Col N="2059" /> discussing expenditure on education and also the people who get very inadequate social service allowances in comparison with almost every other country in Europe.  I say this because I am very much afraid that education could become either a fixation or a gimmick and that this House would think that no matter how much you spent on education nobody would say nay.</P>
    <P>I would be very slow to criticise expenditure on education but I think a note of caution is necessary and when students are making demands for this, that or the other&mdash;I saw something in the papers yesterday about their asking for cheap transport&mdash;it should be pointed out to them that their needs are being met out of the taxpayer's pocket and that, while we admire those students and look to them as the future professional and commercial classes, we must also look at the tens of thousands of young people of similar age who are out in the world working and gaining experience by the sweat of their brows in the larger university of life.  These wonderful young men and women have to pay their income tax in order to subscribe to the national kitty, part of which goes to provide the educational facilities which these students are enjoying.</P>
    <P>I should like it to go from this House to the student body that we admire their anxiety about their needs, that we agree it is time that they had a greater say in the working of the universities where they are educated but we should caution them that here we must look objectively at their needs and take account of them against the broad background of the needs of the rest of the country and that all their demands cannot at the moment be met.</P>
    <P>When I see all this agitation in regard to students and others having a greater voice in the discussion of university matters I often wonder if it would be possible for the parents of university students in some way to make their voices heard.  University students might not like this idea but there is a fair amount of logic in it <Col N="2060" /> because our whole educational system now is leading down one very dangerous avenue that should give us all cause to think.  We have been talking of teacher-student relationship but the parent-child relationship is being seriously impaired by the official approach to educational matters.  In the old days&mdash;and still in post-primary education where children are going to schools that have not taken advantage of the Minister's so-called free education scheme&mdash;the child took pride in the fact that the parents were providing this education and the parents took pride in the fact that they were providing it for the child and the child felt under some obligation to the parents to justify the expense that the parents undertook and often at the cost of great deprivation to themselves, by doing his or her best at school.  This child-parent relationship is now being wiped out.  We have the State as the mother and father of the child from the moment he goes into the school until he leaves post-primary education and, to a growing extent, the State is the mother and father of the child when the child grows up to be a young man or woman and proceeds to university.</P>
    <P>To some extent, perhaps, this is necessary but there are dangers inherent in it.  The child-parent relationship has been affected and will continue to be increasingly affected in this regard.  For that reason, in regard to primary, post-primary and university courses, parents of this country should demand that they get some voice in the manner in which the schools are being run and educational policy is being implemented.  We had an example of that not so very long ago in Ballinasloe but I am not confining this to the pressure for the Irish language or anything else.  Parents should make their voices heard even though the State is paying for that boy or girl.  Parents should claim the right to maintain the natural interest which comes from their natural love and affection for the children.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when every secondary school will have an advisory parents' committee attached to the teaching staff, purely on a voluntary basis.  I look forward, too, to the day when the governing bodies <Col N="2061" /> of universities will have a similar advisory body when the parents could say: &ldquo;I gave you this child but I do not like the way it is turning out because of a, b, or c, &rdquo; tabulating their reasons.  Such a system would give enormous assistance to all sections of the educational world, that is, to the governing bodies of universities, to school managers in both secondary and primary schools.  The Minister should consider this and I hope, now that the idea is propagated, some parents will take it up and ensure that their voices are heard at every stage of the educational evolution of the child they have nursed from the day it was born until it went to primary school.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is an obligation on parents to see that the child is not literally taken from them when it first goes to primary school and not returned to them again until it has finished its university education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held that one of the best investments or, shall I say, one of the best modern investments, in education, was the transport scheme.  It is very desirable in the present age that children, in the first instance, be taken off the roads and away from the dangers with which they would have to contend in modern traffic.</P>
      <P>However, I should like to make one or two suggestions to the Minister in this regard.  In Enniscorthy, we have a temporary school for mildly retarded children&mdash;a new school is being built for us at the moment by the Department of Education with the subvention of the local committee&mdash;and under the existing transport system we have free transport to the school in Enniscorthy from Gorey, which is about 18 or 20 miles away.  There are quite a number of children in outlaying districts but we have managed, by virtue of the assistance of the committee we have, to make arrangements for the majority of these children to be brought into Gorey so that they may avail of the free transport.  We are able to do this through the kindness and courtesy of people living in the districts who have helped in every way and I should like to express my gratitude to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, for one or two children <Col N="2062" /> who live north of the Gorey area we have not been able to get free transport and, for some time, I have been approaching the Department of Education to try to get clarification on this point, as to whether the Department will arrange or assist in some way in paying for these children who, at the moment, are being carried out of their own private finances.</P>
    <P>Our position is that we are responsible for the children in the Gorey area. The funds of the committee for mentally handicapped children in the county are not very big.  Funds are raised by having shows and by getting assistance from those who are good enough to support us.  We manage to collect an amount in the region of a few hundred pounds a year and out of that money we have to make a fairly sizeable contribution towards the building of the new school in Enniscorthy. We also have to make a contribution towards the school for mildly handicapped children that will be built, I hope, in the near future, in the town of Wexford.  It is costing us about £130 a year out of pocket funds to pay for this transport.  I have made representations to the Department during the past 12 or 15 months and I received a reply to the effect that the matter was under consideration and then I was further informed that it was under sympathetic consideration.  I am asking the Minister now to give it his most sympathetic consideration.  A sum of £125 or £130 a year is a lot to the Gorey committee for mentally retarded children but it is very little to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Dealing with transport as a whole, as I said at the beginning it is one of the best investments that have been made in education so far, but there would seem to be a case for extending the period for the transport of children to primary schools beyond the age of ten if they are outside the three-mile limit which, I think, is the position at the moment.  If they are under that, I understand that they go out at an earlier age.</P>
    <P>In a family of, say, half a dozen children the position may be that one child is opted into the free transport system at the age of seven or eight years or, perhaps, even six years.  Under <Col N="2063" /> this scheme, which has been in existence now for about four years, there may be a child who has been carried by this transport system from the time it first went to school but it is suddenly put on the road to walk to school.  This child would have no road sense whatever.  He is creating a hazard for himself, anxiety for his parents and, I might say, very often a danger to traffic as a whole.  This matter should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>There is another point, too.  If there are three or four children in a house and some of them are available for transport while others are not, it means that the parents have to get one child out much earlier than the others to get him off to school.  I am sure the Minister realises that the bringing up of children is by no means easy work. The mother has to work hard, whether she be a farmer, a cottier or whatever she may be, and it does not help to have to have two sets of getting ready, as it were, or two sets of breakfast.</P>
    <P>In the evening, too, the children who can avail of the transport may be home an hour before the other children.  I think I am right in saying that if such children were going to secondary school the transport would be free but why should the transport be free for those attending secondary school and not for those in primary schools?  Why should there be a distance barrier for the children in primary education? That seems to me like class distinction and surely this is what we want to avoid with all the talk of free education that is going on at the moment? For that reason, the Minister should seriously consider extending the scheme.  As well as an educational investment, it is a national investment from the point of view of health.  The Minister may say that he would like to do this but that it would involve extra money.  It is always nice to be able to show Ministers how they can save a little money.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this regimented idea of cutting out small schools all over the place and having bigger schools, there have been attempts to close down schools in my constituency. That is all right, as far as it goes.  I <Col N="2064" /> know of three instances, however, in my country of attempts to close down schools.  Let me give them in their order of sequence.  The first was a twoteacher school which was built, I think, in 1962.  It was perfectly up to date in every way.  It was to be closed down and replaced by a parish school in that area.  A considerable sum of money would be involved in the transfer to the new school.  I was able to point out to the Department of Education the fallacy of their views in that regard and the money was saved.</P>
    <P>The second attempt concerned a parish school in my constituency which was being transferred to a curacy school.  True enough, this school was an older school&mdash;built in 1898.  However, it had been reconstructed and was made up to date.  Two extra classrooms had to be built to the curacy school which was located on a main road which was a considerable hazard to the children.  I mention those two cases to show the Minister how it would be possible to save money for the purpose of putting it into the transport scheme I am advocating.  I am not an advocate of the building of schools along or near main roads because of the hazard to children.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the article in <i>Studies</i> has been mentioned.  Probably the greatest service that has been conferred on Irish education as a whole is contained in the autumn edition of <i>Studies</i> produced by the Jesuit Fathers. It highlights the discussion and contains very erudite articles by people of different denominations in various spheres of education.  Let us get our facts right. Our educational system has served us well and, by and large, has been magnificent. For Roman Catholics that has been made available by our religious orders, practically <i>gratis</i>.  Small fees have been paid but I am aware of many instances where, when the money was not available, it was not asked for. The education of the religious minority was provided through Protestant philanthropic societies, the Representative Church Bodies and other such people who gave a magnificent system of education which was, shall we say, a complete private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the custodian of the <Col N="2065" /> rights of the people.  It is not a success to nationalise education just as it is not a success to nationalise medicine.  If you nationalise education you sacrifice it for administration.  The article in <i>Studies</i> highlights that fact.  Most of the articles were written as a plain exposition of facts.</P>
    <P>There is a move in the town of Enniscorthy in my constituency to make some changes in the education hitherto provided there by the Convent of Mercy, the Presentation Convent and the Loreto Convent.  The Mercy nuns and the Presentation nuns have been in Enniscorthy for a very long time.  The Loreto nuns have been providing a somewhat better type of secondary education, though they deal in a small way, I think, with juniors also.  It was decided, first of all, that the Mercy nuns, who have been teaching there for years in their primary school and in what is known as &ldquo;secondary tops&rdquo;, would get a new school costing about £60,000: their school is 100 years old. Recently, the Presentation nuns built a new school.  The Loreto nuns were told that they were surplus and would be phased out although their centenary in Enniscorthy would fall I think the year after next.  The Mercy nuns were told that their system would be changed: they were not to have the original school but were to become a secondary teaching institution and were to have a school costing about £120,000.  Although the Presentation nuns taught at secondary level, they were told they would no longer be teaching except at primary level.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to give the House some idea of the geography of Enniscorthy. The town is situated on either side of the River Slaney.  The side on which the Presentation Convent is situated is the bigger side of the town. However, due to housing projections, the size of both sides of the town will probably be equalised in the not too distant future.  Quite a number of the young children who will be educated in the primary school will be coming from homes on the Convent of Mercy side of the town and that means that these children will have to cross one of the most dangerous traffic points in the country four times a day.  There is <Col N="2066" /> no question of public transport being involved because the very farthest any child would have to walk to school would be three-quarters of a mile at the very outside.</P>
    <P>Now this scheme may be administratively sound.  There are two convents involved, the primary school being on one side of the river and the secondary school on the other.  The scheme may look beautiful on paper but there is a definite hazard from the point of view of children crossing the bridge four times a day.  That would not be the situation had the original scheme been persisted in and the Mercy Convent been given their school.  Indeed, that would have cost much less and the children could have continued from the primary to the &ldquo;secondary tops&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The idea is, apparently, to keep secondary and primary schools completely separate.  That must be the answer in this particular instance certainly. But one should have regard to local conditions.  As I have said before, the Department is trying to operate a cut and dried scheme, worked out probably with the aid of a map in Dublin, completely unsuited to local conditions.  I asked a question about this and I was told that, even though Loreto had to leave, great benefits would be conferred on them in other areas.  Now that, to me, is a completely wrong approach&mdash;the Department conferring benefits.  The Department is not conferring anything; they are doing certain things with the taxpayers' money and, because it is the taxpayers' money, there should be the fullest consultation with everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Had there been consultation in Enniscorthy before this happened there would certainly have been opposition to the scheme.  The Department are spending money in Gorey.  They are spending money in Wexford but, because they are spending money, they must not pat themselves on the back, as it were; as I said earlier, for 85 years the religious orders have carried practically the whole burden of education and they have done so with practically nothing.  They have led ascetic lives in order to educate people and send them all over the world in <Col N="2067" /> the past 85 years and, in the last five years, the Department comes in to take an active part at last in secondary education.  I believe they should do that but the fact that they are doing it does not entitle them to dictate. There must be more consultation, particularly consultation with the teaching profession itself.  The parents must be consulted.  It would be a tragedy if, when we are getting somewhere in our education drive, a system should develop under which the Department would dictate to those who have carried literally the whole burden, unassisted, in the past, those who are fully cognisant of every aspect of it.  If there is not consultation the scheme will end in disaster, in overlapping and waste of public money.</P>
    <P>In regard again to the article in <i>Studies,</i> I took it the idea behind the Department's scheme was comprehensive schools.  I would advise the Minister, &ldquo;Forget it&rdquo;.  There are areas in which comprehensive schools may be the answer.  They may be the answer in the more densely populated areas but they are not the answer in sparsely populated areas.  They are not suited to our situation.  They will not suit in the East of the country and they certainly will not suit in the West.  Good educational standards can be achieved without comprehensive schools.  With proper transport there is no reason why the child with a particular aptitude could not have that aptitude educationally developed on the right lines.  But more transport would naturally have to be provided to achieve that end.  The benefit of higher education does not depend on social stratum. Environment has nothing to do with it.  A child from the upper income bracket may possibly be the greatest &ldquo;thick&rdquo;, while a child at the other end of the ladder may be near genius.  Such a child will be able to absorb all the education available, become a credit to the country and, indeed, a national asset.  It would be worth the Minister's while to remember that.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is the widest unrest in universities all over the world. To date, there has been very little in <Col N="2068" /> Ireland.  The greatest unrest originated in Paris.  Before the war the number of university students in Paris was 60,000. Today the student population numbers 200,000.  The facilities are the same as they were pre-war.  Some of the students never see a professor because they never get inside a lecture room.  Lectures are relayed by loudspeakers even out in the quadrangle.  There is no contact between the students and the professors. That is the situation in most European universities today.  There is one exception, Norway.  The only agitation that has been taken place in Norway has been agitation in a minor degree by students against students.  In Norway the students run everything, even the shop.  They have a very big say in administration, when the lectures will be held and so forth.  Recently we had agitation here by the architectural students in National University.  They protested against the standards because they are not as high as they should be. If that is the case&mdash;and there must be something in it when there are such major demonstrations as that&mdash;it is, of course, very serious from the point of view of the graduates.  If they have not got the educational standards other graduates have, they will not be able to compete for situations which they may seek.</P>
    <P>The other demonstrations we have had have been mild.  They have been political.  We have all been students in our day and we joined anything for the sake of a row now and again.  There is no sign of any active disagreement between the professorial side and the students but, as we have seen in other countries, this sort of thing spreads like a prairie fire.  I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;he may have already done so; I do not know&mdash;that without causing any unpleasantness, or without offending anyone connected with the universities, he should call a conference of the professors in the different universities with a view to discussing any grievances which may exist.  They could ask representatives of the student bodies to meet them as well.  I think the Minister could do this.  He seems to be entitled to close down universities and open up others.  He seems to have almost unlimited power in the sphere of education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> These things should be thoroughly thrashed out.  There is an old saying that a stitch in time saves nine.  At the moment Ireland has a record of being quite a stable country, in spite of the Fianna Fáil Government. I know I cannot refer to finance on this Estimate but I do not think the country is financially stable.  It is stable so far as demonstrations are concerned.  There is a tendency to revolt against constituted authority in the world today.  That revolt comes from the students.  We should see to it that they have not got an opportunity to start rows.  If they have justifiable grievances they should be redressed. There should be meetings and discussions about these things.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he does this with all the diplomacy at his command he will be doing a good day's work for the universities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long informative and interesting debate on education in Ireland today, and that is as it should be in the present climate of public opinion, where there is to an extent that did not exist before a very deep and committed interest in education, its future and its problems.  In Ireland today education is going through a period of revolution in the sense that people in every walk of life and in every level of society are deeply committed to the idea of improving education, and deeply committed to the idea that education to the fullest extent should be available to every boy and girl in the land.  There is now an awareness of the importance of the social principle of equality of opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years we have taken practical steps in the direction of achieving equality of opportunity for all our boys and girls.  I am well aware that we have not arrived there yet to the fullest extent, but certainly steps have been taken in the post-primary field, and in the higher education field, to bring in a very wide spectrum of our people to the facilities of post-primary and higher education who heretofore did not have that chance.  We have done that through <Col N="2070" /> the fee paying and free transport schemes at post-primary level, and through the substantial extension of the university grants under legislation passed by this House last summer.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say&mdash;and I have said it already&mdash;that from the latest figures to hand concerning the extent to which these university grants were utilised, somewhere in the region of 1,100 or 1,200 of our boys and girls have gone on to higher education this year.  The figure last year was 275 under the old scholarship scheme.  This represents a substantial improvement in that direction. In the field of post-primary education we are now at the level of 186,000 students who are availing of post-primary education.  By 1970 that figure should be up to 200,000 students.  In the past two years the increase each year in students availing of post-primary education was of the order of 18,000.  A total of 36,000 additional boys and girls have entered post-primary education in the past two years.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I feel there is a need to see our whole education policy within the philosophy and framework of what exactly the fundamental motivating policy is.  That fundamental motivation is to implement fully the fundamental social principle of equality of opportunity&mdash;to give every boy and girl an equal chance.  That is the fundamental motivating social principle behind our educational policy at present.</P>
    <P>While Deputies have been critical, some in a constructive way and some in a not so constructive way, of aspects of our educational policy, it is no harm to emphasise here that while there has been criticism, there has also been quite constructive praise and approval of developments in Irish education in the past two years from quite independent sources, and quite unsought.  We had a visit here in the past few weeks from Dr. Philip Coombes, Director of the International Institute of Education. I want to quote what he had to say about our recent developments in education.  He said our developments could provide a laboratory for the rest of Europe.  In other words, the world Director of the International Institute <Col N="2071" /> of Education praised the progressive developments that have taken place here, and said that they could be a test case for similar types of development in other countries in Europe, thereby saying quite plainly that our recent developments in education are ahead of the developments in other countries in Europe and that we can, and we hope will, provide a headline for them in education.</P>
    <P>We had another visit recently from a very famous educationist, Professor Vasey.  Those two gentlemen are probably regarded in world terms as two outstanding thinkers, philosophers and planners on education.  Professor Vasey gave a lecture in St. Patrick's in Drumcondra in which he praised the way in which we have implemented the recommendation of the OECD survey team incorporated in the document Investment in Education.  The OECD through their survey teams made an analysis of the educational problems in every country in the world. We are the only country that has fully implemented or is on the way to fully implementing the recommendations contained in that magnificent document. Professor Vasey paid us the tribute in his lecture in St. Patrick's in Drumcondra that, although it is only a few years since the document emerged, substantial steps have already been taken to implement that recommendation here and that other recommendation are in the course of being implemented and will be implemented. Many of those recommendations have given rise to some of the criticisms that have been voiced in the course of the discussions in the House.</P>
    <P>There is one way in which we can avoid all trouble, all problems and criticisms, and that is by doing nothing. There is no question about that.  We can sit on the fence, do nothing and we will not get hurt; but during the past two years we have been concerned about incorporating the social principle of equality of opportunity into our educational system.  We were concerned to implement the recommendations contained in that fundamental document, <i>Investment in Education</i>, whereby a team of educationists <Col N="2072" /> organised by OECD made a thorough investigation and came up with recommendations which we are now implementing and which have come in for criticism because, in the implementation of the recommendations and in the introduction of new ideas, one is bound to offend some susceptibilities.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that we should have the widest possible range of discussion on education generally. That is why I gave authority to the Assistant Secretary of my Department, Mr. O'Connor, to write a fundamental article on Irish Education which was discussed at length in <i>Studies</i> by other eminent authorities on education in Ireland.  I gave the authority, having made it clear that I might not agree fully with everything Mr. O'Connor would write, but I took the unique step of allowing a public servant to do this so that there could be full discussion and full dialogue on the subject. We have had in this House during the course of the debate the suggestion that it was unusual to allow a senior officer to publish his views and to have them subjected to criticism. The step has been well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that it is only through such discussion and such dialogue that we can get people fully interested in the problems of education and that we can get them to understand the thinking behind the solution to our problem.  It was this which motivated me in allowing Mr. O'Connor to publish his views along with the views of the other people.  They encompassed a very wide range of problems and views on the whole educational scene here.</P>
    <P>One of the main themes of criticism in the House, particularly from some Members of Fine Gael, has been the question of taking steps in education without consultation.  I want to scotch this because, in the course of the discussion here, I fear that the view may have got out through the contributions here that in some way we are imposing educational policy on the community without consultation with the interests concerned.  This is simply not true.  The facts are that in my Department a special development branch has been established.  These officers are excellent <Col N="2073" /> men who have been dedicated to their jobs and have shown this by their practical work.  They have spend days and nights working, seven days a week, during the past two years.  They have spent a lot of their time going around the country, organising meetings of parents and educational interests, ensuring that the basis of our educational policy is fully explained and emphasising the need for a more co-ordinated and co-operative approach in the primary and post-primary fields.</P>
    <P>Last year every county in the country was visited by an official of my Department who organised several such meetings. This is a continuing operation. Every time that we decide, for sound educational reasons, that a larger primary establishment is needed in an area to give a wider range of subjects to the children, we have meetings down at grass-root level between an officer of the Department, the parents and anybody else interested in the area.  There are not just one, two or three meetings; there are four or five such meetings to ensure that the people understand the need to get away from the small idea of primary education, from the small school unit, to a larger unit which will fit the children for occupations in life in the sort of Ireland we shall move into in the 1970's.</P>
    <P>In the post-primary field the problem is again being settled through consultation between officers of the Development Branch of the Department and the interests concerned.  The Department want to ensure co-ordination between vocational, secondary and other educational interests in each area so that the full range of subjects which we now have in the current intermediate certificate, which we will have next year in the new type of leaving certificate and later in the advanced leaving certificate, are covered so that, through co-ordination and co-operation, the best possible facilities can be made available to every boy and girl.</P>
    <P>This can be done through co-operation between the officers of my Department and the people concerned. That is why I repudiate criticisms that have come from some speakers who have sought to get across the idea that <Col N="2074" /> this is a bureaucratic endeavour on the part of the Department.  Our educational policy has brought about a revolution in our educational system through consultation between officers of my Department and the interests concerned and no other country in Europe is doing it at the present time. Dr. Coombes and Professor Vasey were impressed by the fact that there was this consultation and that we were implementing an educational revolution through consultation.  I hope we shall not hear any more of that sort of criticism because by way of reply to Parliamentary Question I can give the facts and figures of the number of visits, the number of hours spent, the number of Departmental officers engaged. An entire branch of my Department have been spending most of their time consulting on the ground with local interests.  Any time there is a &ldquo;blow-up&rdquo; or an objection by people, for various reasons, in a locality to some amalgamation of primary schools or of post-primary establishments, I want to assure the House that that has arisen only through misunderstanding on the part of the people concerned following a long period of consultation, held privately, without publicity.  However, if the people want publicity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; if local newspaper correspondents wish to attend or if national newspapers wish to send representatives to those meetings, which are held on the ground, sometimes a year beforehand, they are entitled to be there.  These meetings have been going on possibly for a year before and it is only when some people object that the matter hits the headlines.  Then we hear of the local objection to a school being closed or to amalgamation of schools.  That gets major headlines but the meetings which have been held, day in day out, month after month, never hit the headlines.  That is part of our trouble.  Behind each one of these amalgamations, behind every one of these efforts to ensure co-operation and co-ordination, there is a long history of consultation on the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfair. That is the Minister's idea but it is not being done in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the facts and figures in relation to that.  I, personally, have made myself available, week in week out, to receive deputations, in particular on this aspect of amalgamation, on this aspect of co-operation, because I consider that what is needed here is more talking, more discussion, more explanations which will get through to the people the wisdom of the thinking behind our educational policy.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned it before and I wish to emphasise again that, as far as the primary school is concerned, the one-and two-teacher school cannot give the range of subjects which we shall be implementing fully under the new primary school curriculum next September. That is in course of preparation at the moment in consultation with the various teaching organisations and the managers' organisation.  This curriculum will give a wide range of subjects outside the traditional formal subjects. We hope to have art, civics, history and geography, rural science in rural areas, and so on, incorporated in a course of environmental studies which will seek to fit the child into his or her environment and will give scope to the teacher to give a broad type of educational training to the child outside the formal subjects.</P>
      <P>That sort of education, combining a wide range of subjects that will fit the child for whatever walk of life he may wish to follow afterwards, while not neglecting the formal education, giving the child a general knowledge base which will equip the child for society, is just not possible in a one- or two-teacher school.  All our planning in regard to the merging of these smaller schools over the past few years has been geared to the introduction of our new curriculum in primary schools starting next September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure people that this is the thinking, this is why we have been for the past few years working towards the new curriculum.  People tend to seek something that is good and forget that steps have to be taken in achieving <Col N="2076" /> that good that may not be immediately popular and that may offend traditional prejudices, and the rest.  The fact of the matter is that we could not hope to bring in the new curriculum next September unless over the past few years we had taken the practical steps to ensure that we had sufficiently big schools and a sufficient number of teachers in as many primary schools as possible to be able to teach the new curriculum starting next September.</P>
    <P>There is no point in working for a new type of curriculum, for a broadening of the educational system at primary level, for giving our children greater general knowledge and more subjects in primary schools, unless we face up to the fact that this cannot happen unless we did what we have been doing for the past few years.  That is the thinking and the philosophy behind our policy in regard to primary schools.</P>
    <P>The next step I wish to mention here concerns the abolition of the primary certificate.  Again, the primary certificate was all right in an age when three subjects were taught and there was an examination and that was the only burden on the teacher.  When there was no other burden on the teacher we could get by with two-teacher schools and good boys and girls emerged all right from that system.  Some went on and achieved fame.  But the boys and girls who were not so good did not get on.  There was no proper advice available as to where they should go, what they were best fitted for and they became, to use the phrase, drop-outs. This was the pattern in the past.  We are seeking to get away from that by having this record card system and report system from second class on where reports will be furnished annually to parents as to their child's progress by the teacher concerned, where the principal of the school at the end of the primary school period will furnish a record card setting out the child's ability and aptitudes, what he might be fitted for, and so on.  This, again, requires a sensitive approach on the part of teachers, requires a more detailed examination of the child.  It means that there must be more teachers and a more sensitive and comprehensive <Col N="2077" /> approach towards the child.  This, again, can best be done in the larger school.  The importance of the record card system is that it will form the base at post-primary level for decisions that can be made on career guidance for the children concerned.</P>
    <P>We made a start, this current education year, last September, on the provision of career guidance in our schools. We have initiated a number of crash courses and have got now 50 career guidance teachers in the bigger post-Primary schools throughout the country.  Their job will be to examine the record cards that come up from the primary school which will give an elementary or basic assessment of the child and then seek to make decisions as to what particular line of subjects suits the child concerned.  We hope to have 150 of these career guidance teachers next year.  We are now in the course of getting a number of trained psychologists who will feed into these career guidance teachers at the post-primary level.  We hope inside the next 12 months to have 25 such trained psychologists who will next year be working into 150 career guidance teachers and we hope in this way, inside the next four to five years, to build up as far as every post-primary area is concerned a fully comprehensive scheme of career guidance and psychology service, the purpose of the psychology service being to deal with the more difficult cases for which the career guidance teacher may not be able to make up his mind and, in that situation, the psychologist would come in and make a more detailed scientific assessment.</P>
    <P>All of this&mdash;coming back to what we were talking about earlier&mdash;amalgamation and co-operation, again, would not be possible unless we decided at the post-primary level to get the post-primary level establishment in each area to come together.  Where you have a convent with 100 pupils, a vocational school with 150 pupils and a Brothers' school with 150 pupils, none of them giving a full range of subjects, each supplying a number of subjects, in that situation, if you bring the three together and they co-operate and co-ordinate in regard to syllabuses, curricula, courses to be taught, timetables, and so on, you <Col N="2078" /> then can provide for all the children in that area all the subjects which we envisage in the intermediate certificate in the present intermediate certificate year.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This is what we are trying to do.  Precisely.  The present comprehensive intermediate certificate final year is in progress and the boys and girls who emerge during the next summer will be the first boys and girls to go into the new type leaving certificate which, again, is a follow-up to career guidance and psychological assistance, based on the system in the primary schools.  The follow-up will be that comprehensive system of education at 15 years of age.  Where the child takes his formal examination at this age, there should be a fair understanding of the child's capabilities and aptitudes&mdash;a fair understanding&mdash;one cannot be perfect in these matters&mdash; based entirely on guidance.  The first formal written examination, thus, will not be at the tender age of 11 years as it was for the primary certificate but will be at 15 years.</P>

      <P>Let me explain fully.  At the intermediate certificate level a decision can be taken as to the form of streaming for the child from intermediate certificate on to leaving certificate.  This will not be total specialisation.  We are avoiding the errors made elsewhere in this respect&mdash; specialisation.  We envisage that in the new leaving certificate there will be partial specialisation in which five groups will be available from which the child will select, on the advice of teachers and parents, in which 50 per cent of the time will be spent on specialisation in the groups, 50 per cent of the time will be spent on subjects taken outside the group.</P>
      <P>The groups are the pure sciences group, science and mathematics, the applied sciences or technical leaving certificate group, the mechanical, electrical, building construction&mdash;that line of country&mdash;and another group, a business studies group, incorporating commercial subjects and then social subjects, with general subjects like history and geography.  From these five groups the child will specialise in three subjects and take two subjects outside the group in order to get his five subjects for the leaving certificate.  The real specialisation which I would envisage taking place would be in the new advanced leaving certificate starting in 1972; the person taking the intermediate certificate now will be able to do the advanced leaving certificate which will then be in operation.  Here is where you will have the specialisation from 17 to 18, when they will concentrate purely on the subjects they have decided to specialise in.  It will be a course, in the main, equivalent to the first-year university course, say, in Arts or Science.  It is a very good idea that the child should at that stage undertake that sort of study within the environment of his own post-primary school.  We hope by this means to avoid a lot of the drop-out situation which has arisen in the past where in some of the first year university courses there has been a 50 per cent failure rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the weaknesses of the present system is that children have been leaving the secondary schools and the vocational schools too early and going into higher education in other spheres, at <Col N="2080" /> 17 years of age, which in the modern context is too young for the specialist technician training they may require, for the specialist technological training they may require or for the academic training they may require.  At 18 they are far better equipped to face this and they will have the advantage of a specialist course on top of the broad curriculum of the post-primary establishment.  I would say, looking ahead into the 70s, we may then have to have the two-year advanced leaving certificate course and have them doing even greater specialisation within the post-primary framework at that level of post-leaving certificate.  In Germany and in other European countries the average age of entering into higher education is 19 to 20, so we are making a start on this with the advanced leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to show the complexity of the educational scene at the present time, to show that we are seeking to get to grips with what is needed in our society today.  We want to emphasise that all this requires continued explanation and continued discussion. I would welcome it if Deputies of all Parties in the House, when talking to their constituents and friends and neighbours, would seek to explain the thinking behind it and to explain, for instance, the unpopular decisions we may have to take in regard to the larger schools, in the context of the overall education picture, that we need the larger educational establishments to cope with the sort of primary and post-primary curricula we envisage.  The officers in my Department will continue their efforts and I feel we are bringing the public around to this point of view.  Nobody likes change but, if change has to be made, it must be change through consultation; and I think we are winning this battle.  I would appeal to Deputies of all Parties to co-operate, because it is very important that we have an educational system which will be able to cope with the problems we shall be facing in 10 or 20 years' time.</P>
    <P>An educational system is something you do not change every year, and we are on the right lines now.  We are following broadly the headline set out in <Col N="2081" /><i>Investment in Education</i>.  We are providing the range of subjects at the lower level, with specialisation as the child goes on, thereby equipping children for the technician jobs which are available and not being filled.  We have not been getting from our educational system enough technicians, enough supervisors and enough people of sub-managerial category.  This is the type of job to which I would envisage many more of our boys and girls going, and the sort of education I have outlined is the basis they require.  Linked with what I have just mentioned is the whole conception of the regional technical and technological colleges.</P>
    <P>We hope shortly to be able to announce the creation of an institute of technology which will co-ordinate the work in the courses at these various regional colleges where you will have provided a technical type of education which will be of post-Leaving Certificate standard.  In addition to providing apprentice training, in addition to providing a second level education, we shall also have courses for technicians of which we are grossly short.  The type of education I envisage is a two-year diploma course to provide technicians for industry in all its aspects, for building, and for trade and commerce generally.  There are outlets in State enterprises and in the private sector for such technicians.  We feel the new type of regional colleges and colleges of technology will provide for specialisation in technological subjects which will be the equivalent of university standard and which will be appropriate to the region.  For instance, we shall have a degree course in food technology which would be appropriate to Carlow as the centre of Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to something I mentioned earlier.  There has been some criticism from some Fine Gael Deputies on this question of religious orders.  I want to say absolutely and categorically here in this House that religious orders have served this country excellently over the past 100 years and there is no foundation for the allegation that their position in post-primary education will in any way be diminished under the <Col N="2082" /> scheme I have outlined.  They form the lynchpin of our post-primary education. If there is to be change I am certain we can get the required change through co-operation, through discussion and dialogue, with the religious orders.  My Department are already getting a substantial amount of such co-operation from them and I want to acknowledge the co-operation which exists.  The contribution of the religious orders in the past has been magnificent and their contribution can be equally so in the future.  There have been misinterpretations and there have been allegations that their position in the post-primary education sphere will be diminished.  I want to be put on record as saying that we are looking forward to greater participation by the religious orders in our primary and post-primary education system and indeed in our system of higher education. Greater co-operation between church and State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include diocesan schools as well as religious orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that includes diocesan schools; that was an oversight. I include everybody who is interested in education, because we cannot afford to have any discordance on the question of Irish education.  This is a time for partnership and co-operation.  The matter of providing proper education for our boys and girls is fundamentally a matter of partnership between Church and State.  We can achieve this only through the fullest discussion and dialogue, when everybody understands the policies that are in mind and when people can then get around a table and seek to implement these policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps go back to another aspect of education to which Deputy Cosgrave referred in the course of his speech here, that is the question of the organisation of higher education, in particular, university education.  I think Deputy Cosgrave was fishing dangerously in rather troubled waters in this matter because this is a matter on which there has not been that full understanding that is necessary.  Befor speaking on this matter all Deputies should look closely into what is <Col N="2083" /> involved and why we are adopting certain policies in regard to higher education. This is the place to have them explained fully.</P>
    <P>As far as university education in future is concerned we shall not be able to devote to it and to higher education the resources we would like to devote to these purposes unless there is co-ordination between the main universities in this city and unless there is overall national education under the Higher Education Authority.  We are moving into a competitive world where specialisation will be all important and in which you will have expensive equipment required for post-graduate study and research and very expensive and highly-paid personnel will be necessary in order to have this post-graduate and research work.  We shall need much more expensive accommodation.</P>
    <P>This is a trend not peculiar to Dublin but it is occurring in the richest country in the world, in the United States, where they see the importance of not duplicating public funds in regard to this very expensive and highly serious business of post-graduate and research work.  The tendency here will be towards a greater degree of that work.  When I talk of financial saving the immediate economies in regard to the merger here of the two colleges in Dublin may not be evident, but the long term economies are quite fantastic.  When I say &ldquo;economies&rdquo;, I am thinking of economies in the educational sense.  I should like to refer to something mentioned by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Jones, when he said that we talked too much about the economics of education and the viability of education.  On any occasion when we talk in terms of economics or viability we are thinking and talking in the educational sense. If it is a question of allocating whatever resources we can make available, we must allocate them in the most economically viable direction.  This is where the economies in the future will arise.</P>
    <P>We shall not be able to afford the highest education that we want for our boys and girls unless we allocate our <Col N="2084" /> resources in the most educationally sound way.  We would have not a firstclass education, but a second-class education, if we have to spread ourselves thinly all around and divide £X among a great many people.  We would not be able to spread our resources to cover the provision of expensive equipment, skilled personnel and accommodation and inevitably we would have a system of education that would deteriorate into second-rate education and perhaps third or fourth rate.</P>
    <P>This is the thinking behind the policy adopted.  This is why the leading medical practitioners in the country came out last week in a very serious statement pointing out the necessity, as far as medicine is concerned, of having a single medical school in the city of Dublin.  They produced a very straightforward and detailed statement because they see the reality in regard to medical standards that is looming up and realise that we shall have problems in the years ahead&mdash;and not too many years ahead&mdash;if we continue to have two medical schools in the city of Dublin which will not be doing proper medical research and post-graduate studies in medicine and which will inevitably deteriorate with repercussions on medical standards.</P>
    <P>What then would be the position in the future of our boys and girls adopting medical careers and what posts would be available to them?  They say that a single medical school in Dublin with two excellent teaching hospitals, one on the north side and one on the south side, is something that makes sense to them.  They have come out with this document signed by every leading practitioner in the city and country and representative of the academic institutions and all our teaching hospitals.</P>
    <P>The very same thing applies in engineering.  The engineers came out with a similar statement and said that if we were to have fully trained engineers highly competent in research work and technology we would not be able to do it if we spread our resources too thinly. Here, again, the argument is unanswerable for a single engineering school.  I do not mind where such schools are located.  It is really irrelevant whether <Col N="2085" /> one is in Trinity and the other in Belfield because they will both be colleges of the University of Dublin but what is important is to have a single professional school of an adequate standard.</P>
    <P>Again, the same argument applies to the veterinary profession, whose association have produced a similar statement stressing the importance of having a single veterinary school.  That is all that is involved in what has been called the merger proposal.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave, and I think Deputy Lindsay also mentioned it, that &ldquo;merger&rdquo; is possibly not the happiest term to describe what we are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it can be an emotive word.  People tend to think of it in terms of big business, but what is intended is co-ordination and rationalisation along the lines I have mentioned.  I am sure that most independent opinion would agree that what is most important is to have single schools in respect of the professions&mdash;a single school of medicine, a single school of engineering, a single school of architecture, a single school of agriculture and a single school of veterinary medicine and of pharmacy in the city of Dublin under the overall governing body of the University of Dublin&mdash;and then you would have arts and sciences in each of the two colleges. We need arts and science graduates.  Arts, in particular, is least expensive from the point of view of research and equipment and so on. This is what is intended, and to extend this into the overall national sphere by having the Higher Education Authority supervising developments in Dublin, Cork and Galway and possibly in Limerick and other centres.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority will allocate funds and decide on the places in respect of development of education in each of the other centres.  Provision already made <Col N="2086" /> in respect of Dublin, Cork and Galway may have to be made in other centres. How to co-ordinate all that will be an important aspect of teacher training which has been neglected somewhat in the past.  There is need for co-ordination of teacher training at the various levels&mdash;primary, secondary and vocational&mdash;and to ensure a university degree of training for teachers at all levels.  I am not at all happy about the present Higher Diploma in Education or about the short period of training at present for national teachers.</P>

      <P>There was certain criticism made in that regard in relation to the Higher Education (Grants) Bill when allegations were made that less brilliant children would be hived away from the teaching profession.  I made precisely the same point now made by Deputy Tully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. You may get a boy or girl with two or three honours who has understanding and compassion and can communicate with little boys and girls and make a better teacher than a more brilliant student who heretofore, because of economic circumstances, had to take up teaching and became frustrated and disappointed. They can now avail of the opportunity of proceeding to higher education and will not suffer any deprivation as a result.  I was emphasising the importance of having teacher training co-ordinated and integrated in some way with the university system.  This can be done on a co-ordinated basis through an institution of education that would supervise all teacher training, set standards and provide syllabuses and so <Col N="2087" /> on and fit into the university system. Similarly, in regard to technology.  The various technical courses can be fitted into the overall system of higher education so that they will be under the supervision of the Higher Education Authority.  As far as the community is concerned resources can be allocated where they can be utilised to the best possible advantage and where the best facilities can be made available to our boys and girls.  In the world in which we move massive investment will be required in higher education if we are to retain our competitive situation. Such investment will be used to the maximum benefit of the individual and of the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>A number of other points were raised during the course of this debate.  Deputy Gerry Collins raised questions concerning the transport system and other Deputies have raised this question also. The school transport system has got off the ground very well.  There are difficulties to be ironed out and I shall be glad to hear of any difficulties which may come to the notice of Deputies from time to time.  We cannot have the system working on a basis where a bus passes one school in an area to bring the child to another school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Passing&rdquo; is not the correct word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have now advanced to the stage where we have an intermediate certificate available in vocational education, I shall not allow a bus to bring children past a vocational school into a secondary school some miles away.  Part of the trouble is because a certain amount of prejudice exists but we will do all we can to eradicate it.  That is also one of the reasons why we should like to get rid of the terms &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; and &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; and that is why we are using the term &ldquo;post-primary education&rdquo;, in as far as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to comprehensive education I should like to say that we have physically built some post-primary comprehensive schools. Deputies are aware of that, but the idea of comprehensive education is not just the idea of physically building <Col N="2088" /> comprehensive schools.  There is much more to it than that.  We must build comprehensive schools within the existing framework of education.  We have built comprehensive schools in areas in which the facilities for post-primary education are not as good as they might be in other areas&mdash;Glenties, Cootehill and Carraroe come to mind.  We have physically built these schools to ensure that comprehensive education will be available in those areas.  This is the primary aim; second to that is the actual building of the schools.  We have a permanent section in the development branch of my Department staffed with officers who fully understand this thinking.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange raised the point about the councils of the new technical colleges and of how the board should be established.  I want to emphasise that no final steps have been taken in regard to the composition of such boards.  We sent out proposals to the vocational education committees and we are also having consultations with the Irish Vocational Education Association.  I agree with Deputy L'Estrange that it would be better to have selected members on the boards of vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned a point with which I fully agree&mdash;it concerns what I was talking about earlier&mdash;that is, the merging of two schools in an area.  The opposition to such amalgamation comes in many cases from people who have vested business or other interests in having the school where it always has been.  Very often the children come second to the particular vested interest of a businessman in having the school permanently in that particular area. We have found this to be the case in quite a number of instances.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Mrs. Eileen Desmond for her contribution which was a very <Col N="2089" /> reasoned objective approach.  At least, we can be gallant in this House.  With regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, in the primary schools we are endeavouring to get more teachers.  During the past ten years we have produced 150 teachers more than our normal requirements so that we are speedily improving the pupil-teacher ratio year by year.  Our normal primary school building requirements are about 6,500 places, but we are now providing 26,000 places which is more than four times what the normal requirement would be.  In that way, we are tackling the whole problem of primary school buildings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond referred to career guidance.  At the moment we have 50 career guidance officers in primary schools and next year we shall have 150 and we have our psychologists working in towards these career guidance teachers.</P>
      <P>The library service question was raised by Deputy Mrs. Desmond also. Here again, I wish to emphasise the importance of this service.  The library is the hub of the school and the most fundamental thing that we can provide in a school is a good library.  We are very conscious of this and we have spent more than a quarter of a million pounds in providing a new library in each national school in the country. We now have a basic reference library directly financed by the Department in every one of them.  Of course, we are seeking to have the very same type of development at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins mentioned bus fares for schoolchildren who are not eligible for free transport.  I want to emphasise that the recent increase in bus fares will not apply to schoolchildren. I have arranged with the Minister for Finance that the entire cost of increased fares, so far as they relate to schoolchildren, will be met by my Department.  It will cost, in a full year, about £135,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Foley mentioned the importance of physical education.  I am not satisfied with the present position.  We are not producing enough male physical training experts for the post-primary field.  On the female side, institutions such as Ling College and <Col N="2090" /> Sion Hill are producing instructors.  The number available on the male side is totally inadequate.  A committee composed of people interested in this aspect of education and officials of my Department has reported and stated practical requirements.  I hope to have a lot to say on this subject within the next month or two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to the Irish language in a very surprising way and in terms which I do not think should be used by a Deputy coming from Galway city.  He referred deprecatingly to the policy on Irish.  In the very recent past, certain practical steps have been taken in the teaching of Irish.  We have a Language Institute which engages in detailed research methods applicable not merely to Irish but to all languages.  We have new graded courses in Irish in the primary schools. Buntús Cainte has one of the highest Tam ratings on Television.  Over 200,000 copies of the book have been sold.  We want to make Irish attractive and loved for its own sake.  We want it to fit into the environment of the child. We want it appreciated and enjoyed by children.  I feel we can achieve success in this respect.  It is important to get away from the old over-formalised approach to language teaching.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Ó Ceallaigh and other Deputies mentioned free schoolbooks. Last year, the amount provided was £6,000: this year we have jumped to £87,000 for free schoolbooks.  We need to do more but at least we have made substantial progress.</P>

      <P>If I have not referred to every aspect raised by Deputies I hope I shall be forgiven.  If any Deputy wants clarification, I trust he or she will write to me about it.  I feel we are moving into a new area as far as education is concerned. It must be looked at as a unit and as a community obligation and a community purpose.  We cannot isolate any aspect of education.  All aspects of it must be meshed together.  There must be easy transfer from the primary school into the post-primary field.  The record of the assessment of the child's aptitudes is the link.  There must be career guidance also.  It is important that universities should have a community obligation just the same as post-primary establishments.  Too often, the universities have tended to be apart.</P>

      <P>If we regard education as a fundamental community service then all institutes of education must be regarded as meshing into an overall pattern in which there should not be any distinction in entry of pupil at any level.  If we proceed along those lines I am certain we can fully implement the basic motivating principle, namely, equality of opportunity: I am certain we can achieve that objective to the fullest extent necessary in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>This has been a constructive debate, on the whole.  The national Parliament is the place where it should take place. Deputies are sensitive to public opinion and are well aware of the public interest in this matter.  In ten years of Fianna Fáil Government, there has been a jump in State expenditure on education from £15 million to £52 million.  The expenditure of the State on education has more than trebled in the past ten years.  That is a very practical commitment by Fianna Fáil to the Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer in particular this morning to telephone tapping.  I regard this practice as an intrusion on the privacy of the individual.  Considering the present situation in Northern Ireland and the situation elsewhere in the world where freedom is curtailed, I think the practice of telephone tapping utterly deplorable.  A telephone call should <Col N="2095" /> be a very private affair and the practice here is one to which the Minister should put a stop forthwith.  The practice is not in the public interest and public anxiety has been expressed about the practice from time to time. The Minister is invariably reticent about giving information about this practice.  I should like to know whose telephones are tapped and why?  We are not yet, I think, living in a police state.  I should also like to know who sifts whatever information is obtained. The Minister really ought to answer the question.  I should like him to give an assurance that there is, first of all, no need for this practice and, secondly, that it will be discontinued. Are Deputies' telephones tapped?  Are the telephones of those in public positions tapped?  Are the telephones of those who may appear to oppose the present Administration tapped?  This is a very serious matter and airing it here will bring it to public notice.  It is a very obnoxious practice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Special Branch, what exactly is the Special Branch and what is its purpose?  How many men are employed?  What is their function?  Who are the men?  The Minister is always reluctant to give any information about the Special Branch and those who man it.</P>
      <P>Freedom is a very important thing and, because it is, there should be an end to the Special Branch.  I do not know of any determined or serious attempt by anyone to overthrow the State or the Government.  Organisations, irrespective of whom they are constituted, must have the right to free assembly, orderly meetings and public speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On crime in general, vandalism is costing the ratepayers a great deal of money.  Not enough is being done to stop vandalism.  I should like to see the gardaí in their new role with a closer liaison with the people.  It would be an excellent idea if gardaí attended meetings of the various associations and explained to those gathered in such associations the particular problems with which they are faced.  They should also lecture in the schools.  That would engender in the children a greater <Col N="2096" /> respect for the gardaí.  They should be more of the community as well as being in the community.  There should, too, be seminars and post-graduate courses of training.  It might be a good idea if the gardaí had courses in psychology.</P>
    <P>Vandalism might be curtailed by the presence of more plain clothes gardaí. The presence of a garda in uniform may deter potential vandals.  If the gardaí were in plain clothes they would not be easily identifiable because children would not know whether or not they were gardaí.  This would be a deterrent to children who indulge in vandalism.  In my own constituency I see people who are terrorised by children and teenagers, and the police say they are powerless.  They are not properly equipped to deal with this problem. The Force is depleted in the city areas, and the garda are not able to cope with this problem.  That is a serious state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I will refer to one case which occurred recently when an old man who was being terrorised by these people went out to try and stop them. He got excited and died suddenly.  It was a natural death, but I am wondering would he have died if this had not happened.  While these vandals were not directly responsible for his death, I believe they were indirectly responsible. I would have thought that the Garda authorities would make a study of where vandalism is most rife, and have consultations with residents' and tenants' associations to see how it might be curtailed in those areas.  In the same areas where vandalism is rife they might even have consultations with the authorities and the teachers in the schools affected.  That would be a constructive way to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>I have had contact with young people who have been engaged in vandalism and I know that, if you talk to them properly and make them aware of their responsibilities, you can win them around.  That is the approach which should be adopted by the Garda authorities.  Closer consultation with the schools, with parents' associations and tenants' and residents' associations could do a tremendous amount to eliminate vandalism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> I do not intend to say much about prisons.  One point disturbs me.  Many prisoners have reason to write to their solicitors on private matters, and those letters are opened by the Governor of the prison.  What happens between a solicitor and his client, who is a prisoner, must be a very private matter. It is completely wrong that these letters should be opened by the Governor.  He must read them before they are sent to the solicitor.  That is very wrong.  It is an infringement of the privacy of discussion between prisoner and solicitor. I should like the Minister to arrange to have this practice stopped immediately.</P>
    <P>The situation in our prisons is reasonably good.  First offenders can be released on parole if they have employment.  That is good.  I have spoken to many young people about this and I think it is excellent.  The only problem is that we find that so many of these first offenders cannot obtain employment.  I should like to dwell on this for a while.  Once a man has been a prisoner he cannot get a reference, and he is deprived of employment for the rest of his life on so many occasions. I was in touch with a State body about a young boy who was involved in a transaction within that company and was dismissed.  He was faced with a charge the outcome of which might have resulted in his going to prison for three months.  I was told by the State company that they could not give him a reference.</P>
    <P>If he had employment he would be allowed out on parole, but they said that if any prospective employer contacted them, they would have to explain that they had dismissed him, and that would be their reference.  I could not expect them to give a reference to the effect that he was a first-class person, but there must be some way out of this, because if we do not seek a solution to it we are really subjecting these people to a life of crime.  If they cannot take their place in life as ordinary citizens they are being deprived of the right to work and that, in itself, may be the cause of their continuing in a life of crime.</P>
    <P>We must discuss the question of traffic in Dublin city which is a source of concern to so many people.  I should <Col N="2098" /> like the role of the traffic warden to be clarified by the Minister.  I should like to know are they appointed for the sole purpose of collecting revenue, or are they employed to prevent offences against the traffic laws.  I am wondering about the new clearway regulations which came into effect a short time ago. Sometimes we are inclined to have too many regulations and not seek a solution to the problems created by those regulations.</P>
    <P>I know it is not the function of the Minister's Department to provide offstreet parking, but we cannot just make regulations.  Cars have to go somewhere. There should be a closer liaison between the Department of Local Government and the Department of Transport and Power on this matter.  If we establish an inner circle in the city in which there is no parking we must have a proper bus service to bring people into the city.  It is not good enough to make regulations without knowing the problems created by them. Dublin city traffic has proved to be a headache for so many people that immediate attention must be given to it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider a Garda patrol helicopter service, or make use of the existing helicopters to deal with the bottle-necks which arise. He might consider closed circuit television operating from the traffic department in Dublin Castle as an effective measure to relieve the bottle-necks in the city.  When these bottle-necks arise, by the time a Garda can come along to try to solve them, they can reach tremendous proportions and disrupt all the traffic in the area.  Closed circuit television might help to relieve that situation, and I do not think the cost would be phenomenal.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to mention is malicious damage against Corporation tenants.  I do not know whether this comes within the scope of the Minister's Department, but where malicious damage occurs against Corporation tenants they have no redress.  They should have.  They are ratepayers. Other ratepayers have redress but not Corporation tenants.  This should be rectified.  As ratepayers they should be compensated for malicious damage.</P>
    <P>I often see ambulances, fire brigades and police cars on duty with their <Col N="2099" /> sirens sounding, and no attempt made by motorists to pull in to the side to leave them freedom of movement.  I lived for a number of years in the States and I know that when this happens over there it is understood&mdash;it is in the traffic code&mdash;that cars must pull in immediately, to the right in their case.  We should have it explained to the public that cars should pull in immediately to the left and stop to allow free passage.  It is very important that we realise that lives are at stake in matters like this and it should be explained as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one point&mdash;I realise it does not arise on this Estimate&mdash;that concerns the Criminal Justice Bill.  The Minister should endeavour to allay public anxiety about it and anxiety among Members of the Dáil, including his own Party.  I shall not dwell on this, but I repeat there is still anxiety even among his own colleagues and Party about this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Ground Rents Act, I believe it is not working properly. The Act has been in operation for two years and, despite what the Minister's Department say 20 times the ground rent is the amount that is acceptable, whereas if a case is submitted to arbitration it can cost almost anything.  I should like to ask the Minister to comment on what I have said.</P>
    <P>Regarding probation officers, I should like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied with the numbers and whether they are adequate to meet the needs.  There are three vacancies for probation officers in Dublin and I should like to ask when these will be filled.  On the question of courts, the Minister will agree that it takes much too long to litigate cases.  Can something be done about this problem, which concerns so many people?  We speak about modernising proceedings. I saw where last week in the courts a child was asked to give evidence and the judge and counsel removed their wigs.  Could they not remove them permanently?  More than children are overawed and frightened by those wigs which are worn in court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few comments I wish to make in regard to certain subheads in this Estimate. First, I think it is important that public representatives should avail themselves of every suitable opportunity to make the public in this country aware of how fortunate we are with our police force.  Our Garda Síochána have, since their foundation, maintained an outstanding record of public service.  At the present time, when attention has been focussed in many parts of the world on police forces&mdash;and we find that even within the past few days attention has been drawn to the Commission of Inquiry in the United States on the rioting in Chicago on the occasion of the Democratic Convention&mdash; we have had incidents in Northern Ireland and there have been comments on the police force in London during recent demonstrations there.  But it is not sufficiently realised that our police force have been confronted with situations in recent years&mdash;situations which, of course, were by no means as grave as those to which I referred but nevertheless which could have been dangerous and could have led to serious trouble.  However, because the Garda handled those situations in a tactful, firm manner, what might otherwise have been ugly situations were averted. It is important that the public realise how fortunate we in this country are with our police force.</P>
      <P>The present recruits coming into the Garda Síochána, and the younger members of the force, are maintaining the high standards and the great tradition that have been set by the men who founded the force.  It is important that every effort should be made to ensure that our gardaí should be as efficient and effective as possible and that no effort should be spared in making pay and conditions of service as attractive and as good as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point has been made by other Deputies, particularly by Deputy de Valera, on the importance of ensuring that we have a contented police force, and that one of the ways of doing that was to ensure that the pay, living conditions and conditions of service should be as attractive as possible.  Unfortunately, there are certain, legitimate <Col N="2101" /> grievances which the Garda have had for quite a long time.  The condition of some of the Garda barracks in this country is atrocious, and I am ashamed to say that in the city of Limerick we have a building, William Street station, which is the main Garda station, which is a disgrace.  It was condemned years ago as being unfit for human habitation. Various efforts have been made to find an alternative site on which to erect a new station and I urge on the Minister the importance of proceeding with the erection of a proper Garda station in Limerick.  I have been in the William Street barracks on numerous occasions and have been horrified to see the atrocious conditions under which members of the force have to work in that dilapidated building.  It creates a bad impression and is not conductive to high morale, and psychologically, from every point of view, it is bad.  I cannot see any reason why in the third city in this State a proper Garda barracks cannot be established.</P>
    <P>I and other colleagues from Limerick have been asking questions about this problem.  I see no reason why a suitable site in a suitable location cannot be obtained, and I hope when the Minister is replying to the debate he will make some reference to this.  We in Limerick are ashamed of the situation which exists.  I have already paid a tribute to the gardaí for the high standard they are maintaining.  When one looks at the awful conditions under which they have to operate in Limerick city and the dilapidated and antiquated condition of the building, one is amazed at the high standard of efficiency which the members of the force in Limerick reach.</P>
    <P>There is a situation in some rural Garda stations where the condition of the buildings and in particular the living conditions are very bad.  For the past three years I have been making representations consistently to have bathroom and toilet facilities installed in a Garda station in Hospital, County Limerick and there is as yet no sign of this being done.  I have made representations on numerous occasions in this matter.  The Sergeant and his wife and young family are residing in this barracks.  It is a disgraceful <Col N="2102" /> state of affairs that in the year 1968 no proper sanitary services have been provided in this case.  It is a shocking thing that members of the Garda Siochána should be expected to operate efficiently when their living conditions are completely antiquated.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment in recent months about the intention of the Minister and his Department in relation to the smaller Garda stations in rural Ireland.  Rumours have been circulating to the effect that it is the intention to close down certain Garda stations.  I suppose this is in keeping with the policy of Fianna Fáil and an unfortunate consequence of the failure of the Government to maintain the population in rural Ireland.  We had the Minister for Education a short time ago talking about the amalgamation of schools. Now we are confronted with the problem of the closure of Garda stations.</P>
    <P>It has been intimated to me that it is proposed to close down Garda barracks in two or three areas in my constituency.  I had a question down about this matter in recent months. Other Deputies have also been asking questions about it.  I understand that no firm decision has yet been taken.  I would ask the Minister to indicate what his intentions are in relation to this very important matter.  It may be argued and presumably it is being argued that, with greater mobility patrol cars can cover areas formerly served by Gardaí on bicycles or on foot and that a mobile force operating from a central area can cover a much wider area.</P>
    <P>Personally, I should hate to see the situations arising where the smaller country Garda barracks would be closed.  The best tribute that could be paid to the Garda Síochána is that in three villages, where rumour had it that Garda barracks were about to be closed, the people in the villages and surrounding areas were so perturbed that they pleaded with me to make the strongest possible representations to the Minister that the barracks should be kept open.  In one of the areas concerned there is only one Garda station now and one or two business men and others have pressed me very strongly <Col N="2103" /> in recent months to fight for the retention of the barracks.</P>
    <P>The fact that a garda resides in a village is a great deterrent to crime. His presence there and the fact that he has become integrated with the local community is the best deterrent against petty crime or other offences.  I hope the Minister does not intend to effect any drastic closure of the smaller Garda barracks.</P>
    <P>I want to pay particular tribute to the members of the Garda Síochána, with whom, of course, I include the Ban Gharda.  The establishment of a female section of the force was an excellent idea.  The Ban Gharda have justified their existence.  It might be appropriate at this stage to review the position in order to ascertain whether or not there is a case for increasing the number of Ban Gharda in the force. Certainly, so far as Limerick city is concerned, the people have paid tribute, both privately and publicly, to the efficiency of the Ban Ghardaí stationed there.  I should like to go on record as saying that we are very fortunate in the police force that we have in this country and I sincerely hope that the Minister will do everything possible to ensure that their pay, conditions, living quarters, and so on, will leave nothing to be desired.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who has taken part in this debate has referred to delays in the Land Registry in the registration of deeds.  My experience is no different from that of any other Deputy in the sense that scarcely a week goes by without my having a request from a member of the legal profession or a constituent for my intervention with a view to the expedition of registration of certain deeds. I am not familiar with the legal process in the Land Registry but I must say that my representations have always been received there with the utmost courtesy and, particularly when the case justified it, the registration has been expedited.  I think it was Deputy Cunningham who referred to the fact that very often when one goes to the Land Registry in Chancery Street at the request of a constituent <Col N="2104" /> one finds that the necessary document has not been lodged by the solicitor acting for the client.  Be that as it may, and despite the fact that my experience of Chancery Street has been good and that efforts have always been made to meet the case I presented, I do feel that there is need for increasing the staff, that is, if it is a staffing problem and I understand it is, that there is need to reorganise the whole operation there with a view to having more efficient machinery to deal with the whole question of the registration of deeds.</P>
    <P>I am personally interested in the problem of juvenile delinquency. Other Deputies have referred to this matter and particularly to St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin for juvenile offenders.  I was very interested to find a new development in this field when I had occasion to visit Shanganagh Castle.  I think I am right in saying this is a country mansion with an estate of some 20 or 30 acres out at Foxrock, which was acquired by the Department of Justice for use as a remand home.  I had occasion to go out there to visit a constituent who unfortunately landed himself in trouble, and I was most impressed by the system which is in operation there.  I was facilitated in every possible way by the officer in charge.  Both he and members of his staff showed me right through the building and gave me full information on the operation of the system.  This might well be a model for future development in this country. About 20 or 30 young chaps are getting an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves there so that they will be able to take up their places as useful members of society.  They have the opportunity of attending classroom instruction as well as practical instruction in various trades.  I was very pleased to see this in practice and I sincerely hope that this is but the start of an entirely new approach to the problem of unfortunate young people who find themselves in trouble, particularly where there has been no background of delinquency.</P>
    <P>What I have said in relation to the new development at Shanganagh Castle might be related to the whole approach <Col N="2105" /> to the prison service.  I have had occasion, as have most other Deputies, to visit various prisons in this country to discharge one of the corporal works of mercy, and whilst I am not old enough to make a categorical statement on this point, I do feel that a tremendous change has come over the prison service. In Mountjoy, Portlaoise and Limerick, to name three prisons which I have had occasion to visit, the aim is rehabilitation.  I am convinced that this policy is one which will pay very big dividends.</P>
    <P>The system whereby certain categories of prisoners are allowed out during the day time in the latter stages of their term of imprisonment is a very good idea.  Where a person has been committed to prison for a long period, when that term of imprisonment is up and the door is opened and he is thrown into the outside world, he has not merely the psychological problems of readjustment but very often a practical problem in the matter of securing suitable employment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there are many enlightened employers who are prepared, and have given evidence on a number of occasions of their desire, to assist in rehabilitating such people. I have seen examples of where enlightened employers, motivated by Christian charity, have given a chance to people who have served a term of imprisonment, and in most cases the trust placed by the employer in these people has been justified.  I hope the aim will be to continue, if possible, to accelerate the progress being made in this whole matter of trying to rehabilitate the people who are unfortunate enough to fall foul of the law and find they have to serve a term of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>One final point I want to make&mdash;I do not know whether I am in order or out of order, but I am sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle you will guide me on it&mdash;is on the question of drug taking. There has been a lot of concern generated&mdash;how much of it is justified I am not in a position to say&mdash;about the question of drug taking and about a traffic in drugs in this country.  A great deal of publicity has been given to this, and, as a Deputy representing <Col N="2106" /> an urban constituency, I am aware of the concern on the part of many parents for quite a considerable time past in relation to the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of the establishment of a special commission of inquiry into this matter.  It is a very serious and horrifying problem.  The establishment of this commission of inquiry is a good thing.  Certain criticism has been levelied at one newspaper, the <i>Evening Herald</i>, and allegations have been made that this paper was exaggerating the problem.  I want to be put on record as saying that this newspaper has performed a very useful service.  The fact that the Minister has now taken action in the matter will be welcomed by very many people.  I sincerely hope, and I am sure every Deputy would likewise hope, that following the Minister's investigation into the problem it will be revealed it is not of very great magnitude. However, if there is evidence of any large-scale or any increasing interest in drug taking and in the traffic in drugs, I hope the Minister will take appropriate action, and I think I am right in saying he can be assured of the full support of all Parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a very comprehensive statement in introducing his Estimate and therefore the burden on us of referring to matters is considerably lessened.  I have heard with sympathy what Deputy O'Donnell had to say on the subject of drug taking. Perhaps what I am going to say is unpopular, but I propose to say it all the same.  I do not believe the Minister for Justice can reasonably call on this House to discharge the duty that devolves on every parent to look after his own children.  The Minister for Justice has a very grave duty, which I hope he will discharge, and that is that if there is brought to his notice the arrival in this country of drug pushers, namely, people who sell drugs or try to persuade juveniles to buy drugs, they will be mercilessly dealt with by the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is no use in parents laying the soothing unction to their souls that they can shuffle off on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice or the Government the obligation to look after their <Col N="2107" /> own children which they undertook when they brought them into the world. Looking after your own children involves not only love and affection but a recognition that they must be taught, in the years when they are under parental care, the disciplines requisite to live a decent life.  Let us make it as clear as we can make it from our experience as administrators that there is no substitute available either in Dáil Éireann or in the Executive Government for parental care.  I should like to hear&mdash;I think it would be useful&mdash; from the Minister a declaration that, in so far as the evil exists, the full rigour of the law will be invoked against those who seek to make a profit out of the demoralisation of the young.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this occasion to say that I congratulate the Minister on the institution of traffic wardens.  The removal of the constant conflict between members of the Garda and the motoring public is a most admirable development. I have read repeated comments relating to the British police force on how intolerable a burden that conflict is becoming in Britain and how it gives rise to misunderstanding and antagonism between the ordinary people and the police when ordinary people get it into their heads that they are being unreasonably harried for parking offences.</P>
    <P>I find the traffic wardens to be responsible and sensible, mostly elderly men, controlling the activities of the irregular parker with reasonable prudence and diligence.  I think that already the removal of this responsibility from members of the Garda is yielding dividends in reducing the occasions of conflict between members of the Garda and ordinary, normally law-abiding citizens who are involved in minor traffic offences which cannot be regarded in the ordinary way as breaches of the law.</P>
    <P>There is a forgotten microscopic population of the country which is constantly present to my mind and I am in a perennial dilemma in trying to bring it before the House.  It is tiny groups of children in Marlborough House.  We have the fantastic set-up <Col N="2108" /> that there is one quasi-penal institute in the country which, for some extraordinary reason, remains under the administrative control of the Minister for Education but the children in it are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I was not able to find out, not even when I was a Member of the Government, why this extraordinary dichotomy of responsibility is allowed to continue but inasmuch as the children on remand are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice I ask him to approach his colleague, the Minister for Education, and ask him how in conscience can he continue to allow children committed to his care by the Minister for Justice on remand to continue in the state they are in in Marlborough House.</P>
    <P>I began this campaign 30 years ago when these children were in an old barred house in Summerhill and the present President, Mr. de Valera was acting as Minister for Education.  I remember describing to him the conditions at Summerhill and inveighing against them as being intolerable and I remember him saying: &ldquo;I will go down to Summerhill&rdquo;.  I think he did go there but to my amazement and alarm, the only result of his journey was for him to say: &ldquo;If one of my children went wrong I should not be a bit unhappy if they were brought down to Summerhill&rdquo;.  Of course, he was a man of very austere standards. However, after a protracted battle, I think it was the late Deputy Derrig I eventually prevailed on to close up Summerhill and we removed the children to Marlborough House.</P>
    <P>I thought a new day had dawned but I am told that in Marlborough House still the children are all sitting down in a large room.  I believe the Superintendent is an excellent man.  I do not suppose he has any special qualifications for dealing with children.  There is no entertainment, no instruction and no provision for them.  I think they are allowed out to Mass on Sunday but there was a time in Summerhill when they would not be allowed out to Mass on Sunday.  I doubt if they have any facilities for confessions or receiving Holy Communion while there.  This is one of these crazy oversights.  This institution <Col N="2109" /> should be under the control of the Minister for Justice.  I suspect it is regarded in Marlborough Street as a sort of unreasonable imposition in which nobody is taking any interest.  It is not an educational establishment and yet it does not come within the purview of the officers of the Department of Justice who would ordinarily draw the Minister's attention to the situation if they felt it did not measure up to standards ordinarily required.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that where children are on remand or in transit from one industrial school to another&mdash;there are never more than 30 or 40 of them in the place but their ages range from three or four up to 16&mdash;these children should be looked after and, even if it is manifestly uneconomic, some instruction of an occupational or educational kind should be provided for them without regard to the economics of the operation.  Secondly, I ask that, while they are in that detention home on remand from one children's court to the next, a child psychiatrist should be retained who would prepare a report on the child's psychiatric condition and on the family background which would constitute part of the material laid before the district justice in the children's court when he or she&mdash;I believe it is a lady at present&mdash;is called upon finally to dispose of the child.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister had occasion since taking office to visit Marlborough House, and I suppose there is a certain amount of delicacy about his visiting an institution that is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, but I am quite satisfied that if the Minister for Justice went down there and took the Minister for Education with him they would find nothing scandalous and nothing that they need be ashamed of.  But they would find a condition which is manifestly below the standard which ought to obtain.  There is not a large number of children involved but this is something which has always troubled me and it still troubles me, although I imagine that conditions are now considerably better than when the matter was first brought to my attention regarding the old establishment in Summerhill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> I know of the intention of the Department of Justice to reduce the numbers of the Garda Síochána.  I know from the Minister's introductory remarks that he is doing this with due regard to the incidence of crime.  I believe that the reason we have such a low incidence of crime in rural Ireland is because of the presence of the Garda Síochána.  Where there is a Garda station in a rural area the gardaí become not only the protectors but also the friends of the people.  It is a most interesting thing that when a minor offence, such as housebreaking, is committed in a rural area, the gardaí will be on the track of the offender.  They will say: &ldquo;That is Tommy McGann at it again, you would know his track&rdquo;.  Because of this familarity with the neighbours, the gardaí are able to nip crime in the bud in the area in which they live.  They turn the whole community into an auxiliary police force because the general feeling is that, if one goes to the sergeant and tells him who the miscreant probably is, the information is not received with detached vindictiveness.  The sergeant is known to be a friendly and a reasonably prudent man and he will act in a reasonable and prudent way.</P>
    <P>If the gardaí are taken away and cases of petty offences are left to itinerant police patrols from relatively remote centres, there is a great danger, particularly in rural Ireland, of the local community becoming a closed unit against the gardaí to shelter their neighbours from the gardaí.  That is a way of building up crime in rural Ireland.  There is no need for me to labour that point to the Minister for Justice who, I think, has spent most of his life in a community similar to that with which the rest of us who represent rural constituencies are familiar. I would therefore urge the Minister not to consider the general closing down of Garda stations in rural Ireland because the gardaí are the bulwark of the admirable record we have of the absence of serious crime in our community.</P>
    <P>Another thing which the Minister is familiar with and which, I think, he is endeavouring to remedy is the problem that exists in relation to the <Col N="2111" /> Registry of Titles and Deeds, or is it the Register of Titles or Deeds?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience, whenever I had a particular problem I received nothing but courtesy and help in the Land Registry, but infrequently I have had the same experience as that mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell as regards delay.  I discovered that the delay is not in the Land Registry but in the solicitor's office.  Undoubtedly, there is delay and undue delay in the Land Registry.  It is not necessary for me to press that view to the Minister who is himself a solicitor because he must have heard this story repeatedly from his own colleagues in the profession. I gather that the problem is one of recruiting staff.  I do not know what particular expertise is required in the Department; perhaps the Minister will help me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were the case of young solicitors they could be got more readily by raising their salaries.  However, the matter is one of urgency and I need hardly tell the Minister for Justice that the Registry is made the alibi for any number of solicitors who have allowed dust to collect on their files.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us distribute the blame as equitably as we may.  That fact, notwithstanding, I think the Minister knows as well as I do that there is undue delay in the Registry for the reasons he has mentioned and I am glad that he is doing what he can to right it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask about something that is approaching a scandal and that is the matter of paying jurors.  The number of people required to do jury service is certainly shrinking but the numbers of people in the categories who are exempted from doing jury service are growing and the burden of <Col N="2112" /> the rest who have to do jury service is growing proportionally.  The people who are called for jury service, particulary those who work for wages or who are self-employed people in a small business, are bearing an intolerable burden.</P>
    <P>I regard jury service as a very valuable element in our whole judicial system.  I am gravely apprehensive that the Minister, conscious of the problem I am now mentioning, may be swayed in his judgment unduly to reduce the occasions for jury trial.  I know there is a very strong agitation to eliminate juries altogether in civil actions.  I hope the Minister will not be unduly swayed in any legislation he may have in contemplation to that end by the fact that the burden of jury service tends to become more onerous on the restricted number of people who are liable to it.</P>
    <P>I take the view strongly that where one litigant asks for a jury he should have the right to get it and that a judicial decision should not be substituted for a jury decision unless both litigants indicate their readiness to accept that procedure.  If the Minister can persuade the Minister for Finance to provide not only an adequate but I think a rewarding fee for jury service, he will find that the burden on the Exchequer will be relatively insignificant but that a very great hardship will be abated and that people, instead of regarding jury service as an appalling catastrophe, may come to accept it as all in the day's work and, in certain cases, a welcome respite reasonably and adequately remunerated.</P>
    <P>I heard with interest from Deputy O'Donnell that he has been out in Shanganagh Castle.  Is that to be the new Borstal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There used to be a Borstal at Clonmel.  Our Government did that.  We transferred it to Mountjoy which I think was a great mistake. We did it in a mistaken desire to bring the young delinquents within visitation reach of their parents.  Is it to close down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2113" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention about Shanganagh was that we would more or less separate the wheat from the chaff.  We would separate the young boys who we felt showed the best chances of rehabilitation from the hardened chaps and send them to Shanganagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people get sentimental about Borstal&mdash;&ldquo;harmless youths&rdquo;, &ldquo;shameful to lock them up&rdquo;, and so on.  Some of these youths are not so harmless at all.  They are very tough operators.  I think the Minister is wise, in some measure, to segregate them in so far as he can.  The inter-Party Government moved the Borstal from Clonmel and accommodated it in a premises immediately adjoining Mountjoy Jail.  The reason was that experience proved that the bulk of the inmates of the Borstal came from in or around Dublin.  It was thought to be a humanitarian gesture to locate them in a centre where they would not be completely cut off from their parents and it would be possible for their parents to visit them regularly and maintain the family connection.  In retrospect, I think that was a mistake.  I think it would have been better to maintain the institution in Clonmel until we could find premises such as Shanganagh Castle, near Dublin, where a suitable institution could be established quite divorced from the prison cell.  Every Government makes mistakes and, in that matter, I think we made a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In starting at Shanganagh, I think the Minister is right in shifting, as he says himself, the readily redeemable elements who are finding their way into Saint Patrick's and segregating them from the hard chaws, if I may use the word.  But let us not forget the hard chaws.  I should not like to see them left&mdash;perhaps a dozen of them, really difficult and quite formidable adolescents&mdash;virtually in Mountjoy.  If we are to adopt the segregation policy suggested by the Minister, and for which I see great force, I think there is an immense additional responsibility on him to show a very special solicitude and anxiety for the hard chaws that are left there if they are not to be turned, in their adolescence, into potential <Col N="2114" /> recidivists in jail.  Handling the adolescent misdemeanant is an extremely difficult job; I would utter a word of caution.  If we segregate them, in the euphoria of redeeming the redeemable, let us not forget the very special obligations which devolve upon us in respect of the residue who are still our neighbour's children and, however difficult, are still entitled to our special solicitude.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied about the establishment at Daingean?  I do not want to suggest to the House that I am dissatisfied.  We have Marlborough House.  We have industrial schools.  A child cannot be committed now, I think, to an industrial school.  There used to be a system under the School Attendance Act by which children were sent to industrial schools by the courts: I think that is ended.  There is Daingean and then there is what we call Saint Patrick's&mdash;what we used to call the Borstal.  Are we satisfied that Daingean provides all the amenities for the rehabilitation of the youths who are sent there?  Can the Minister assure the House that he has visited that institution and is satisfied that they have at their disposal there all the facilities they need to carry out the very difficult job they have to perform?  If the Minister can give that assurance, I should be prepared to rest upon it. I shall apply to his Department shortly for permission to visit some of these institution myself, which I have not done for a great many years.  I did so at one time in order to know what was going on in the establishment that was there before Daingean was established. In fact, I think I was in some measure responsible for having the reformatory transferred from Glencree to Daingean.  I visited Summerhill, as I say, and all the prisons.  That was some time ago but I take it that, if I desire today to visit these places again in a responsible way, facilities will be available to me.  <i>Ad interim</i>, I do not want to suggest that I have any reason to complain but I would be glad if the Minister would say to us that he has had time to visit Daingean and is satisfied that the priests who are responsible there have at their disposal all the facilities they consider necessary for its proper administration.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag ceapadh, fé mar adubhairt an Teachta Dillon, go mbeadh sé i bhfadh nios fearr na stáisiúin Gharda a fhágáil oscailte. Ní dheineann an &ldquo;squad car&rdquo; an obair chomh maith leis an gharda féin mar bíonn an gluaisteán amuigh faoin tír i rith an lae agus go díreach ag an am is mó a bhíonn sé ag teastáil.  Bíonn an garda ann ó mhaidin go hoíche ach ní bhíonn an gluaisteán ann.  An t-am is mó a bhíonn gá leis an ghluaisteán agus na gardaí b'fhéidir go mbíonn an gluaisteán ós cionn scór míle ón áit ina mbíonn gá leis.  Tá an gluaisteán níos costasúla ná garda amháin a fhágáil sa bhearaic, go mór mhór más bearaic roint nua atá ann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin with a few remarks on certain matters that concern my constituency. First, I should like to refer to Garda stations in country districts.  The time has come when there should be running water, bathrooms, showerbaths and all the rest, for men after they come in from duty, be they small or large stations.  Some of these stations are old and worn out, with uneven concrete floors, <i>et cetera</i>.  There are in the cities and larger towns a number of young gardaí who get married early in life and in Galway, particularly, they find it next to impossible to get flats.  Because of their low income, they are reluctant to get themselves involved in the large sums of money necessary to provide them with new houses.  Some of them may be only a few months, or at most two or three years, in the stations before they are transferred unless they are lucky enough to climb the ranks.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates the amounts such gardaí have to pay for flats in cities like Galway.  The Department contemplated the building of some houses for them and I urge the Minister to see that they are built, particularly in a seaside resort like Galway.</P>
      <P>From time to time we hear discussions and little cribs among the personnel in the Garda.  I suggest there should be a seniority list drawn up among the members of the Force.  For instance, there may be a garda who has served ten, 15 or 20 years in a country station.  He may see a younger man transferred to a city and he may wonder why he, during his long years of service, did not get such a chance. Perhaps he may be a married man with a family who would like to go to a city where he would have better educational facilities for his children. In such cases, a seniority list would be of great value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> Deputy Dillon spoke about the Land Registry, about delays in registration. I agree with him and I ask the Minister to see if there is anything he can do to have the registration of deeds expedited. I know it is a long and tedious job.</P>
    <P>It has been found necessary, apparently, to close a number of Garda stations in country areas and I often wonder if it is sensible or right to do so.  The people in those areas nowadays look up to the Garda stations in their areas.  In the past they thought policemen were just put there to prosecute them but they are finding nowadays that the gardaí are their friends and protectors, particularly since housebreaking has become so prevalent throughout the country.  Therefore, if there was only one man in a station, it would be much better to keep the station there.  I know such areas are covered by squad cars but one such car has to cover from five to nine Garda station areas.  I do not think such a system gives adequate coverage and I suggest that if the Minister went into the matter he would find that even one man in a station would work out cheaper in the long run and give a better service than a squad car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>Fianna Fáil generally have more than one in the gap. If the Minister goes into the cost of the new car, the question of wear and tear&mdash;tyres, petrol and so forth&mdash;I think he will find that a Garda station with one man would work out cheaper. There might be a serious accident in an area and the squad car might be in some other part of the district and it might be hours before it could reach the scene.  The squad car might get a breakdown.  I suggest that the Minister would be doing a good day's work if, by this time next year&mdash;let there be no doubt about it, he will be here this time next year as Minister for Justice &mdash;he had considered this matter.</P>

      <P>The amount of State subsidy towards the cost of Dublin Corporation housing will have increased by an estimated 99 per cent in the five years to 31st March next. In these circumstances I do not consider an increase in subsidy of the sort mentioned by the Deputy would be justified.</P>
      <P>I may add that I have already introduced a special subsidy for flats in buildings over five storeys and relaxed the conditions for the payment of subsidy for the re-housing of subtenants from local authority houses.

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would consider abolishing the differential in subsidies?  At the moment, either one-third or two-thirds, according to the merits of the case is paid to get a family rehoused.  If there were a flat rate of two-thirds it would help very much indeed.  The Corporation does not or should not house people who do not qualify for housing. The application of a flat rate of two-thirds subsidy would ease the position greatly and the amount saved in investigation of cases would materially help to reduce costs.</P>

The subsidy paid by the State has grown from £.6 million in 1948-49 to an estimated £4.2 million in the present year.  That is a substantial increase.</P>

    <P>According to the latest estimate submitted to me by the Corporation, they expect in 1968/69 to have capital expenditure of approximately £6,700,000 on local authority housing and land acquisition, excluding the Ballymun scheme for which a provisional capital allocation of £2,500,000 has been made in the current financial year.  In compiling their Estimates for 1968/69, the Corporation provided for net current expenditure on local authority housing of about £1,680,000.</P>
    <P>Note: Capital expenditure is incurred in providing or substantially reconstructing houses and in acquiring land.  It is financed largely by borrowing.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure is incurred in paying loan charges and in maintenance and administrative costs.  The figures for current expenditure are for the net expenditure borne on the rates after taking account of receipts from State subsidy, rents and annuities and miscellaneous sources.</P>
    <P>The Corporation's receipts from State subsidy amounted, approximately, to £989,000 in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> £1,126,000 in 1966-67 and £1,200,000 in 1967-68 and are expected to amount to about £1,700,000 in 1968-69.</P>

    <P>The high cost of the 3-roomed flat is, I understand, due to abnormally high acquisition and development costs on some schemes which were comprised mainly of such flats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not talk as if he knew the answer to everything.  Is it not a fact that if flats are built on top of each other there is only the one price of land involved, or does the Minister give a new price for every floor he builds?</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that these figures represent an extraordinarily high price for flats, with the eventual end result of high rents for the people who will tenant them, would the Minister not consider that it presents an unanswerable case for the control of the price of houses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that, from the figures he has given, there is a strong case to be made in favour of single-storey houses on the ordinary traditional lines rather than for high-rise flat building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ordinary traditional style is more two-storey than single-storey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, two-storey? It looks as if the case is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain cases the comparatively high-rise flats are practically essential because of the type of site that <Col N="2129" /> is involved and the demand there is for accommodation in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister appreciates that there has been a marked increase in building costs in recent times?  If so, will he not agree that the time is at hand for a marked improvement in the rate of reconstruction grants?  Personally, I think the percentage rate is all right &mdash; 66? per cent &mdash; but there is a maximum of £140.  Would the Minister not agree that that should be increased sharply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultations between my Department and building interests are held from time to time when it is considered that they will serve a useful purpose.  I do not think that the consultations suggested by the Deputy would do this.  As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a question on the 28th November, the effects of wholesale and turnover taxes on building costs are mitigated by the fact that many building materials are exempt from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>The delay in reviewing the estimate in this case is due mainly to difficulties which have arisen in determining the expenditure properly chargeable to the scheme of work for which a grant from my Department could be made available.  Although the applicant indicated originally that he intended to apply to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for a grant for a water supply to his farm and farmyard, in addition to the domestic supply, he has not yet done so. The maximum Local Government grant is being paid next week and the estimate will then be completed for the purposes of supplementary grant payment by the local authority on the assumption that no further work is being carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has any immediate plans to introduce new legislation, or to amend existing legislation, to curtail the sweeping powers of city and county managers and generally democratise and reorganise local government so that the elected representatives and the public generally, will have a more effective function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion in the Deputy's question that city and county managers have sweeping powers or the implication that the present system of local government is undemocratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall control of the affairs of each local authority is vested in a council elected by the local government electors of the area.  Day-to-day administration is vested in the hands of a manager.  In carrying out his duties, however, the <Col N="2141" /> manager operates under the general supervision of the council and is expected to have regard to their wishes. The Management Acts enable the members, subject to certain limited reservations, to direct the manager as to how any of his functions is to be exercised in any particular case.  The members may also obtain prior information about the way in which a manager proposes to perform any specified function and the manager must always inform them before undertaking any new works.  Decisions involving financial policy and all other major issues are matters for the elected members; these include making rates, borrowing money, making a development plan and so on.  I am satisfied that the system enables elected members to maintain effective control over the administration and direction of local government in their areas.</P>
    <P>I should emphaise that the whole system of local government, including the operation of the Management Acts, is constanly under review in my Department with a view to the formulation of proposals for any changes which may be found desirable in the light of experience.  The original Management Acts have already been amended on a number of occasions to remedy deficiencies which had come to light and to incorporate new provisions to enable the system to operate more smoothly and effectively.  Accordingly, I do not consider that the introduction of legislation to make radical alterations in the system on the lines suggested by the Deputy is warranted. Indeed, I might point out that experience of the system has clearly established that active and effective councillors can make it work efficiently and democratically, as was intended by the framers of the original legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that despite the activity of councillors it remains for the manager to exercise his functions which very often he refers to as being managerial functions which can override and overrule decisions made by the councillors?  Surely that is not in keeping with present-day thinking particularly when we call ourselves a democracy?

As a result of this study, which covered the period up to July, 1968, recommendations by An Foras Forbartha for the most suitable lay-out for the intersection were made available to the Council on the 14th November, together with approval to the provision of traffic light signals in accordance with those recommendations. It is accordingly a matter for the council now to proceed with the provision of traffic lights at the intersection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give the present number of cars in the Dublin region; whether any estimates are available of the number in 1980; and whether there are any plans to meet this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of private cars registered in the Dublin area, i.e., Dublin County, Dublin County Borough, and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire on 10th August, 1968, was 101,266. I have no official estimate for the number of vehicles in the area in 1980, but various studies undertaken indicate that there will be a substantial increase over today's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of plans is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned. However, I would like to make the following comments.  In the light of the problems presented by increasing traffic in the Dublin area, it is clear that in the short-term the <Col N="2149" /> most effective measures will result from the maximum use of modern traffic management techniques in order to get the optimum use from the existing street system; indeed such measures will always play a significant part in dealing with the traffic problems of an urban area like Dublin.  A number of interests are involved in the preparation and operation of traffic management measures, and to ensure coordination a standing committee representing these interests keeps all proposals to improve traffic flow in the city under constant review.  Proposals being implemented or considered include, in addition to the extension of the clearway system to all radial routes, extensions and modifications of oneway street systems, the provision of integrated systems of traffic signals in the central city area, the provision of further off-street parking facilities, and the introduction of new forms of parking control.</P>
    <P>A long-term solution, based on the provision of a modern, efficient road network, must largely await decisions on studies already completed or under way, financial studies and the settlement by the local authorities of planning objectives in their development plans.  In the meantime a limited number of useful road reconstructions and improvements are in hands or planned.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>It has been made clear many times, in the Dáil and elsewhere, that it is the wish of the community that pay and conditions should continue to be settled by the processes of bargaining which have been developed in this country.</P>
      <P>The Government do not propose to interfere with those processes, and neither, as far as I am aware, do employers or workers.</P>
      <P>There is a desire, which the Government share, to improve the position of the lower-paid worker.  However, this cannot be done through the wage structure as long as the better paid classes insist on using to the full the bargaining power which they have under our system.</P>
      <P>When speaking in the House on the 26th November on the Financial Resolutions, I invited attention to this and urged that better off sections should be prepared to let the lot of the lower paid worker improve without making demands for maintaining differentials.</P>

      <P>In my reply on the Estimate this morning I emphasised the rational thinking behind the Government's decision in regard to achieving a degree of co-ordination between the two universities and with that in view I announced a proposal to the effect that the professional disciplines should be unified into one single school in each case.  In regard to the professional bodies concerned in the matter, there has been complete approval from a wide-ranging number of responsible prominent medical people in the city and in the country who see the wisdom of having a single medical school.  Similar support has come from the professional bodies concerned with the engineering and veterinary professions.  The argument for having single professional schools in the city is very heavily weighted in favour of doing this if we are to preserve and improve our <Col N="2172" /> standards of higher education in these professional qualifications.</P>
      <P>My proposals are now with the Higher Education Authority who are receiving deputations and discussing all aspects of the higher education proposals with all bodies concerned, the university authorities, the staff associations and the students' bodies.  It is going through this very desirable process of consultation.  I would hope that the matter will be resolved in about three months.  The Higher Education Authority will report back to me as to what legislation is needed to implement what are very desirable decisions not only in this field but in the whole field of education.</P>

The real fear is that if we do not do this, particularly in medicine&mdash;and professors and medical people believe this &mdash;we will face the situation of declining standards.  If we spread our resources so thinly in the future that we have two separate universities in Dublin competing for scarce resources&mdash;remember, substantial investment will be required in both spheres of study, medicine and engineering, as well as the other professions&mdash;substantially higher investment will be required for post-primary study and research.  Unless we have the combination of a single medical school in Dublin located in Trinity College and allied to the proposed two main teaching hospitals envisaged by the Minister for Health&mdash;one on the north side of Dublin and one on the south side&mdash;our medical education of the future will not be up to the standards required.</P>

From a medical point of view, I think it is important for the Minister to realise that consultation is vital, not because it affects this generation or the next.  It is terribly important that the Minister does not ride roughshod over the House.  He should decide now that he must have more consultations.  We know he said this but he also said that, whether they like it or not, he will go ahead and do it.</P>

      <P>We are consulting all round the place.  Deputy Dillon says we are consulting too much and you say we are not consulting enough.  The reality of the matter is that it is not a question of money but we will want substantially heavier investment in higher education in the years ahead if we are to allocate the resources available to us in the future.  Looking to the future&mdash;we are planning 15 years ahead&mdash;and having regard to the sort of investment needed, we can only have it with a unified university structure in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension in 1951 was 20/- a week.  There was then no contributory pension scheme.  In 1965 maximum non-contributory and contributory old age pensions were 47/6 and 50/- respectively. The percentage increase in old age pension since 1951 is almost three times as great as the rise in the consumer price index.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as contributory pension is concerned, payment of an allowance for a wife continues unchanged when she attains the age of 70 years.  If, however, she has no means and would qualify for a non-contributory old age pension at the maximum rate, she can apply in the normal way for that pension.  If old age non-contributory pension becomes payable to her, the dependant's allowance received by the husband as part of his contributory pension, of course, terminates.</P>
      <P>There would have been no assessment of means in relation to the contributory pension which is not subject to a means test or assessable as means.</P>

      <P>If this is so I suggest to the Deputy that the difficulty does not lie in the hire purchase arrangements but in relation to the quality of the goods supplied.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in relation to hired out television sets there is often a hidden clause that they must be retained and paid for for two years?  Even if they break down they must be paid for. Should it not be necessary that before people sign a contract they should be told that this was one of the conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that this is so and the Deputy will realise that he is now referring to the renting of sets as distinct from hire purchase.  However, from personal observation I was under the impression that most of the firms renting television sets provide a service for repair which is quite satisfactory. In regard to the question of the length of time for which one is bound, this is normally made quite clear even in their advertisement in the newspapers apart from the actual negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is reading a different newspaper from the one I read because I never saw a statement in any newspaper that a person must pay for two years even for a purchased set because with some of them it is possible to rent at a diminishing cost which is a form of hire purchase but if after having it for a period something goes wrong or if because of a drop in circumstances or moving out of the area a person wants to return it he must pay whether the set is working or not.</P>

I have indicated my acceptance, in principle, of the recommendations in the report and I have asked the hospital authorities concerned, that is, Dublin Health Authority, the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals and St. Vincent's <Col N="2193" /> Hospital, in association with their medical staffs, to consider the matter and report to me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services <Col N="2195" /> has recommended that, because of the proximity to Cork city of Mallow and its surrounding area, the acute hospital services for this area should be provided from the major hospital centre in Cork.  The Council also recommended that the role of the present county hospital in Mallow should be changed to that of a community health centre.  Such a centre would provide inpatient services for normal maternity patients, for some medical cases and for geriatric patients. In addition, it would have a wide range of consultant outpatient services, including radiology and other diagnostic facilities.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that I am in agreement in principle with the recommendations of the Consultative Council.

I am aware that the lands are in need of rehabilitation and this will also have to be undertaken before allotment takes place.</P>

      <P>The area of arable land on hands of the Land Commission in County Wicklow at 31st March, 1968, was 1,300 acres, approximately. It is not possible to indicate when the individual estates comprised in this acreage will be allotted but there will be no avoidable delay.  The necessary local inquiries preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>
      <P>It is expected that an area of about 1,100 acres will be allotted in County Wicklow in the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why his Department are responsible for carrying out repairs and <Col N="2201" /> improvement works to the embankment protection at the holding next to that of a person (name supplied) and will not accept responsibility for repairing the breach in the protective wall in this holding; and whether he is aware that, if repairs are not carried out immediately, there is a danger that the holding, for which his Department accepted responsibility and on which they spent large sums of money in the past few years, will be flooded because of his Department's refusal to repair the adjoining wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the sale of the first-mentioned holding under the Land Act, 1903, it was established that the landlord was liable for the repair and maintenance of the seawall and sluices on the holding.  Accordingly, a maintenance trust fund, contributed by the landlord out of the purchase money of his estate, was set up to assist the tenant purchaser in carrying out repairs and maintenance to these works.</P>
      <P>No such fund was established in respect of the second-mentioned holding because liability for coast protection works was not admitted by the landlord and could not be proved against him.  As intimated in my reply to the Deputy's previous Question on 4th July last, any remedial work on this holding is not a matter for the Land Commission; it seems more appropriate for consideration by the county council and the Commissioners of Public Works under the provisions of the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  The Deputy is aware that a proposal for the repair of a seawall in this area has been received by the Commissioners of Public Works from the Kerry County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there was a loose stone fence dividing the farms, that his Department have spent a good share of money during the past few years to protect one of the farms from the sea and that if something is not done there is a danger that all the good work will be washed away?  The Department have put down a concrete butt where the loose stone fence had been to keep the water from flowing from one farm to the other.  I know this area <Col N="2202" /> very well because I go for walks there and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the problem is that there is a fund to look after the first-mentioned farm but not the second one.  The most recent reports I have got do not disclose any danger to the second holding arising from the adjoining lands. In any case, as I have made it clear, this is not a matter for the Department of Lands but for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authourity have submitted proposals under the 1963 Coast Erosion Act but there is no hope of a scheme being implemented earlier than two years.  As I have said, I visit this place frequently. The concrete but was put down either by the landholder or by the Department of Lands to make sure that the water would not get through into the other holding.  There is a great danger that one high tide will do severe damage to this holding which the Department have been protecting through the years.  Something should be done immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission are not spending money on the other holding mentioned by the Deputy.  The money which is being spent comes from a trust fund and it is operated by the Land Commission. We could not do this in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The work is carried out by employees of the Minister.  In view of the fact that there is a danger that one high tide can offset completely the protection work that has been done, I urge on the Minister to have this matter attended to immediately. A few years ago it could have been done for £300 or £400. Now it will cost £4,000 or £5,000.</P>

      <P>This area which is extensively used by the public is regarded by my Department as an area of high public amenity, a view which is endorsed by both Bord Fáilte and the planning authority.

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why landless men do not get land from the Land Commission while many of them have been brought up on farms and have worked for years in the home farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Landless applicants are not excluded from the categories of persons to whom lands may be allotted and where the disposal of lands which are not required for the structural reform of uneconomic holdings or other priority commitments is concerned, the claims of such applicants in any locality are always carefully considered by the Land Commission.  Preference is then given to those who have experience of the working of land and who have sufficient capital or stock to enable them to work any land that might be allotted to them.  In practice, however, the needs of the structural reform programme are such that the landless men must of necessity take a low place in the allotment queue.  The extent of genuine congestion still awaiting solution amongst the people exclusively or <Col N="2204" /> mainly dependent on agriculture for a livelihood requires that the main emphasis on land policy must be directed towards them.</P>
      <P>I dealt with this matter of priorities in the allocation of land when replying to the debate on the Lands Estimate on 24th October last; cols. 1295 and 1296 of the Official Report of that date are relevant and I would refer the Deputy to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What greater congestion can there be than among three or four men trying to exist on a small area of land, even in cases like County Meath?  Is it not time these got fair consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that, where there is a small farmer rearing a family and living wholly or mainly from the produce of the land, he should be given first preference. Because there are a large number of these people with holdings which are not sufficiently large to give them a reasonable standard of living, obviously we must concentrate on them before concerning ourselves with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister say this when he knows that, even in his own area, people who have been reared on small farms and whose opportunity to get land is reduced because of the system of dividing land in their areas have to emigrate because they are not given portions of land when it is being divided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, all uneconomic holders within a mile of the estate being divided get first consideration after those employed on the estate have been catered for.  As a general rule, when all those people are catered for there is rarely any land left for division among others.  After the claims of estate employees and uneconomic holders in the areas concerned have been catered for, then other categories are considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the system of the Land Commission, first of all, to divide half of the estate among local people and to give the remainder to migrants, who have come in from outside, with the result that many local people have to emigrate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that that has been the policy of the Land Commission&mdash;to divide the estate into halves.  The policy of the Land Commission has been to give first consideration to the claims of those who have been looking after the estate and secondly, to ensure that uneconomic landholders within a mile of the estate will have their farms brought up in so far as is possible to economic level and very often after doing this the whole estate is used up.</P>
