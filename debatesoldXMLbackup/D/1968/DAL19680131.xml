    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the present position regarding Ireland's application for membership of EEC; and whether the Government have given any further consideration to the possibility of some form of association other than full membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of Ireland's inability to gain entry to the EEC, the Government intend to review the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the Government's attitude to alternative proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Ministers of the European Communities, at their meeting <Col N="3" /> on 18th and 19th December, were unable to reach agreement on the opening, at this stage, of negotiations with the applicant-countries.  There was, however, unanimous agreement that the requests for accession should remain on the Council agenda.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, various proposals have since been made by Britain and some of the Member-Governments as to what should be done in the new situation. In reply to Question No. 1, I should mention that the British Government did consult us about their proposals. The Government are studying these and the other proposals which have been made with a view to deciding their future course of action.  The outcome of the various proposals will, of course, depend on the reaction of all the Governments concerned, and developments in this regard are being followed closely through diplomatic channels.</P>
    <P>The implications for the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement of any arrangement which may emerge from these proposals would be a matter for consideration.  There is, of course, provision in Article XXIII of the Agreement for meetings between representatives of the two countries once a year, and at any time at the request of either, to supervise the application of the Agreement, to keep its operation under review and to consider whether further action should be taken in order to promote its objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say when the British Government contacted the Irish Government with a view towards consultation on the joint applications for membership of the EEC?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would also now reconsider an approach to the British Government for a review of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, in view of the fact that this agreement was drafted in the expectation that Ireland would be a member of the EEC by 1970, and particularly in view of the fact that this Trade Agreement has militated against some Irish industries, with consequential unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government made approaches to us on 20th December last about the proposition in relation to the new development in the European Economic Community. I do not think it is necessary at this stage and in present circumstances to review the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and I do not accept that the Agreement has adversely affected us in general.  In fact, the contrary has been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if there has been a definite proposal from the Benelux countries to the Government here concerning a wider concept of the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There was a separate proposal which was communicated to us.  That proposal is now under examination and, as the Deputy is aware, there is at least one other proposal, which has not yet been reduced to writing &mdash; this is a proposal from the Germans &mdash; and the implications of both these proposals are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the British Foreign Secretary said that there would be consultation with the Irish Government and that these consultations took place on the very same day on which he made the announcement? He made the announcement on 20th December last and the Taoiseach said there were consultations on 20th December as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say there were consultations.  I said fresh proposals were communicated to us through diplomatic channels &mdash; I did not say that actually earlier &mdash; on 20th December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say what the proposals from the British Government were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give them in broad outline.  They are as follows: that there should be closer co-operation in the technological and political fields and they suggested the most promising fields for co-operation seemed to be (a) political co-operation; (b) co-operation in the industrial and technological fields; (c) co-operation <Col N="5" /> with under-developed countries and (d) co-operation in general weapons development and military equipment purchases.  It is obvious that some of these items are not of any particular interest to us, but I might say at this stage that the British proposals appear to be subsumed now by the Benelux proposals because there is much in common between them and the British Foreign Secretary stated at a meeting of WEU that they favoured the Benelux proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Independent of the Benelux proposal, is it proposed to make a separate approach to the French on the basis of the interim arrangement suggested by General de Gaulle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been studying the question of an interim arrangement with the EEC which might be possible, consistent with our existing international obligations and it has emerged from our exploration of this question, particularly in view of our obvious interest in not interfering with our existing trading arrangements with Britain, that there would be difficulties in the way of an interim arrangement independently of the other applicants and of Britain in particular. It would seem, therefore, that any initiative towards an interim arrangement must await the development of the various proposals at present in the air to which I have already referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals to which the Taoiseach has referred do not seem to amount to anything at all.  The Taoiseach said this himself now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not; I said the British proposals, some aspects of which were not of particular interest to us, would now appear to be subsumed by the Benelux proposals which are rather more comprehensive and in some respects are similar to those of the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that the British proposals to which the Taoiseach has referred are virtually the same as those made by the British Premier in his Guildhall speech?  Is there anything in these proposals <Col N="6" /> that was not made public at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the details of the British Premier's speech.  The proposals I have referred to are those announced by the British Foreign Secretary, and they have been well published and are fairly specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we assume that any action taken for an interim arrangement with the EEC will not be an individual action but will be a collective action with other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not taken individual action.  As I said already we have been examining the possibilities of an interim arrangement that because of our existing trade obligations, it would appear that independent action is not likely.  To that extent, we have not taken any initiative in this respect beyond examination of the prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think that it would now be advisable to do so, to take individual action with regard to an interim arrangement with the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our desire is to ensure that we will create the best possible climate for our ultimate accession and we want to ensure that any action we will now take will not be divisive either of members of the Community or of the applicant countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his intention to travel to Belfast in the near future for further talks with Captain O'Neill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>My recent meetings with Captain O'Neill in Belfast on the 11th December and in Dublin on 8th January were a continuation of the policy established by my predecessor of contact and maximum co-operation in practical matters of public concern without sacrifice of principle.  No constitutional topics were touched upon at either meeting.</P>
      <P>The discussions at these meetings covered a broad range of topics of common interest including tourism, transport, electricity supply, trade, measures to keep foot and mouth disease out of Ireland, road safety, currency decimalisation and cultural matters.</P>
      <P>There are no plans for a visit to Belfast in the near future for further talks with Captain O'Neill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, I believe that the meetings which have taken place between Captain O'Neill and myself as well as between other Ministers and officials on both sides have helped to confirm the desirability and good sense of this policy of contact and co-operation in order to contribute to a better <Col N="8" /> understanding and appreciation of our common interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If Partition was not discussed at these meetings, why was it not discussed, in view of all that Fianna Fáil have been saying about it in the past?  Also if members of the British House of Commons are interested in Partition, in discrimination in housing and jobs, and in gerrymandering, surely the head of an Irish Government should be interested in these matters, and if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the interest of myself as head of Government, the Government in general and our Party in these matters. However, Partition has been with us now for almost 50 years and in that time prejudices of different kinds have been built up.  We have now established a very useful line of communication and I think we should nurture that line of communication and not so overload it as to revert to the old <i>status quo</i> and the negative approach we had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach tell the House why the visits of himself to Belfast and of Captain O'Neill down here were kept so secret?  Why is there not prior notice?  Was there any reason for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I answer bluntly that there are security matters in question here?  Obviously &mdash; there is no point in hiding it &mdash; there was the danger of certain demonstrations which it would be better to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>President Johnson and President Kennedy took the same risks and their visits were well publicised beforehand.  Surely if the Taoiseach goes to part of his own country, there should not be such secrecy about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the growing decline in population in the western counties owing to a lack of employment for young people; and if he is prepared to take special measures to remedy this serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The twelve western counties are being treated by the Government as a special development region.  The Government are, in this matter, working to a comprehensive programme aimed at increasing employment and income derived from agriculture, industry, tourism, forestry and fishing in the region.</P>
      <P>The co-ordination of the planning and implementation of the various measures is being effected by the County Development Teams and to assist worthwhile projects inaugurated either by the Teams or otherwise, the Government has created the Special Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>The pilot areas in these counties have recently been increased to three times their original size in order to extend the advantages of the facilities &mdash; including increased grants &mdash; available under the Pilot Area Programme.  An intensive programme of land settlement and land structural reform is being carried out in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture will very shortly put into operation an incentive bonus scheme for the benefit of small farmers who wish to develop potentially-viable holdings on a properly planned basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> Apart from other special measures for attracting industries to the undeveloped areas, the new Small Industries Programme, initiated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should be of particular benefit in the present context as two of the three areas selected for its operation are in the western counties.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the provision of holiday accommodation in the west, Bord Fáilte have been authorised to pay higher incentive grants and to introduce a special scheme for the development of supplementary holiday accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of almost 90 per cent in the provision in the current Volume of Estimates for Improvement Schemes in the Gaeltachts; among these is a new scheme of grants to assist skilled workers in the provision of workrooms and equipment for the purpose of their trades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Taoiseach if he is aware that industries to which he has referred such as the Bord na Móna industry in Bangor Erris and the factory in the Ballina area are threatened with closure?  Is he further aware that despite all we hear about future plans the population of the West is dwindling?  It is absolutely necessary to take crash measures to deal with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Crash measures in this context would not be very valuable in the long run.  The policy of the Government in approaching these tasks and problems in a co-ordinated way, on a regional basis, is the best approach and the one most likely to produce economic viability in the western areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the increase in the consumer price index from 1st November, 1967; and the basis on which he estimated a two per cent increase in the cost of living at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index is calculated quarterly in respect of mid-February, mid-May, <Col N="11" /> mid-August and mid-November: the results of the inquiry for mid-February of this year are expected to be available about mid-March next.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, my estimate was 2.3 per cent and related solely to the effect on the general price level of the devaluation of the pound.  It was on the 14th December last, in the course of my reply to the debate on the Adjournment of this House, that I dealt with the matter, and I would refer the Deputy to columns 2286 and 2287 of Volume 231 of the Dáil Debates for the information he requires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will now admit, I am sure, that as a result of devaluation, it must be more than two per cent?  Furthermore, will the Taoiseach state whether we have a different system of assessing the changes in the consumer price index from Great Britain where, in the past two or three weeks, it was announced that the increase in the consumer price index since 1st February was four per cent?  Is it possible for us to make an assessment at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still convinced that the effect of devaluation on the consumer price index figure is, as I have said, 2.3 per cent and I sought to establish that, and I think I did effectively, in the course of the debate to which I referred.  Our method of calculating the index is a most comprehensive one, one that is not a rigid one, and which will be reviewed from time to time to ensure that as near as possible we can get the proper effect of price increases on the figure.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the method of selecting shops for the provision of data for compilation of the cost of living index; whether there has been any change in the selection or range of shops in the last ten years; the number of shops from which data are collected; the frequency of shop selection and data collection; whether supermarkets and cutprice stores are included; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index is compiled quarterly for mid-February, mid-May, mid-August and mid-November.  Price quotations are furnished to the Central Statistics Office at these dates by local officers of the Department of Labour in respect of the 118 towns in which employment exchanges and branch employment exchanges are located &mdash; several returns are received for the larger centres of population, so that the total number of returns is 163.  The price quotations, numbering over 28,000, relate to a list of 189 commodities selected on the occasion of the introduction of the present consumer price index series in August, 1953.  In November, 1967, approximately 2,400 different shops furnished the basic data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of the shops from which the price quotations are obtained is made by the price reporters referred to, subject to general instructions to select shops most frequented by the wage-earning classes. The essential principle followed in the collection of price quotations is to ensure that the prices quoted for a particular commodity in any particular period should be for the same <Col N="15" /> quality and description as at the preceding inquiry and, as far as possible, should be obtained from the same source.  This means that the set of shops from which quotations are obtained remains relatively stable &mdash; any substantial change at a point of time could result in a discontinuity in the series.  Over the years, however, there is a gradual change because of closures, changes in types of commodities handled, difficulties in retaining the co-operation of the proprietor, etc.  Because of this, and because of changes in the form of retailing followed by shops already furnishing quotations, the newer types of retail outlet which have emerged in recent years are represented in the list of shops involved, but not to any predetermined degree.</P>
    <P>It is important to keep in mind that the basic objective of the consumer price index is to assess the change in the level of prices over a period of time.  It does not essay to determine the actual absolute level of prices at a particular point of time &mdash; for which a very elaborate sample of retail outlets and individual transactions would be required.</P>
    <P>The number and type of retail shop from which quotations are obtained is only one facet of the consumer price index compilation &mdash; the list of commodities covered and the relative weights given to these commodities are of great importance. These will shortly be revised by the Central Statistics Office when the results of the 1965-66 Household Budget Inquiry becomes available.  At that stage all technical aspects of the preparation of the index, including the sources of the basic price quotations, will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.  The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available.  It is not always possible to distinguish direct investment from other international capital transactions and, therefore, there is a considerable element of estimation in the derivation of figures for even total direct investment apart from such investment by individual countries.  However, it is estimated, on a very approximate basis, that, in 1966, direct investment in the State by the USA and Canada, taken together, was about £3 million to £4 million and the direct investment by other OECD countries (excluding Great Britain) was about £2 million to £3 million.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain, in the first instance, that under section 8 of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE are free to fix such charges as the Board thinks fit for any service provided by them.</P>
      <P>CIE first informed me in January, 1967, of the need to increase fares and rates to meet increased labour and material costs.  In accordance with the policy of the Government to defer as far as possible the impact on prices of rising costs, I encouraged the Board to postpone the application of the increases and to intensify their efforts to improve revenue by new business and higher productivity.  The Board have in fact deferred the increases to the fullest practical extent consistent with maintaining solvency.</P>
      <P>I see no need to hold a public inquiry into this matter.  I am fully satisfied, in view of the Board's present financial position, that the Board had no alternative but to increase rates and fares.</P>
      <P>I am however aware that there has been some public concern about the increases in CIE's weekly fares for school children on provincial bus and rail services, which in some cases, I understand, represented increases of the order of 100 per cent on existing charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE have informed me that the <Col N="21" /> weekly fares for school children had been abnormally low and that, with the introduction of a free transport scheme for school children by the Minister for Education, the Board had decided to establish an economic fare structure for children not covered by or not availing of the free transport scheme.  The increases were not related to the general increase in the Board's fares and rates but represented a rationalisation of school children's fares.  Even with the increases, CIE's weekly fares for school children are lower than the corresponding fares in Nothern Ireland.</P>
    <P>CIE received many representations in this matter and, following consultations with me, they have decided to defer the full implementation of the rationalisation policy.  Accordingly, as and from 5th February next the fares for children under 16 years will be reduced from half to approximately ? the adult fare and, for children under 19 years, from ¾ to approximately ? the adult fare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that he was aware of the public concern regarding the increase in fares applicable to school-children, but is he not aware of the widespread and very strong public concern regarding the general all-round increase in fares, particularly as they affect the workers living in the Dublin suburban areas who have to use the buses to travel to work and in many cases have to use a bus to get to the central city area and perhaps use another bus to get to another suburban or near-suburban area to their place of employment? Has he no knowledge of the concern that this has caused and of the considerable increase in living costs to such people that the bus fare increases have caused?  Does he propose to take any steps to lighten the intolerable burden of continuously increasing fares which has been unremittingly imposed on these workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has voted a subvention of £2 million a year and <Col N="22" /> pending the period in which the subvention is paid, it would be most inadvisable to increase continuously the subsidy to a company like CIE. Further, if the Deputy would examine the increase in earnings in the past few years of the workers themselves he would find that the increases in fares, while they may bear heavily on certain sections of the population, did relate reasonably to the increase in earnings which they secured in the same period. The view of the Government is that the subsidy should remain where it is until it can be examined in connection with a new Bill which will be brought to this House some time about the autumn of 1968 or the beginning of 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire if the Minister recalls the speech made some time ago by the General Manager of CIE in which he said for the first time that this concern accepted the fact that it was not in business to make a profit and that it was in fact a social service?  Does the Minister now accept this fact which he has denied for several years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never denied that a good portion of the CIE operations constitute a social service.  I gave information to the House about a very large number of bus services within Dublin city which actually lose money, and that there was a cross subsidy from the services within Dublin city that made a profit.  I pointed out that all over the country there are bus services and rail services which lose money which constitute a social service.  The all-round loss is occasioned, as the Deputy knows, on the railway service and not on the bus service.  Although the profit on buses is now minimal, the total subvention of £2 million a year which is the equivalent of 4d per gallon of petrol is a reasonable subsidy.  In addition, I have had the opportunity of studying the problem of rail transport in Europe at the European Conference of Ministers for Transport and making comparisons of the costs and I am satisfied that we have made a reasonable decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The implications for the Irish tourist industry of (a) devaluation, (b) foot and mouth disease epidemic and (c) American proposals to reduce expenditure on foreign travel, have been under examination by Bord Fáilte and my Department.</P>
      <P>Devaluation will mean lower prices here for visitors from countries which have not devalued.  In addition, it will have the effect of increasing costs for British holidaymakers in most European countries.  In this way, devaluation provides an opportunity of promoting additional tourist traffic to Ireland.  On the other hand, the sterling cost of Bord Fáilte's promotional work in countries which have not devalued has been increased.  I intend to introduce a Supplementary Estimate shortly to provide for increased promotional funds to offset these higher costs and to exploit the opportunities presented by devaluation.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have calculated that the foot and mouth disease epidemic resulted in a loss in tourism revenue of about £1 million in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details are not yet available of the <Col N="29" /> measures which the United States Government intend to adopt to secure the reduction of their overseas tourist expenditure.  Until more information is available in the matter, it would be premature to attempt any precise assessment of the extent to which our tourist industry may be affected.  However, there is no doubt that restrictions on American travel abroad could have serious repercussions for us and accordingly the Government have made representations to the United States authorities expressing deep concern about the possible effects of restrictive action on our tourist industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt at length with the question of hotel prices and the fact that they have risen both here and in other countries, and I have also made it clear that as far as we can gather from comparative studies, hotel prices here are not excessive compared with those of most countries in Europe. In only about three countries in Europe were general hotel and guesthouse charges markedly, or even noticeably, lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="30" /> for Transport and Power whether he has been able to establish the cause of the loud noise heard and felt throughout the Dublin area on December 26th at or about 10.45 a.m.; whether is was due to supersonic aircraft; and, if so, what steps the Government propose to take to prevent recurrence of such supersonic disturbance in Irish airspace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigations I have made in this matter suggest that the noise was caused by a military aircraft flying over the Irish sea outside Irish airspace which, at the time of the occurrence, executed a change of course at supersonic speed resulting in the phenomenon known as a &ldquo;focussed boom&rdquo;.  This is a most infrequent occurrence and a repetition is unlikely.</P>
      <P>I have under consideration the introduction of legislation to prohibit supersonic flight within Irish airspace, but such a prohibition could not be fully effective without international co-operation as is illustrated by the occurrence which is the subject of this question.</P>
      <P>Efforts to achieve the necessary international agreement in this respect are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that this matter, which I raised five years ago and repeatedly since then in this House, is now the subject of international discussion so as to ensure that transatlantic flights from European points of departure will not feel themselves free to assume supersonic speeds, once they have passed over British territory, with consequential continual supersonic bangs, oriented or otherwise, taking place over our land mass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex question and, so far, there have not been conclusive tests as to what would constitute supersonic boom as made by the kind of aircraft that will come into use for passenger transport such as the Concorde and the American supersonic plane.  There are experiments going on to determine what type of noise will be made.  There <Col N="31" /> are international discussions taking place on this problem.  The boom can extend laterally for distances of from between 25 to 30 miles, and even if we pass legislation which will prevent the passage of supersonic planes over our territory, we may still suffer from supersonic bangs from planes outside the area unless this can be dealt with by international treaties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that discussions have reached a fairly advanced stage amongst European countries, including Great Britain, to provide that supersonic flights will not take place over their territory?  Am I to presume from what the Minister has said that our Government are joining in these discussions and hope to secure consent from the participants in them that supersonic speeds will not be undertaken until Irish territory has been left behind from departure points in Europe to the United States and by aircraft originating in America approaching the European land mass? If not, this country will be the most supersonically-banged country in the world.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the present position regarding the instal'ation of electricity for the people of Keel, Brida, Lickeen, Dreenagh and Glencar in <Col N="33" /> Killorglin, County Kerry, to whom the present charges are prohibitive, being in one case £7 18s 2d as compared with a figure of £1 3s quoted when a survey was made seven years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the townlands of Keel, Brida, Lickeen, Dreenagh and Glencar are in the Board's Killorglin rural area.  The area was recanvassed recently but, due to the very heavy expenditure which would be involved in supplying these locations, the lowest terms which could be quoted were not acceptable to the applicants for supply.</P>
      <P>Special service charges are related directly to the cost of making supply available.  The townlands mentioned are in very isolated locations and several miles of high tension line across difficult country would be required to supply them.</P>
      <P>The ESB have been unable to check the comparison of charges referred to by the Deputy but if he furnishes full particulars I will have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>I have already stated in the House in reply to a question on 29th November, 1967, that I recognise that, despite the present generous State subsidy, some special service charges are extremely high.  The whole position of these charges is under examination to see whether any relief is possible.  I am not yet in a position to say what the outcome of the examination will be but I hope to make a statement in the matter reasonably soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the townlands in question are isolated townlands and consequently the heavy charges are due to the special service charge the ESB impose on such districts.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider wiping out that special service charge in its entirety in so far as it relates to the townlands stated in Deputy Connor's question and all other such townlands?  Is it not about time that this House wiped out that special service charge which militates against isolated districts such as the districts set down in Deputy Connor's question, <Col N="34" /> and gave them electricity at the same standard charge as areas contiguous to built-up districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a straightforward question of subsidisation.  It boils down to the question of how much the Oireachtas can provide towards the wiping out of the special service charges.  At the moment, subject to a £75 maximum per house, the subsidisation is at the rate of 75 per cent for new connections.  As I have stated, this matter is at present again under examination with a view to seeing if anything more can be done to help and I hope to be in a position to make a further statement in the matter soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with feelings of deep regret that Deputies learned of the death, during the Recess, of Deputy James Everett.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire air.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Father of the House&rdquo;, Deputy Everett's long association with the Dáil began with his election for the Counties of Kildare and Wicklow in 1922.  From 1923 onwards, he was returned for the Wicklow constituency at every General Election.  In 1948, he was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and, again in 1954, he became Minister for Justice, a post which he held until 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the trade union movement, the late Deputy gave a lifetime of service. Keenly interested from an early age, he first became an organiser for the County Wicklow Agricultural Union, which later merged with the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  He also became a member of Wicklow County Council of which he was Chairman at a time of great stress in local administration during the War of Independence. In 1920, he became Chairman of Wicklow Urban District Council, a post <Col N="56" /> which he was to occupy for a number of terms.</P>
    <P>From 1919 until 1922, the late Deputy served as a Justice in the Republican Courts.</P>
    <P>Ever conscientious in the discharge of his duties in the House, his contributions to our debates were wellinformed and distinguished by a quiet sincerity of purpose.  To our discussions, especially those affecting local government and social welfare, he brought both a specialised knowledge and a warm sympathy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett's sterling qualities earned for him the high regard and respect of his colleagues, and I know that all Deputies will deeply regret his passing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a house in North Great George's Street which at present is in fairly good condition but which in a very short period, the next year or so, will not be in such good condition, unless repairs are carried out to the roof.  The landlord of that property has no intention of repairing the roof.  In fact, his clear and manifest intention is to allow this roof to fall in so that, in due time, the house will be condemned by the corporation and the existing tenants will leave the house and be given accommodation by the corporation and he in turn will let the house, having then made the repairs, to tenants who will pay him what he will consider the market price at that time.  In other words, there is a racket going on in Dublin in house property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister at different times has said that he intends to curb the rapacity of some of these Rachmans in property in Dublin but so far he has done nothing.  The only penalty a landlord involved in such doubtful <Col N="59" /> activities can incur is to be brought every few months to court, called there by the corporation, and pay a derisory fine of about £5.  The landlord's whole object is to get rid of the tenants who live there at present and who over the years have built up certain rights on the house.</P>
    <P>The tenants in the house in North Great George's Street have no desire to leave that house but under the law, they have no way of ensuring that the landlord will carry out his duties to maintain the property.  In fact, last year, the tenants got a man in to preserve to some extent the roof of the house.</P>
    <P>This goes on while we all agree that there is a scarcity of housing accommodation in Dublin.  There are certain people in Dublin who, for material gain, are involved in a vandalism which the law cannot stop.  If a vandal, an ordinary hooligan, wrecks public property, we penalise him by putting him behind bars but men involved in property speculation in Dublin can with impunity wreck whole blocks because it will mean a higher return to them when they get the existing tenants out. This is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>The question can be asked: how much more sound property is there in Dublin in which there exist long-established tenants whom the landlords wish to get out of the houses and, having got rid of them, turn them over to public maintenance in new corporation schemes?  If we are serious about the housing situation in Dublin, then we must and should turn the searchlight of public scrutiny on these very doubtful and twilight practices going on in the city.  It is completely wrong that the necessity of people to have shelter should be regarded as on the same level as any other business activity.  It is far different.  Human beings are involved and therefore social justice and the norms of what we consider to be fair public policy should control and curb these activities to some extent.</P>
    <P>There are many more houses around the city in the same state, houses which could be saved, the fabric of which is <Col N="60" /> quite sound, but the landlords of these houses wish to clear long-established tenants and instead get tenants with no traditional history who are not protected by law and to whom, therefore, they are enabled to charge very high rents.  I draw attention to the extent of the high rent question existing in Dublin at the present time.  There are people who consider it legitimate to look for £5 and £6 a week for single rooms in Dublin from people who may be earning only £12 to £13 a week.  It it not at all unusual to find certain people in Dublin who are ineligible for corporation housing, young married couples, for example, who must spend nearly 50 per cent of their weekly income on the provision of shelter over their heads.  How can you expect these people to get sufficient money together to rear a family or to be able to save, to practise this virtue of thrift we are always saying is necessary in our citizens, when these unfortunate people are forced to pay an inordinate amount of their weekly income on the provision of shelter?  There is no possibility of such couples ever getting together the amount of cash that would be necessary as a deposit on a house. Therefore we can understand the desperation of many families in Dublin who see no prospect of getting any decent accommodation in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One thing we should see to in regard to corporation houses is that the period between one tenant leaving and the next coming into that house is shortened as much as possible.  I do accept that this is a very complicated job and that, even for paper work, there has to be some delay.  However, it is very difficult to explain the situation to people who are looking for accommodation, perhaps, in a particular area.  They will say that such-andsuch an address has been vacant for so many weeks, and it is hard to explain that, in accordance with the waiting list, such accommodation is already booked for families of a certain size.  The authorities should see to it that the accommodation that is vacant is filled as rapidly as possible by the people for whom it is reserved properly in the first place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> We should, especially in the city of Dublin, consider once more what we consider to be adequate housing standards in the year 1968.  It is true that the corporation have announced their intention of clearing out Corporation Place and giving the people better accommodation in this area.  They should also look at Benburb Street which was built in the late Victorian period and does not now in the least fulfil the standard of accommodation we should have in 1968.  The front doors of these houses in Benburb Street are open all night to any person passing along the street.  There is no way one can shut the main doors of this accommodation which is in a dimly-lit street.  It is extremely difficult to see how hygiene and other things can be preserved in such antiquated accommodation. All of us who are acquainted with the problems of housing in Dublin are aware of the ravages being made on the health of children due to their poor living conditions.  Every week we send medical notices to the corporation from one doctor or another who is dealing with the family in question stating that such-and-such a child is suffering from asthma as the result of the conditions in which he is living.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have contact with this problem are aware of the number of nervous diseases being caused in Dublin.  One has only to talk to the people who are acting in a professional capacity in St. Brendan's or St. Loman's to be told that the housing situation is one of the main causes of these diseases.  There are many families whose health is being wrecked due to their appalling living accommodation.</P>
    <P>One cannot produce a statistic to show how exactly the health of children is affected, but there is no doubt that there is a serious effect on a child who has no room to play at home.  You meet cases of mothers who never allow their children out of their prams, although they are of an age that should be out running around; if the people in the flat underneath object to the child running around the room, that child must be kept in its pram until it is three or four years of age, and those are not unusual cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> There are some people who talk about the danger to family life in Dublin.  I would say the biggest danger to family life here is the present scandalous housing situation, and singly this is at the bottom of most family troubles.  Nobody has calculated the ill effects or how far it goes into the next generation.  We all have only one childhood, and if our childhood is one given over to cramped accommodation in which we cannot run around, in which our health suffers, this must have a very grave effect upon our intellectual development.  If we believe that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally in matters of education, I do not see how we can achieve that if the housing situation is not improved dramatically.</P>
    <P>We must also look into this question of suiting people's human desires in regard to where they want to live.  At present the practice is that when a person who is on the waiting list is offered accommodation when his turn comes, very often it is a place he will not accept.  We must, as far as possible, see that we suit people's family requirements. A chap may live at one end of the city and be offered accommodation at the other end.  There are other people who may be on shift work or who may be on permanent call in their job and who would find it extremely difficult to meet the demands of their job and home life if sent out to live in a place like Ballymun.</P>
    <P>Apart from the extra expense involved in removing people from the city centre, we should consider whether we want the city centre to become a morgue, completely devoid of people, of inhabitants, which has happened in some of the cities of Europe and which they now regret.  We must see to it that the older parishes in Dublin are preserved by developing housing there.  There are on either side of the river, in the centre of the city, wide tracts being given over to car parks.  The fact is that we should be developing flat building schemes in that area.  There are people in the area, dissatisfied with their present accommodation, who would be very happy indeed to remain in their familiar surroundings, the neighbourhoods in <Col N="63" /> which they were born and reared, if there were decent accommodation available in the area for them.  We cannot forever continue the flight, north, west and south into virgin land for building purposes.  We must utilise the vacant areas in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>It is far cheaper to live in the centre of the city than it is to live in the hinterland.  That is demonstrably clear when one compares the prices in Moore Street, for example, with the prices in the new supermarkets and retail shops in the suburbs.  It is a year now since Canon Doyle died.  He did his utmost to prevent the depopulation of Arran Quay parish.  There were areas in that parish which could have been used for building development. Instead of that there is throughout the whole area the development of car firms and car parks.  Property is allowed to deteriorate and no attempt is made to arrest the flight of the population from the centre of the city to the outskirts.</P>
    <P>There are more flights than the flight from the West and the flight from the land.  There is also the little publicised flight from the centre of the city.  This flight has certain detrimental effects on community living.  It is no light thing to wreck a community.  Whole communities in Dublin are being sent north and south and west.  This trend must undoubtedly have very serious social consequences.  It will affect the children.  They will be reared in the kind of anonymous relationship that grows up in this kind of environment. The trend has been noted in other countries.  We will be no exception. The social consequences on the children coming from such areas are disastrous.</P>
    <P>One of the most dangerous symptoms is the automatic acceptance of the idea that the centre of the city is dead.  There has been no attempt to keep people in their own neighbourhoods. The depopulation of Arran Quay is puzzling, to say the least of it. This is an area well supplied with schools, churches and shops, with an open playing area in the adiacent Phoenix Park.  Why it should have been <Col N="64" /> permitted to die is something that passes my comprehension.  To me it would appear to be a planner's dream for imaginative development.  Instead of that the area has been allowed to develop into a desolate wasteland. There would be a better understanding and appreciation of planning policy if such areas were utilised for the housing of our people.  That kind of planning would engender the confidence of our people in our planners.  Nobody at the moment looks on planning with any great enthusiasm because planning seems to consist in the main of these huge, soulless monstrosities in Ballymun, a shadowing forth of Orwell's &ldquo;1984&rdquo;.  Digging out people's roots is a very dangerous recreation.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts that there are places unfit for human habitation. There are many hundreds living in accommodation which has been condemned as unfit.  These people cannot get alternative accommodation from Dublin Corporation.  The only way in which one can get on the present preference list is by having two children as rapidly as possible and, if one can do it, three children as rapidly as possible enables one to qualify that much quicker.  That is the policy of the corporation.  It is regrettable that our housing situation should be so bad that our City Fathers advise young married people to beget X number of children as rapidly as possible in order that they can be put on the list.  The begetting of children should not be motivated by the hope of getting accommodation.  Begetting children is a private matter between husband and wife.  It should not be something governing one's place on a housing list.  But that is the present tragic situation here in Dublin.  Unless the accommodation is excrutiatingly bad a family with one child must wait indefinitely.</P>
    <P>There should be a complete inventory made of accommodation needs and the kind of accommodation in which people are forced to live at the moment.  Many people are unaware of the conditions under which their fellow citizens are living.  Social justice is becoming more and more popular and everybody is helping one weak section <Col N="65" /> or another.  The housing position might improve if these fellow citizens appreciated the extent and gravity of the present housing problem.  The first step is a proper realisation of the extent of the problem.  The next step is the tackling of it.  There must be a solution to the problem of newly-weds.  They must not be compelled to live with in-laws in already overcrowded accommodation. There must be some halfway stage to solve the problem of newly-weds.  Even one room in which they could be on their own would be an improvement.  That is a problem that must be tackled separately.</P>
    <P>There is then the problem of old people.  One questions the wisdom of putting old people in chalets isolated from neighbours.  All modern studies seem to suggest that old people retain their mental health if they are kept in the normal community structure.  It is bad policy to segregate the aged.  In some instances our treatment of the aged is somewhat reminiscent of the treatment meted out to lepers in less enlightened days.</P>
    <P>It is time we brought old people into schemes with young people, that we considered the problems of our old people, that we considered how they may be kept in touch with people in their locality, how they may be kept sufficiently warm and how they may have sufficient to eat.  Many of our old people have not sufficient food in the conditions in which they have to live. If old people are isolated from general schemes, put into caravans in places here and there and cut adrift from their neighbours, there is a grave probability that they may fall into ill health.  We often hear people saving that old Miss So-and-So has not been seen lately.  We should ensure that the discovery of hardship among old people should not be left to chance and an effort should be made in big housing schemes to ensure that no old person should die in an urban community without care.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that young people who are newly married and who cannot get a house under the regulations of Dublin Corporation should be levied to the extent of £5, £6 or £7 a week for a single room.  There is no <Col N="66" /> penalty under the law for this and yet we can say that it is absolutely wrong in a Christian society that anyone should make money in such a manner.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with a rather disturbing matter which has arisen of late, that is the manner in which the Minister has countermanded the decisions of local authorities with regard to planning permission.  I am thinking especially of the Mount Pleasant affair in Dublin. After many years of refusal by the local authority to develop that site, the Minister has reversed the local authority's decision and has granted a person the right to develop a petrol pump station at this place.  It is correct to say that nothing has happened over the years which would justify such an action by the Minister.  The traffic flow at that point does not suggest that the erection of a petrol pump would help the free flow of traffic.  It is a pleasant and open green with a certain appeal and too many such places in Dublin are now being blotted out.</P>
    <P>This decision of the Minister must produce a certain lack of confidence in the planning powers of local authorities if, when they make a decision, the Minister can grant an appeal, in this case the appeal of a man wishing to develop a petrol pump.  That is a serious situation and must lead to a lack of confidence in the local authorities. If the Minister makes such a change on appeal, it is important that he should publish his reasons for making such a change.  The local authorities must state the reasons why they will not permit a certain development and the least the Minister could do is to state his reasons for permitting the development of a petrol station.  If justice is not seen to be done on all such occasions, it will be further proof to the rumour-mongers when they suggest that all is not well in these areas.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely delicate area. There is money to be made.  A site that may not have been worth much yesterday may be worth £60,000 tomorrow because of its permitted development or because of its proximity to another <Col N="67" /> development.  If the granting of permission to develop means a difference of £50,000 in the value of a site, the least we can expect is that the Minister should give an explanation for his change of decision.  I understand that a similar case has arisen in Galway where the Minister gave permission to a man to build a bungalow.  The local authority had turned down the application to build because the proposal interfered with the view towards the seashore.  Yet the Minister, on an appeal by a German citizen, accepted the appeal and the man can now build his bungalow.  The local authority does not know whether it is to be a singlestorey, two-storied or three-storied building.</P>
    <P>The Minister holds a very important post at this time in this matter of permitting developments and he must see that profits are not made in this connection because somebody possesses a site which is in close proximity to some other site.  I hope the Minister will answer some of these points when he comes to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on Local Government has gone on for quite some time.  That is as it should be because the activities of the Department now touch the lives of every citizen.  Deputy O'Leary and other speakers have stressed some of the difficulties and hardships which our people suffer because of the lack of housing facilities and Deputy O'Leary instanced certain difficulties in Dublin.  We, in Cork, have individual cases as bad as those mentioned by Deputy O'Leary.  The problem is full of difficulties because what suits one family does not suit another and we have not got such a selection of houses that we can suit everybody's requirements.  It is true to say that all Governments, all Ministers for Local Government and all members of local authorities, are anxious to see the solution of this problem.  I do not think the sincerity of local representatives and members of the Dáil can be doubted or that it can be said that they are not fully aware of the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> We have heard a lot about the public sector of housing but I would like to refer to the private sector.  Everyone who is in a position to build his own house relieves the local council of the responsibility of having to build a house for him.  In this regard there are a couple of points I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.  I should like, firstly, to point to the delays, the friction and frustration caused to a person who is trying to build his own house when he is trying to prove title. In the meantime, that person has to go to the bank to borrow money and then pay interest on it.  The delay is often one of several months.  I wonder if the Minister would look at the position and see if, in cases where legal title is granted for the whole site which is about to be developed, it is also necessary at the outset to get individual title for every single plot on the site.  I should like to see this being examined because I feel it should not be an insurmountable difficulty.  It should be possible to expedite the matter and make the grant available when the builder has title to the whole area.  This is a legal point and I am only asking the Minister to look at it to see if something can be done to prevent the delays that now occur.</P>
    <P>A sore point in many areas is in regard to the price charged for land to private developers.  In some areas, it is almost impossible to buy a piece of land.  In the circumstances, the local authority&mdash;and I must say in Cork city we have done this&mdash;should acquire the land compulsorily at a fair market price, develop it and then parcel it out at a fair price to people who want to build houses, without wanting to make a profit but making it easy for the purchasers. Many grants have been given to those who want to build houses, but, rightly or wrongly, there is a feeling that over the years such grants have only tended to increase the price of houses.  The feeling is that if there is a State grant of £275 and a local authority grant of £275, more than half of that, if not more, goes into the increased cost of the house, that the price of the house is inflated.  The best possible way of helping a person to build a house, and I am sure the Minister <Col N="69" /> appreciates this, is to reduce the interest rate on the money he gets to do so.  To reduce the rate of interest is much more important than providing a grant of £275 or more, which very often finds its way into the hands of the wrong person.  Where possible, the local authorities should also be encouraged to reduce the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my fourth point, the Local Loans Fund.  The Minister should direct the local authorities not to charge more than one-eighth more than the figure at which they borrow money at themselves.  We know that it is the custom to charge three-eighths or more, and while that may have been justified 20 years ago, when the amount was small and the overheads were different, today the overheads are more or less static and there is a much greater amount of money involved. Authorities like those in Dublin or Cork must make a considerable profit from what they charge over and above the rate at which they borrow the money.  Fortunately in Cork city, we have been able to loan it at one-eighth more than the figure at which we get it.  We must be the lowest in the country in this regard.  I do not see why every authority should not be able to do that.</P>
    <P>This is the time of year when the rate problem becomes very acute and all those who have been clamouring for concessions now find it difficult to meet the bill.  I am not foolish enough to imagine that you can have increased salaries and wages, or that the price of every commodity can be increased, and that the rates will not go up accordingly.  In spite of the fact that I understand the Government are examining the position, I do want to say that the present rates structure is outmoded. It was brought into being when times were far different.  It seems peculiar that now a householder has to be the ratepayer while members of his family may be earning more than he is.  The other people get off scotfree. The whole thing should be overhauled because there must be some end to it.  It cannot go on in this way indefinitely.  We will have other occasions on which to speak about <Col N="70" /> health, but the burden is becoming unbearable and something will have to be done about distributing the levy more evenly among a greater proportion of the people.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine carefully the question of regionalisation. I understand some of the tremendous problems which are involved &mdash; local pride and tradition and all the rest&mdash;but it has been done by Bord Fáilte, who have divided the country into eight regions.  This has meant a tremendous step forward for the region in which I am interested and will lead to great economies and more efficient work.  The whole question of boundary lines between cities and counties should be considered for the purpose of local government.  There is overlapping and we are paying large fees to professional men who are doing a job in a small area when they could take in a much greater area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would not want to sit down without saying something about the Cork bridges.  I understand that the survey team have recommended that there should be four or five bridges in Cork, that the old bridges should be replaced.  With the best intention, I want to say that I hope the Minister will be able to ensure that there will be no undue delay and that he will be able to show, as he has very rightly shown within the past fortnight, that most of the delays can be shortcircuited and decisions reached in the shortest possible time.  If the bridges are necessary, then they should be erected, and if they are not erected now, they will have to be erected at an increased cost in the future.  In the meantime, there may be a great tragedy which no one would wish to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Healy referring to the Local Loans Fund as far as Cork city is concerned.  I remember going down to Cork 12 years ago when they successfully floated their own loan and when they were able to procure the money for their own housing needs. I am disappointed to find that a change is being made there.  Cork Corporation should never have any necessity to <Col N="71" /> avail of the Local Loans Fund.  Any money they require could be acquired in the city, unless like other cities, they have been so denuded of cash by the Government that they can no longer find it.</P>
      <P>In regard to houses, we heard Deputy M. O'Leary refer to the dearth of houses in Dublin city and we heard Deputy Healy refer to the dearth of houses in the city of Cork.  I should like to refer to the dearth of houses in the country, with particular reference to my own constituency.  For years and years we have been pestering the Department to sanction small housing schemes throughout County Donegal and it is only after years of delay that we can obtain sanction for the building of these schemes.  If I may refer to one particular scheme in my own home town of Dungloe, three or four years ago we sought four new local authority houses in Dungloe.  We were able to tell the county manager where a site was procurable, and that site was readily given.  It was sold to the local authority, but there is still no word of those four houses being built for nine applicants in that small town.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies throughout the whole of rural Ireland.  In every report of every local authority, be it in County Wicklow or County Donegal or any other county, we find complaints of a housing shortage and of delays in building houses.  If the Minister were wise he would have a crash programme with top priority given to the building of houses not only in the cities but in the small towns in rural Ireland to try to house the people, because if we cannot house them there is no use in giving them employment.  As Deputy M. O'Leary said, they will never remain unless they have houses of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To solve the problem, we in Donegal have now purchased ten prefabricated houses and we have allotted two of them to each electoral district.  If we find they are a success we propose to build more throughout the county.  I often wonder if it were an individual who was trying to build these prefabricated houses, would town planning permission be given.  Our local authority was so fed up endeavouring to <Col N="72" /> get permission for the building of houses that this was the only solution they could find.  I may say that the building of prefabricated houses was abolished in the Six Counties after the last war.  However, it was the only solution offered to us.</P>
    <P>There is also delay in procuring permission to build houses.  Even if one owns a site and decides to build a house there is delay in procuring town planning permission.  This procedure of procuring town planning permission is a fairly costly one today.  It is absolutely essential to obtain an architect. Two sets of maps in triplicate are required, one site map and one location map, which can only be drawn by an architect.  In the beginning we were told that a person such as a school teacher could draw up a plan but that is now being turned down by the local authorities and it is absolutely essential that a qualified person be employed to draw up the site and location plans.</P>
    <P>Then one must wait for a certain period to find out if there are any objectors.  After the statutory period has elapsed one must wait until such time as permission to build is granted. I notice that certain standards are now required by all the local authorities. There must be a particular type of fence at the front with a hollowed space in the centre for a gateway.  There is no imagination and no variation in the standards, and the whole thing does not look very good from the planning point of view.  As was pointed out, when one has completed one's house it is necessary to get a Deputy or a county councillor to write several letters to the Department before the first instalment of the grant is paid, and one is a good many months in occupation before the final instalment of the grant is paid.  In the meantime, the owner has to procure the money and provide it, possibly by way of overdraft from the bank on which he will be paying interest.  He must pay the vendor of the various materials of which the house is composed and the builder.  If the Minister wishes to see private enterprise, be it an individual or otherwise, building houses, he must ensure that the grants are paid, and paid forthwith, when they become due.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> When I talk of town planning, I do not wish to cut across anything my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, may say on the Bill which will be introduced later this evening, but sometimes when I see town planning in operation, I wonder what are the reasons at the back of the whole subject.  I have no objection to the positive side of town planning: it is to the negative side that I object.  For instance, we are now publishing a town plan for County Donegal.  We find that certain houses in certain towns and in certain parts of the county will be demolished when that plan is implemented.  We know that that plan, which we reckon will cost £11 million, will not be implemented for 30 or 40 years but, in the meantime, those houses which are listed for demolition are being devalued and are becoming absolutely useless from the owners' point of view.  At the same time, firms and people who are not subject to town planning are getting away with what I might describe as murder.</P>
    <P>I might refer particularly to the ESB.  In every county throughout the State, transformer stations are being erected by the ESB.  I understand that town planning permission is not necessary for the erection of these transformer stations.  Where do we find them being erected? &mdash; at the entrance to the various towns, particularly the capital towns and the larger towns.  There is a beautiful approach to Longford from the Sligo direction but here we have a transformer station completely obliterating the view in that area. Again, to be parochial, the approach to my hometown from the Glenties direction has a magnificent view of the Rosses lakes, the Dungloe and other lakes.  To my amazement, I find that the ESB acquired a site for a transformer station within a quarter of a mile of Dungloe and have a heinous and objectionable obstruction placed there obliterating the view of people entering that town.  If the ESB want to erect transformer stations &mdash; and I am certain there is a necessity for them &mdash; in close proximity to towns, they should find some by-way or back road, or erect them where they would not obstruct the vision of tourists or the <Col N="74" /> public generally entering those towns. I should like the Minister to bring to the notice of the ESB that there was considerable objection by people in my area to the erection of this transformer station.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Minister for this but he should look into it.  I do not expect him to know anything about it &mdash; it would not be fair to ask him to &mdash; but it is something which, when brought to his notice, he should look into.  I cannot say very much about the transformers already erected and I am thinking chiefly of those in process of erection or those to be erected in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who granted town planning permission for the erection of the signs on the Slane road.  Between here and Ashbourne, the local Garda have erected signs, direction posts, and <Col N="75" /> how they got permission for it I do not know.  They probably applied to themselves and got it.  They are most objectionable signs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the local authority who gave instructions for their erection; it was the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know; that is what I am inquiring about.  The signs are most objectionable.  First, you have them erected in English and when you go about 50 yards, you find the same signs erected in Irish.  I have never seen such duplication and waste of money.  Signposts are erected mainly for visitors because we are a small country and the majority of those using these roads know the various directions of by-roads and side roads.  I do not mind being bilingual in this respect but why not put the two languages on one sign if we must erect a sign at all? Why we must have them within 50 yards of each other, huge objectionable signs, is something beyond my comprehension. The Minister should inquire if Meath County Council did apply to Meath County Council for permission to erect them and if the county council gave permission to the county council, something should be done about it.</P>
      <P>May I refer to another matter which is causing considerable concern along the Border?  We have many roads known as through roads which are sometimes referred to as concession roads where you may pass from the Twenty-Six Counties to the Six Counties and back again into the Twenty-Six Counties without stopping. There are no customs posts.  These concession roads are a considerable advantage to those residing in the locality but since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, vehicles are no longer permitted to travel on these concession roads.  I am referring to the smaller ones, not to roads such as that between Dundalk and Castleblayney, particularly in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As traffic is no longer permitted on these concession roads due to foot <Col N="76" /> and mouth disease, many by-ways which are not county roads are being used by this traffic and these accommodation roads and by-roads have been so cut up by traffic that they are no longer usable by the people who used them in the past.  I am thinking of a particular road known as Cullion Lane in south Donegal.  It is a private road, but owing to the closing of the road between Lettercran and Pettigo, all traffic is diverted to this private lane, and I have seen it myself in such a condition that nothing can now be done to enable pedestrians to use it.  The local authority can do nothing about it because it is not a county road but I think the Minister could possibly give a grant out of the Road Fund for such roads as have been overused during this emergency.  I should be more than greateful if he would make a grant available for this famous lane.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is worrying people considerably is the question of the obligation to fence public highways. This is an agricultural community and on many roadways there is absolutely no fence between private property and the public highway.  As a result, cattle stray on to the highway, motorists crash into them and individuals are often seriously maimed and vehicles damaged.  There is no liability on the owner of the cattle, first to fence his land, or secondly, to pay compensation for damage which may result from a car crashing into animals on the public highway.  There is an onus on a farmer if he has fences to ensure that those fences are kept in proper repair.  The Minister should look into this matter and if he would think it too great a hardship to compel farmers to fence their land &mdash; and I do believe it would be a great hardship &mdash; it might be possible for the local authority to assist the farmers in this matter.  It is something that has given judges and juries and the public generally, particularly motorists, considerable worry and trouble.  Now that the Minister has a Road Traffic Act before the House, it may be possible to bring in amending legislation which would remedy the situation.  It might be possible for the Minister to ensure that for a very small additional premium, motorists could be compelled <Col N="77" /> to insure themselves and their passengers against such damage as might be incurred in car crashes with straying animals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for the Coast Erosion Act which he introduced five or six years ago.  Speaking at the time, I remember saying how necessary it was, but also pointing out how cumbersome the procedure under the Act would eventually prove to be and how the delay and the duplication and the other machinery involved would eventually defeat the purpose of the Act.  How right I have proved to be. In County Donegal, I think we have formulated some six different coast erosion schemes.  They have been with the Minister for the past four years and that is the last we have heard of them.  They have gone to the Board of Works that somebody described correctly as the &ldquo;Board of Jerks&rdquo; because that is exactly how they work. They remind me of the old narrow gauge railway.  One passes the buck. The local authority say they have submitted it to Local Government and Local Government have transferred it to the Board of Works.</P>

I would like to know &mdash; and I will find out next week by means of Parliamentary Question &mdash; how many schemes have been submitted, how many have been operated and the amount of money spent on coast erosion.  We will clear the air then.  No scheme in Donegal has been put into operation, although they have been submitted many years and the land is still being eroded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I now move into the bailiwick of my friend now in the House, Deputy Briscoe?  May I join with him and other Deputies in appealing to the Minister not to close the Grand Canal? I was surprised to receive letters from citizens of Dublin informing me that their grandfathers came from my constituency and appealing to me to use any influence I had to ensure that the <Col N="78" /> Grand Canal will not be closed.  I am now carrying out the duty I have been asked and am appealing to the Minister to ensure the canal will not be closed.

      <P>We were talking earlier on about housing, but without sewerage and water houses cannot be properly serviced. There is a considerable delay in sanctioning sewerage and water schemes.  May I quote one example?  I have quoted it so often I am sure the Minister must be tired of listening to it. It is the water scheme for Ardara and Glenties.  After years of planning and all the other necessaries, we eventually got sanction for this scheme and advertised for tenders.  In September, 1965, we succeeded in procuring the lowest tender for the scheme.  On 15th September, 1965, we forwarded that tender to the Minister for Local Government for his sanction so that we could accept it.  From that day to this, we never heard from the Minister, despite repeated requests.</P>
      <P>I remember in the month of July last two of us, Deputy Breslin and I, going on a deputation to the Minister immediately before the local elections.  I must say Deputy Breslin did his best to blackmail the Minister because his opening gambit was: &ldquo;Deputy O'Donnell is going around Donegal telling the people that you have no money for the Ardara and Glenties water scheme.&rdquo;  And I told the Minister: &ldquo;Unless you sanction it, I will continue to say it.&rdquo;  And we are continuing to say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> May I appeal to the Minister to sanction that tender as soon as possible?  I note the Minister is now trying to sidestep, because the other day he sent us down another memorandum asking for a new priority of water and sewerage schemes, knowing very well that at this stage other priorities have crept in and Ardara and Glenties has been pushed slightly down the line.  If he can possibly give us some assurance that this tender will be sanctioned in the near future, we will be grateful.  But I doubt very much if the contractor will now undertake to carry out the scheme he tendered for in 1965 at the price he then tendered and we may find ourselves readvertising and some successor of the Minister possibly sanctioning it some time in the distant future.</P>
    <P>There is a Combined Purchasing Section in the Minister's Department. Some years ago when I was in Local Government, tenders were invited each year by the Combined Purchasing Section.  The tenders approved of were notified to local authorities and at that time, they could purchase from any other contractor, whether he tendered to the Combined Purchasing Section or not, so long as the price of the material or goods supplied did not exceed that approved by the Combined Purchasing Section.  That has been done away with and now it is necessary to purchase through the Combined Purchasing Section.</P>
    <P>That is a very bad thing.  For instance, I know small firms in different counties who would not dream of tendering to the Combined Purchasing Section in case they would get orders that would completely swamp them, but they could tender for the supply of materials in their own counties.  If the tender did not exceed those accepted by the Combined Purchasing Section, local authorities could approach these small contractors and procure their necessaries from them, thus avoiding considerable amounts in transport.  I would ask the Minister to revert to the old system which was in operation until he or his immediate predecessor changed the position.</P>
    <P>The Department have fallen down <Col N="80" /> badly in the provision of courthouses and pounds throughout the country. In Donegal we have not got a pound left.  If county registrars seize, as they often have to do on foot of decrees, there is no place in which legally to impound any animal seized.  The whole thing is a complete farce.  The provision of courthouses is the responsibility of the local authority.  Rates have soared and we know the local authorities can no longer impose a burden on the taxpayers for the provision of courthouses.  Courthouses should be taken out of the category of buildings provided by local authorities. I could understand it in the old days where you had a courthouse in every village and the old district councils were able to procure money for them, but today we are centralising our court.  In a few years' time we will have only two or three central courthouses in each county.  That being so, it should become a country-at-large charge and it should be the duty of the Minister to ensure that moneys are made available to the local authorities for the provision of these courthouses. They should not be a burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy referred a few minutes ago to the burdens placed on the taxpayers as a result of the high rates throughout the country at the moment. I know this is not part of the Minister's duty, but I distinctly remember hearing the then Deputy Dr. Ryan introducing the Health Act in this House saying, in reply to an interruption from this side, that it would cost an additional 2/- in the £ on the rates.  A figure of 17/6 or 19/- is now a very moderate estimate of the impact of the Health Act on the rates.  The taxpayer can no longer afford that in addition to the ordinary items which comprise the rates struck by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the then Minister for Local Government &mdash; I think it was Deputy Blaney &mdash; said he was looking into this question and would try to relieve the ratepayers of added increases in rates.  In my county the rates this year will amount to about £4 15s in the £.  It means that local authorities are now the landlords of all private dwellings throughout the State. <Col N="81" /> If one has house property of £16 valuation&mdash;and that is a very conservative valuation&mdash;one has to pay £1 10s. poor rate, which is over £64 a year.  If one wished to let that house one could not procure much more than £64 per year as the letting value, with the result that the local authority are really the landlords and the factual owners are paying the rent by way of rates to the local authority for the house.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House any longer on this matter.  In other years when the Estimate for Local Government was before the House, whether I was on this side of the House or on the other side of the House, I always found Deputies on some side of the House willing to compliment the Minister on what they considered to be the magnificent work he was doing, whether in the matter of building houses, sewerage grants, water grants, town planning, and so on.  I have yet to hear one Deputy on either side of the House compliment this Minister on the magnificent work he is alleged to be doing.</P>

      <P>I say that sincerely, not in jest.  He has a very difficult task. A large number of people who should be informed are not informed as to what is taking place in local government. This has been a very long debate. Most of the contributions dealt with every aspect of the Minister's Department. However, not enough has been said about the problem to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, namely, the Grand Canal.  I have gone to some trouble to inform myself as to what this matter is all about.  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the Dublin Corporation, two in particular, members of the General Purposes Committee, voted for the closure of the canal in the committee meeting and at the public session voted against the closure.  The peculiar thing is that one of these people who voted against the closure of the canal at the public session actually proposed its closure in 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> The emphasis has been laid all along on the need to use the Grand Canal to lay sewers and culverts.  The emphasis has been on these aspects but the wrong aspects in my opinion.  The most important aspect for the public and those who have been most vocal against the closure is the question of the restoration of the canal.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell appealed to the Minister to see that the canal is restored.  The Minister has given authority to the Dublin Corporation to close down temporarily a 5½ mile stretch of the canal subject to its restoration.  There is no question about its not being restored.  The public have got the idea that it will not be restored due to a number of public representatives who have not informed themselves as to the situation. I spent two and a half hours with the city engineer who told me about the plans for the canal.  I feel I should pass on a number of things that he told me.  First of all, he said, the requirement was for a culvert for rain water and a pipe for sewerage; that the culvert would be 10 feet high and the sewer six feet high.  The intention is to lay these two pipes side by side along the bed of the canal.  To lay them separately would increase the cost of the project enormously.  If laid side by side they will take up the following space: 20 feet wide, 20 feet deep.  The alternative to laying them along the bed of the canal would be to blast a tunnel.  The cost of the excavation would be enormous.  The city engineer gave me figures.  The approximate cost of blasting a tunnel would be between £1,000 and £1,200 per yard as against the cost of laying the pipes along the canal&mdash;between £250 and £350 per yard.  That is, for the main sewer pipes and does not include subsidiary pipes going into the canal.</P>

      <P>Certainly nothing about sewerage.  Many of the engineers who have joined in the controversy about the canal know nothing about sewerage.  A layman assumes that an engineer knows every aspect of his profession. That is not so.  A brain surgeon would not try to tell a heart surgeon how to do his job.  A number of people want to know how long it will take to lay the pipes.  That will be approximately two years.  The time taken to restore the canal will be one year.  The cost of restoring the canal now would be approximately £600,000.  The figures have been worked out.  Unfortunately, because of the delays in implementing the scheme, the cost has increased overall by £1 million.  The cost of laying the pipes and of restoring the canal is now in the region of £2,346,000.  In 1962, the cost would have been much less.  A number of persons have expressed concern about the canal not being water tight.  These fears are unfounded.  To quote the city engineer on this, the restoration of the canal presents no problems.  There are three methods of restoring the canal in order to ensure that it is water tight.  One is by concrete; one is by laying aside a large amount of puddle clay and saving it and the third method is a system used in Italy, by welded polythene sheeting. The engineers have taken borings of nearly every yard of that 5½ mile stretch and know exactly what the ground is like in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> There has been a good deal of discussion about the destruction of lock gates.  There are 10 sets of lock gates. Some of them are rotten, some are rotting and in the normal course would need replacement.  The cost of a set of lock gates is approximately £2,000.  The gates that are not rotten and would not need replacing could be unpinned, taken out and put back again.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of concern about the bridges, that the bridges will be knocked down or interfered with. There will be no interference whatsoever with any of the bridges.  Any interference with bridges would be associated with road widening and would have nothing whatsoever to do with the scheme.  A number of people, and one man in particular, asked the question about pipes being laid side by side taking up a width of 20 feet, and said the width of the canal is only 13 feet at a number of locks.  I put this to the City Engineer and the answer he gave me was very simple and straightforward.  He informed me that the pipes would go on top of one another going through the locks and once through the locks, side by side again, the drop at each lock would give a sufficient head to enable the flow through the pipes to continue unhindered.</P>
    <P>People are worried about their boats using the canal.  Last year 50 boats came up the canal from Ringsend to the 12th lock at Lucan, whereas the number of boats that were carried up to Lucan to the 12th lock and set sail up the canal to the midlands was 200. There would be a service provided by CIE for carrying boats up from Ringsend to the 12th lock whilst work is in progress.  The corporation are building a slip at the 12th lock, and every facility will be there.  There is no need for people to worry about their boats being transported.  The corporation made extensive inquiries about boats being transported in Britain from leading firms of boat hauliers.  The only accident that was reported to any boat was a collision at a set of traffic lights with another vehicle.  CIE recently carried a barge from Dublin to Belfast quite safely.  There is a considerable <Col N="85" /> amount of unwarranted scare-mongering being engaged in.</P>
    <P>If this scheme had been put into effect in the early 1960s, £1 million would have been saved.  At that time, land was roughly £700 to £800 an acre and it has gone up by £1,000 an acre, to £1,700 or £1,800.  I should say this was due to the lack of serviced land.  New towns will be built, and there will be such new towns in the areas of Palmerstown, Blanchardstown, all around that region.  These areas will require new industries. People talk of effluent: they think of it in terms of domestic effluent, without realising that effluent from industry has to be accommodated also.  Every industry has a right to discharge into a sewer.  These people have very little idea of the quantities that can be involved.  To give an example the quantity of effluent from the Clondalkin Paper Mills would be equivalent to the sewerage of a town mid-way between Cork and Limerick.  The effluent from Guinness's would be equivalent to that of a city the size of Cork.  One can see, therefore, the tremendous need there is for adequate sewerage.</P>
    <P>People have talked about the canal as a national asset.  It is true the Grand Canal is a national asset, a great tourist attraction, etc. However, one of our greatest national assets, and I think everyone will agree with me, is our pure rivers.  We are becoming famous throughout the world for game fishing. In England there is no game fishing because there are no pure rivers.  The only countries in Europe that have pure rivers are Sweden, Norway and this country.  The Baltic Sea is so polluted that there is not even one fish in it, except perhaps carp.</P>
    <P>Worries have also been expressed about discharging into Dublin Bay. There is no question of this.  New tanks are being built in the Pigeon House, and there the solids are separated from the liquids.  The solids are taken by the <i>Shamrock</i>, out to sea 2 miles east of the Baily Lighthouse and there dumped.  The currents there carry them away from the land and they completely <Col N="86" /> disperse.  In the sea there are approximately nine parts oxygen to one million parts of water, I am told.  This may be a little bit technical but maybe somebody here might understand some of this.  Nine parts oxygen are considered saturation.  Game fish can live in four parts oxygen per million parts of water.  In the Dublin estuary there are six parts oxygen per million parts water.  Sedimentation tanks are being installed at the Pigeon House and there will be no reduction at all in the oxygen content of the river, and it certainly will not fall below 60 per cent which is six parts per million.  Provision will be provided in this scheme to take all the effluent from Killeen Paper Mills and Clondalkin Paper Mills into the new sewer as I have already stated.  This effluent at the moment pollutes the River Camac.  There have been many complaints about the state of this river. Once the effluent from these two mills is fed into the main sewer, the River Camac, in about one month, can be pure again, chemically pure.  Fish can eventually return to this river.  This, I understand, could take anything between a year and two years; there is no definite period.  However, there are trout further on in the Camac river at Saggart and the Brittas lakes which will make this possible.</P>
    <P>As regards sewage farms Clondalkin Paper Mills spent £70,000 on a new sewage disposal plant which was completely ineffective.  There has been frequent mention about calling in the experts.  The only experts in this country on the problem of sewage are employed by the Dublin Corporation, by the Department of Local Government, by the Board of Works and by the ESB.  People say that there is no one in this country who knows anything about this problem.  These people who are dealing with major sewerage works all their lives know all about it. In spite of this fact, Mr. John Calvert of John Taylor's was consulted by the Dublin Corporation on the Grand Canal scheme.  John Taylor's is an English firm employing 600 engineers, and this firm specialises in water and sewerage works.  Mr. Calvert himself was a member of the Royal Commission <Col N="87" /> on the Thames and is a member of the Royal Water Resources Board. He is acknowledged worldwide as an authority on sewage disposal.  What is not generally realised is that sewerage must eventually discharge a polluted liquid.  This usually discharges into a river.  The only way in which a successful scheme can operate is through availability of water, preferably sea water.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there is no doubt whatsoever that the canal will be restored.  There has been talk about a secret road plan.  This is no secret at all.  A plan has been prepared to cope with the situation which is visualised in 1985 when it is estimated that there will be some 115,000 cars a day passing along by the canal.  This plan has been rejected by the Minister.  The corporation have been told very definitely&mdash;I am sure the Minister will confirm this&mdash;that the canal must be restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the matters one would normally deal with on this Estimate have already been dealt with by other speakers, particularly Deputy O'Donnell.  He, like myself, comes from a rural constituency, a constituency very similar to that which I represent.  Because he dealt so extensively with certain aspects in which I would normally be interested, it will not be necessary for me to raise these particular matters now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, however, like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in Mayo we have the highest rate in the country.  In Mayo we have a very special problem in relation to roads. We have the longest road mileage in the country.  Many of our roads are over mountainous areas and through bogs.  Take, for instance, the road from Crossmolina to Belmullet and Blacksod. There is bog underneath in many places to a depth of 12 to 15 feet.  The construction of roads over such terrain is a major engineering problem.  There is difficulty in making foundations and difficulty in hauling the materials for those foundations over very long distances. Many of the roads, rolled and <Col N="88" /> tarred, have broken down under the increased weight of traffic.  There are buses.  In the old days trucks weighed three, four or five tons.  Today they weigh 20 to 25 tons.  These trucks serve the bog development works and the power station.  The roads have been wrecked.  Foundations are a major problem and costings are much higher than they would normally be.</P>
    <P>We have many mountainous roads and excavation on these roads can be very costly.  Snow, followed by a sudden thaw accompanied by rain, works havoc on the roads.  I am trying to stress the seriousness of the problem. According to the Minister there is a cut of 25 per cent in grants for roads. I know that when the Minister made his speech, the financial position was not as healthy as it is now.  I am appealing to him, therefore, to bear in mind the improved financial position and the position of counties like Mayo, particularly North Mayo, where the problem is very serious.  From the point of view of tourism it is most important that we should have good roads giving easy access to tourist areas and tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>We have a very lopsided economy in Mayo.  Valuations range from £2 to £15 or £20.  The majority of valuations are £5, £7 and £8.  We have no big city in close proximity in which to dispose of produce.  It is absolutely important that our young people should have employment on road works.  The cut of roughly 25 per cent is a very serious matter.  It will aggravate the position in the West generally.  The position has been highlighted by meetings of the bishops and clergymen of different denominations in the West.  Cutting down on road works will deprive people of a traditional means of employment in order to supplement their meagre incomes.</P>
    <P>On the question of rates, Mayo County Council has been notified that in future they will be responsible for roads which were formerly the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  I refer to the minor employment and road improvement schemes. It was a major change of policy on the part of the Government to hand these schemes back to the county <Col N="89" /> councils.  It should be appreciated by the Minister that for quite a considerable time the Office which dealt with these schemes was practically shut down for lack of money.  In consequence of that stoppage, our roads have deteriorated very considerably and the fact that they have not been maintained as they should have been means that much additional expense will be required to put them in proper repair.</P>
    <P>I understand that £44,000 has been indicated as the amount of money available from the Central Fund to Mayo County Council to undertake this work.  It has to be borne in mind that this work will entail many engineering expenses.  We will have to employ five or six additional engineers, if we can get them, to undertake the surveying of these roads so that by the time this has been done, there will be only £38,000 or £39,000 available for the actual work.  That amount could be spent in the Swinford electoral area alone, and it is doubtful if it would be sufficient to restore the roads in that area to their proper condition. It is ridiculous to think that an amount such as £44,000 would be sufficient to do this work all over the county.  I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at the figures and realise that what he is giving is completely insufficient.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience in our county of bridges coming to be regarded as dangerous and I notice that the question has now cropped up in Cork.  I am speaking about bridges over roads between two important towns such as the bridge at Cloonacanna, between Swinford and Aclare. I understand that after a long struggle between the Minister and myself, that bridge is to be rebuilt.  I hope there will be no delay in doing the work.</P>
    <P>We have another serious problem in relation to grants paid to us by the Government.  This is an old problem and has arisen because of the delay on the part of the Department in paying out grants advised to the county council.  In order to pay our bills, we have to raise the money from the banks <Col N="90" /> and pay interest on it.  Every year we find colossal sums of money being added on to the rates because of the high rates of interest which the county council has to pay on these overdrafts. I have listened to criticism in this House along this line on many an occasion, but, in a county such as ours, where we are facing an increase of from 7s 6d to 10/- in the £ in our rates this year, it is ridiculous that this extra amount should be imposed on us.</P>
    <P>The question of housing has been raised, particularly by Dublin Deputies. I know this city very well and I can appreciate the views expressed by Deputy M. O'Leary and others regarding their problems here.  Over the years, many of the older buildings have deteriorated and finance to replace them is not available.  Our problem is a different one.  We have built a lot of houses in the small towns and rural areas and got grants for them.  Many of them were built when materials were cheaper than they are at the moment but the regrettable situation is that many of these houses are now vacant.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the records of the House my appreciation of the work the engineering and office staffs in Mayo County Council have contributed towards the solution of our housing problem.  It is to their credit that they worked overtime and for long hours in the formulation of housing schemes so that our people might live decently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provision is made for appealing decisions of a planning authority to the Minister for Local Government.  The decisions which may be appealed to the Minister fall into five broad categories (a) those relating to permission to develop property or to retain a structure in respect of which planning <Col N="91" /> permission was not obtained, and in relation to the unauthorised use of property; (b) decisions by a planning authority taking the form of a notice served by authority on a property owner in relation to the preservation of amenities, be they trees, flora or fauna, or the creation of amenities, such as rights of way; (c) certain decisions relating to the payment of compensation by the planning authority; (d) the relaxation of building restrictions and (e) decisions of a procedural character, that is to say, dealing with services of notices of a property owner extending the time for bringing a claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that if any question arises in any particular case as to what is or is not a development or an exempted development, the question should be referred to and decided by the Minister.  In this Bill Fine Gael propose to take all these powers of appeal from the Minister for Local Government and to give them instead to a new board to be known as the Appeals Board.  The board, to be established under section 4, is designed to ensure impartiality, confidence and competence and to improve the operation of the Planning and Development Act throughout the country.  When the present Act was going through the Dáil the Fine Gael Party, by numerous amendments, sought to have these powers of appeal vested in the courts.  That view was not accepted by the Dáil and we had to be content to wait and see how the Act would work out in practice.  It is now clear beyond shadow of doubt that the appeals provisions of the Act are not working satisfactorily; on the contrary, the appeals procedure is the object of widespread criticism, suspicion and distrust, and it is difficult to see how it could be otherwise.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1963, provision is made for the hearing of appeals on oral evidence by any party.  It is further provided that any such oral hearing may be conducted by a person appointed for that purpose by the Minister.  Such person, normally an officer of the Minister's Department, is empowered to furnish a report to <Col N="92" /> the Minister before the Minister gives his decision.  Even with the best will in the world the Minister for Local Government cannot properly exercise his appeal powers under the Act if for no other reason than that the volume of work to be discharged by the Minister on appeals alone is too great.  In the year ended 30th September, 1965, 979 valid appeals were submitted to the Minister.  In the following year, 1,125 were submitted and in the year ended 30th September, 1967, 1,322 were submitted. During the year ending 30th September, 1965, 437 appeals were decided by the Minister.  In the following year, 862 appeals were decided by the Minister and for the year ending 30th September, 1967, 991 appeals were decided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some of these appeals were probably more important than others but in every case in which a citizen decides to appeal to the Minister, it must be taken that the matter involved is of considerable importance to that person. It is quite impossible for a Minister with his many duties&mdash;as Minister in charge of his Department, as a Deputy with constituency duties, as a member of a political Party and a Member of the Government&mdash;and while carrying on his functions in relation to these various activities, to bring a judicial mind to bear upon as many as 991 planning decisions in the space of one year.  It must be obvious that in many cases the Minister will act upon the report of the civil servant dealing at official level with the planning appeal and merely rubber stamp it, dealing personally, so to speak, only with those cases in which special representations have been made to him.  It is a delusion to think that decisions in planning appeals are at present the product of a Ministerial examination of the reasons why the planning authority made the decision in the first place, or of the arguments for or against the decision put in by the parties to the appeal.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that it is wrong that the Minister, who is a politician and the political head of the Department of Local Government, should be entrusted with giving judicial decisions in planning appeals, decisions which <Col N="93" /> can add enormously to the value of property or, indeed, detract enormously from such value.  As a politician, the Minister is subject to political pressure from many angles and it would be asking too much of human nature to expect the Minister not to be influenced by such pressure.  In my opinion, it is asking too much of the present Minister for Local Government, who is the honorary secretary of his own Party, and who acts as Director of Elections from one end of the country to the other, and who, I think, would not be offended if I described him as being one of the people regarded as a director of strategy within his own Party, not to be unfairly influenced by the pressure which must be brought to bear on him as a result of his activities in the various fields I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The next question I should like to pose is: is there a demand for the Bill which I am now recommending to the House?  I say there is a widespread demand for it.  There is widespread dissatisfaction about the present system of appeals.  As recently as last September, the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland, at its Congress in Tralee, passed this resolution unanimously:</P>
    <P>That the Minister for Local Government be asked to amend the Planning and Development Act, 1963, so as to provide that planning appeals should be heard by the judiciary instead of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>That conference is composed of representatives from all political Parties, including the Minister's Party.  It is composed of representatives from practically all the municipal authorities in the State, and that was its recommendation and its demand.  The executive of this Association of Municipal Authorities, as recently as last week in the City Hall in Dublin, also expressed dissatisfaction with the present planning arrangements and suggested that they should be preserved as a reserved function.  The resolution I am relying on is the resolution unanimously passed after having been on the agenda circulated for <Col N="94" /> a couple of weeks by the annual conference of the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In order to make appeals affecting the property rights not alone of developers but also of adjacent property owners, and the public, real appeals in which the issues will be decided upon a mature consideration of the proper planning and development of a particular area and the other provisions laid down in the Act of 1963, Fine Gael propose in the Bill to establish an independent board which will devote its full time to dealing with planning appeals.  It will be provided with such a staff as will be necessary to enable the board to function effectively.  Lest one board should not be sufficient to deal with the number of appeals&mdash;which on present indications appear to be growing year by year: it will be noted that the total number of appeals dealt with in the year ending 30th September, 1967, was twice the number dealt with in the year ending 30th September, 1965&mdash;power is being given in the Bill to the Minister to increase the number of members of the board so that a second board will be available to deal with appeals.  The second board would have the same powers and act in all respects in the same way as the permanent board to be appointed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the complex society in which we live, it is obviously necessary that the State should play an ever-increasing role in public affairs.  The stage has been reached, however, where the steadily increasing autonomy of the Government and the Civil Service has quite literally become a law unto itself. Most ministerial decisions made in the exercise of discretionary powers vested in them by various statutes are not subject to the authority of the courts, nor can they be effectively made the subject of an inquiry even by Parliamentary Question, by debates on the Adjournment, or in the course of debates on Estimates for various Departments.  We have reached the stage in this country where the permanent head of a Department has refused to produce his files for audit purposes to the Comptroller and <Col N="95" /> Auditor General.  That is an indication of the stage to which the autonomy which the Civil Service claims to exercise has travelled.  That is the sort of thing to which I say this Bill will put an end.</P>
    <P>Decisions of Ministers are too numerous to permit of any scrutiny in order to avoid injustices which may arise in many cases.  To continue to allow this great and increasing power of the Government&mdash;most frequently exercised by its Civil Service&mdash;to be exercised arbitrarily against an individual citizen or business company&mdash; and by &ldquo;exercised arbitrarily&rdquo; I mean exercised according to their own will&mdash;is at complete variance with our sense of justice and fair play.  Most European countries have some form of protection against arbitrary decisions by the executive Government. In France they have what is known as the Conseil D'État.  In Sweden, in Finland, in Denmark, in Norway and in New Zealand, they have in one form or another an officer corresponding to the Ombudsman about whom we hear so much in modern times.  In England recently they introduced the Parliamentary Commissioner as the result of a demand from the public for someone to stand between the rights of the citizens and the powers of the executive.</P>
    <P>In this country we have never publicly recognised the need for any officer who would have supervisory authority over decisions of Ministers in those areas in which Ministers exercise a discretionary administrative power.  It is true, however, that in certain fields, we have recognised the necessity for entrusting decisions to judicial or quasi-judicial officers. Under the income tax code, we have the Special Commissioners of Income Tax who sit publicly, give their decisions and are independent.  Under the Land Acts, we have the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission who have evolved a system which, on paper, would never appear to work satisfactorily in that appeals are taken to the Lay Commissioners from administrative decisions already taken by <Col N="96" /> themselves, but in practice, the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission, sitting and acting judicially, have given the utmost satisfaction to those appearing before them.</P>
    <P>A feature of cardinal importance in the case of the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission is the fact that they are quite independent of the Government and of the Minister in their constitution and the terms of their appointment.  That is probably why they have always been able to exercise their powers judicially, irrespective of the wishes of a particular Minister or of the pressure sometimes sought to be exercised by groups organised in relation to a particular holding of land.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts, we have the appeals officers.  We have the acknowledgement by the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare that appeals officers are necessary. While these appeals officers are not all that could be desired, in that they are permanent officials of the Department of Social Welfare, they still act independently of the Minister and give independent decisions, having heard the submissions and the evidence.  Much more important is the decision of the Government in relation to the Redundancy Act of 1967.  When the Bill was introduced, it provided that appeals be taken to an appeals officer under the Social Welfare Acts, but it is very much to the credit of the Minister for Labour that he accepted an amendment by Deputy Jones of this Party providing for an appeals tribunal of the sort I am now advocating.  We believe that as a result of that amendment, the Redundancy Bill of 1967 left the House a much better instrument than when it came in.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting coincidence, perhaps, that it was the same Deputy who, as shadow Minister for Local Government in 1963, strongly advocated an appeals board in relation to the Planning and Development Act which I now urge.  He took the view then that it was wrong that appeals should be decided by a Minister just as in 1967 in the case of the Redundancy Bill he took the view that it was wrong that important decisions under <Col N="97" /> that measure affecting workers and employers should be made by a civil servant.  He did not succeed but he endeavoured to persuade Deputy Blaney to amend the Planning Act.  He succeeded in persuading the Minister for Labour to amend the Redundancy Bill.  I trust that the present Minister will follow the reasonable example of the Minister for Labour and accept this Bill.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, Fine Gael proposes that the new Board shall consist of a chairman, who shall be a judge of the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court and two other members, one to be drawn from a panel of members nominated by the Minister for Local Government and another to be drawn from a panel to be constituted by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The persons drawn from the panels must be a qualified civil engineer, a qualified architect or a qualified town planner.</P>
    <P>The purpose of appointing a judge of one of the courts to act as chairman and to give the decision having heard the parties to the appeal is to give a new confidence to the public in planning appeals.  In our society no better system of obtaining fair play and justice for all concerned has been devised than the machinery of appointing judges who are absolutely independent in the exercise of their judicial powers. The system of judicial appointments in this country has worked well and has given general satisfaction to the community. No doubt in individual cases, individual persons will harbour a sense of grievance because a particular judge has not seen things their way.  There must be a loser in every contest before a judicial person but the public has an unshakeable belief in the impartiality and incorruptibility of our judges and it is for this reason that Fine Gael proposes that a judge should be chairman of the Board, that the decision of the Board shall be the decision of the judge, who will have the benefit of the assistance of two highly qualified persons, one appointed by the Minister and another from the Local Appointments Commissioners Panel.</P>
    <P>It may be said that a judge is not a <Col N="98" /> particularly qualified person to hear and determine appeals under the Planning Acts.  The same can be said of a Minister but in any event this is entirely an erroneous view because judges have been lawyers of considerable practice and extensive experience in human affairs, in matters affecting the business community, in matters affecting property rights, during their careers before being appointed judges.  A judge as chairman of the Board will bring to the Board all that wealth of experience together with that particular impartial approach as between planning authority and citizen and as between citizen and citizen and he will make decisions in the light of the requirements of the Oireachtas as laid down in the Planning Act of 1963 and the development plan made by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the decisions of the Appeals Board are the best possible, the two additional members of the Board as assessors are proposed in the Bill.  The panel to be nominated by the Minister will provide the highly expert knowledge and approach which the Minister's higher officers at the present time give to the Minister in the reports that they submit on individual planning appeals.  In addition the member from the Minister's panel will provide a necessary degree of co-ordination from the Department's and planning authority's point of view and provide the liaison between the Department and the planning authority on the one hand and the planning board on the other so that those concerned with planning on what I might call the &ldquo;official&rdquo; side, will have constant liaison with the Board and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>On the other hand, in order to ensure impartiality and that the &ldquo;official&rdquo; view will not predominate on the Board, it is proposed that the third member of the Board will be drawn from a panel to be appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners. Such a person will have the same qualifications as a member on the Minister's panel and will be a technical expert like the Minister's member, but will be able to take an independent line representing what I might call the non-&ldquo;official&rdquo; public <Col N="99" /> interest point of view.  We, of Fine Gael believe that such a Board will be a highly competent Board, and that from the very inception of its work, will inspire the members of the public coming before it with every confidence in its competence and impartiality.</P>
    <P>In order further to strengthen the confidence of the public in the impartiality of the Board, a provision is being made in sub-section (8) of Section 4 of the Bill, that an ordinary member of the Board shall not, while holding his office as a member of the Board, be capable of holding any other office or position of emolument or be a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, or be interested in any company or partnership concerned in dealing with, or developing, land.  The purpose of this provision is to make sure that no decision of the Board will fall under any suspicion that any member of the Board was or could in any way be motivated by personal interest or private gain.</P>
    <P>The last element in the constitution of the Board for the purpose of ensuring its impartiality and inspiring public confidence in its deliberations is that the Board will keep a record of its decisions and provide a copy of every decision for the public and power has been given in the Bill to the Minister after consultation with the Board to make regulations in relation to the keeping of records of decisions and the publication of the principles applied by the Board in reaching decisions. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that the public will know well in advance of making any planning application or taking an appeal from a planning authority's decision, the principles upon which the Board operates.  These would emerge over a period of time from the decisions which the Board will give.  Furthermore, as the Board would have to publish its decisions and as these will be readily accessible to the public the decisions will not only have to be fair but to appear so to the public.</P>
    <P>In proposing to the House that the Board be established along the lines envisaged in the Bill, it is not to be <Col N="100" /> understood that every appeal, however relatively unimportant it may be, will be the subject of a full-scale inquiry before the Board.  This is not at all envisaged.  Many appeals will be dealt with without oral hearing as at present but in every case, the Board will formally and actually make the decision itself.  The Board will not rubber stamp the recommendations of any of its officials but will bring its own mind to bear upon the particular appeal and deal with it on paper.  For this reason, the Board is being integrated into the Act as far as practicable and only a minimum of amendments are being made to the provisions of the 1963 Act dealing with appeals.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the system proposed by this Bill for dealing with appeals will add to the cost of appeals. I want to say here and now there is no such intention behind this Bill.  It is of cardinal importance that it be clearly understood by the House that appeals should be continued to be dealt with, even by way of oral hearing, by the Board on an informal basis; the judge will not sit with a wig and gown as he does in Court nor will there be any of the formality associated with the proceedings that is required in Court hearings.  Access to the Board should be available to any member of the public, to an engineer or architect or building contractor on his behalf.  Right of audience should not and will not be restricted to members of the legal profession. Procedure before the Board must be as simple as possible and in this the Minister will by virtue of the power which he has under the Bill to make regulations after consultation with the Board to ensure that appeals to the Board will continue to have the advantage of being inexpensive and informal with the added advantage of being expert, expeditious and manifestly impartial.  The time has been reached to take politics out of planning appeals and planning appeals out of politics.</P>
    <P>I say that because town planning has come to affect the everyday life of the man in the street.  It can make or mar him financially.  It can add enormously to the value of his property or <Col N="101" /> it can reduce it drastically.  It is not reasonable or fair that decisions with such effect should be made by the political head of a Department behind closed doors without the necessity for giving his reasons for so doing.</P>
    <P>Another amendment which is being made in the law is contained in section 7 of the Bill.  This will enable a person to object to planning permission being given to appear as a party at an appeal in the kind of case where the planning authority has refused planning permission and the developer has appealed the refusal.  At present if A applies for planning permission and B opposes if the planning authority refuses permission, A appeals to the Minister and there is an oral hearing, B who is vitally affected by this decision has no right to appear at the oral hearing and tender evidence and cross-examine witness.  Section 7 proposes to amend that.  In such a case an adjacent owner of property, who may have a vital interest in the outcome of the appeal and in upholding the planning authority's refusal, should be entitled to go to the hearing before the appeals tribunal and be heard.  As the law stands he is not so entitled and the object of section 7 is to correct that.</P>
    <P>I think there is a widespread demand in the country for a change in the method of appealing under the Planning and Development Act, 1963. It is badly needed.  The present system does not command confidence.  It is open to abuses and pressure from one quarter or another.  I am confident that only by accepting this Bill and the principle of taking appeals away from the Minister and handing them over to an independent judicial tribunal&mdash;who will hear evidence in public if necessary, and more important, give its decision and the reasons for its decisions in public&mdash;will the present unsatisfactory state of affairs be rectified.  I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of planning permission is probably one of the most controversial one could discuss at present.  It has become controversial because of the very mysterious decisions that have been made from time <Col N="102" /> to time by the Minister for Local Government.  I undoubtedly see many benefits in taking away from the political head of a Department these decisions which so vitally affect the individual concerned but can directly affect many other people who have no say and whose interests apparently get no consideration whatever from the Minister and his Department.  The first duty of a Member of this House is to express the views and, on occasions, the fears of the people that he is sent here to represent.  In my constituency a considerable amount of redevelopment has taken place and the area is scheduled for further development.  A number of my constituents have expressed to me their fears with regard to some of the decisions that have been handed down by the Minister with regard to planning permission and in particular with regard to appeals that have been made to the Minister against decisions of the appropriate local authority which, in the case of my constituency, is the Dublin Corporation. The fears that they have expressed have been that, in fact, there is a large element of corruption in some of the decisions that have been made.  &ldquo;Corruption&rdquo; is a very nasty word that should not be used lightly by a Deputy in this House.  The use of such a word in this House is privileged in that legal action cannot be taken against the Deputy using it. Having regard to that privilege, a very large sense of responsibility must be exercised by individual Deputies. However, the duty and the primary obligation of a Member of the House is to express clearly the feelings and fears of his constituents and there is no doubt that very many of my constituents fear that in this area of planning appeal and planning permission there is corruption.  I will go further.  When I see some of the decisions that have been handed down, I personally share this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like very much if the Minister would take the opportunity now presented to him by virtue of this debate to give me reason to change my view with regard to this charge of corruption because one aspect&mdash;and one of the more undesirable aspects&mdash;of the <Col N="103" /> Minister's right to reverse a decision of a local authority is that he gives absolutely no reason whatsoever.  He is not obliged&mdash;nor does he, in fact&mdash; to justify the decision which he is handing down.  The local authority will clearly inform the applicant the grounds on which planning permission is refused.  The applicant may appeal to the Minister and the next thing that one knows is that permission has been granted but no reason whatsoever is given.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the enhanced value that planning permission may bestow, is it any wonder that this cry of &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; would go up in certain cases and that people are quite honestly and quite openly saying that this is a tie up and that someone, as Mr. Colley would say, &ldquo;in high places&rdquo; is getting something out of it? These are things that should not be lightly said by a Deputy in this House but they must be said and the Minister must be given an opportunity and must be asked to avail of that opportunity to dispel the fears that people have with regard to corruption in planning permission.</P>
    <P>There is a number of cases I personally know where a local authority has refused permission for the erection of a certain type of structure or have reserved land for the building of local authority houses and the Minister has reversed the decisions and by doing so has made the property concerned very, very valuable indeed.  In order that the Minister may be at no disadvantage when he comes to reply.  I will cite just two cases that I personally know and in connection with which I find it very difficult not to agree with my constituents who cry &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under town planning, an area consisting of approximately 330 acres in the Kilbarrack area had been designated by Dublin Corporation for local authority housing for quite some time. Then a gentleman named Gallagher acquired some of this property and appealed to the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, for the exclusion of portion of this land for private housing.  The Minister granted <Col N="104" /> Mr. Gallagher's appeal and the result of that was that instead of the corporation having 330 acres for local authority housing, approximately one-third of it&mdash;I think somewhere in the region of 129 acres approximately&mdash; was excluded and handed over to Mr. Gallagher for the building of private houses.  This, of course, enhanced the value of the land quite considerably and now we find that Mr. Gallagher and his group are in a position to offer back to the corporation something in the region of 700 or 800 houses, at his price.  Mr. Gallagher, who is no stranger to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say, Deputy Gallagher.  That gives him ample opportunity to come into this House and reply.  He was able to offer back to the corporation these houses and stated quite openly, publicly&mdash;he was quoted in the newspapers as saying&mdash; that naturally he was only interested in profit.  Had this land been left to the corporation they would have been able to develop their own houses on it.  There is one case which gives rise&mdash; and very justifiably so unless there is an acceptable explanation as to why the decision was made&mdash;to this charge of corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another case, a more recent one, regarding a petrol station in Mount Pleasant in regard to which there were a number of applications to Dublin Corporation which were all refused. The corporation stated in very definite terms why they were refusing permission for the erection of a petrol station at this particular place.  In my opinion, and, I might add, in the opinion of the majority of the elected representatives of Dublin Corporation, they gave valid reasons why permission should not be given.  The gentleman in question, who, because he is not a Member of this House and has no direct voice in the <Col N="105" /> House, I shall not name, appealed to the Minister.  The Minister upheld the appeal and overruled the corporation, and a petrol station can now appear in Mount Pleasant.  If this gentleman has enhanced the value of the property by £58,000 by virtue of the Minister's decision to give permission, surely, unless the Minister avails of this opportunity to give an adequate explanation as to why this permission was given and the local authorities were overruled, people are justified in crying &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; in regard to planning permission.</P>
    <P>I have cited two cases, and I have done so in order to give the Minister every opportunity of letting the public know why the 129 acres were excluded from the corporation's development and handed over to a private individual, despite the crying needs of the people of this city for municipal housing at the time, and why he overruled the corporation and gave permission for a petrol station to be built in Mount Pleasant, although very valid reasons had been given by the local authority for refusing such permission and absolutely no reason has been forthcoming from the Minister as to why he saw fit to give this permission.</P>
    <P>There is a growing tendency, unfortunately, in this country today for our people to say: &ldquo;Ah, sure, there was a fiddle on there.&rdquo;  The tragedy about it is that the activities of what Mr. Colley would term &ldquo;people in high places&rdquo; have been going on for so long and have been going on without a full and adequate explanation of the action taken by these people in high places, that our people are inclined to believe that one of the necessary qualifications for a politician is to be on the fiddle.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this is the type of representation our people want, and I do not believe that any Government or any responsible politician who can do away with this tendency will not avail of every possible opportunity of doing so.  If the Minister avails now of this opportunity he has of giving a reason for the decision he has made, even in the two cases I have cited, if we ignore the very many others that have happened, he will be doing a service to both the House and the people.</P>

      <P>Good.  The questions that have been raised here, particularly and generally, are questions of deep concern to many people who have the best interests of the country at heart. There is far too much involved in permission for a particular type of development being either granted or withheld to permit this power to lie in the hands of the political head of the Department.  One might say that we must accept that the Minister who exercises this power is a responsible Minister and a Minister who will weigh up all the aspects of a particular situation before giving a decision. The various interests involved clash violently.  There is the question of a large sum of money going to a particular concern or a particular individual in the event of development taking place.  There are the interests that concern us on this side of the House, namely, the needs of the people.  Surely it is too much to have one man in the position of overruling a local authority, <Col N="109" /> a local authority which has been guided by its technical experts who advise against a certain development taking place?  Surely, if a Minister overrules the decision of a local authority in those circumstances, he should give reasons as to why he does so, so that people will not alone know that justice has been done but will actually see justice being done?</P>
      <P>Unfortunately that is not the principle that prevails here and anything which will correct the present unhappy situation, such as removing this power from the Minister and giving it to an independent body, which will justify its decision, commends itself to me.  As I said earlier&mdash;I repeat it now&mdash;I cited two of the many cases of which I am aware.  If the Minister will avail of this opportunity of letting the people know why he overruled the local authority with regard to the development in Kilbarrack and the petrol station in Mount Pleasant and explains fully and adequately his reasons for reversing the decision taken, he will not only be doing justice to himself but he will also dispel the idea that has crept into people's minds that there is widespread corruption at the present time with regard to planning permission, particularly in this capital city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason I wish to say a few words in this debate is that, knowing that Deputy Fitzpatrick is a good advocate, I expected he would be able to make a good case. I was not disappointed.  He made a very good case though, to my way of thinking, he missed out on one or two important aspects of planning, aspects which deserve to be mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my own experience of the operation of the Planning Act, the principal defect is that there are, in all, 87 planning authorities.  It is bad enough having 27 health authorities, but I shudder at the thought of 50 more planning authorities.  It is perfectly obvious that it is impossible practically to achieve uniformity between them.  In my experience, there has been no uniformity as between one planning authority and another. In my opinion, some planning authorities <Col N="110" /> have virtually abdicated their rights altogether.  The figures given by Deputy Fitzpatrick&mdash;I assume they are accurate&mdash;show the enormous weight of work cast on the Minister and his predecessor since the Act came into operation.  I am perfectly certain that, if the facts were known in regard to at least 50 per cent of applications, there would be no necessity for an appeal at all in the first instance.  Many of the applications were turned down on altogether frivolous grounds or on grounds which showed no real grasp of the purpose of the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>In fairness, I should add that every Act, especially such a complicated measure as the Town and Regional Planning Act, is bound to cause great difficulty when it first comes into operation and bound to cause misgivings in the minds of those charged with the serious responsibility of putting it into effect.  Nobody in this House regards the purpose of the Planning Act as anything other than serious.</P>
    <P>I thought it was a weakness in Deputy Fitzpatrick's case to bring in the example of the action of the Secretary of the Department of Justice in regard to certain files which he refused to hand to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was using this to show that his general statement regarding the arbitrary powers of Ministers and Secretaries of Departments was correct.  I do not think it was relevant because surely there are certain files in the Department of Justice which, for policy sake, must not see the light of day.  I am sure that in so far as the Secretary, or any other secretary, may have improperly held the files, that situation can rapidly be put right.</P>
    <P>I must say that the tone of the debate changed radically and sadly when Deputy Cluskey got to his feet. It seems to me that Deputy Cluskey would find corruption in Heaven. Whatever about the roads, the sewers were certainly opened wide in Deputy Cluskey's speech.  It is not my function and, in any case, I am not familiar with the circumstances, to accept the invitation which Deputy Cluskey gave to me to reply to certain specific <Col N="111" /> charges of corruption which he made in regard to certain matters within the ambit of the Minister for Local Government.  Indeed, in so far as these charges also reflect on another Member of this House, I have no doubt we will hear a great deal more about them in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>It does us, as Members of this House, no service to make vague general charges of corruption such as Deputy Cluskey made.  While I do not object to his making charges in regard to specific questions known to be within the purview of the Minister, matters with regard to which he has the facts and on which he will be able to reply in due course, I repudiate the general statement that there is corruption in regard to planning of these, either as regards the present Minister or his predecessor.  In that I do not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the pressures involved are such that the Minister has not been able to resist them.  This, I emphatically say, has not been my experience and has not been the experience of anybody whom I know in regard to the present Minister or his predecessor, whether these pressures were political, parochial or of any other kind.  So far as the present Minister for Local Government is concerned. I do not know of any Deputy of higher integrity who has come into this House.</P>
    <P>The fear I have about the proposals in this Bill, while they are very good ones and may offer a good solution to some of the problems, is that they would lead to the creation of a new Department to be known as the Department of Planning.  It is obvious that if the members of the proposed board, the judge and his assessors, were able to discharge their functions in accordance with the stipulations of the Bill, they would require to be given a very large sum of money.  They would require a very considerable staff as well and we know that when staff begins to grow, it is not downwards but upwards that is the development.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests a simple procedure, this is a praiseworthy sentiment.  I agree with many <Col N="112" /> of the things he said with regard to the present appeals system.  He cites the case of the objector who has no right of audience.  That is something that should be remedied.  In general, most of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick seemed to me to be well thought out and worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Whether the proposals put forward by him would not lead to a more costly system of deciding appeals is the one matter which I have great doubt.  Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks they would not.  I think they would and, if I may repeat what I said when Deputy Fitzpatrick was not here, the root of the matter lies in the fact that there are 87 authorities where there should possibly be not more than half a dozen.  If there were only about half a dozen authorities, the need for the present enormous number of appeals would be obviated and the need for the big machinery suggested in this Bill as being necessary would also be obviated.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say too much that would impinge on the province of the Minister for Local Government. Surely the fundamental purpose of planning is to preserve the natural and aesthetic beauty of our towns, cities and countryside?  Surely that is the object of all planning, all appeals and all decisions?  There is a lot of Ireland left to destroy.  A lot of it has already been destroyed.  If I were satisfied that the machinery suggested in the Bill was the best machinery for the prevention of the further destruction of our country, for the preservation of what is beautiful and for the development of what is aesthetically and economically desirable, I would vote for it.  I think it is not quite the right method of attack but I also think that great credit is due to Deputy Fitzpatrick for the care with which he prepared his brief, for his speech for which he deserves every credit personally and on which I would like to compliment him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to note the Minister's reaction to this Bill. The only note of recrimination I have to offer on it is that in 1963 when the <Col N="113" /> present Act was passing through the House, Fine Gael put forward proposals exactly similar to those contained in this Bill at that time.  The Government, at that stage, rejected those proposals.  Had they accepted them, it would not have been necessary to introduce this Bill which has been so carefully prepared and placed before the House.  I gather from the Minister for Health that he is satisfied with the principles put forward in this Bill and that his main objection is that it might lead to great expense.  I do not think that is a very valid argument. What we are seeking to do is to replace one piece of machinery with another.  We are replacing the local government inspector who might go to Cork, Galway, or elsewhere, by a judge and two assessors.  That is about the only extra expense involved.  Let us take it that even if there were greater expense involved, this is no valid argument against passing a Bill of this nature because this Bill has been introduced for a very specific purpose which has been rather highlighted by the allegations made by Deputy Cluskey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can rest assured of this, that not alone is it important that justice should be done but it should be seen to be done.  At the moment, plainly it does not appear to the average person who is involved in a town planning appeal that justice has been done.  I have been brought very closely in touch with the public approach to matters of this nature and I have been struck by the fact, although I have been in public life for over 20 years, that neither as a lawyer nor as a public man have I ever been approached by any person to do a deal with a judge.  Nobody has ever suggested he could approach a judge to get a judge to alter his decision or so to make his decision as to suit any particular person.  Time and again, and I am sure this has been the experience of every other Deputy, I have been approached by people interested in appeals under the Planning Act.  They <Col N="114" /> ask you to communicate with the Minister with a view to getting the Minister to make a certain decision.  That shows how the public mind reacts to the present machinery in regard to appeals.</P>
      <P>When the Principal Act was being introduced, we on the Fine Gael benches expressed our extreme dissatisfaction with it.  We warned the Government that the people would be dissatisfied with it.  It has been the experience of most Members, I am sure, that the people are dissatisfied with it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to refer at any length to the fact, already referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick, that the Association of Municipal Authorities at their annual congress unanimously called for the introduction of legislation of this nature.  It is absolutely essential, in my view, for the resuscitation of public belief in the machinery of appeals that something like this should be done, because when the appeals are carried out in the fashion referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cluskey, there is bound to remain in the mind of the public a feeling that some political pull might have been used or, in fact, had been used.  I might say, without making any allegations of corruption, because I do not know enough about the case, that many decisions have been made on appeal which to me appeared to be unsustainable and to have some elements about them which will always remain a mystery to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bad thing when a Minister, as the political head of a Department, can make a decision in private.  He can send down his inspector and his inspector can make any inquiries he likes and he must receive the evidence given to him and he must report to the Minister, but the Minister is not bound by what the inspector tells him.  That is one of the things which interferes mostly with public confidence.  There are many anomalies in the present situation which cause grave misgivings. For instance, not alone has the Minister absolute power when appeals come in but in his own absolute discretion, the Minister for Local Government, having determined an appeal, can proceed to order the appellant to pay such costs as the Minister thinks fit, to <Col N="115" /> the Minister for Local Government. That is the sort of thing which should not exist in the State at present.  This is administrative law at its worst.</P>
    <P>It is about time we followed the practice adopted in the countries to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred, to afford the public protection from arbitrary decisions of a political figure. I see no good reason why the Government should refuse to accept the suggestions put forward in this Bill. Since the Principal Act was introduced in 1963, as already pointed out by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Government have accepted the principle put forward in this Bill, in the Redundancy Payments Act.  It was not their original intention to do so because the Bill they put before the House did not contain the proposals which eventually were enshrined in it as a result of the advocacy of Deputy Jones in this House. For that reason, I earnestly appeal to the Government to carry into this particular sphere of legislation proposals similar to those enshrined in the Redundancy Payments Act.  Nothing can be lost by it; a little more expense will be involved, but it will be money well spent inasmuch as it will revive public confidence in town planning appeals generally.  It will give each person who has an appeal the feeling that he has been fairly and justly dealt with.  It will prevent corruption, if there has been corruption; if corruption does not occur, it will prevent in this House the making of allegations which have no foundation.</P>
    <P>I am not adjudicating on the allegations made by Deputy Cluskey. I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister and Deputy Gallagher dealing with this matter themselves. The introduction of the very outright and forthright allegations by Deputy Cluskey has invested this debate with a piquancy and importance which we who introduced the measure did not expect it would get in its course through the House.  Anyway, it is important that we should get rid of the atmosphere in which such allegations can be thrown around; worse still, if allegations are founded, it is imperative that we should get rid of the <Col N="116" /> system which allows such a thing to happen in our State in 1968.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress, I was speaking on the housing problem generally, and paying tribute to the engineering staffs and others who work under the control of the various county councils throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I feel that any words I might utter here tonight would be wholly inadequate to convey not only my own personal feeling and my own personal respect in regard to the amount of work these people have done, but also the feeling of my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many can be critical of the people in the £2,000 income bracket.  It is easy to pass glib remarks or comments about our staffs and officials either at local authority level or in the Department, but I certainly appreciate that in this day and age we have with us in our office in Mayo County Council engineers and staff of the highest integrity.  I do not say this lightly as I have had experience of them for 25 years.  I have seen them <Col N="117" /> come and go.  I have heard thrown lightly around words like &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; and &ldquo;bribery&rdquo;, but I am proud to put on the records of this House that I know of no such happenings in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>We have in our county engineer a man of the highest integrity, a man who on many occasions disagrees with us, the elected representatives, at county council level, but we have to bear in mind that he and his staff have many difficulties and many problems, not the least of which is the big mileage of roads, to which I have already referred, and the housing problems and many other problems that confront them.  We should bear in mind&mdash; and I certainly do&mdash;that the people who man these offices and who are our technical advisers, are the sheet anchor of any development plans we may have in hand in relation to roads, sewerage schemes, water schemes and anything else.</P>
    <P>From time to time people from the USA, from England and elsewhere tell us&mdash;but perhaps they are not telling us the truth&mdash;what can be done when you pass money around. Whether we have a Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government in office, it is grand to think that we have dependable people, people in whom we can place our confidence, people who are tried and tested, on our staffs.  I want to go on the records of this House in saying that no man is more proud than I am that we have such people in Mayo from the top down to the most junior official, and in the Department of Local Government as well.  It is very easy to throw out these hints which may be swallowed at the crossroads, but the people who throw out these hints and suggestions and remarks usually find it is unprofitable to do so.  If a thing is true by all means let us say it, but we should be able to stand over it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to pass on to another matter to which I think we should pay more attention.  If we have no other responsibility, we have an administrative responsibility to put up road signs.  The county council staffs put up road signs to indicate where <Col N="118" /> there are beauty spots and so forth. We are somewhat lacking in this regard in County Mayo and I feel this very much because in the course of my work, I travelled around quite a lot, and although we may think we are familiar with a particular area, there are certain abbeys and old monasteries and public buildings we would like to visit on our journeys, and perhaps show to our wives and children or to people who cannot always get around on their own, and the signposting of these historic places is of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>It was my privilege in my time to travel through a number of European countries from the south to the north as far as Finland.  That was ten or 11 years ago.  In many cases I did not know the language but when I saw the signposts, I inquired what they indicated. Perhaps before I left the place I parted with a few pounds or a few dollars but because of the signposts I went to see what it was like.  In this country we have many old and historic places which should be better signposted. There is urgent need in County Mayo for signposting.</P>
    <P>Courthouses were mentioned by Deputy P. O'Donnell and other Deputies.  I suppose Deputy O'Donnell is familiar with the problems of courthouses by reason of his law practice. My only association with them is to read in the local papers, perhaps, that some district justice or someone else &ldquo;kicked up a shine&rdquo; because of lack of heating, or the poor condition of the building generally.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that when litigants in rural areas cycle or motor in to the courthouse when a case is being heard before a district justice or a High Court judge, they should find that the courthouse has been brought up to presentday standards.  In that regard much remains to be done.  I know some of them which would need, to use a slang term, a &ldquo;once-over&rdquo; to improve the heating and seating.  Perhaps a little paint would also improve them.  Because this was referred to already, I think I have said enough on the subject.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> On the question of derating, I know many people who have benefited in some cases by £1 or £2, in some cases by £15 or £20, and in other cases by greater amounts, as a result of the derating of agricultural land.  I live in a rural area and what I have said now, generally speaking, would be stating the position truthfully and honestly as I know it.  Some people have gained £1 or £2 and others have gained £15 or £20.  In the time that lies ahead we in Mayo County Council will be facing, probably in the month of March, a rates estimate in which we must examine the overall position in relation to the different services administered by the county council.  We are definitely facing an increase of something in the region of 7/- to 10/- in the £ in rates. That is a serious burden on people who have a big problem in trying to keep going, provide the necessaries of life and educate their children.</P>
    <P>A section of the community for whom I have great sympathy comprises those who live in small towns and villages, towns of 500 or fewer up to those with 1,000 or 5,000 or more. These people have not gained as a result of derating but they are certainly worthy of sympathy and support here. Perhaps five or 15 years ago the bread-winner was engaged in a small business in Charlestown, Swinford, Foxford or some such town.  He may have died and the business may have suffered in consequence.  He may have been in the confectionery line or something similar; he may have been a tradesman, a joiner, or something like that.  I know small towns, as I have canvassed them like others engaged in politics, and you find those poor people suffering in silence, doing their best.  The widow may even provide for her children the food she would need herself for her own health.  These people deserve our consideration.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is a big task for any Minister or Department to go into all these matters and separate the wheat from the chaff.  No matter how well-intentioned a Minister or Department may be, in view of all the difficulties, it would take time to assess the real extent of the problem.  In many <Col N="120" /> rural towns in the West, you have a situation in which, due to rural depopulation perhaps because of reasons I have mentioned or the fact that the breadwinner has died, large families have to face the cold winter days, try to provide fuel, light and food and other necessaries and also meet a rates demand which is a heavy burden.</P>
    <P>I do not think the present Minister would like to evict any people from their homes or throw them out on a side street: that is not in his breed. Although compliments have not been paid to him, I am sure that if money were available to him, he would like to consider that section of the community. Recently, it seems to me, the country's economy has improved sufficiently to enable us to give consideration in some way to these people as regards relieving their rates burden. Coming from a family of smallholders myself, I appreciate that in a rural area there is some means of keeping a fire going on a winter's day&mdash;perhaps an old ash tree that can be cut down or something to keep a fire on the hearth &mdash;but in a side street in a town like Ballina, or Swinford or even Dublin for that matter, it may be a difficult matter.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remember those sections of the people in the matter of derating as he has remembered the smallholders.  There are many widows and children involved; they are the less privileged classes to whom we should try to bring relief and try to assess the situation as far as they are concerned.  The rates burden in my county and, I am sure, in many others, is a particularly serious burden for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary of Dublin and Deputy Healy from Cork spoke of the bad position of housing in both cities and it is my duty to speak of my own city of Kilkenny. The present housing position generally is due to the neglect of the present Government over the past ten years. The present Minister has only been a year and a half in office but he was a member of the Government and must take his share of responsibility for the present housing positions and <Col N="121" /> his Government's policy in not building houses throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Practically no houses were built in the country in those years, as far as I can gather, although we had the former Minister saying that more money was allocated to housing than ever.  Only a nominal amount of housing was provided but the loan charges, of course, had to be met each year.  The result is that young married people today, in a city like Kilkenny, are forced to pay anything up to £6 per week for a furnished flat.  That, if anything will do so, should bring home to the Minister the present position regarding housing.  It was recently brought to my notice that two well qualified tradesmen left Kilkenny because they could not get a house. One went to England where he got a house and a job.  The other went to Bord na Móna because Bord na Móna provided him with a house.  Both were in an engineering company and these two men are a great loss to industry in the city.</P>
      <P>I have been on local authorities for many years and in all that time these authorities have been completely frustrated in their efforts to get sanction for house building.  Only in the past two years have the local authorities been allowed to rehouse families with full subsidy out of corporation houses. You had two, three or four families living in one corporation or local authority house and one can imagine the tension that must exist in such circumstances. They had no hope; we could not rehouse them unless we got the full subsidy.  Therefore, we could not build houses and people lived in very bad conditions in condemned houses.  The first effort of any Government should be directed towards providing houses because decent houses are essential for the good health of the community.  Housing has improved a bit over the past 12 months.  An effort is being made and the Government are giving sanction to housing schemes in a fairly large way.  But not enough is being done and much greater effort should be put into housing because money spent on housing is money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those willing to provide their own <Col N="122" /> homes should be encouraged as much as possible, yet the grants for this purpose have not been increased for a long number of years despite the fact that housing costs have risen tremendously over the same period.  At present and for very many years, the grant is £300 from the Department and £300 from the local authority, a total of £600.  The Minister said that the Government and local authorities were contributing 12s 4d of every £ spent on local authority housing, that is 60 per cent.  Taking the cost of the average house you can build, the present total grant of £600 to those providing their own homes represents only about 20 per cent.  I think there is a case for an increase here.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government in recent times have been getting the turnover tax on a lot of materials going into house building, and more recently still the wholesale tax.  Some Deputies said there was a grant of £450 from the Government and a further grant of £450 from local authorities.  How many are eligible for that grant?  Very few. How could any small farmer put up the balance of the money?  The only hope he has is to get a cottage built by the local council and pay it in the weekly rent.  The reconstruction grant is £140 from the Government and £140 from the local authority.  This is small in view of the fact that any major reconstruction work today costs anything from £600 to £1,000.  I suggest that these two grants should be increased by at least £200.</P>
    <P>For the past few years, it has been Government policy to build houses in rural areas.  We in Kilkenny County Council have been pressing to have cottages built in rural areas because we feel that to keep people on the land, we must provide housing for them there.  Apparently the policy of the Government is to build houses for these people in the towns.  I had a specific case of that recently.  I was pressing to have a house built for a man who was providing his own site in a rural area. The regional water scheme passes his door.  He was told they were prepared to provide him with a house in the town three or four miles away and he was asked to make a case why they <Col N="123" /> should provide it for him in the rural area.  He said that he and all before him had been reared there and his children wanted to live there.</P>
    <P>Despite that, I saw a letter from an official of the local authority saying that they were not prepared to accede to his request to take over the site and build a cottage for him but that they were prepared to give him a house in a nearby town.  Is it Government policy to drive people off the land? Ministers may say that every other country has this problem of a flight from the land.  That may be so, but is it not being accelerated by the action of the Government in not providing rural cottages and forcing people into towns where they do not want to live?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce should have been very slow to sanction the recent increase in housing loan charges.  People have to pay up to seven or eight per cent to the building societies for money.</P>
    <P>Last year my county council provided £15,000 for cottage repairs and also arranged for a loan of £10,000, making a total of £25,000 in one year, a tremendous amount.  People may say we were not doing our duty up to this, but we were and doing it very fully. The reason for the heavy expenditure in one year was that in that year a very large number of cottages were being vested and had to be put into an excellent state of repair before this could be done.  The result was that £15,000 did not cover the cost and we wanted to raise a loan for £10,000. We asked the Minister for sanction to that loan but he refused to give it.  In November or December, the £15,000 was exhausted and we were refused sanction for the loan.</P>
    <P>This would have been a short term loan covering only five years.  With the loan, the cost on the rates would be about 1½d in the £ but the cost of raising the money directly and paying it out of the rates is 5½d.  Therefore, the Minister's action in refusing to sanction the loan is directly increasing the rates in my county by 4d.  That is very wrong.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="124" /> to change the general policy in that regard.  The present repairs are more a capital cost than an ordinary cost. They are a capital cost because, as I said, the cottages must be put into an excellent state of repair prior to vesting.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to change his policy in regard to the building of rural cottages.  If a farm labourer has a site and wants to have a cottage built on it, he should have that cottage built, provided it is in a reasonable position near a main road. I would ask the Minister to reconsider that.  If he does not, he is going to clear the whole countryside of houses. Is the position that the Government do not want to have these cottages obstructing the view for the tourists, that they would rather this than have our own people living in these cottages where they always lived?</P>
    <P>I come now to roads.  Main and county road grants in Kilkenny were cut by 20 per cent this year.  The previous year we got £200,000.  This year we got only £150,000.  With the increase of 25 per cent in road tax, members of the council felt that there would be an increase in the grants, but instead we had this cut of 20 per cent.  That has resulted in unemployment in the county.  For many years past county surveyors have been anxious to maintain a permanent staff in the county council, because those retiring would only be entitled to a pension or gratuity if they had 200 full working days per year.  Naturally, the surveyors were anxious to cut down on casual employment and have permanent employment.  But with the reduction in the road grants this year, I have noticed that any man retiring from the council at present is not being replaced, the idea being that through retirement, they hope to reduce the demand on the amount received in grants and rates.  The machinery is not being fully utilised.  It is not economic. In the main there are men with shovels labouring on the roads so that they may be kept in employment up to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The county road grant has been <Col N="125" /> considerably reduced.  That means that improvements cannot be carried out.  Roads which were completed within the past two or three years have to be retarred.  The result is that there will be scarcely five miles of roads done in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in Kilkenny in that the county council were sufficiently enterprising to demand a greatly increased rate for county roads with the result that 80 per cent of the roads are dust free.  There should be a maintenance grant for county roads just as for arterial roads so that the county roads would be properly maintained. We had a five year scheme for the completion of all the roads but the grants were considerably reduced and it was not possible to complete the scheme.  Kilkenny county council raised a loan of £30,000 for the repair of culs-de-sac and laneways.  This was of considerable advantage where two or more farmers resided in a cul-de-sac. Last year and again this year the Minister has refused sanction for the raising of this £30,000.  This work also had the advantage that it provided employment.  As was mentioned at Question Time today. the unemployment figure is the highest for many years.  Not only did the Minister refuse to sanction the raising of the £30,000, but he also refused to receive a deputation from the council.</P>
    <P>The county council are keen to improve the county and to provide housing accommodation.  If that is not done, people will emigrate.  In this respect the county council are not getting any assistance from the Government.  I am sure the Minister will receive a further application in regard to the raising of £30,000 so that the work to which I have referred may be continued.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have grants announced in reasonable time. At the estimates meeting nobody can tell what the grant for the following year is likely to be.  It is a matter of guesswork.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvement Scheme has been handed over to the local council by the Office of Public Works.  Kilkenny <Col N="126" /> is receiving the large sum of £3,500 under that scheme.  As one member said, it could be spent on a parish.</P>
    <P>Regional water schemes involve too much delay in surveying and development. In some cases they may take ten to 15 years.  The result is that many people who would be delighted to avail of a regional water scheme have sunk pumps for their private water supply and the regional water scheme is, therefore, less remunerative than it otherwise would be.</P>
    <P>I attended the opening of a very fine group scheme recently in Kilkenny. I know of one case where a person applied for a grant for connection with a group scheme.  He had installed a water tank of 7,000 gallon capacity and therefore his application for a grant for connection with the group scheme was rejected.  That is a deplorable position.  The person to whom I refer has a young family. Some years ago he installed a toilet and bathroom in his house and a rain-water supply to the kitchen and was glad to be able to do it and that was the only thing possible for him at that time.  The position appears to be that a person who has a tank with a capacity of over 3,000 gallons will not get a grant for connection to a group scheme.  In my view, an enterprising person such as I have described should be the first to get a grant when a group scheme comes into operation.</P>
    <P>There should not be undue delay in the payment of grants.  There may be a scarcity of money and in that case people should be told that they cannot get grants for some months rather than be told that the file is with the inspector.  I know of one case where a person whose house has been completed for two years has not yet got the grant for that house.  That is most unfair.  I would appeal to the Minister to pay the grants so that applicants would not have to appeal constantly to TDs to make representation on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to introduce a crash programme of housing so that persons living in overcrowded conditions would get suitable <Col N="127" /> accommodation in the foreseeable future&mdash;I suppose that is about the best one can say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual statement made by the Government and in particular by the Minister in regard to the question of money for housing is that there is more money available this year than there was last year.  I do not think that is a very fair or honest statement.  In the year 1965 the cost of a five-roomed house fully serviced in my constituency was £3,300.  The cost without central heating was £2,850.  That is a type of house that must be built to the Department of Local Government's specifications in order to qualify for a grant.  The increase in the cost of such a house over the period of three years is in the region of £350.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government cannot close their eyes to the causes of that increase in cost.  The first cause was the turnover tax.  Then in the following year there was the wholesale tax.  Now we have some Ministers&mdash;I must say in fairness to the Minister for Local Government that I did not hear him make this statement&mdash;telling us that the devaluation of the pound will not have any effect on building.  On 1st January this year, the price of timber went up by five per cent.  At the moment there is an application with the Department of Industry and Commerce for a further increase of 20 per cent.  Very often when people think of timber going into a house, they think of timber in a room, but one must include ceiling joints, wooden floors, windows, doors and every other place where a piece of timber is used in the erection of a house.  It will be rather interesting to see how high the price will go.  Copper and instanter fittings have increased already by 22 per cent; hard woods have increased by 25 per cent; galvanised gutters have increased by 20 per cent.  The unfortunate people who cannot afford either to build a house or to reconstruct their own house but have to take advantage of section 5 of the Housing Act will find that the price of galvanised iron&mdash;again the application is with the Department&mdash;is expected to <Col N="128" /> increase by £7 to £8 per ton, equivalent to 2d per foot.  For some weeks past there has been no galvanised iron whatsoever available to the trade for the reason that they are waiting to get the O.K. from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I do not think the stock answer, that there is more money available this year than was available last year, will suffice any more.  There would want to be a great deal more money available next year than last, either that or housing will completely stop.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on this House and particularly on the Government Party to examine the way they have been treating the private people who are trying to build their own houses.  I admit that a farmer with a valuation of under £25 will get a grant of £450 from the Department of Local Government. He will also get a grant of £450 from the local authority if his valuation is under £25 or if he is a person that the local authority is entitled to house. That is the maximum grant that can be got.  It is still only £900, and these unfortunate people are asked to find another £2,000 if they want to build a new house.  I have not a clue where they would get it.  The Minister would be quite safe in offering them twice that much.  They will not take it because they cannot afford it.  They have no capital and cannot get it.  Even if they could get it they could not afford to pay the interest charges.  The demand on that fund will be very limited, and the demand on it has been very limited.</P>
    <P>As regards people with a valuation of over £25 or people whom the local authority is not entitled to house, the maximum grant they can get is £300 from the Department of Local Government and £300 from the local authority. Let us examine the grants that are paid for the reconstruction of a house.  For the reconstruction of a five-roomed house the maximum grant is £140.  If the estimate is £420 the maximum grant again is £140 from the local authority so that the cost of reconstructing the house is only £300.  The applicant himself will have to contribute £100, the Department of Local Government will contribute £140, and <Col N="129" /> the county council £60.  He must contribute one-third of the total cost himself, and I can see the point in that. However, this is the point I cannot see: if the estimate is £700, the applicant still gets £140 from the Department of Local Government and only £140 from the county council; he himself has to find £420.  If it works fairly well the first way, it certainly must work in the very same way in the second case.  It is unfair to ask one man to pay more than the other, the man living in a five-roomed house that has probably deteriorated much more than that of the other man who is living in a five-roomed house.  There could be many reasons for the deterioration, for instance, family circumstances.  If he lets the house go that far it is quite obvious that he has less capital than the person who has got a higher percentage grant than he has.  The Minister should look into that.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make reference to the delay in the payment of grants. Any time you go into the Department of Local Government to ask about a case, the stock answer is that the file is out with the inspector.  It is the same as when we are told by the Minister here and outside the House that there is more money available for housing this year than was available last year. I think the delay is due to carelessness on the part of the officials in the Department of Local Government.  Last week I was in the Department of Local Government with no less than 86 cases from a very confined area.  I believe it is carelessness more than a lack of money, but if it is money, let the Minister or the Department tell the applicant the position.  Whatever the reason is, the Minister should investigate the position and see what is wrong.</P>
    <P>As regards road grants, there has been, over the whole country, a reduction in the region of £750,000 in road grants last year.  In that particular year the people who had cars were asked to pay 25 per cent increase in tax and were asked to make a further contribution by way of petrol tax; and at the same time road grants were reduced. In County Roscommon road grants were reduced by £47,470; in County Leitrim they were reduced by £25,690.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> Being a member of a local authority for a number of years, I may say that we usually have trouble at this time of the year in that, in framing the estimates, we have no word from the Department of Local Government as to what the allocations of road grants will be.  I think our estimates meeting is fixed for 10th or 12th February.  I would ask the Minister to make sure that local authorities are notified in time for the estimates meeting with regard to the amount of money which will be available for grants in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Another detrimental effect as a result of the reduction in road grants in these two counties is the fact that a large number of small farmers can no longer supplement their incomes by working on the roads for the county council.  That kind of work is dwindling every year, dwindling because of the introduction of machinery, because of the use of gravel instead of stone and because of the reduction in the amount allocated.  I would appeal to the Minister to put the grant this year back to where it was last year.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a short reference to the handing over of rural improvements schemes to county councils.  It seems to me now that minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and rural improvements schemes will be amalgamated and, instead of a ten per cent in the £ contribution in the case of a valuation under £5, it will now be 2½ per cent. We are told that the amount of money allocated is assessed over the past three years and one-third of that will be allocated this year.  A county in which £60,000 was spent over the last three years will get one-third, or £20,000. I do not know how reasonable that allocation is, but there is one thing I do know: for the past three years, one could not get an application form out of the Special Employment Schemes Office for minor relief schemes.  It was impossible to get any allocation for bog development or rural improvements schemes.  I am quite certain that the number of applications received by the Special Employment Schemes Office will eat up more than the amount of money available this year <Col N="131" /> and that means the local authority will not be able to accept any further applications.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to use the local authority occasionally, but, if we are now to be used as a face saver for the Department of Finance, the situation is getting pretty desperate.  People living in Dublin do not realise the hardships endured by those living in rural Ireland.  Perhaps there are two or three families living up a boreen, a lane, a by-road&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;who have to plough their way down these water-logged and pot-holed means of access to and from their homes.  Ten years ago there may have been ten families living up these boreens; the number is now reduced to two or three.  Very often these people have to carry a pair of shoes so that they can change out of their Wellingtons and go into town or to church decently clad.  That is the situation.  When these people reach the main road, they see the results of the lavish expenditure on these roads, but there seems to be no money to improve the roads leading to these people's homes.</P>
    <P>With regard to rates, the Minister made some reference to shifting the burden of taxation from local authorities to the Exchequer.  That, at least, was the interpretation I took.  I am not too clear what he meant.  But there is one matter upon which I am very clear.  I heard the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil in Carrick-on-Shannon in the last general election telling the people&mdash;I shall never forget his words &mdash;that the present rating system was outmoded and outdated.  He may have gone into retirement since but I am entitled to ask the Government, in the name of the people he addressed that night, what they have done about this outmoded and outdated system.  Every year since those people have had to pay increasing rates, some years an increase of 6/- in the £, some years perhaps an increase of 4/- in the £, and this year they will have to pay an increase of at least 8/- in the £. There is an onus on the Minister for Local Government to tell us now <Col N="132" /> what change he intends to make in this outmoded and outdated system.</P>
    <P>To show how outmoded and outdated the system is, take two adjacent houses on which the valuation is £5 and the rates are £3 in the £.  One of those houses may be occupied by an old age pensioner living on a miserable 47s 6d per week; if she is the owner of the house that is all she will get. The other house may be occupied by a husband, his wife and two or three children, who may be working.  That family will pay the same rates as the old age pensioner.  Certainly that system is, to use the then Taoiseach's words, both outmoded and outdated.  It is a long way from the just society.</P>
    <P>Most of the businesses in the towns of Leitrim and Roscommon are family businesses.  These people are being squeezed out by the supermarkets and others.  They have also lost a great deal of business because of emigration.  Yet they are asked to pay ever-increasing rates, year in and year out.  Unless the Minister shifts some of the burden from local authorities it will be quite impossible for these people to meet the demand which will be made on them.</P>
    <P>I want to make a short reference to regional water schemes.  These were first mooted in 1959.  The Minister for Local Government at the time got in touch with every county council and told them to speed up their piped water schemes, to send them up as quickly as possible to the Department; it was only a matter of getting sanction.  The net result was every county council employed consultants and planners. There were lengthy discussions and big headlines in the local papers.  I do not think that was accidental.  It all happened prior to the 1961 general election and, since then, one has to ask oneself what has become of these schemes.  In my own county, we have one scheme known as the Cloone-Mohill scheme with the Department for the past 2½ years and nothing has been done about it.  We have another scheme, the Carrick-on-Shannon &mdash; Jamestown scheme, with the Department for 12 to 18 months and there has been no word of its being sanctioned.</P>
    <P>When the people read the headlines in the local press and saw the statements <Col N="133" /> from the then Minister for Local Government, they felt that it was just a matter of waiting for a few weeks before they got a piped water supply. Every county manager in the country seemed to have received instructions from the Custom House not to put up a pump anywhere, that the people would have rural water in no time at all.  That was 1959 and 1960 and it is now 1968, and we still have no rural water supplies.  If that is the way the Department of Local Government is going to run matters, the sooner they tell the truth to the people the better.</P>

Tar éis dul i gcomhairle le hAire na Gaeltachta, agus leis na húdáráis áitiúla, tá socraithe agam go n-ullmhófar pleananna forbartha ar leith do na limistéirí Gaeltachta.

    <P>When one considers how closely the various activities of the Department of Local Government affect the everyday lives of the whole community, both as regards essential services and amenities, it is not surprising that the debate on the Estimate should be a fairly long one.  I think it was unnecessarily prolonged on this occasion because so many Deputies insist on ignoring the fact that we have local authorities in this country and that it is through the local authorities that these services are administered in individual areas.  The result was that a lot of time was taken up here in discussing matters which are really the concern of individual <Col N="136" /> local authorities and which can only be dealt with at local level.</P>
    <P>As I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily, I do not propose to deal with individual matters which are the concern of individual local authorities and which, in most instances, were raised by Deputies who are themselves members of the local authorities concerned and who know that it is only at that level that these matters can be dealt with effectively.  I would merely point out to these Deputies that if they and their colleagues would use local authorities for the proper purpose instead of for political play-acting, there would be much less dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Department of Local Government is so much concerned with our living environment, it is inevitable that it will always be possible to look for improvements. This Estimate we are supposed to have been discussing shows that the provision of these improvements is an expensive business.  Nobody speaking on the Estimate referred to the amount of money this provides for, or referred to the relationship of that total of money to the total amount of revenue or, indeed, to the relationship of the total amount of money that was raised by way of revenue by the State and the local authorities to the total national income.  I have become accustomed now, between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Local Government, to hearing Opposition Deputies speaking on these Estimates magnanimously offering to vote as much more money as is necessary in order to remedy, forthwith, all the deficiencies in the various services administered by these two Departments that still remain.  I have pointed out before, and I have no doubt that I will have to point out again, that such offers, to vote as much more money as is necessary, at this time of the year, are absolutely meaningless. There is no point whatever in offering to vote more money for any of these services because money cannot be effectively voted unless arrangements are made to collect it and the only source from which the Government can collect it is from the pockets of</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> An offer, then, to vote more money the people.</P>
    <P>is realistic only in the context of the budget when it can be put forward as a serious, genuine and complete offer and when it can conclude an amendment to the budget proposals in order to raise the necessary extra money.  My experience has been that at that time of the year there is never a suggestion that any tax should be increased or that any new tax should be imposed.  I have never heard it yet, but we on this side of the House generally accept the position that the Government have gone as far as is fair and as far as is feasible in the matter of the redistribution of income.  Opposition Deputies, however, invariably contend that we have gone much too far and they represent the taxpayer as being over-burdened and demand tax reductions. Whatever may be said, therefore, of the Estimate debates for any of these Departments which are involved mainly with the expending of the money collected through the medium of the budget proposals, it is a fact that at the really important time the Opposition demand is for a cut-back on all these services since the demand is for the imposition of less taxation.</P>
    <P>The services under the auspices of the Department of Local Government, of course, involve, as I said in my opening statement, total revenue expenditure to the tune of £107.71 million. There is general agreement that there is little scope for any increase in that. All the services which are provided, whether under the Department of Local Government, Health, Education, or Social Welfare, can only be realistically considered in the light of the problem of financing them and demands for improvements which do not take account of the capacity of the community to provide the money are not worth serious consideration.  The fact is, whether Opposition Deputies like it or not, that only a limited proportion of the national income can safely be taken through local or central taxation for purposes which are not directly productive, however desirable these purposes may be, if economic advance is not to be inhibited, or if individual hardship is not to be caused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> Of course, the ultimate solution of all our social problems depends on economic advance.  I believe that the Government should aim every year to go as close as possible to collecting this critical percentage of the national income and to allocate it as equitably as possible among the various purely social services and among the services provided by my Department which are in the main both productive and social in character.</P>
    <P>I am entirely satisfied that this in fact is what happens under the present Government.  Similarly the amount of money that can be acquired by the Government in any year for its capital programme is also limited and is regulated by the state of the economy at the time.  Here again I am satisfied that the amount raised for this purpose every year under the present Government has been decided in accordance with an estimate of the maximum amount that it will be possible to obtain from the community. The requirements of my Department, such as roads, houses, water, sewerage, swimming pools, community centres, parks, and other amenities, are all urgent and they are so urgent that demands for more rapid progress are understandable.  I doubt if there was ever a Minister for Local Government who was completely satisfied with the amount of money he got for the conduct of all these services under his Department in any year.  Certainly, I have not been satisfied yet and I do not expect to be, but I am satisfied that a fair allocation of the total amount of the money it is possible to get from the community has been made in every year under the present Government.  This year, for instance, out of the total State capital expenditure of £109 million, £29 million, or more than one-quarter of the total, has been allocated to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>When the speeches of Opposition Deputies are analysed, it will be seen that they amount to a claim for the full amount that it has been possible to raise for capital purposes, if indeed not for more.  I need hardly say that just as the Opposition Deputies apparently would like me to have <Col N="139" /> more than £29 million for capital purposes this year I would like to have it also but when we take into account the fact that there is also capital expenditure for other Departments, such as Health and Education, I think it is clear that a very high percentage of the total amount it is possible to come by is, in fact, allocated to social purposes or to purposes such as my Department's purposes which are, as I said, both social and productive.</P>
    <P>If all the money which it was possible to raise for capital purposes were to be allocated in any one year to purposes that are not directly productive I say it would be foolish in the extreme to do this, because to do it would starve economic undertakings of the capital necessary for further development which is essential if our social problems are to be solved.  We have quite clearly been allocating the maximum feasible amount of our resources to various services coming within the sphere of my Department. In none of these areas, I fully and freely admit, have we reached the end of the road, but considerable progress has been made and the overall position is improving year by year.</P>
    <P>More important still is the fact that the approach in each case is planned so that this progress will be continuous. To give one example, great care is being taken to ensure that there will never be a repetition of the disastrous neglect of the acquisition of land and the preparation of plans for housing by the Coalition Government from 1954 to 1957 which, added to the decimation of the building industry, which followed on the collapse at that time, made it impossible to get local authority housing going at a reasonable rate for from three to four years.</P>
    <P>Listening to Opposition speakers, one would never realise that this was a Department spending each year a greater amount of total national income for the benefit of the community as a whole.  It was, as I said, spending this year more than one quarter of the total State capital expenditure for this purpose. In fact, the Department of Local Government is one of the principal <Col N="140" /> Departments which constitute the shop window through which the Government demonstrate their realisation of their fundamental duty not merely to ensure economic expansion but also to ensure that the resulting increased prosperity is used to improve all-round living standards.  The activities of the Department of Local Government, therefore, are one of the principal reasons why this Government have been successful in Waterford, South Kerry, Cork and West Limerick by-elections.</P>

      <P>They are not sincere. They make unrealistic promises they are not able to honour.  I was pleased and flattered to see from my perusal of the report of the speeches made on this Estimate in the Official Report&mdash;I was not here for them all&mdash;how keenly members of the Opposition have followed the procedings of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as reported in the papers and, in particular, <Col N="142" /> at the close attention they paid to the Taoiseach's address.  I was flattered that they were impressed.  I can assure the Opposition that they are on the right lines in being guided by the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as to the matters which are important.  All the Opposition Deputies in this House will benefit if they keep up this interest in the future.  In fact, I am one of the honorary secretaries of the Fianna Fáil Party and I think I can say that if the Opposition have this same interest in the future, if they would like to hire a neighbouring hall to the Mansion House, we would be quite pleased to relay the proceedings of our Ard-Fheis, or at least the Taoiseach's speech, for their edification and benefit.  They will then get an object lesson of the vigour, democracy and genuine concern for the wellbeing of the people as a whole which keeps us over here and them where they are. Although Opposition Deputies had only Press reports to guide them, they made no mistake in picking out housing as the most important matter that was discussed at the Ard-Fheis and as the most important item in the Taoiseach's presidential address.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made it quite clear that we regard the provision of houses for our people, whether they can pay for them or not, as an item of first priority in regard to the utilisation of the fruits of the economic growth now taking place.  The Taoiseach put the problem clearly, demonstrated its magnitude&mdash;which is something Opposition Deputies do not do&mdash;and out-lined how it is being tackled, and how it will be tackled in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement introducing this Estimate, I presented the facts to the House more than once, so there is no excuse for Deputies not knowing exactly what the position is.  We had complaints during the debates on this Estimate from the Opposition with regard to the fact that because of the peculiar arrangements that have to be made to facilitate the front bench Members of the Opposition, whose attendance is of such a sporadic nature that my introductory speech came in three instalments, but the speeches that were <Col N="143" /> made on the Estimate show, I think, that even though the Opposition got this statement in easy stages they still did not have sufficient interest to read it and if they had got the whole lot together, I suppose they would have taken even less trouble in regard to it.</P>
    <P>As regards this most important aspect of the Department, housing, I dealt, on the Taoiseach's Estimate, with some of the more glaring mis-apprehensions under which the Opposition labour, or pretend to be labouring.  At the same time I know that in concluding this debate I shall be expected to go into this most important aspect of the Department's activities in some greater detail.  In 1964 the Government issued a White Paper on housing which stated the problem confronting the country at the time.  In the financial year 1964-65. the total number of houses completed was 9,679.  In the White Paper the Government set a target of 12,000 to 14,000 new dwellings per year by 1970. This target was based on an assessment of the existing need for houses and the need to keep the building industry on a rising gradient of output, and on the growth in the economy which it was reasonable to expect and which, although the Opposition do not realise it because their approach is too casual and superficial to consider such things is an absolute essential if we are to get to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>In 1964 it was clear that we had got over the collapse of the building industry that took place in 1957.  Local authorities throughout the country were by that time responding to Government urgings to expand the provision of houses, acquisition of sites and so on.  The building capacity of the industry was again expanding following its drastic reduction in the economic collapse of 1956-57 and this figure of 9,679 completions in 1964-65 compared with 5.976 in 1961-62 which was the year in which the cumulative effect of the three Coalition years during which there was no activity in regard to the long process that is necessary in order to start a building scheme, was felt; the three years during which the only housing activity was the automatic <Col N="144" /> progress of the plans for the schemes that were arranged by Fianna Fáil from 1951 to 1954, accompanied by the erosion of the capital-providing capacity of the country; the three years during which there were no arrangements made to have any continuity in the supply of land, plans and money which were so improvidently used up.</P>
    <P>This recovery which, as I said, was already apparent in 1964 because it had been a sustained recovery since 1961-62, has continued since then with just one slight and temporary deviation last year when we were affected by the world-wide shortage of capital. The figures for completions are: in 1961-62, 5,976 houses completed; in 1962-63, 7,217; 1963-64, 7,831; in 1964-65, 9,679; in 1965-66, 11,255; and in 1966-67, there was a slight falling-off to 10,984.  But this year there will be a satisfactory return to the upward trend of at least 11,700 houses.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have been trying to represent the year 1965-66 as a year of economic crisis.  We freely admit that it was a year of economic difficulty such as every country experiences occasionally but the effect of these economic difficulties on housing output is, I think, a very appropriate yardstick to measure whether or not there was a crisis.  The drop in output in 1967, if it is compared with 1965-66 when this crisis was supposed to have developed was a mere 2.4 per cent.  There was a drop in production of houses to that extent following the year of this acute crisis about which we are told.  This compares with a drop of 44.5 per cent in 1957-58 and a further drop of 33.5 per cent in 1958-59 following the Coalition crisis of 1956-57.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In our case we took care of the difficulties, dealt with them when they arose and it was possible for the upward trend to be resumed immediately so that the so-called Fianna Fáil crisis of 1955-56 produced a drop of 2.4 per cent followed by an immediate increase whereas in 1956-57 we had a drop of 44.5 per cent followed by a further drop of 33.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>If what happened in 1965-66 was a crisis then I think a word has not yet been invented to describe what happened in 1956-57.  Perhaps we could say that a drop of 2.4 per cent followed by an immediate return to the upward trend is a Fianna Fáil size crisis and a drop of 44.5 per cent followed by a further drop of 33.5 per cent is a Coalition size crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this record of sustained and continuous progress and with the upward turn of the country's economy this year and with the Fianna Fáil commitment so forcibly expressed by the Taoiseach that it impressed even the Opposition, it is obvious, when we have already reached the stage of 11,700 completions this year, that we are going to reach the target set in 1964 of completions at the rate of 12,000 to 14,000 by 1970.  It is, in fact, reasonable to think in terms of the higher of these two figures.  There can be no clearer proof, I think, of the Government's absolute dedication to the solution of this problem than the fact that while overall national output between 1961 and 1966 rose at an average annual rate of 3.3 per cent, the production of houses rose at an annual average rate <Col N="146" /> of 17 per cent.  If further proof is needed, I would again direct attention to the fact that this year's State capital investment in housing at £25 million is almost a quarter of the total State capital expenditure of £109 million. This is, of course, as Deputy Reynolds mentioned, by far the highest figure of capital for house building ever provided by the Government.  Last year's figure of £21.15 million was also a record.</P>
    <P>This is not by any means the total capital expenditure on housing.  The amount provided by building societies and assurance companies has increased from £7.2 million in 1962 to £12 million in 1967.  The total from these three sources&mdash;the State, building societies and assurance companies&mdash; has gone from £18.34 million in 1962/63 to £37 million in 1967/68. When account is taken of capital from other sources, such as banks and personal savings, the total capital expenditure is well over £40 million in this year.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, I agree, to continue to increase this amount.  It is necessary to try to divert expenditure from less urgent building activities to the urgent sphere of low-cost housing.  But it is quite clear, it is indisputable, from these figures that the country as a whole is making a major effort to grapple with the situation.  As I said, it should be possible and it is eminently desirable that the efforts made be even further stepped up according as improvements in the economy make it possible.  But it is nonsense to suggest our State capital resources can be commandeered and devoted to this one great social problem.  It is nonsense to suggest, even if this were done, that success could be achieved even in this one field and even at the expense of everything else.  It is no solution for any problem to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  On the contrary, it must be nurtured.  That is why we succeeded in getting continuous progress in these things, because we realise that.  The Opposition either do not or are unable to look after the economy.  But to starve economic undertakings of the capital necessary for development&mdash; and that is the only suggestion I heard <Col N="147" /> from the Opposition&mdash;is the surest way of turning the present progress being made in all aspects of social welfare into reverse.</P>
    <P>The only way to ensure the continuation and to make possible the acceleration of the progress is to increase the earnings of the community. It is because this was not appreciated by the Coalition Government that we have so much leeway to make up.  The leeway is being made up with increasing rapidity.  The only danger is that the Opposition Parties might ever again get an opportunity to mishandle the country's finances as they did in the past.  But, luckily for the country, it becomes clearer that with every opportunity the people get of expressing their opinion this danger becomes more and more remote.  One of the results of the success with which the housing drive was kept at a high level during our recent economic difficulties and of the indications given by the people at byelections that the country is to remain in responsible hands is that there is a new feeling of confidence in the building industry and in local authorities. Land is being acquired and developed for sites, plans are being made and the economic growth now taking place is a guarantee that an increasingly high level of house building can and will be attained.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of talk about the position in Dublin.  The population of Dublin has been increasing.  According to the census of 1956 it was 539,476.  In 1961, after the Coalition emigration, it was down to 537,448. In 1966 it was 568,772.  Naturally, it is there that the housing problem is most acute.  I may say that the increase in population between 1961 and 1966 was greater than in any period since at least as far back as 1900. This reflects increasing prosperity in the country, and indeed there was also an overall increase in population in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I suppose then, since the housing problem is eminently most acute in Dublin, it was natural that the Opposition speakers would concentrate on Dublin.  The problem in the capital city is of formidable proportions and <Col N="148" /> it should not be necessary to exaggerate it as was done.  In order that the subject may be dealt with in a reasonable way, I think the first thing to do is to state the problem with regard to corporation housing as it exists, according to the factual, statutory assessment of housing needs carried out by Dublin Corporation under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966. We will then be able to compare the actual need with the present programme of the corporation and the future prospects instead of dealing with figures which Opposition spokesmen have apparently invented to suit themselves.</P>
    <P>According to this statutory assessment of housing needs there is a total accumulated need in Dublin for 8,518 local authority dwellings.  This includes all types of housing needs, such as unfit or overcrowded dwellings and families living involuntarily with other households.  There are 4,752 families on the approved waiting list.  That is the situation.  With regard to the programmes on hands, including the Ballymun scheme of 3,021 dwellings, 1,403 of which have been handed over, at 31st December, 1967, the corporation had 2,982 dwellings in progress.  This included 1,122 houses and 1,680 flats.  These 2,982 dwellings included 1,618 in the Ballymun project, while a total of 1,524 dwellings had been completed within the period 1st April, 1967, to 31st December, 1967.  That 1,524 included 1,059 dwellings handed over at Ballymun.  In addition to the houses which were in progress, tenders for 1,129, including 358 tenant purchase houses were approved since the 1st April, 1967.  In the same period approval was given to acceptance of tenders for 222 flats and proposals for schemes in various stages of planning for a further 2,833 dwellings including 1,210 houses and 288 flats in the Kilbarrack area.</P>
    <P>In addition, the corporation were in process of acquiring sites for a further 1,370 dwellings to accommodate persons on their approved waiting list.  So that there are then 2,982 dwellings in progress and 376 at tender stage, making a total of 3,358, while in planning <Col N="149" /> there are, as I have said, 2,833.  So that, between dwellings in progress, at tender stage and in planning, the total is 6,191, which is considerably more than the present approved waiting list and these should certainly all be completed within the next two or three years.  In addition to that, the corporation, as I said, are acquiring sites or have acquired sites, for 1,370 more dwellings.  This is a total of 7,647.</P>
    <P>The average number of vacancies occurring in Dublin Corporation housing estates is about 550 per annum and when this is taken into account it is quite clear that the present accumulated need of 8,518 dwellings should be accommodated in the next three or four years but, of course, more dwellings will constantly be needed as time goes on.  It is, therefore, essential that the process of land acquisition and the preparation of plans should continue at full speed and I am glad to say that the corporation is making very good progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>While, then, the problem in Dublin is, as I said, still a major one, it is quite clear that it is within sight of being reduced to manageable proportions. With the increasing number of houses becoming obsolescent, with higher living standards and with more marriages taking place and the natural increase in population I do not expect that despite our best efforts any of us will reach the stage where there is no longer a need for quite a considerable amount of local authority house building and also for private building in the Dublin area.  Indeed, from the employment point of view this is just as well since if housing needs were fully and finally met and house building stopped there would be an enormous slump, as was evidenced by the dramatic slump and disastrous disruption of the building programme that occurred in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that if house building were to stop more men would be thrown out of work than if the four biggest employers in industry closed down.  Obviously, then, house building is an important factor in the country's economy and as such it is essential to keep it going at a high level of output, <Col N="150" /> even apart from the urgency of the provision of houses.  There need be no fear that even the satisfying of the present housing needs in Dublin will cause a slump in house building.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prospects for house completions by Dublin Corporation in this financial year, the corporation published a report dated 6th June, 1967, in which they stated that they expected to complete a total of 1,635 dwellings in this financial year and allowing for vacancies in existing corporation dwellings they expect in 1967-68 to rehouse 2,185 families. This is a high figure and it will increase over the next year or two.  To keep the number of families housed per annum at this high level after the Ballymun scheme comes to an end will obviously require a major effort by Dublin Corporation and for that reason I am glad to see so much progress being made in regard to the acquisition of sites.  It is not sufficient to have a considerable number of dwellings in progress, as I said before. It is equally important to have more houses at planning stage and to have a supply of developed land available so that building activity can be maintained at a consistently high level. Excessive bursts of housing activity followed by slumps are bad both for the industry and for the solution of the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Throughout this whole debate there was an effort by Opposition speakers to disclaim any responsibility by local authorities for housing progress in their area.  Deputy Larkin who for years was Chairman of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee until he abandoned his post this year was the outstanding example of this because he should have known better.  Nobody knows better than Deputy Larkin that the initiative in regard to housing proposals must be taken at local authority level and, indeed, it was largely because of the difficulty of getting Dublin Corporation to take this initiative following on the collapse of their house building programme under the former Government that the provision of houses in the Dublin area lagged so much behind during the earlier years of the present Government. <Col N="151" /> Deputy Larkin would have us believe that the members of the local authority are mere ciphers, but nobody knows better than he that the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation have the power either to promote or frustrate the housing policy of the Government.  Nobody knows better than he the obstruction that can take place and how important resolutions dealing with housing matters can often have to wait for months while resolutions which are mere political playacting take up the time of the city council.  One wonders, indeed, why exactly Deputy Larkin refused to continue as Chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>So many misstatements have been made as to how the housing situation developed in Dublin that although I dealt with the matter on the Taoiseach's Estimate before the Recess, when the same misstatements were made, I think I should deal with it again.  I want to establish that according to the housing authority&mdash;Dublin Corporation&mdash;in 1956-57, when the house building industry collapsed and when the Government's programme was disrupted due to the impossibility of getting money to meet commitments already entered into or to undertake new commitments, the need for housing was greater then than it is now.</P>
      <P>In November, 1956, the Dublin Corporation over the name of Mr. T.C. O'Mahony, Deputy City Manager-Housing Director, issued a printed document entitled &ldquo;Corporation of Dublin Housing Review&rdquo;.  From this document I give the following quotation:</P>
      <P>It will be noted that the provisional figures thrown up by the survey indicate a requirement of 14,114.</P>

      <P>It will be noted that the provisional figures thrown up by the survey indicate a requirement of 14,114.</P>
      <P>Later on on the same page, page 7, the document goes on to say that it is understood that the provisional requirement figure of 14,114 referred to above does not contain any provision for an improvement in overcrowding standards.  In effect, this would mean that families living in rooms, including single rooms, are not to be regarded as in need of rehousing except in the case of (a) where two or more persons of 12 years or over and of opposite sexes who are not living together as man and wife have to live in the same room and (b) where the free air space in any room is less than 400 cubic feet, the height of the room being taken as eight feet.</P>
      <P>I understand that 2,611 families of three persons and over were found to be living in single rooms and that 1,225 families of five persons or over are living in two rooms were excluded from these provisional figures.  If you add that figure of 2,611 to the figure of 1,225 you get a total of 3,836, and if you add that to the requirement of 14,114, you find that total housing requirements at that date, November 1956 amounted to 17,950.</P>

      <P>In the year 1956-57, the result of the plans and acquisition of land initiated in the period 1951 to 1954 reached a high peak and, despite the fact that the economy collapsed towards the end of the year and building came almost to a halt, there were 1,564 dwellings completed by Dublin Corporation in that year.  Of course, a lot of these were completed and occupied before November, 1956, but even if we ignore this, and treat the full 1,564 as reducing the need for houses as stated by the Housing Director, we are still left with 16,386 families in need of housing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and other Opposition Deputies would have us believe that by the time they left office, this deficiency of 16,386 had been converted into a surplus of 1,500 without the building of a single additional house. In other words, we have to account for a total of 17,886 families in need of accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke on 7th December, 1967 and here is what he had to say about that surplus of 1,500, at column 1770, volume 231, of the Official Report of 7th December, 1967:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1957 Fianna Fáil took office after three years of inter-Party Government. <Col N="156" /> The then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That shows Deputy Dillon's knowledge of affairs.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, addressed the House in July of that year on the Adjournment Debate. He said that Dublin Corporation told them they had too many houses in 1957.  I am quoting Deputy Seán Lemass.  I am not making any claim on behalf of the Government of which I was a member.</P>
    <P>We all know Deputy Dillon is too modest to do that.  I asked Deputy Dillon to give me the reference.  He was not able to do it but, as Deputy Fitzpatrick may remember, he promised to send it to me.  He sent me something all right eventually.  Remember what he said: The then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, in 1957. I pointed out to him later that Deputy Seán Lemass was not Taoiseach in 1957 and he then mended his hand and said he was Minister for Industry and Commerce; he was wrong in that, too.  When he came to look it up this is what he produced: he wrote to me on 11th December.  It took him four days to discover something remotely resembling what he had purported to give as a quotation.  Eventually, after four days of research, Deputy Dillon unearthed this: he says the reference of the statement is to be found in volume 194, No. 11 of 11th April, 1962.  This is the quotation which he alleged was made by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;he did not know which&mdash;in 1957.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a stage two or three years ago when Dublin Corporation had 1,500 empty dwellings available for people who needed them ...&rdquo; But there is no full stop.  It continues: &ldquo;... but, with the very rapid return of population from England to Dublin and the substantial reduction in emigration, that picture has now changed completely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, there is no full stop. Deputy Lemass, who was Taoiseach and not Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1962, went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> ... were available for people who needed them but, with the very rapid return of population from England to Dublin and the substantial reduction in emigration, that picture has now changed completely and Dublin Corporation is already finding itself in arrears with its housing programme, almost as much in arrears as they ever were.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing a great deal of talk lately about the need of the Opposition Parties for research facilities. I think Deputy Dillon would find himself using these research facilities quite a lot if he makes demands like this upon them.  I asked him to find a reference by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Adjournment Debate in 1957 and the research officer has apparently to start in 1957 and search for something remotely resembling what Deputy Dillon confidently gives as a quotation here; that research officer searches through the Official Reports until 1962 before he finds something that fits in and, even then, Deputy Dillon has to mutilate and disguise it in order to make it appear that he had been speaking factually.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Dillon that he does not have to remind me of the unprecedented rate of emigration that marked the collapse of the Coalition Government.  In his contribution to the debate he also, as Deputy Fitzpatrick will, no doubt, remember, exhorted all and sundry to learn the lessons of the past.  Far be it from me to minimise this huge volume of emigration, since I appreciate that, by doing so, I would be helping the people to forget the lesson they learned from the performance of the past Coalition Government.  As Deputy Dillon knows, I thoroughly agree with him that the importance of the past is the lessons learned.  But I must ask him was emigration, in fact, so high at that time that from Dublin city alone over and above the 1,564 families that were housed another 17,886 families eligible for and seeking corporation houses disappeared?  And not just heads of families, but whole families.  This figure would not include the large numbers who were purchasing their own homes and who could <Col N="158" /> not meet the repayments and had to get out.  It would not include single men.  Neither would it include cases in which only heads of families went since, in such cases, the families were left to avail of the opportunity of all these vacant corporation houses.  Deputy Dillon may find it hard to believe, because I am sure he has a vivid memory of the despair that covered the country at that time, that there were such cases, but, even in the despair which was so widespread at that time, there were people who retained some hope that a general election would restore the damaged economy and so not all of them completely abandoned the sinking ship and, in those cases, the application for a house still stood, since they took the risk, in the confidence that Fianna Fáil would get back at the first opportunity, of leaving their families behind them.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, despite the high rate of emigration, the housing situation in Dublin was never solved and any Deputy who had any contact whatever with the people of Dublin at that time knows that at all times, even when there were large numbers of vacant corporation houses in every housing estate in Dublin, there were large numbers of families still in urgent need of accommodation, numbered in thousands rather than in hundreds.</P>
    <P>The situation of large numbers of corporation houses remaining vacant over a considerable time developed in this way during that period: when a vacancy was offered to the first on the waiting list, there would be no response because the applicant had gone.  The practice inevitably was to wait a reasonable time for a reply before assuming, for one reason or another, that the offer of accommodation was not being accepted.  Then the vacancy would be offered to the next on the list, and so on.  Very often it would be only on the fourth or fifth, or perhaps sixth offer, that an applicant would be found for the house as the family had not emigrated. The result was that the process of reletting vacant corporation houses &mdash;I fully agree with Deputy Dillon there were plenty of them&mdash;was a slow <Col N="159" /> process.  Often, by the time an applicant on the waiting list was found, the house would be so damaged by vandalism that it would be necessary to repair it before it could be let.  And, all through that time, public representatives were inundated with requests from families living in insanitary and overcrowed conditions.</P>
    <P>I agree that Dublin Corporation inexplicably misinterpreted this situation and the unjustified attitude of complacency in that body was an additional difficulty in getting the housing drive going again.  First of all, the supply of land acquired under the urging of the previous Fianna Fáil Government had run out.  The number of houses at planning stage was severely limited.  The capacity of the building industry to achieve a high level of output had been greatly diminished.  The result of all this was, as I have said, that it took three to four years to get increased housing activity under way in Dublin.  But as I have shown, progress is now being made.  Despite the collapse of the economy which caused the complete disruption of housing activity by local authorities in 1957, and despite the increased population in Dublin since then, Dublin Corporation's assessment is now that the problem is of smaller proportions than in November, 1956; and, as I have shown earlier, provided the corporation's present plans are vigorously pursued, the situation will be considerably eased within a few years.  Outside Dublin city two places in which the housing deficiency is most acute are Cork and Limerick cities.</P>

      <P>I am not attempting to convince Deputy Fitzpatrick.  That would be a ridiculous occupation on my part: I would not attempt it.  I am not interested in doing that.  I am just putting these facts on record, and they are there already.  I do not need to put them on record again.  In both of these cases, Cork and Limerick, the local authorities have made a projection of the probable housing need up to 1971.  In both these cities the National Building Agency has arranged for the construction of large housing schemes, 1,800 dwellings in Cork and 600 in Limerick.  These two schemes are intended to be in addition to the housing authorities' building programme.  Building operations in both places will start shortly and when these two schemes are completed, and provided the corporations of Limerick and Cork can meet their own building targets, the projected housing need will be fully met within the time covered by the projection.  In regard to other areas in the country, the position is that it has been possible to allow schemes to go ahead according as they were technically agreed, and all local <Col N="161" /> authorities are in a position to tackle the shortage of houses in their area.  I hope they will tackle it vigorously.</P>
      <P>I do not want to create the impression that there is no problem with regard to financing the housing programme, either in regard to capital or current expenditure.  Although, as the figures show, the expansion of the economy under the present Government has made it possible to provide continually increasing annual capital expenditure for housing, our resources are not unlimited.

      <P>As I say, we can feel confident of meeting the target of annual completions set for 1970 and of sustaining a high level of housing activity thereafter.  We are almost up to the figure of 12,000 already.  We shall have at least 11,700 completions this year, and the target we set ourselves for 1970 was an annual output of between <Col N="162" /> 12,000 and 14,000.  That programme we have set ourselves is both ambitious and realistic.  It takes account of the urgent housing need that exists and the duty of the rest of the community, or as some people who really want to mislead put it, the Government's duty, to ensure that people will not be left without houses because of their inability to provide them for themselves.  It also takes account of the resources of the economy, and this is essential if progress is to be made, whatever may be said by street corner agitators who have no real interest in the problem but whose only interest is in creating a disturbance. Admittedly, there is in the Government's approach the presumption that some responsibility rests with the individual to endeavour to help himself if he can.  That is wrong, we are told by people who, having themselves opted out of playing any part in the solution of this problem, pontificate on it at street corners and university tea parties and castigate those people who have dedicated themselves to the work of building houses as distinct from talking about them.</P>
      <P>There is, we are told, an inherent right to marry, beget children and have a home.  There is no question of making any effort to provide a home.  Far from it.  Indeed, the making of such an effort, we are told, would be an occasion of sin.  I have not had the inestimable advantage of a Jesuit education, but I remember the Irish Christian Brothers telling me that it was my duty to try to avoid these things myself.  Apparently if I had been lucky enough to be educated at Clongowes Wood, I would have got the much less onerous advice that it was the Government's duty to avoid them for me.  The old idea of the responsibility of marriage is apparently replaced by this inherent right to marry, beget children and have a home, and the responsibility is on other individuals to have houses on tap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people whom my colleague, Deputy Dunne, described as modern heroes have, when they decided to marry, first of all, set about the difficult task of accumulating the deposit on a house, and I share Deputy Dunne's admiration for them.  I am <Col N="163" /> not prepared to agree that the finger of scorn should be pointed at them for, as alleged, subjecting themselves to a period of temptation.  The Government and the local authorities have been and are making every effort to have adequate housing available but, despite great efforts, we are, I am afraid, still some distance from the stage where it would be feasible for individuals who marry to make as little provision for the future as the lilies of the field.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not want to create the impression that there is no problem in regard to finance.  The annual cost of financing local authority housing is met in three ways, by rent, by subsidy from the State and by subsidy from the rates; in other words, it is met partly by the tenant, partly by the taxpayer and partly by the ratepayer.  I often wonder do Opposition Deputies ever pause to take an overall look at their approach to this matter and, if so, do they not see how ridiculous this approach is.  On this Estimate they have complained about the burden of rates and the burden of rents.  At the same time they demanded increased housing activity and at the appropriate time they will complain again about the burden of taxation and, at that time again, they will demand increased housing activity because this is the popular thing to do.</P>
    <P>Now, the capital for the building of houses is obtained by loan from the community and the arrangement with the lenders is that the money will be repaid on a given date and that interest will be paid in the meantime.  If the Opposition Deputies know of some source from which the money to honour this commitment can be obtained, other than the sources I have mentioned, I wish they would let us know, but I do not think they do. Certainly they did not find the money from any other source when they were over here.  The fact is that they treat this important matter of the provision of houses in the same cynical and irresponsible way as they deal with most other matters.  Their concern is solely to say the popular thing on every <Col N="164" /> detail and their contempt for the intelligence of the people is so complete that the incongruous result of taking their attitudes to different aspects of the problem as a whole does not appear to them to be important.</P>
    <P>They know that to the rent-paying tenant low rents are more attractive than high rents and so they demand low rents.  They know that increasing rates are a cause of great resentment and so they demand reduced rates. They know that no one likes to pay increased taxes and so they complain that the country is overburdened by taxation.  They know that the people as a whole want the housing situation solved and so, having demanded all these reductions in the collection of money from every possible source, they also scream for the provision of more houses.  Although they have demanded all the popular things and although we tell the people that housing and other social services can only be financed through the collection of portion of their earnings in one way or another, and that we intend to finance them on an ever-increasing scale in this way, we win the bye-elections and the general elections and the people who have demanded everything popular lose them.</P>
    <P>The reason is that contrary to the ingrained belief of the Opposition Parties, the people are not fools and the people have done what Deputy Dillon said they should do, they have learned the lesson of the past.  They know that we tell them the truth, that everything cannot be done at once, and they know that the Opposition approach is cynical and irresponsible. They know from experience it is only under Fianna Fáil that social progress is made whether in local government matters, social welfare, in health or in education, and that the result of listening to Opposition promises of everything for everybody at no cost to anybody has been disaster in the past and will be disaster if it ever happens again in the future.</P>
    <P>The annual cost of providing a typical four-roomed local authority house costing £2,400 is £200.  The total subsidy payable by the State has grown from £0.6 million annually in <Col N="165" /> 1948-49 to an estimated £3.5 million in the current financial year while the contribution from the rates has grown from £1.05 million in 1948-49 to an estimated £3 million in the current financial year.  In other words, the amount of contribution by the State &mdash;and I always like to emphasise that the contribution by the State is the contribution by the taxpayer&mdash;has been increasing at a much faster rate than the contribution from the rates.  This Government recognise that a considerable portion of the cost of local authority housing will have to be met by central and local taxation and we do not try to fool the people by talking about contributions from the Exchequer as if the Exchequer meant anything else but the pockets of the people.  Neither have we attempted to conceal the fact that it is only fair to everybody that a reasonable part of the cost should be contributed by rents.  If all these elements are to be reduced, as the Opposition promise, then the output of houses must drop. The frustrating thing for the Opposition is that the people know this and will not believe them when they try to convince them otherwise.  They know that when the Opposition say the Government will not give more money for this or that purpose, the fact is that the Government have not deemed it feasible to extract more from their pockets for these purposes.</P>
    <P>Our objective in the matter of housing is, as I said, to reach a stage where a house will be provided for every family, irrespective of whether or not they can pay for it.  If this objective is to be achieved, it is essential that there should be a reasonable system of rents which will be fair to everybody concerned, both the tenants of the houses provided and the rest of the community who have to contribute in one form or another the difference in cost between the actual cost of providing the house and the amount contributed by way of rents.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that my colleague in County Dublin, Deputy Dunne, has described as modern heroes the young people with modest incomes who pinch and scrape to <Col N="166" /> accumulate deposits which, I agree, in most cases are of a frightening size and who then undertake the substantial outgoings which will reduce their standard of living for the greater part of their lives in order to acquire homes for themselves and their families.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Dunne. It requires exceptional qualities in present circumstances to set about the task of accumulating anything from £400 to £800 and to face the prospect of repaying a loan at current interest rates and, in addition, rates on valuations up to £20 or more and possibly ground rent as well.  Where I part company with Deputy Dunne is when he and his colleagues consider it a crime to expect people, with at least as good and often much higher incomes but who for one reason or another did not make the same exceptional effort to save, to pay a reasonable rent for a local authority house.  When differential rents schemes in which the maximum rent is related to the cost of providing the houses are attacked as unjust, this is the same thing as demanding that those who are making the commendable effort of purchasing their own homes should be asked to contribute still more by way of rates and taxes to the cost of providing houses for people whose income is at least as high as their own and in many cases higher.</P>
    <P>We have had great play made about the maximum rent payable under the latest differential rents scheme adopted by Dublin Corporation.  I want to point out that this scheme applies only to houses first let after 28th February, 1966 and to new tenancies after that date in dwellings which had been first let after 1st January, 1954.  Of course no one thinks of mentioning that this maximum rent would not be payable by a family with two children unless the income exceeded £27 10s Od per week.  Deputy Dunne knows that many people with much smaller incomes than this are at present paying much more for houses which they are purchasing with the aid of Government and local authority grants and house purchase loans, after having endured the hardship of saving the money for the deposit.  Deputy Larkin was one <Col N="167" /> of those who complained most bitterly about the Dublin differential rents scheme.  I hope he will not think me unkind if I remind him that this scheme applies only to houses let after 28th February, 1966, because I rejected the proposal from the corporation to have it applied to all, which he as Chairman of the Housing Committee concurred in.</P>
    <P>Differential rent is a social service of a very commendable kind.  It is also an essential factor in our policy of providing a home for every family, irrespective of capacity to pay for it. Those who campaign against the system do a grave disservice to the community, and particularly to the less well off sections of the community.  I can remember during the recession at the end of the last period of the Coalition Government, people on fixed rents who suddenly found themselves out of employment and who could have got substantial rent reductions by asking to be put on the differential rents scheme were terrorised by unscrupulous agitators who were conducting a campaign against the adjustment of rents to capacity to pay, and who succeeded in convincing these less sophisticated tenants that the differential rents system which would have made life easier for them was something to be avoided like the plague. Differential rent is a practical form of enlightened social welfare.  Fixed rents schemes which are so highly regarded by the Opposition are reactionary, unfair and unchristian.</P>
    <P>Without differential rent, really poor people could not be adequately housed. Just as a means test is an essential feature of the just distribution of social assistance, so differential rents are an absolute essential if housing subsidies which are provided by the rest of the community are to be equitably used.  When Labour and Fine Gael Deputies attack differential rent, they are, in fact, asking that out of the limited amount which it is possible for the rest of the community to provide for this purpose higher income families should get the same assistance as lower income families.  This is a proposition which I reject completely.  It may be <Col N="168" /> that those requiring the maximum amount of assistance because of their needs are a minority, but I do not agree with Labour and Fine Gael Deputies that that is any reason why they should not get more assistance towards the cost of providing them with housing than families who are better off and better able to pay reasonable rents.</P>
    <P>Differential rent is in fact a form of social insurance since, by providing that outgoings in the form of rent will fall when the income is reduced, it helps towards the maintenance of a reasonable standard of living in such circumstances.  In view of the limited capacity, as I said, of the rest of the community to subsidise housing, either through rates or taxation, it is obvious that if there are to be nominal rents for poorer people, then the rents must be higher for those who are better able to pay.  The State subsidy for new local authority houses is equivalent to a maximum capital grant of £1,100 and the subsidy from rates is equivalent to a capital grant of from £400 to £600.  As I pointed out also, the loss on local authorities which is met by the Government and the local authorities is at present £6.5 million per annum and is still going.</P>
    <P>Obviously then, arguments against requiring those who are able to pay, to pay reasonable rents are equivalent to arguments against the provision of houses for those without them and who are not able to provide them for themselves.  Apart from all this, under the 1966 Housing Act, tenants of local authority houses may purchase their houses on very favourable terms. Nobody, therefore, who has to pay maximum differential rent in present circumstances has any legitimate cause for complaint, since he can opt to purchase his house as other people in similar and, indeed, in worse financial circumstances are doing, but in his case he can do so without going through the period of hardship which is necessary in order to accumulate a substantial deposit.</P>
    <P>This question of rents is another example of how Opposition Deputies try to have it both ways.  Deputy Treacy is a very good example of this.  Indeed, it is very hard to know <Col N="169" /> exactly what Deputy Treacy supports or does not support.  In the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government in 1966-67, as reported at column 353, volume 224 of the Official Report of 29th September, 1966, Deputy Treacy said:</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of differential rents.  This is a principle for which the Labour Party, in the main, have been responsible.  It was a principle first devised by the late Jim Larkin who, in order to rid this city of the slums and squalor, propounded the theory that there should be a differential rent system which would ensure that anyone who was in need of rehousing would be capable of taking a house and of paying the rent, that he would not be deprived of a house by reason of inability to pay the rent. This is a good Christian principle to which to adhere.</P>
    <P>I agree, but I do not think Deputy Treacy agrees because on 29th September, 1966, he said that and since then he has been reported on 7th October, 1967, in the <i>Clonmel Nationalist</i> as saying:</P>
    <P>The Labour representatives have consistently opposed the whole idea of a graded rents scheme on the grounds that it is unfair, inequitable and unjust.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Labour Party, in particular, have shown themselves in this debate to be antagonistic to the idea of differential rents or rents related to capacity to pay, I think I would be doing them a service if I pointed out that the Party to which they nominally belong published a booklet in June, 1967, which indicated acceptance of the principle that rents should be related to what people could afford to pay.  I do not know who prepared this policy but one thing is obvious to anyone reading the debates on this Estimate, that is, that the Labour TDs had no hand, act or part in it.  I realise that this document is only in existence since June, 1967 which is not a very long time and that during that time the Labour Party have been busy digesting something else that they have only just found out.  Somebody has told them that they are now a socialist Party; they became socialist overnight. I suppose it would be too much to expect them, in addition to accustoming themselves to that newly acquired knowledge, also to digest the fact that they are committed in their published document to accept differential rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still the document is in existence for seven months and I think it would be no harm if whoever did prepare the policy would some time explain it to the Labour TDs so that they would <Col N="172" /> not display such complete ignorance of their official published policy.</P>

      <P>Another example of the inconsistent and insincere approach of the Opposition parties to the whole question of local authority housing is their attitude to the purchase terms for local authority houses under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1956, which are briefly that for tenancies of 20 years or more, these houses may be sold for 55 per cent of market or replacement value in rural areas and for 70 per cent of this value in urban areas.  The same Deputies who pretend to want an increased rate of provision <Col N="173" /> of new houses claim it is exorbitant for local authorities to obtain 55 per cent of what it will cost to replace the houses they sell.  Surely they know that if houses are to be given away for less than this the result will be to gravely diminish the capacity to finance new houses?  In other words, this is, in effect, yet another attack on the provision of houses for those without them.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that no Opposition Deputy forgot to demand a faster rate of new housing, the fact is that on every aspect of the problem, their suggestions, if adopted, would inevitably result in the provision of less new houses.  It is easy to demand more houses but anyone of normal intelligence will see that the problem is largely a financial one.  He will also see that to accompany a demand for more houses with opposition to every measure designed to assist the financing of the housing programme is a cynical and dishonest pretence.  It is quite clear from this debate that the only possible effect of the Opposition approach to this important matter is to obstruct the housing drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rural local authority houses, 69,500 or 78 per cent of the total of 89,720 cottages had been vested already at the 31st March, 1967, and in the case of a further ten per cent applications for vesting were made before that date.  I have not got the exact figures, but I am sure many more applications were received before 30th September, 1967, so that comparatively few will fall to be dealt with under the Housing Act, 1966.  With regard to rural houses under the Labourers Act, 1936, the county council must make a purchase scheme for every cottage provided by them before 1st January, 1966, while for cottages provided after that date the council may make a purchase scheme. Obviously then the vast majority of <Col N="174" /> tenants of rural cottages have already had ample opportunity to apply to have their cottages vested.  The terms of sale, of which I have indicated I will approve, for the purpose of these schemes under the Housing Act of 1966 are a discount from market or replacement value of three per cent for every year after the first five which the tenant has been in occupation of a local authority house subject to a maximum discount of 45 per cent.  I an satisfied that no reasonable person could consider these terms less than generous.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 98,033 urban houses, the position is different.  Up to 31st March, 1967, 7,100 of these had been sold or vested in accordance with circulars which were issued in 1953 and 1956, and a total of 6,300 had been disposed of under other provisions.  The 1953 circular notified local authorities that the Minister for Local Government would be prepared to approve of schemes for the sale of their houses to tenants for the higher of (1) the outstanding balance on the loan from which the erection of the houses was financed, or (2) the annual rent exclusive of rates multiplied by the appropriate minimum number of years which was calculated in this way: For houses provided prior to 31st March, 1922, the number of years was ten, for houses provided between 1st April, 1922, and 31st March, 1931, the number of years was 15, for houses provided in the period 1st April, 1931, to 31st March, 1946, the number of years was 20 and for houses provided after 31st March, 1946, the number of years was 30.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1st February, 1968.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NOTES.</P>
    <P>(1)  A breakdown of the net receipt of Income Tax under each Schedule is not available.  For the years up to and including 1962-63 figures showing the net produce of Income Tax under each Schedule have been given.  Net produce of tax is the estimated ultimate yield from the <Col N="51" /><Col N="52" /> tax assessed in the year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.  Net produce figures are not available for 1963-64 and subsequent years in consequence of the introduction of the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; in 1963-64 following on recommendations in the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  However, it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt of Schedule E tax since it consists almost wholly of tax collected under P.A.Y.E. and under Rule 5 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E.  The approximate net receipt of Schedule E Income Tax has been given for the years 1963-64 to 1966-67.  The balance of the net receipt for those years is regarded as referable to Schedules, A, B, C, and D.</P>
    <P>(2)  Excludes an amount estimated at £4,150,000 in respect of the abatement provided for by Section 14 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, in respect of emoluments coming within P.A.Y.E.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to bodies other than Health Authorities.  To the extent to which such bodies are unable to meet their outgoings from their ordinary income they receive support in the form of grants from my Department, and borrowing, except by way of temporary bank overdraft, does not arise.</P>

      <P>The amounts of grant to be paid in respect of the year 1968-69 have not yet been determined for all health authorities and I am not, therefore, in a position to furnish in full the information requested.  I would accordingly suggest that the Deputy repeat the question in about two weeks.</P>
