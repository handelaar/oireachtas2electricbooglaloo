      <NameTxt>Deputy Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. L'Estrange</b> asked the Taoiseach if in view of the growing public disquiet over the failure of Irish competitors to win honours in the recent Olympic Games and the consequent blow to national prestige abroad, the Government propose to establish a commission of inquiry into the present state of amateur sport and organised physical recreation in Ireland for the purpose of setting forth constructive guidelines towards the future, similar to those outlined in Great Britain by a similar commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refute any implication in the Deputies' Question that, because the Irish team did not gain medals in the recent Olympic Games, their participation failed to win them honours.  I think the Deputies are mistaken in thinking that there is any significant public disquiet on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a commission of inquiry or similar body cannot be considered without reference to the existing situation amongst athletic and sporting organisations.  The Government would not undertake an initiative in these matters in the absence of <Col N="2330" /> agreed proposals from the major athletic and sporting organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is aware that men like Bob Tisdall, Pat O'Callaghan, Ronnie Delany and others brought honour and glory to Ireland in the past at the Olympic Games, where the Tricolour blew in the breeze along with the flags of bigger nations?  Surely, the Taoiseach is aware that the amateur bodies associated with the Olympic Games and helping to promote athletics and so on in this country have been crying out for more State aid for the past few years?  Surely, the Taoiseach realises that, when other countries are spending such vast sums, our country should give more help to those amateur bodies in order to try to put Ireland on the map in future and give our athletes at least good training and preparation before they go to the Games?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be very few who would be more interested than I am in the promotion of athletics of all kinds in this country.  I would dearly love to see Irish athletes attain highest standards in as many fields of athletic activity as would be possible. As far as the background is concerned, we have, as I have indicated in reply to previous Parliamentary Questions the other day, initiated a very progressive programme of physical education in the Department of Education which I hope will have its effect in the long run.  The Deputy in his original Question refers to a commission. He seems to ignore the fact that there are certain difficulties obtaining within the sphere of athletics and sporting organisations in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>They are patched up since last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that I played some part in the patching up but there are other differences, as the Deputy knows, between the Gaelic Athletic Association and other sporting organisations and when it comes to the subvention of sport the Deputy will readily appreciate the difficulty involved in the subvention of one and not another.  As I said in my reply, as far as a commission is concerned, if it <Col N="2331" /> could be initiated by agreement with all sporting organisations, certainly, the Government would be glad to help if such a commission is in operation but unless and until that could happen, it would be invidious for the Government to undertake such a task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that in other countries athletes were seconded from their work and prepared for the Olympic Games for as long as a year and in many cases much longer?  Our athletes who went abroad had to work up to a week before they left and could not be allowed off from work.  Could not some arrangement be made, when a team is picked five or six months before the Games, that through Government help they could be allowed off in order to get proper training before going abroad to participate in these very important Games in which they could bring honour and renown to the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the kind of amateurism that would appeal to the great majority of the Irish people.  The Irish people indulge in athletics and sport for fun, and participation is more important to most of them than the winning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Prestige is important, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Prestige is important, I admit, but we did not suffer any loss of prestige by not winning gold medals in the Olympics.  We would gain, perhaps, some prestige if we had. On the other hand, there are many nations with much greater resources who did no better in the recent Olympics than we did.  When it comes to specialisation, the greatest middle distance runner in the world, Ron Clarke, because of the atmospheric conditions, failed to get a medal. Because we have not this ultra specialisation, the failure of some of our athletes need not be attributed to that fact; I think it can be attributed to climatic conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We could do better with more intensive training I agree, but I suggest that the type of amateur status which involves the six months or the one year's leave of absence, as happened in one case where a man won a major event, would not be acceptable to the vast majority of Irish people.</P>

The time of these part-time directors is valuable and if they can avail of rail services they do so but there is no service from Sligo to Bundoran and they would have to take a car there and back.  It has <Col N="2336" /> been my experience that the directors use the railways whenever it is reasonably possible to do so but as the company are operating hotels throughout the country at places including Parknasilla and Kenmare obviously it is impossible always to use the railways.</P>

      <P>In the pilot areas in the western and north-western counties, however, if the farmer concerned is effectively operating a farm plan approved by his area agricultural adviser, and this plan includes land project works, the grant is increased to three-quarters of the estimated cost of the work, subject to the overriding limit of £50 per acre, and, in addition, lime, phosphates and potash up to a maximum value of £8 per acre are supplied free where a soil test shows that the land requires them.</P>
      <P>In County Leitrim, where the work done consisted mainly of intensive field drainage, the average grant per acre paid over the past year was £35.  In County Roscommon, where the work done was less expensive and consisted mainly of the removal of light scrub, stones and unwanted fences and the levelling of ground, the average grant per acre paid over the past year was £21.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind those tenants on the Proby estate who had entered into agreements with the landlord and who are, therefore, outside the scope of the recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission. As I indicated, in reply to a question by the Deputy on 3rd July, 1968, I do not accept that right of renewal should be extended to those tenants.  Such a departure from the Commission's recommendations would, in my opinion, be an undue inter ference with existing contracts and be <Col N="2343" /> open to serious objections in principle. I do not consider that these objections can be significantly affected by any new light which may now be cast on the nature of the previous leases under which these tenants held.  What is important is that the agreements were legally entered into and that any attempt to set them aside in legislation could well raise constitutional difficulties.</P>

The Deputy is well aware that where contracts have been entered into&mdash;where sales, for instance, have taken place&mdash;it would be virtually impossible to put back the hands of the clock.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why a publican may not remain open until 11.30 p.m. during <Col N="2344" /> the winter months when summer time, renamed standard time, now applies all the year round; and if he will make a general statement on this matter, with particular reference to Section 1 (1) (2) of the Standard Time Act, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement that summer time, renamed standard time, now applies all the year round, while it is a convenient and useful way of describing the change, is not accurate as a statement of the law.  Legally, the position under the Standard Time Act, 1968, is that summer time has been abolished, not extended and renamed.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, the closing hour of 11 p.m. is applicable to any period that is not a period of summer time. As there is now no summer time, as such, that provision, taken by itself, would have required public houses to close at 11 p.m. all the year round. This is the reason why section 1 (2) was included in the Standard Time Act&mdash;its object was to ensure that the right to remain open up to 11.30 p.m. during the summer months is preserved, notwithstanding the abolition of summer time.  Section 1 (2) has no application to the winter months which, therefore, are governed by the 11 p.m. closing provision.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied on 30th October, to a question about the 11th round applying to the Army personnel, that a decision would be reached as quickly as possible.  That is a week ago.  Surely, in view of the fact that everyone else in the State including State employees have either been told they would get it or have already received some increase, it is not unreasonable to assume that the <Col N="2353" /> question of the Army personnel would be dealt with now and not at an early date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as stated that the decision has not yet been reached.  On the 30th October I told the Deputy that Army pay is normally adjusted in the light of developments in Civil Service pay.  The decisions on Civil Service pay are not fully completed yet.  If the Deputy wishes I will communicate with him immediately a decision is reached on Army pay and let him know the complete details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more interested in having a decision taken.  I think most of the Civil Service people already know what they are getting.  The increases they were given were announced by the Taoiseach two days ago.  Another Budget has been passed since the 11th round rises were granted to others.  It is not unreasonable to ask that the Army should not be delayed.</P>

      <P>I consider that it would not be in the interests of security to furnish information in regard to the average number of troops stationed in each barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particulars of the cost of upkeep of each barracks in the centres mentioned by the Deputy are not readily available in my Department and I consider that the considerable work involved in ascertaining such particulars would not be warranted.  The total net provision in the Estimate for Defence for the current financial year in respect of materials and contract work for the maintenance of all military barracks, camps and posts is £136,000 approximately. In addition, a provision of <Col N="2357" /> £505,000 approximately is made in respect of civilian tradesmen, labourers, etc., employed by the Corps of Engineers on works of a maintenance character.  There are, however, many other elements of expenditure involved in upkeep costs.</P>

      <P>The number of former members of the Permanent Defence Force whose service pensions are with-held because of their overholding married quarters is 41.</P>
      <P>My Department does not propose to provide quarters for pensioners.</P>
      <P>The provision of houses for exmilitary personnel is a matter for the local authorities concerned who are generally co-operative in this regard. Soldiers who are about to be released from the permanent Defence Force are advised by the military authorities to apply to the local authorities concerned for rehousing.  Following the making of each such application, my Department requests the local authority to give favourable consideration to each individual case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The corvettes were surveyed afloat in 1966.  The surveyor reported that the vessels had been well maintained; the hulls were in good condition structurally, having regard to their ages; all main propulsion machinery and auxiliaries were found to be in good condition and well maintained as were the boilers with one exception, that of LE &ldquo;Maev&rdquo; where some renewals were considered necessary. Following this survey, LE &ldquo;Macha&rdquo; and LE &ldquo;Cliona&rdquo; were overhauled in January and July, 1967, respectively, and any necessary repairs effected.  A similar refit of LE &ldquo;Maev&rdquo; is at present in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) The cost of maintaining a corvette in operational condition varies from vessel to vessel and from year to year.  The major overhauls of LE &ldquo;Macha&rdquo; and LE &ldquo;Cliona&rdquo; completed in 1967 cost about £20,000 each. The chief maintenance costs for these vessels in the year following these refits amounted to £4,412 in the case of LE &ldquo;Macha&rdquo; and £3,731 in the case of LE &ldquo;Cliona&rdquo;.  These figures do not <Col N="2363" /> include running costs or day to day expenditure of a minor nature.</P>
    <P>(c) It is not possible to isolate the cost of maintenance of the Naval installations at Haulbowline.  It may be stated, however, that the annual cost of materials is unlikely to exceed £3,000.  In addition, the cost of civilian tradesmen, labourers, etc., employed by the Corps of Engineers on maintenance work at Haulbowline in the current year is estimated at £13,500.</P>
    <P>(d) The present effective strength of An Slua Mhuirí is 331.</P>
    <P>The approximate annual cost of the main charges directly attributable to the Slua Mhuirí (e.g. pay, gratuities, allowances, grants, clothing, rations) is £13,000.  This figure does not include the cost of such shared services as accommodation, medical treatment, etc., or the cost of personnel of the permanent Defence Force assigned for duty with the Slua Mhuirí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised from time to time with appropriate authorities in Great Britain.  Successes in the Leaving Certificate are accepted in lieu of GCE passes at Ordinary Level but Honours in the Leaving Certificate are generally not accepted in lieu of passes at Advanced level in corresponding subjects of the GCE.  There is a high level of specialisation in what is known as the &ldquo;sixth form&rdquo; in England, and students commonly take the Advanced level GCE in as few as one or two subjects.  I would not be prepared to abandon our broader Leaving Certificate programme in favour of a narrow specialisation.</P>
      <P>The new Leaving Certificate structure which I announced recently contains provision for a further year's course leading to the Advanced Certificate, in which a greater degree of concentration is envisaged.</P>

Teaching under the supervision of the faculty of education of the university is an essential part of the Higher Diploma course. The question of the remuneration of diploma students serving in secondary schools is one for arrangement between the students and the schools, which are privately managed institutions.  It is not a matter in which I can intervene.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent information available in regard to the issues raised by the Deputy is from the Report of the Department's Survey Team on investment in Education.  This Report shows that (a) 62.5 per cent of national schools were equipped with electric current in 1963, (b) 63 per cent of schools had open fires in the same year and (c) 54.1 per cent of schools had no inside toilets in 1963/64.</P>
      <P>Since then although I have not got the exact details, the position has been improved by the following factors:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  closure of 474 small schools on centralisation;</P>
      <P>(2)  the issue of a circular letter to managers giving them permission to install sanitary and heating facilities in certain national schools without further reference to the Department; and</P>
      <P>(3)  the provision of 365 new schools and the carrying out of 639 major schemes of improvement.</P>
      <P>An up-to-date rough estimate taking the foregoing factors into consideration in regard to (a), (b) and (c) above would be 65 per cent, 60 per cent and 50 per cent respectively.</P>

      <P>I had available the statutory returns of the insurance companies which show figures for the total amounts of claims paid and outstanding each year under motor insurance policies.  It is clear from these returns that the cost of claims has increased steeply in recent years; they represented <Col N="2385" /> 80 per cent of the companies' premium income in 1967, as against 57 per cent in 1964.  These figures are, of course, exclusive of outgoings under other headings such as expenses of management.  The figures are set out in the Report on Assurance Companies published annually by my Department. The Report is available for the years up to 1966 and that for 1967 will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>A number of improvements have been sanctioned in recent years at St. Laurence's Hospital which includes the Richmond Hospital. On the 25th September, 1968, the Hospitals Commission submitted a recommended scheme of improvements for the hospital, involving expenditure of about £145,000.  This scheme, together with a number of other improvement proposals submitted by the hospital amounting to some £47,000, is under consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major scheme of this kind would have to be considered in the light of the changes recommended in the report of the consultative council on the general hospital services, which I have accepted in principle.  The retention of St. Laurence's as a general hospital in its present location is not envisaged in the report.  I have requested the principal authorities concerned with the general hospital services on the north side and the south side of the city to consider jointly with their medical staffs the manner in which the council's recommendations can be implemented. I have asked the committees to report back to me early in the new year and I would expect to be in a position in <Col N="2392" /> the light of the north-side committee's report to decide the extent to which it will be necessary to maintain general hospital services in St. Laurence's Hospital for an interim period pending the implementation of the council's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The employment of sufficient district medical officers is a matter in the first instance for the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the figure of 62 dispensary doctors mentioned by <Col N="2395" /> the Deputy relates only to the Dublin city area; the total number of dispensary doctors employed by the Dublin Health Authority in the city and county is 83.</P>
    <P>The Health Authority regularly review the workload of the district medical officers in the light of changes in the numbers covered by medical cards and attendances at dispensaries in each area, and, where necessary, they adjust the allocation of doctors.</P>
    <P>I have not refused any request from the Health Authority for extra posts of district medical officer and I understand that they consider the present level of one doctor for every 1,875 eligible persons in the city area is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that any action on my part is required.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question by Deputy O'Connell on 30th April, 1968, when I explained that under existing legislation, health authorities can and do make arrangements to alleviate financial hardship which may fall on parents in any income group in arranging for proper care for children suffering from cystic fibrosis.  The question of more formal provision for the free treatment of such cases is being considered in connection with legislation to implement the proposals in the White Paper on the Health Services and their further development.</P>

      <P>A county manager may, subject to the approval of the appropriate Minister, delegate any function performable by him to an approved officer of the local authority. In the case of health functions, the officer to whom the delegation is made, and the specific functions delegated, must be approved by me.  My approval is generally accorded subject to the limitation, in the case of the provision of services, that the approved officer may decide to grant, but not to refuse, such services which, of course, include the provision of medicines.</P>
      <P>In the Deputy's constituency, the delegation of decisions in relation to health services, including the issue of drugs and drug cards, is confined to the granting, but not the refusal of services.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the Deputy in answer to his previous questions on this subject, the reason why the County Wexford Health Authority are not in a position to supply dentures to all eligible persons is due to the shortage of dental staff.  Every effort has been made to fill the dental staff vacancies and a dentist has been recommended recently by the Local Appointments Commission for the remaining vacancy in County Wexford and there will be some further improvement in the denture service when he takes up duty in the near future.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  It is not possible at present to indicate when the individual estates mentioned will be allotted but there will be no avoidable delay.  The necessary local enquiries preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>2.  During the last three complete financial years the aggregate area allotted in County Tipperary as a whole was approximately 4,700 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Land Commission activities in County Mayo are heavily concentrated and involve numerous estates and holdings.  Many of the properties are of modest size and include remnants of Congested District Board estates, lands surrendered by migrants and small residues of allotted estates.  The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction of the detailed information requested would entail a disproportionate expenditure of time and labour which would not be warranted. Moreover, as regards lands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution, the position is subject to constant fluctuation depending on progress in intake and allotment&mdash;and the extensive information sought, even if staff were to be diverted specially to extract it, would be out of date within a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, perhaps it would meet the Deputy's requirements to know that at 31st March, 1968, the <Col N="2403" /> Land Commission had on hand in County Mayo an aggregate area of some 4,500 acres of arable land to be used for land settlement in the county. In addition, 33 estates aggregating some 750 acres are at present the subject of inquiry with a view to considering acquisition or purchase&mdash;while proceedings are at various stages for compulsory acquisition of 195 estates containing 6,560 acres and negotiations are in progress for voluntary purchase of 107 properties comprising 3,120 acres.</P>

In the interests of ensuring that the scheme eventually settled would be the best one, it was deemed necessary to incorporate other lands already acquired or in process of acquisition in adjoining townlands.  Composite resale proposals have now been formulated for the Clifford Estate and the other lands aggregating some 360 acres and I am hopeful that these proposals will be approved so as to permit allocation of a substantial part of the total acreage in the coming Spring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Local Government is present because not long ago at Question Time we had questions regarding the training that should be given to our athletes competing in the Olympic Games. Surely we have here the long distance, all-time record-holder in the person of the Minister for Local Government who spoke for between five and six hours trying to gull the unfortunate people of the country and waste the time of the House and the taxpayers' money in the futile exercise of the referendum.  I think the Minister has qualified for a Nobel Prize.  If the Taoiseach introduced such a thing I would be the first to put my hand in my pocket and subscribe generously for a proper decoration for the Minister for Local Government, not only on account of his long distance performance but also for the arrogance and ruthlessness with which he behaved here last week when only the hand of God saved him from a paralytic stroke as a result of the anger and bitterness which exuded from every pore of his body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank God the people of Ireland, and the plain, honest rank and file of Fianna Fáil gave their decision in no uncertain fashion.  I suppose it would be tantamount to a miracle but I hope the Minister will learn the lesson if that is possible and realise that his <Col N="2406" /> arrogance and ruthlessness and the off-handed manner in which he thinks he can treat the people of Ireland have been defeated forever.  Let us not be diverted in any way from the lesson that must be learned along the road we travelled for seven or eight months up to 16th October.  Along the way and right up to the polling booths on the 16th October the Minister&mdash;God help us that Ireland should be inflicted with such a plague&mdash;took upon himself to dictate to the hierarchy and clergy of Ireland and accuse them of wrong-doing, of falsification and misrepresentation as if he were a prophet come among us.  This is the Minister who will descend to sewer level and make personal attacks on any Member of the House but there would be no God in heaven if this did not boomerang as it did when 250,000 people, the majority of them being members of his own Party, said: &ldquo;No, definitely, no.  To hell with you and your take-over bid by the Tacateers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Minister that in the early days of this century a brave and noble Irishman said: &ldquo;They have bought one half of us and they have coerced the other&mdash;the fools, the fools!&rdquo; What has happened in 1968? The buying has gone on.  Who were the purchasers?  Who paid for this take-over? The Minister's gang and his pal, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who is patron, have sold themselves or thought they were selling themselves out.  They tried to sell themselves out, but the honest rank and file of Fianna Fáil, spearheaded from these benches of the Labour Party and the workers throughout the country came out to give the Minister and his colleagues the answer they surely deserved.</P>
    <P>We are proud of that and why should we not be?  We have our chests out and why should we not be trumpeting?  We did not make the mistake the Minister made.  We did not underestimate the intelligence of the ordinary workers. We knew what they were thinking because we mix with them and know all about them and how they live.  I hope the Minister will take this lesson of the 16th October, 1968, to the grave with him and that it will harass him and terrify him and haunt him for the <Col N="2407" /> rest of his life.  That is my prayer for him this morning.  He deserves no more because no man in his position as Minister would descend to sewer level in personal attacks such as he has been making in the past 12 months in this House on anybody who disagrees with his views.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is hard to blame him&mdash;it is dú cha.  It is handed down and I suppose we must make excuses.  Like the wooden leg in the family it is handed down.</P>
    <P>This Budget, which has been composed by the civil servants, is nothing short of a vicious attack on the ordinary worker who came out, organised by the trade unions and different bodies associated with the workers and the trade union movement, and rejected the Government's proposals.  This Budget is the chastisement of such a worker.  The only comfort and relaxation he has after his hard day's work is the pint of stout, together with a cigarette.  What has happened?  This is the whip and the scourge that Fianna Fáil have given to the worker because of his action on 16th October.</P>
    <P>Together with that they have imposed a severe penalty on the unfortunate mother who tries to make the chores of the house as easy as possible, by practically stopping for all time the introduction of a washing machine into the home.  Will any man or woman, father or mother of a family, tell me that a washing machine is not a necessity in any home today?  Restrictions have also been imposed, of course, on the purchasing of radios and televisions; but the unfortunate woman who tries to pay for a washing machine, whether it be on hire purchase terms, through the ESB or in any other way, is now being victimised.  What has the Minister done?  He has put the ability to purchase commodities out of the reach of the working man.  He has not put any impediment in the way of his own gang&mdash;the people who can have, not one motor car, but maybe two or three in every family.  There is no impediment in their way.  They came out and voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  They must be compensated.  They must be thanked in some way, the attitude being that, if <Col N="2408" /> one group must be thanked, another must be victimised.  The worker has been hit hard.  However, I have news for the Minister.  The sooner he goes to the polls the better.  I know he will not go.  I suppose it is hard to blame him.  I will go into the reasons for that when I come to it.</P>
    <P>I defy the Minister to go down the country and talk to the people&mdash;to come out of his nest egg, the Post Office in Ballyfermot, for once in his life.  I have come here to tell the Minister some home truths and I will do it without considering his personal feelings as I would do with other Ministers but not in this case.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the smuggling of pigs and the decline in the bacon industry. I must say that it is a good thing this smuggling is going on.  We closed a bacon factory in Limerick 12 months ago because we did not have a sufficient number of pigs to kill.  Were it not for the smuggling that is going on at present I can assure the Minister and his colleagues in Agriculture&mdash;they are both fettered together like two old goats on the side of a road running blindly before every vehicle that comes along&mdash;that we would have more closure in the bacon industry.  We must, therefore, turn the blind eye to the smugglers and even congratulate them.  It is an unusual thing to condone any breach of the law but in this case we must be factual and truthful.  That is the position with regard to the bacon industry and the smuggling going on from Northern Ireland.  I hope they keep it up and even increase it, thereby doing what the Minister for Agriculture has declined and failed to do&mdash;keep men working in the industry.</P>
    <P>That is another reason why we call for an immediate general election&mdash;to bring those two heroes out into the open fields and let the people give them their answer, as they did on 16th October.  We all know what happened within the Party.  It is common knowledge to anyone who has his ear close to the political ground.  We know what happened when the postmortems and inquests were held.  We all know that certain members of the Party were told to be prepared for the high jump.</P>

I want to bring to the attention of the Minister the difficulties which we are experiencing in Limerick with regard to the unemployment situation and the lack of industrial progress.  Not one new industry has been established in Limerick over the last ten years.  We have made application.  On many occasions we have come on deputations in order to see if something could be done.  To give the late Minister for Education his due, he did come up with a scheme which, of course, was harebrained.  He gave us some encouragement for a while that he would bring a chipboard factory to Limerick that would absorb about 1,500 male workers.</P>

      <P>You need not preach charity to me.  Do not try to play that game with me.  To give the late Minister his due, he did try.  He realised the <Col N="2411" /> situation that existed in Limerick.  He did his best.  It all went up in smoke. Nothing happened.  I want the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay attention to the remarks of the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Limerick which received notice in the national and local press on last Monday night and on Tuesday.  He warned the Government that if something was not done with regard to the provision of industries in Limerick, drastic action would be taken.  There was a challenge from the Chamber of Commerce in Limerick whose views must be respected.  We have already applied for and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared to issue a licence for a smelting plant in the county.  As a body united on a regional basis we have made the case for the Limerick region as the site for this smelting plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of its proximity to the mines in the locality.  I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to our claim for a smelting plant within the region of the estuary of the Shannon.  That would relieve in some way the tragic situation of the unemployed in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>Three or four years ago we went to the Minister for Transport and Power representing that there should be one estuarial authority for the whole Shannon.  That would be a combination of the three smaller ports down the Lower Shannon.  If the Minister had been in any way co-operative he could have done that by a stroke of the pen. No.  He said that we should go back and settle our differences in Limerick with the ports and harbours concerned and return to him with some solution. That matter has been hanging fire for almost four years.  No progress has been made.  Let it be clearly understood that Limerick is the most accessible deepwater port in the whole of the Western Continent of Europe.  The people on the Fianna Fáil benches are not bothering their head about development so far as Limerick is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2412" /> It is about time that the persons responsible take action.  Instead of sticking their heads in the sands, they should face realities.  If they applied themselves to industrial development and the creation of employment, rather than to attacking the trade unions and the clergy, they would be better compensated and better appreciated by the people whom they are supposed to serve.</P>
    <P>Arrogance has taken over.  The cheque-book gang have taken over.  The unfortunate Taoiseach is, as I said last night, like a cork in a high tide, being buffeted and pilloried on all sides.  A split exists in Fianna Fáil.  We all know it.  We know the gangs that are there, both at top level and at local level.  There was an example of it last week in a case of co-option to Limerick Corporation.  They were divided down the centre.  Their own nominee was thrown to the wolves and discarded by some of their own honest members on Limerick City Council. There is the division.  There is the split. We have it in the Cabinet and everybody knows it.  Is this not one of the reasons why the Taoiseach will not go to the country?  I suppose it is hard to blame him.  One does not race a lame horse.  It is only a fool who would do that.  You get your horse ready before you produce him on a racecourse.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Taoiseach is playing a similar game.  He is waiting, hoping that some day there will be unification of the different gangs that exist in Fianna Fáil, that he will gather them around him some fine day and they will go as one regiment before the people. Until that happens he cannot face the people.  That is the reason for accepting the long stall approach.  It would not surprise me if this Taoiseach were to go down in history as one who went the full distance.  I cannot see any chance of the split forces in Fianna Fáil being united.  It would be like trying to make a Protestant out of the Pope or a seagull out of a crow.  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil gang now in office are living on borrowed time, they are in the condemned cell and they know it.  They have been condemned out of hand by the people.  It is about time <Col N="2413" /> the tide turned.  It had to turn.  But we know they will hang on like a drowning man hangs to a straw, thinking that time will erase from the memories of the people the debacle of 16th October; 1968.  While there is blood in our veins we will see that no such thing happens. We will see that honesty comes before fraud.  We will expose them and we will tell the people how public money was wasted on the referendum.  I want to repeat what I said last night that, if right was right, the Minister for Local Government should be put on trial for the illegal conversion of the taxpayers' money for the holding of the referendum.</P>
    <P>While that money was being spent and while all the curbs were being put on the trade unionists, nothing at all has been said about the unfortunate old age pensioner or the widow and her meagre couple of bob a week.  No provision has been made for them because they went out and voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The big industrialist did not come under the whip; he is well fortified and he can carry on and perhaps improve his subscription to the Taca brigade in the coming year, having listened, I am sure, so attentively to the talk given by the Taoiseach recently at a symposium in Cork.  Where are we going?  However, there is one hope on the horizon.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries have trod their primrose path to the everlasting political bonfire, we can look to the people and say that there are still honest people left.  One quarter of a million of them diverted from you and told you where you were going.  I am looking forward to your next Ard Fheis, whenever that may be, to hear the voices of the ordinary rank and file of Fianna Fáil repeat the charges I am making against you. There are men in Fianna Fáil who are prepared to do it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of listening to the debate, but I was engaged in the very complicated task of ensuring that representation in this House will be rigidly related to such relevant democratic considerations as the number of temporary residents in hotels and guesthouses and the number of sailors on board ship in harbour on the night of 17th April, 1966.  As a result of my preoccupation with this essential aspect of democracy I did not hear my colleague, Deputy Dunne's, contribution and his gracious references to myself or his outrageous attack on the freedom of the press in the form of that estimable journal, the <i>Irish Independent.</i> It is really amazing that, with all his experience, Deputy Dunne has not yet come to appreciate the divine pontifical authority that attaches to the journalistic profession at every level but particularly at the editorial level. However, even if I missed my colleague's contribution, I have been amply compensated by hearing the enlightening contribution from the pure-souled, socialist Deputy, who has just concluded.  It was very interesting, indeed, to hear the comments of a true revolutionary on the iniquitous capitalists who, unlike the dispensers of largesse who follow his own noble profession, expect a day's work for a day's pay.  It is indeed an interesting development of the socialist creed that brands such as criminals and outcasts <Col N="2417" /> who provide productive employment, even though they may be motivated by the ignoble profit motive, which is, of course, so completely foreign to the altruistic principles of those who follow the socialist Deputy for Limerick's profession.  They, as true socialists, operate their own private social welfare offices so that the downtrodden employees of the iniquitous capitalists can double or treble their miserable pittances on their way home from work in accordance with the fundamental socialistic principle, &ldquo;if you do not speculate, you will not accumulate&rdquo;.  It is a far cry from the days when drink and gambling were described as the twin curses of the workers to the present stage of socialist development when it is the operators of the starting price office who are the public benefactors, while those who invest in industrial development in the country are pilloried as criminal malefactors.</P>
      <P>This debate has, as far as I can gather from press reports, which, apart from Deputy Coughlan's contribution, is all that I have had available on which to form a judgment, followed a predictable course, a course just as predictable as the Fine Gael Party's reaction to the defeat of the Government's recent proposals in the referendum. The reaction has been, as was to be expected, a revitalisation of the slander factory that operates in the Fine Gael Party and a revitalisation of those members of the Fine Gael Party who have volunteered to constitute themselves a committee for the manufacturing of scandalous falsehoods designed to assassinate the characters of individual Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party and of members of that Party who are not Members of this House and also for the dissemination of the falsehoods which they manufacture. In so far as I personally am concerned, I am proud to be the recipient of this attention from the Fine Gael Party.  I am proud of the fact that Deputy Clinton, for instance, has not even got sufficient regard for his own supporters; he goes so far as to blacken them in addition to me because of the enmity he personally has against me as a representative of the Fianna Fáil Party in his own constituency.</P>

I have no connection whatever with the gentleman concerned and, if there is anything wrong with the development of that particular project, it has certainly nothing whatsoever to do with me or, as far as I know, with any member of the Fianna Fáil Party. When Deputy Clinton gathers his scandalmongers and slanderers around him and distributes this product of the Fine Gael slander factory to them for circulation in the locality he knows that this is utterly untrue, but it is, of course, an indication of the depths to which the Fine Gael Party are prepared to go in order to try to blacken the name of individuals in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

The result will be to place on record again the fact that the Opposition Parties have no confidence in the Government.  That is something that is well known, something that has been said many times.  Its re-assertion this week does not in any way alter the position, and does not in any way add to the public knowledge.  It is known that Deputies on the opposite side of the House desire a change of Government, but there is no reason to believe that the people of the country desire a change of Government. In fact, the only available indications are to the contrary.</P>

      <P>The matter of the continuance of the Government was not at stake in the by-elections.  The possibility of a Coalition Government was not apparent, so the people might reasonably have felt it was safe to express any disapproval or disagreement they might have felt about minor aspects of Government policy.  Despite that and despite the tendency that exists in all known democracies for by-elections to go marginally at least against the Government in office, particularly when an adverse decision in a by-election will not affect the stability of the Government, and particularly when the vacancy is not caused by a member of the Government Party, in six out of seven of those by-elections the people gave a clear vote of confidence in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That result was never approached in this country before.  The only period during which there was anything approaching this kind of result in by-elections was in the period 1957 to 1961 when the Fianna Fáil Government of the time won five out of eight by-elections which took place.  As the results of the by-elections indicated, we were, of course, returned to office again at the next general election.  In the next period from 1961 to 1965 there were six by-elections and the Government won only two.  Despite what might conceivably be interpreted <Col N="2422" /> as an indication of a change of opinion among the electorate, we were again returned to office at the next general election.  On this occasion we have had seven by-elections and the Government have been successful in six.  There could be no clearer indication of the continuing confidence of the people in the Government than that fact.</P>

      <P>This can be compared with the record of the two Coalition Governments we have had.  During the period of the first Coalition Government&mdash;it lasted such a short time that there were three by-elections only&mdash;the Government succeeded in winning two out of three.  During the second Coalition period there were seven by-elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The most they could do was to win two out of seven.  So, as far as the people of the country are concerned, there is a clear indication available to the Government that they retain their confidence.  In only three out of the six by-elections which we won was it a Fianna Fáil seat that was in question?  In those three by-elections the people decided to replace the Fianna Fáil Deputy who had died by another Fianna Fáil Deputy, thereby maintaining the <i>status quo</i> which was established in the general election of 1965.</P>
      <P>In the other three cases of the by-elections which we won, the people decided to increase the Fianna Fáil representation.  In one case, in Cork city, the people made the very remarkable decision of giving Fianna Fáil four out of five seats.  In a situation in which we already had three out of the four surviving seats, the people decided to fill the fifth seat by giving us a fourth representative.  It is hard to imagine a more definite vote of confidence in the Government than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another of these by-elections, in Waterford, the result was a reversal of the position that existed after the general election of 1965.  There, despite the tendency of by-elections to go against <Col N="2423" /> the Government, the result was to change the situation in which we got only one seat out of three in the general election to a victory in the by-election. This Fianna Fáil victory in a by-election in a three-seat constituency is equivalent to a two out of three result in a general election.  Even in the solitary case where the Opposition candidate was &ldquo;deemed to be elected&rdquo; there was a clear indication of a &ldquo;no change&rdquo; attitude on the part of the electorate.  These seven elections took place at four different times: 7th December, 1966, 9th November, 1967, 14th March of this year and 26th May of this year, so that we have quite recent expression of opinion in regard to the question of whether or not this Government retains the confidence of the people from some of these constituencies.</P>
    <P>The first two by-elections took place at a time when we were in the throes of an adverse economic situation and when the man who as Minister for Finance had the responsibility of introducing the measures which were deemed necessary by the Government had just taken over as Taoiseach.  They were held in two mainly agricultural constituencies at a time when the major farmers' organisation was in direct dispute with the Government and when circumstances were particularly favourable to the Opposition's attempt to exploit sectional differences for their own advantage.  Only one of the two seats to be filled at that time was a Fianna Fáil seat.  In one of the constituencies we had only obtained a minority of the seats at the general election.  Despite all these factors and the fact that this was a period in which the economy was going through adverse and difficult times the people of Waterford and South Kerry clearly indicated confidence in the Government and their desire that the affairs of the country should continue to remain in responsible hands.</P>
    <P>The next two by-elections were held when the measures taken were just beginning to have their effect and the next two when the economy was once more moving satisfactorily.  Although the last by-election was held at a time <Col N="2424" /> when Coalition solidarity had been restored by the decision of the two Parties opposite to oppose the Constitutional amendment proposals and although this was made the principal point in the campaign by the Opposition, the people left no doubt as to their decision to retain the present Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Presidential election, while this was not in any way a political matter it was contested on a very intensive scale by the Opposition. Whereas the outgoing President, because of his position was, in effect, a non-participant in the campaign, and even despite this the Fianna Fáil organisation succeeded in getting an overall majority which is something only achieved once in the history of this country in a political election.  If there is any political indication in that particular result it is clearly of continued and increased support for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>With regard to the local elections, these are concerned with different matters to Dáil elections&mdash;the issues are local ones and the location of a candidate is often more important than anything else.  The constituencies are smaller and quotas go down as low as 400.  There is room for every type of fringe candidate.  Despite this Fianna Fáil increased its representation on local authorities, obtaining 589 seats out of a total of 1,538.</P>
    <P>The difference between the local elections and the Dáil elections is indicated by the fact that candidates outside the main political Parties who are described under the collective title of &ldquo;others&rdquo; obtained almost one-half as much as the major political Party and considerably in excess of 50 per cent of the number obtained by the second political Party.  While this election was not either a political matter in the same sense as Dáil elections any indication that can be drawn from it is surely of continued support for the Government.</P>
    <P>The two recent referenda, the results of which have inspired the Opposition Parties to put down these motions of no confidence, were concerned with two specific proposals for Constitutional amendments.  The people have <Col N="2425" /> decided not to make these two changes and they have decided nothing else. They decided not to change the present system of multi-seat constituencies and the transferable vote and they decided constituencies must be revised on the basis of equality of population within very narrow limits, as assessed in the census, per deputy.  We accept that. This is what the people want.  They want more than one Deputy to represent them.  They do not accept that the dangers which we see in the present system are there.</P>

      <P>The result of the other decision is that constituencies must be revised on a very strict basis of near-equality of population per Deputy irrespective of other considerations. Although the constituencies were last revised in 1961, I and my Department have now to engage in the complicated task of squeezing four more Deputies into Dublin and re-arranging the other areas on the basis of four fewer seats. It is not permissible to take into consideration even such known facts as the fact that the Ballymun housing scheme, which was only in its initial stages in April, 1966, will soon be complete and that large scale housing developments will have taken place soon in Tallaght and other places in my own constituency and that these will significantly affect the census in 1971.</P>
      <P>Since these things cannot be taken into account it seems inevitable that another revision must take place in a few years' time.  However, that is the position.  We are not complaining, but there has not been any other decision made by the people and we have every reason to believe that the people, at the next general election, will decide to renew their mandate to the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach concluded his statement announcing the Government's proposals for the proper management of the country's finances, to go as close as possible to matching increased expenditure with increased income and to counteract a somewhat unfavourable trend, Opposition Deputies remarked on the fact that there was no applause from the Government benches.  That was true.  There was no welcome here, either in the Government or among the members of the Party, for increased taxation in itself. <Col N="2427" /> But there is a realisation that the surest and most reliable test of good government is the manner in which it deals with the country's finances and the promptness with which it recognises and deals with ominous trends.</P>
    <P>We have always believed that the public can appreciate the necessity for this type of action.  We have always believed that they appreciate that the increased expenditure on the pay of State employees, on social services and on agricultural subsidies must, if the economy is to survive, be met from increased tax revenue and, if the revenue itself is not sufficiently buoyant to match increased expenditure, that extra taxes are then required.  We have always believed that the people can appreciate this.  Our experience has been that we were right and we have never hesitated to do this, when circumstances called for it&mdash;and the public have continued to express their confidence in us as a Government.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, as politicians, we appreciate that life would be a lot easier for everyone if taxes never had to be increased.  We know that increased taxation in itself can never be popular.  The Opposition are quite correct.  It was on their side of the House that these proposals for taxation were greeted jubilantly and with smiles.  The welcome for the proposals was on the side of the House that voted against them&mdash;but it was the other side, the Government side, that did their duty and this will be recognised by the people, as it has been before.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan's remark that he thinks we are &ldquo;stone mad&rdquo; is typical of the Opposition attitude.  It is a clear indication of what the country can expect in the unlikely event of a change of government after the next general election.  The Opposition cannot understand the mentality of a government that does an unpopular thing because it is the right thing to do.  With them, that is described as &ldquo;stone madness&rdquo;.  We feel confident that we can demonstrate to the people that, so far from this being &ldquo;stone madness&rdquo;, it is an example of the wise and <Col N="2428" /> courageous government which has resulted in a period of practically continuous economic growth such as this country has never experienced before. It is because of the responsible and meticulous handling of the nation's finances that we have been able to make continuous progress in every aspect of social welfare.  There is no need for me to go into detail about that.  I know how painful it is for Opposition Deputies to hear even the most general cataloguing of the achievements in every aspect of social welfare of this Government, particularly because of the contrast that it provides with their own almost completely barren record in this regard.</P>
    <P>Take the question of the income maintenance services themselves.  In every year since this Government came to office in 1957&mdash;and despite the disastrous state of the economy which we took over in 1957&mdash;this Government has been able to increase the social welfare services and, not alone that, but, in almost every one of those years, each of the income maintenance services was increased.  This contrasts very sharply with the record&mdash;or lack of record&mdash;of the Opposition Parties when they had the opportunity to do something about these services in respect of which they are so vocal when they are on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>Most of the social welfare services have never been touched by any hands other than those of Fianna Fáil.  Certainly, there is no social welfare service that has been introduced by any government in this country other than Fianna Fáil.  Every single one of them &mdash;with the exception of the non-contributory old age pension scheme which was introduced during the British time and a rudimentary form of unemployment benefit&mdash;was introduced by Fianna Fáil and practically all the increases in rates have been introduced by Fianna Fáil.  I do not say that this is because the Opposition would not like to improve these social welfare services.  It is because they were not able to do so.  This was because they have not the courage nor the sense of responsibility to handle the country's finances in a responsible way and so they have not been able to do it. <Col N="2429" /> Each one of our Budgets since 1957 has been an exercise in the redistribution of the increased national income resulting from our economic policy&mdash; and the people have continued to demonstrate their confidence in the Government because they know that our policy can be expressed simply as &ldquo;To generate increased national prosperity so as to enable the Government to make real progress in all aspects of social welfare.&rdquo; They can see from experience and from the demonstration they get every year that we have never confused the means with the end; that economic policy, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, is the means and improved social welfare, in all its aspects, is the end and that our object in fostering economic growth is to have available an increasing source from which to draw resources for the improvement of living conditions for the people as a whole.  My own Department of Local Government is an outstanding example of the methods by which the success of the economic Departments is utilised for the common good.</P>
    <P>So far as I myself am concerned, and I think so far as the majority of us are concerned, the most important aspect of my Department is probably the provision of adequate housing for our people.  The number of houses built each year has been rising now, with the exception of one year, when there was a slight deterioration, for a longer period than ever before in the history of this State.  Between 1963-64 and 1967-68 it has, in fact, risen by about 50 per cent.  This rise is continuing.  In the first six months of the present financial year, about 8,300 houses were started or had grants allocated for them compared with 7,606 houses in the first six months of last year.  In the current financial year, it is expected that about 13,000 houses will be completed compared with 12,017 houses last year.  This rise is reflected in total spending on the construction of private and local authority housing and on substantial reconstruction work.  In the current financial year, the total amount spent in this way is expected to reach £54 million compared with about £46 million in the last financial year and, of course, this also was a record.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2430" /> In fact, in the last six years, including the estimated figures for the present financial year, capital expenditure on housing construction, at about £233 million, is almost equal to the total capital expenditure in the 15 years preceding 31st March, 1963, when the total was £240 million.  The rise in capital expenditure on housing is continuing. The figures for loan advances or for loan applications on hand by the principal building societies, local authorities and assurance companies for house purchase showed that in the first six months of 1968-69 they had paid out £10.2 million compared with the figure of £8.5 million in the first six months of 1967-68.  The value of loans for which applications were in the hands of the principal lending agencies has risen from £5.6 million at 30th September, 1967 to £7.7 million at 30th September, 1968.</P>
    <P>Of course, this massive increase in the numbers of houses built and in expenditure on housing construction has naturally been accompanied by an increase in subsidy payments.  Since 1963-64 these have risen from £8.2 million to an estimated £11.8 million in the current financial year, and this figure excludes £7.8 million in subsidies for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken a number of steps to encourage greater efficiency in building which will in turn result in reduced housing costs.  These include a scheme of technical assistance grants for builders to encourage them to engage consultants and to streamline their procedures and to attend courses and seminars where the latest building and control techniques are described; work on dimensional co-ordination, with the object of achieving economies through greater efficiency in the production and use of components in building; and standardisation, throughout the country, of requirements for structural standards etc. in building regulations, which are at present being drafted by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>In regard to the local authority housing programme specifically, 4,045 dwellings, including 1,255 at Ballymun, were completed in 1967-1968.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> Work in progress has increased very rapidly and at 30th September a total of not less than 7,277 dwellings were in progress including 1,749 in special projects of the National Building Agency in Dublin, at Ballymun and in Cork and Limerick.  Houses in progress, excluding the National Building Agency projects, have increased from 3,031 at 31st March, 1967, to 5,528 at 30th September, 1968.  4,251 men were employed on ordinary local authority housing and 1,016 on National Building Agency projects.  A total of 4,684 new dwellings, excluding the National Building Agency projects, were started in 1967-1968 as compared with 2,411 dwellings in 1966-1967, and 2,611 in 1965-1966.  Nearly £11 million worth of tenders were approved by the local authority housing, leaving out the National Building Agency projects, in 1967-1968.  This compares with £6.06 million in 1966-1967, £5.86 million in 1965-1966, and £7.4 million in 1964-1965.</P>
    <P>This is only one aspect of my own Department's administration that I can touch on in this debate, but similar progress has been made in every other aspect.  It is because this Government looks after the country's finances, that this Government has sufficient courage and sufficient wisdom to take the necessary remedial measures in time, that it does not have to wait until a critical situation develops, that we ensure that the economy progresses on an even keel throughout our period of office.  That is why we have been able to remain in office continuously since 1957.  That is why we have been able to maintain such continuous and outstanding progress in every aspect of social welfare; and why the people, realising this will decide, at the next general election when it comes about, to continue to place responsibility for the conduct of the country's affairs in the same hands that have produced such an outstanding contrast to the miserable performance of the two Coalition Parties opposite when, through an indecisive election result, they got the opportunity of wreaking the havoc they did wreak on the country's economy.</P>

      <P>As I said, I heard many Fianna Fáil Deputies stating openly they accepted fully the verdict of the people.  This is obviously not so with the Minister for Local Government. He is still whining and complaining that the people are wrong. The only person who is wrong in this country now is the Minister for Local Government.  Even his own Taoiseach is wrong.  The Taoiseach accepts the verdict of the people; the Minister for Local Government refuses to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government proceeds from there to defend the <i>Irish Independent</i> against the attacks of Deputy Dunne.  Surely this is novel and particularly good coming from the Minister for Local Government who has himself, in the course of the campaign, been attacking the <i>Irish Independent</i> and doing everything possible to intimidate them.  Of course, he would see to it that those advertisements were withdrawn from the <i>Irish Independent</i> if he were not afraid to do it as was done in the case of the <i>Farmers' Journal.</i> It is certainly novel to see the Minister defending the <Col N="2433" /><i>Irish Independent</i> against Deputy Seán Dunne.  Deputy Dunne is well known for his appreciation of the high standards observed by the press in this country and of the service they render to the people.  The Minister's attitude is typical of his arrogance.</P>
    <P>He goes on then to make a personal attack on me and when he is challenged he runs out of the House.  He makes a scandalous personal attack on my character but cannot produce a shred of evidence to support what he says.  He talks about what I said in regard to some development or other in the Green Isle Hotel in Clondalkin and what I said he did or did not do about this development.  He refused to give particulars.  I could not possibly follow it up but I challenge him here and now to meet me, with the directors of this hotel, and to tell them and me what he has in mind; because anything I have in mind about the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Local Government or any other Minister, I will say it to him both here and outside the House. I will not be afraid to say it because I am not a person who takes pride in annihilating people's characters as some of those opposite do.  I want that challenge to be on record and I want to see the Minister outside the House because I insist I will defend my character no matter who attacks it.  I want him to produce the evidence.  He is completely free to do so.</P>
    <P>He made an attack on Deputy O'Connell about the letters the Deputy writes to his constituents.  I had a question on the Order Paper today to ask the Minister if it was the practice in his Department, when he accepted tenders, first to notify certain Deputies in his own constituency before notifying the county council concerned, and I was told the answer was in the negative.  I was told the answer was in the negative while I hold in my possession a letter to Deputy Foley: &ldquo;Dear Des, I am very pleased to be able to tell you I have today accepted the tender for such a house.&rdquo; This was given to Deputy Foley on the 14th and was given to the county council on the 16th.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2434" /> This is his method of keeping himself in office and for keeping a Deputy in office who is well known to have done no work since he came into the House, either in the constituency or in the House.  This is the way for getting a pretext for deceiving the people into believing that they have been in some way responsible for getting a house built for an unfortunate woman.  This is the type of practice the Minister for Local Government indulges in when he should be doing his own work.  This is the job he has his civil servants engaged in with public money.  It is a disgrace and it should be exposed.  Of course, there is another Fianna Fáil Deputy in the county but he is not in such favour as Deputy Foley.  He may get a letter a few days after the county council have got it and &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; will then be late with the story.  This is the form, this is what I want to expose. The <i>Irish Independent,</i> to which the Minister for Local Government referred, had this to say in a leading article on 5th November:</P>
    <P>Distasteful, even humiliating, steps are required of the Government to expunge the undemocratic arrogance of which, until last month, it could be rightly accused.</P>
    <P>If the <i>Irish Independent</i> wants further evidence of arrogance, it certainly got it today from the Minister for Local Government.  The leading article continued:</P>
    <P>An easier policy is required of the Opposition: to expose and relentlessly hunt down that arrogance should it show itself again.</P>
    <P>I say that, in fact, it has shown itself on a number of occasions inside the last week and I have been thinking about this problem just as the <i>Irish Independent</i> has been.  The arrogant people, the people who refuse to talk to people in the country, who refuse to consult the various vocational groups and who ignore the express wishes of the people, are well known in Fianna Fáil.  The Minister for Local Government is well known, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, sitting opposite, is well known.  He refuses to get down to talk to the people for whose welfare primarily <Col N="2435" /> he is responsible.  The Minister for Education refuses to talk to the people concerned with education in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Taoiseach will do about them but he has a responsibility to do something.  Frankly, I think the only solution is that he should introduce them to Deputy MacEntee, because Deputy MacEntee has friends in Greece, and I think they would be suitably employed there imposing martial law.  Either that or, perhaps, Backbencher's NGKA might come out from its anonymity like Taca and make Deputy Boland Taoiseach of that organisation, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Tánaiste, and, perhaps, even find a job for Deputy Lenihan also.  That deals with our friend Deputy Boland particularly. When the Taoiseach spoke here earlier he tried to make the point that there was an element of political opportunism in Fine Gael tabling this motion of no confidence at the present time, and that this, of course, applied also to the motion in the name of Labour.</P>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach saw no such element in his, on the same day, bringing in a staggering Budget that will leave the people of this country incapable of thinking of anything except the backbreaking load of added taxation that has been piled on their backs and which they are being asked to accept.  The Taoiseach so far has got away successfully with his pose on the pious altar of rectitude, but the people are now finding him out and they have realised fully that he is well able to play Party politics with the best.</P>
    <P>Since we put down this motion, and following this crushing defeat at the referendum, many people have come to me and said: &ldquo;You had not to wait for the defeat to put this motion down.  This motion is long overdue.  There is overwhelming evidence available already to prove that they have failed completely to solve the many pressing problems from which the country is suffering and they appear to have no worthwhile ideas or plans for the future&rdquo;. After 30 years of Fianna Fáil in office we have a situation where unemployment <Col N="2436" /> is increasing rather than decreasing. We have emigration proceeding apace.  We have health and social welfare services lagging behind the rest of Europe and we have a deplorable backlog of housing needs.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have scandalous speculation in building land.  In the course of the past week, I have come across sites for sale, individual sites for houses, for £5,000 each, plus 5 per cent.  I know another case where the speculator bought a nine-acre field for £47,000.  He got planning permission for 75 housing sites on it.  These housing sites are now being sold at £1,675 each, plus 5 per cent, plus&mdash;this is an important plus&mdash;£22 ground rent, so that when these houses are built on this site, this speculator will have an annual income of not less than £1,600 from the ground rents alone.  This is the type of speculation that the Government have facilitated and encouraged. It is what brought Taca into being. They are the people who want to see Fianna Fáil continue in office.  They are the people who have grown fat during Fianna Fáil's reign in office. Fianna Fáil have refused absolutely to accept our proposals for the setting up of an impartial body to deal with planning appeals.  They know that these favours can be handed out, that they can make or break any such person and that money has been put into the pockets of people of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister for Local Government to come in here and tell us all the present Government have done in relation to the housing problem. What I want to know is what is the present position.  It is deplorable. There is a backlog of housing needs and I do not know when it will be caught up with and I do not think that any evidence is needed to prove that many thousands of our people have been living in deplorable housing conditions for many years.  This city is ringed with caravans.  Every approach road to the city is locked up with caravans on the side of the road and every open space has caravans.  These caravans are occupied by decent people who cannot find the wherewithal to buy a housing site and build houses. Those people cannot get a local <Col N="2437" /> authority house and do not qualify in many cases for a local authority house.</P>
    <P>In many of these caravans you have children of nine, ten and 11 years of age who do not know what it is to run from one room to another and who possibly will never know the joy of running from one room to another. How children can be expected to grow up with a healthy mind and wholesome aspirations from these surroundings beats me, and how any Minister for Local Government can come in here, with his own Government in office for so long, and flap his wings about what has been done about the housing situation in this country beats me.</P>
    <P>I think the people have sized up the situation.  They have realised that this Government is more concerned about the wealthy people in this country and about making the rich people richer than they are about unfortunate people who are confronted with circumstances such as I describe.  We do not find the Minister for Local Government going to Ballyfermot on a Sunday morning to see the position there and listen to the plight of many people: but he can come in and attack people in this House who are trying to do what they can to assist people of that kind.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that, instead of improving, the unemployment situation is worsening.  Unfortunately the facts are there and this fact does not require any proof from me or from anybody else.  The main reason why we have this situation is that many people are fleeing from conditions in rural Ireland. We are not able to find jobs for them outside rural Ireland and we have no plans to hold them in rural Ireland or to try and find worthwhile occupation for them there.  So, therefore, we have no plans in rural Ireland and we have no plans when they leave it.  Were it not for the safety valve of emigration this Government would be out of office long ago.</P>
    <P>The people of rural Ireland are the most important sector in this country. On their production depends our ability to buy the raw materials for all other industries.  We know that, if they do not produce agricultural goods at a price at which we can sell them in the export market, the whole of the <Col N="2438" /> economy is doomed.  It has long since been well established that the welfare of the economy as a whole in the last analysis depends on how agriculture is doing and how much it is producing for export.  The more we succeed in producing in rural Ireland the more dependent we become on export markets.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in agriculture to-day?  I said earlier on that we have a situation where the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not talking to the people in the industry.  This war is in existence now for over two years.  I personally have pleaded with the Minister and with the farmers concerned to try and build a bridge between them but the Minister is not prepared to come and meet them.  He is not prepared to accept that he is there to serve the people and not to bully them and not to drive them.  The day is gone and should be buried forever when farmers can be kicked around and dictated to by their own Minister.</P>
    <P>An essential starting point in any agricultural policy programme is the full involvement and participation of the farmers on whom the future of the industry depends.  If we have not this type of democracy in agriculture, we have no hope.  We talk about industrial democracy but I think it is far more essential to have democracy in agriculture.</P>
    <P>This week what have we been given? What has agriculture been given?  It has been blamed for the heavy taxation that has been imposed on the people's back in the second enormous Budget we have had this year.  But, what are they likely to get out of it?  The subsidy on calves will give them nothing this year.  That is accepted.  It does not operate until the 1st April next and the one penny a gallon for those who produce milk up to 7,000 gallons cannot bring in more, cannot cost the Government more than £250,000 in what is left of this year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries knows, and nobody has to tell him, that the end of the lactation period has arrived and that cows will be dry over the winter in the dairying areas and the amount of milk involved in this will <Col N="2439" /> certainly not call for expenditure up to the amount described in this second Budget.  It is ridiculous to say it will. It is ridiculous to suggest that this taxation has been found necessary because of the fact that there are £6 million for the farmers.  This is the type of deplorable attitude that exists towards the Irish farmers and Irish agriculture.  That has been in evidence here for a long time.</P>
    <P>If farmers get anything in a budget it should operate from April or May, that is the summer.  The other sectors of the people who have to pay for this enormous load of taxation are said to carry the farmers on their back, when in fact the reverse is the case.  Today we hear that this limited number of small farmers are getting this one penny when their cows are dry.  On the same day as we are told that there will be £8 for a calf on a farm where no milk will be supplied to a creamery or no milk will be supplied to a city or a town, we hear the news that the B and I are charging 25s more per beast for bringing cattle from Dublin to Liverpool and that they are going to confine their operations in future to one route. This means that cattle being exported from Cork and from all over the country will first have to be conveyed to Dublin.  I would like the Minister to calculate the cost of bringing those cattle to Dublin and then 25s more to convey them to England from Dublin and only on the one route.  I hold that the loss involved in this to the producers of cattle is in fact going to be much greater than what the Minister is providing so that the sooner the sing-song about what the farmers of this country are getting is given up the better.  They are getting a pittance.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing is encouraging people to stay below 7,000 gallons.  He knows as well as I know that this is not an economic unit of production.  We have had programmes on television indicating that if you want an economic unit, a viable unit, you must have 30 cows on a 40-45 acre farm of good land.  Here we have the situation where the Minister comes in offering a penny a gallon to those <Col N="2440" /> who produce under 7,000 gallons.  This does not make sense to me and it does not make sense to anybody.  We have the Second Programme for Economic Expansion laying down certain targets.  We have not nearly reached those targets in cow numbers, in cattle numbers or in milk production but the farmers are told: &ldquo;You are producing too much milk.  We must stop you producing milk.&rdquo; They are told at the same time: &ldquo;You are producing too much wheat.  We must stop this.  Look at what this is involving the country in.&rdquo; We have a situation where we are not able to supply our quota of bacon to the British market.  This arises purely and solely because Fianna Fáil have no agricultural policy and never had an agricultural policy and because their policy is being decided from day to day and from month to month.</P>
    <P>I said earlier on that it was the job of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to serve the people and to serve the farmers of this country.  I want to say more about that.  It is also the job of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to take some of the uncertainty out of farming in the future. He must look a reasonable distance ahead and he must plan a reasonable distance ahead.  He should be able to say to the farmers: &ldquo;I want you to produce so much of this, that and the other and, if you do, I will guarantee that you will get a rock bottom price of so much.&rdquo; Put a floor on it and say: &ldquo;You will get this price when you produce so much and I will guarantee an outlet.&rdquo; No such statement has been made and consequently there is no confidence in the future of Irish farming.  No farmer is in the position today that he can plan ahead and that he can make worthwhile investment knowing in advance that, if he does this, he will have an outlet and a reasonable price for his produce.  This should be engaging the attention of the Minister and it certainly has not been engaging the attention of the Minister. We have had slumps and booms and every time that we produce more pigs, more grain, more milk, more cattle, we have a slump simply and solely because forecasting and marketing as it should be done in a modern society <Col N="2441" /> is just not being done.  It is being neglected.</P>
    <P>We have a situation at the present time where the Minister says that there must be a shift away from milk and, at one and the same time, his advisers are going around the country, especially in the intensive development areas, telling the farmers: &ldquo;Your only hope is to get into milk.  This is the best way to increase your income.  This is the best advice we can give you!&rdquo; Surely that is a contradiction in terms and surely a stop must be put to this once and for all.  The farmers must be told where they are going.</P>
    <P>We have a chaotic position in the pig industry.  Smuggling has been referred to earlier on today.  We have a situation whereby we are not able to supply our quota on the British market.  We have failed to do that and we are only supplying it because of the enormous amount of pigs being smuggled in across the Border from the Six Counties.  My view is that no serious attempt has been made to stop this smuggling and that this is because of our embarrassment at not being able to supply our quota.  This smuggling is costing the taxpayers of the country on average £12,000 per week.  These smugglers are well known and the number of pigs they are smuggling is well known but, as Deputy Coughlan has said, were it not for these smugglers the bacon industry in this country would be sitting down.  This is a deplorable situation.  We have skim milk to the point where we cannot dispose of it and there has been no organised effort to get the pig industry into a situation where it could absorb an immense amount of this skim.  We have failed because we refused to accept that you will not get pigs produced in this country unless you get a balance between the price of pigs and the price of feeding stuffs and unless you keep this relationship always the same or reasonably the same.  Farmers will get into pigs and get out of pigs.</P>
    <P>We have had the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission&mdash;where I think a good job is being done having regard to the circumstances&mdash;coming into the open and saying that the situation that took place here in 1965 would justify a public inquiry in any <Col N="2442" /> other country in the world except here and that obviously the advice he had given and the recommendations he had made to the Department were ignored. It is a deplorable situation that this can be said and not contradicted and that farmers were put into the situation, long before they had reached the target of pig production set by Fianna Fáil in the Second Programme, where they practically had to give pigs away. It is no wonder the situation is as it is but I think it is something to be thoroughly ashamed of.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the market is there. It is obvious that the Irish farmer is in a position to supply that market. It is obvious, too, that there are difficulties in the disposal of milk products and that the Minister has a duty to attract people into other lines of production. We cannot afford to say in the case of milk production, the economy as a whole cannot afford to say: &ldquo;You cannot produce any more milk,&rdquo; when we have regard to the fact that two-thirds of our beef cattle are supplied from the dairy herds of this country.  We are treading on very dangerous ground now and we offer £8 for calves in this very limited category.  At one and the same time, as I understand it, we are taking away the calved heifer subsidy scheme.  If that is so, the result will be a minus benefit to the farmers of this country. There will be no benefit in it and I think the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries knows this well and it is time he did something about it.</P>
    <P>I spoke about increased charges for transport and so on.  I believe the Minister has been forewarned on many occasions that this situation would arise.  He had been warned about the situation in England with which the people in the cattle trade were confronted when the B and I allowed their waggon stock to run down and when farmers and traders were required to convey their cattle by road at very much increased costs.  Obviously nothing was done about this or, if so, nobody knows that any effort was made; but we do know that no success was achieved in regard to overcoming these difficulties.  Now there is a war between B and I and British Railways, a war that the Irish farmers and those <Col N="2443" /> in the cattle trade must endure.  The Minister should do whatever he can, with his colleague the Minister for Transport and Power, to resolve these difficulties and ensure that our farmers get the service they deserve.  He should try to reduce the costs involved.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with agricultural matters and we shall probably be dealing with them in a week or so again because we have now reached the situation when one Estimate is catching up with the next simply because we have had so much unwanted and undesirable legislation introduced, eating into the time of the House and causing unnecessary expense to the country. We had the referendum thrown in for good measure.  We scarcely know what Estimate we are discussing.  The country is alarmed at the situation in regard to sheep.  Sheep numbers are down by about 500,000 or something approaching that.  The reply to a question I had down the other day indicates that the subsidy on sheep is only about half what it is on other products.  Here we have an imbalance that apparently had not been looked at or no great effort was made to level it up.  It is a serious situation when we want to attract farmers into lines of production that are easy to sell to find that we are making little or no effort to bring that about.</P>
    <P>What is our grain policy?  Since last January we imported about £1.5 million of low-class and low-quality pollard.  Why?  Why did we refuse last year to give our farmers a few extra shillings per barrel or per ton for barley?  Why did we not encourage the growing of greater quantities of barley by increasing the price?  We all made a case for an increased price for barley or for an acreage subsidy for barley as they do in Northern Ireland.  We are boasting about the £8 for a very small number of calves but I was in Northern Ireland last week buying cows and I inquired from a farmer what they were getting by way of subsidy in Northern Ireland and he informed me that they were getting 10 guineas for bull calves and 9 guineas for heifer calves of all breeds and sorts.  We are now boasting about taking away the heifer subsidy scheme and giving a <Col N="2444" /> small subsidy for a limited number of calves.</P>
    <P>I am glad horticulture is making some progress, even though last year we imported £2 million worth of apples.  I believe strawberries are paying, but no effort is being made to find a market on a contractual basis for a reasonable period ahead such as would induce people to make an investment knowing they would not be throwing away their money.</P>
    <P>I have not much time left but I want to say a word to the Minister about the Cook-Sprague Report.  Why is this Report left lying about?  We first had the Knapp Report.  We still have this chaos in the milk industry. Recommendations were made in the Knapp Report but we were not wholly satisfied with that and we brought in two more experts to check on the previous ones and they reported a considerable time ago.  The Cook-Sprague Report, when it comes out, is not the Cook-Sprague Report but an edited version of it.  I want the Minister to say why was he afraid to print what was in the Cook-Sprague Report and why it has been altered and what right he has to alter a Report produced by two experts and paid for out of public money?</P>
    <P>There is also the store cattle report. That is lying in the Minister's Department since last April and not yet printed.  I am sure it contains some very important material that would benefit the country, but it is kept in the background like whatever the Minister has to say about all his visits to the British Minister for Agriculture. That has also been kept secret.  The House has been told nothing about what happened in the course of the Minister's visits to his British counterpart. What matters were discussed? There are many matters of urgent importance to this country.  The Minister promised the House before we went into Recess that he would come back and tell us what it was all about and asked us not to embarrass him about it in advance.  We refrained but, after all this time, it cannot be a cause of embarrassment for the Minister now to stand up and tell the House what he has been discussing with the British Minister because there have <Col N="2445" /> been no obvious results.  No great beneficial results have followed these visits.</P>
    <P>I do not want to continue to speak but I believe the time has come when the people will speak.  A general election is obviously in the offing and I think the people are looking forward to that day when, I believe, their verdict will be for a change of government. That is the relief the country is looking for.  The present Government stand discredited before the people for their failure in so many departments. I think it was Deputy Coughlan who said earlier that there was no fear of the Government going to the country. I agree with him because I think if they went to the country they would be slaughtered.</P>

In so far as this motion is concerned, that this House has confidence in the Government, as distinct from the negative sort of motion put down by Fine Gael, that there is no confidence in the Government, I want to give with regard to agriculture, to which I will confine myself now because of the time-wasting tactics indulged in, a few figures which, perhaps, the Opposition Deputies will take home and add up.  Agriculture is our most important industry and always has been in the mind of Fianna Fáil.  In the years since Fianna Fáil last came into office, that is 1956, gross agricultural output has risen from £175 million in that last glorious year, as they would like to believe, of coalition, to £293 million estimated for 1968.  These are two good figures&mdash; £175 million in 1956; £293 million in 1968&mdash;for gross agricultural output as between those two years over that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does not like his increase in salary he can give it back.  He was told that already. <Col N="2450" /> Aggregate farm income&mdash;I am sure you must be absolutely bubbling over with enthusiasm to hear these figures about agriculture&mdash;£95 million was the aggregate farm income in 1956.  It will be, or is, this year £161 million.  Agricultural exports, about which we are all so concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>One shilling a gallon for milk and the rocks of Connemara to be moved into the sea.  Cattle numbers: in 1956, 4,537,000 head of cattle. Under Fianna Fáil, since then, the figure has gone up from that figure of 4,537,000 to 5,546,000 in the year 1968. Milch cows, about which we have heard so much in the past few days, have gone up since 1956 from 1,187,000 to 1,603,000 in the year 1968.  Exports of cattle and beef have gone up from 830,000.  In 1956, 830,000 cattle or their equivalent went out from this country.  In 1967, 1,404,000 cattle went out by way of export and earned very good and substantial money for the farmers of this country.</P>

      <P>Again, creamery milk, in which you like to wallow in this House and you cry crocodile tears about the dairy farmers, here in brief form is the record.  In 1956, creamery milk delivered to creameries was 263,000,000 gallons.  In 1968, now drawing to a close, the figure will be in or about 520,000,000 gallons from these same dairy farmers&mdash;surely, even in Fine Gael's estimation, a significant increase in milk production and deliveries to our creameries?</P>

      <P>Listen to this.  The value of that milk, which was £20 million in 1956, is now, in this year, reaching £56 million for the milk supplied by the dairy farmers of this country and then we hear Fine Gael crying about them and they would have us revert to James Dillon and his agricultural policy and his bob a gallon.</P>

      <P>If we reverted to that we would not only not need the supplementary Budget just introduced but, in fact, we would save so much that we would have a surplus to distribute at this time or six months from now, next April, because one bob a gallon at this stage would save us £25 million by reducing our support to milk and bringing it back to the level it was at when you people in Fine Gael were in government in 1956, and well the Deputies know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind what it is equal to.  That is what you would have them get.  Are you now backing down on Deputy Dillon's offer of a shilling a gallon?  Are you also backing down on the statement I made that our output at the present time in milk is 520,000,000 gallons as against 263,000,000 gallons, when the land, apparently, in 1956, was flowing with milk and honey brought about by the good government of you lot over there?  Is this what you are trying to tell us?  Is that what we want to go back to and how are we to guard ourselves against the threat to the future that your colleague talked about a few minutes ago?  Are we to take him to heart?  Are we to listen to him and take some notice when he talks about what we are to do for the farmers in the future?  How are we to secure their future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Get Fianna Fáil out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One way in which we can do that is to ensure that Fine Gael <Col N="2452" /> stays in Opposition and does not get over here.  This is the best security, the best assurance, for the future that the farmers can get, and well Fine Gael knows it and well the farmers know it and well the people know it. When you go to the country, as you will have to do in the not too distant future, the people will tell you that they want their future secured, that they want to see agriculture progress in future as it has been doing under Fianna Fáil and the only way to ensure it will be to keep you people where you are, in the Opposition, forever and always.  This is the only rôle that you can fill, and very badly, if I may say so, do you fill it and have been filling it over these recent months.</P>
      <P>Let us look at just another aspect, lest the increased production that the farmers have been giving us and the increased out-turn they have been earning for this country is attributed to them and them alone and lest it should be said that the Government had no hand or part in it, that it was in spite of the Government that it was done.  Here is your record: in 1956-57, in terms of money, your government's total contribution to the agricultural community and the advancement of agriculture was a scanty £17 million. What will it be this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1968-69, that £17 million will have risen to a figure approximating to £80 million.  Start sorting that one out and ask yourselves whether we as a Government have not only done our part as a Government in supporting and aiding agriculture, have not only kept in step with the increased production, but have gone far ahead of it as against your record as a Government during that term of Coalition during that last year in office, and your figure of £17 million odd. That is what you gave.  That is what you thought the farmers were worth. That is what you thought agriculture was worth.  Whereas, we in Fianna Fáil, this year, are putting into agriculture, taking it on the same basis as that £17 million, a figure of £80 million. Sneeze that one off.</P>

      <P>The Minister was not entitled to any ten minutes at all. This is further evidence of the tactics of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Party that does not want anybody but themselves to be heard and, as well as that, they want only their own particular version.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, tell us about the wonderful situation agriculture is in and, simultaneously, the farmers are picketing and the Minister will not speak to <Col N="2459" /> them.  When the referendum was on the stocks he suddenly got the idea that it might be a good thing to say he would meet them under certain terms but, the farmers having had their fingers burned on at least two occasions by the Minister and his predecessor, the invitation was turned down.</P>

      <P>We have heard a great deal about this extra penny on the milk.  Would Fianna Fáil realise that the penny per gallon offered to the farmers works out at shillings per week?  It is the very same as the derating of land under £20 valuation. That also works out at shillings per week.  The small farmer does not want doles or pennies handed to him, as if he were a child.  He wants a decent living and, if he does not get it with Fianna Fáil in office, he will get it with Fianna Fáil out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I promised Deputy Foley I would comment on one particular point because he obviously does not know the facts.  He spoke for three-quarters of an hour.  He made some fairly good <Col N="2460" /> points, but one point was entirely off beam and, because it was, it requires a little explanation from me.  I refer to this matter of the political fund.  He talked about trade unions giving money to the Labour Party, having got that money by slitting the workers' wage packets as they came home from work.  That statement, for the benefit of Deputy Foley and those like him who do not know anything about trade unions, is absolutely wrong.  The position is that any trade union can, if their members agree, set up a political fund.  By law, they can have a certain subscription paid towards a political fund.  Any member who wants to opt out of the fund can do so.  All he need do is sign a declaration that he does not want to contribute.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>All trade union members have the right to opt out and if they sign an option out their money is not used.  During the recent referendum campaign the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, following a discussion at their annual conference, decided they would campaign against the change and the money they used for that campaign was money subscribed by unions which had political funds and which subscribed some of those funds to help finance the campaign. Those who were not subscribing to the funds had no right to say how the money should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union of which I am general secretary had no political fund and we did not, therefore, contribute; but certain people signed a document to the effect that they were opting out and disagreed with what we did. One fellow had not paid a penny to us for six years, or to anybody else, but his name was down as disagreeing with the way we spent his money.  I do not know what money he was talking about.  If one goes to the trouble of checking the published lists one finds that some did not know the name of the union and some did not belong to any union, as was proved subsequently. In the case of members of <Col N="2461" /> families, the address got changed around a bit, but it was the same family.  To suggest that money was illegally used for this campaign, or any other campaign, or that the Labour Party is getting money which is taken off Fianna Fáil supporters for the purpose of campaigning, is a lot of damn nonsense and anyone who does not know that must be very thick.</P>
    <P>We had a great deal of talk from the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, about all the by-elections Fianna Fáil won.  I do not want to go back on the ones they won.  I am more interested in the ones to come.  There are two by-elections, unfortunately. I would like to see the Government moving the writ for one or the other.  That would show their confidence in the people and the result would show the confidence the people have in them.  We will take the test on one or the other and the sooner the better.  Are they afraid to go to the country?  Let there be no doubt about it, Fianna Fáil are afraid to face the electorate.  If President de Valera or Deputy Seán Lemass were Taoiseach, either of them would have been up in the Park the moment the result of the referendum was known. Do not forget what happened when Mrs. Eileen Desmond won the seat in Cork a few years ago.  Deputy Seán Lemass was up to the Park asking for the dissolution of the Dáil before the information was published in the evening papers that Mrs. Desmond had won the seat.</P>
    <P>We have people here who, knowing they have done wrong and knowing they have no chance of getting what they got in the last general election, an overall majority, are sitting around in the hope that another miracle will occur which, by some peculiar set of circumstances, they may be able to twist around and recover the face they have lost.  Why did they lose the referendum? They lost it for two good reasons.  First, the presentation of it to this House proved that the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, in particular, did not give two damns about anybody.  During the debate here he talked, and talked, and talked for hours on end.  When anybody <Col N="2462" /> made a point he talked for another hour on that.  But he objected to one of our members in the Seanad speaking for 20 minutes.  He himself spoke for six hours and twenty-five minutes. Does anybody think the people were going to tolerate his antics when they saw that, if he represented Government thinking, it would be only a matter of time until all the members of the Government would be walking on the necks of the people even more than they are now, if they had all that authority, and the people decided to give them a good kick in the pants and they did?</P>

He and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who followed him talked about the improvements in conditions from 1956 to the present. That seems fair enough except that both of them seemed to have a blind spot.  They seemed to forget the year 1932.  If things were bad in 1956 after the Coalition went out of office, surely the Fianna Fáil Government who held office continuously except for one break of three years in the late 1940s, must carry the major share of the responsibility.  We could go back to the time after they took over when no houses were built.  No houses were built in 1957 when Fianna Fáil were in power, and when pressed they said that the housing problem had been solved.</P>

      <P>My time is running out and I want to go back to the question of newspaper publicity.  Statements were made by various Members of the House as to what was said in the newspapers.  This morning the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> seems to think that Deputy Seán Dunne has a thin skin.  I can only say that I think the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> is a little thin-skinned himself.  If it is fair game, and I believe it is, for any political correspondent to attack and criticise any Member of this House, no matter to which Party he belongs, and if his editor feels he is entitled to write a leading article on whether or not the political Parties are behaving in the right way, surely the Deputy is also entitled to give his version of what he thinks is right or wrong in that newspaper.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; but I am sure the heart of the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> would jump if he were here today and heard Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, defending him.  He certainly made a spirited defence. There may be some people who are members of the Press Gallery who have got the idea that they know everything there is to know about politics.  I remember an old man who did not belong to my Party saying that when you go into politics you are in a trade union and you are an apprentice until you leave.  You are learning all the time.  If someone who looks down on us from an exalted height presumes to be an expert without going through the mill he had better think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all had the reasons trotted out as to why Fianna Fáil lost the referendum. I gave as the first reason the presentation of the referendum to this House by Deputy Boland.  The second and main reason was that the proposals were outrageous and no one could hope to get away with them.  I am amazed that the Government did, in fact, agree to adopt Deputy Boland's suggestion.  When the matter went before the people of Ireland the people <Col N="2465" /> decided.  The voters of Ireland decided.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to cross swords with the newspaper correspondents who said politicians had nothing to do with it and that the politicians of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party all got their knuckles rapped. That line of reasoning is a bit hard to follow.  There was a decision to be made.  Fianna Fáil were in favour of it and Fine Gael and Labour were against it.  We campaigned against a change and we won.  How someone can blame us for that is a bit devious to follow.  I am unable to untangle it.  In the fight against the proposed change not only were the two Opposition Parties and various bodies outside the House against it, but quite strong support came from prominent Fianna Fáil supporters.  If some Deputies who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party did not get up on a platform and say they did not want a change, they certainly did not get up and say they did want a change.  When the election was over it was extraordinary&mdash;or, perhaps, it was not so extraordinary&mdash;to see the number of people who formerly supported Fianna Fáil who were prepared to say: &ldquo;We won.&rdquo; Having considered the matter over the past few weeks, I am quite satisfied that a substantial number of those people will never again put a stroke in front of the name of a Fianna Fáil candidate.  If Fianna Fáil want proof of that they can easily get it.  All they have to do is ask the Taoiseach to dissolve the Dáil, and if he does we will have a decision pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that originally this whole thing started at the committee on the Constitution.  I want to repeat something which many people would like to deny but cannot deny.  During the discussions by the committee when we came to the section dealing with election to Dáil Éireann which said that Members of Dáil Éireann would be elected by the system of proportional representation for multi-member constituencies Deputy Seán Lemass who had set up that committee when he was Taoiseach said: &ldquo;There is no point in wasting our time discussing this, boys.  It was decided by the people <Col N="2466" /> of Ireland less than nine years ago and no Government would be fool enough to put it before the people again.&rdquo; Yet here we had Fianna Fáil, his own Party, being fool enough to put it before the people again.  I was very suspicious about the fact that this decision was taken to put it before the people again nine years after it had been rejected.  There was a difference of 200,000 in the number of voters who rejected it this time.  Deputy Boland today was not too happy about the position.</P>

      <P>I will give him what he is called in this House.  He was very shaky about the whole thing and was suggesting, if there was any excuse at all, another attempt might be made later.  In the meantime he talked, as indeed Deputy Foley did, as if he knew a lot more than anybody else in the House, about the way the constituencies were going to be broken up.  Nobody will forget the attempt at blackmail made by the Minister for Local Government when he threatened a number of Deputies, including me personally, about what would happen to my constituency and to their constituencies if they did not agree with his policy of changing the system.  He told us we would never sit in the House again.  He even got the secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party to write to the local papers making stupid suggestions that we were trying to get out of our constituencies and that the Minister was going to fix us up with &ldquo;cushiony&rdquo; constituencies.  We are accusing him of being arrogant and making arrogant replies to Questions put in the House.  After the referenda results they became sullen and kept their heads down and had not a word to throw to a cat.  Today and yesterday they have their voices back again.  We had the Minister for Local Government in the House again not content with <Col N="2467" /> shouting here but going outside the rail to shout back to Deputy Clinton and tell him what he would propose to do with certain things.  These are the people who tell us they are a fair and reasonable Government and they would not do anything out of the way.</P>
      <P>I would suggest if the Minister has any sense he will look at the answer he gave me on the slight changes which might have to be made to some constituencies in order to comply with the law.  He will make those changes and leave the rest alone because when he goes before the electorate, whenever he is forced to do so, he will get an answer he will not forget.  Somebody said he was going to leave politics if he did not win the referendum.</P>

They gave the impression that they had nothing to do with coalitions.  The Labour Party put Fianna Fáil into power the first time, for their sins.  For a number of years Fianna Fáil stayed in power with the assistance of what Deputy Dillon referred to as the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo;. They are now in power and they will be mainly depending on one pair until the next election.  They have one pair they can depend on.</P>

      <P>I think the papers were right when they said Deputies were nearly struck dumb when they heard the amount of money required for this Budget.  Then, after saying that the country was in a terrible state, the Taoiseach came in a few days later, <Col N="2468" /> said it was a great country and told us to look at how well off we are.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to put this on the record that, when the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget last Spring, those of us who spoke on it from this side of the House pointed out that without doubt the Budget was intended to put the country over the referendum after which another Budget would be introduced.  There were hands raised in horror by the Fianna Fáil people.  They would not do anything like that.  The Budget was the housekeeping for the year.  The Minister for Finance said unless it was extremely urgent there would be no further Budget.  I suggest that what happened was that the Government decided to bring in a reasonably easy Budget and that then, when the referendum was finished, to have a further Budget.  I would say to the Taoiseach&mdash;and it is something which will come up again&mdash;the amount of money he is attempting to get now on the increased taxes is not required and they are deliberately building up for a surplus next April or May to give another easy Budget before a general election.</P>
      <P>This seems to be the system which Fianna Fáil have.  This is their financial system and this is how they are going to run the country.  In between all those Budgets we have Supplementary Estimates.  It is fair to say until a few years ago every Government of this country budgeted for 12 months. Whether the amount of money required was produced or not produced, the next Budget corrected whatever happened. We then had a change where a second Budget was introduced.  Now we have a system which has become common with Fianna Fáil of introducing Supplementary Budgets all over the place and the result is the Budget in the Spring gives no indication of what the situation will be at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a trade union official.  It is my job to try to negotiate wages for my members.  How can I or anybody else know what is going to happen if we negotiate wages on the taxes announced in the Spring and on the cost of living and find out in November everything we got for them is being taken back <Col N="2469" /> again?  Does it not tempt them to say to me and to the other people like me &ldquo;We are back where we started.  We must get more money&rdquo;?  Are they not finishing up with their last position worst than their first?  While this means we will have to go for more money almost immediately what about the minor employees of the State who got nothing at all, despite promises made by the Minister for Finance and his officials and by the Taoiseach in this House?  Are they going to say &ldquo;Keep it all until we negotiate a reasonable amount,&rdquo; or are they to be handed an increase which everybody else got last April?  The State should be ashamed of itself for the way it is treating minor employees like labourers&mdash;the men who work shovels and machines and do the menial and hard work for the State. They get nothing.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough for those able to negotiate for an increase.  What about unfortunate people on social welfare benefits or on fixed incomes?  They do not know, from year to year or from month to month, whether or not the money they have budgeted to carry on their housekeeping is going to be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, acting as Minister for Finance, should have introduced along with the supplementary Budget a supplementary allowance for social welfare beneficiaries. I am sure he realises that the unfortunate people who are depending on the State for their existence and livelihood would require something. They were not considered.  There was not a word about them.  Some of them are getting a few shillings increase in January and they will have to wait until May to see what God will send them.  I think the Government over the past number of years have been getting worse.  We have heard talk during the referendum campaign and in this House about Taca and Tacateers. Is it not true that the ordinary rank and file Fianna Fáil supporter <Col N="2470" /> throughout the country is now realising that what he says no longer matters, if it ever did, and that the only people that matter are the people who are able to put money in large doses into the pockets of the Fianna Fáil exchequer so that they can run the expensive campaigns which have been run, particularly in the past couple of months.  Mind you, if the Taoiseach is not aware of this, the members of his Party who are in touch with the grassroots of his organisation will remind him of it very shortly.</P>
      <P>I would say that this system of the church-gate collection, whereby they give the impression that some poor devil, who is giving 2/6d to Fianna Fáil, which he cannot afford, is running the Party, is becoming known for what it is.  A lot of them now realise that that is only a blind for the purpose of trying to keep them in association with the Party.  The Taoiseach will find that there will be a lot fewer 2/6d. pieces and, what is more important to Fianna Fáil, a lot fewer votes the next time he faces the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the Vote of Confidence or the Vote of No Confidence in the Government should have been debated here for the past few days.  I felt, when the Taoiseach started, that in the course of the debate we would hear a clear elucidation of Government policy by Ministers who knew the situation and who were trying to explain where they stood. What had we?  We had Deputy Martin Corry coming in to tell us about agriculture. We had Deputy Desmond Foley coming in to tell us about what I do not know.  I am not sure he even knew himself.  We had Deputy Lionel Booth coming in to tell the Taoiseach that, whatever he did he should not be too hard on the motor industry.  In the finish up, we had the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries protesting that we were taking away his time, that we did not allow him to take overtime which rightfully belonged to Deputy Patrick Tierney of the Labour Party.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries came in and succeeded in getting that time.  He forgot that, earlier on, the Deputies I mentioned would have been only too delighted to <Col N="2471" /> step down and let the Minister make the speech in their place and tell the Dáil and the country about the actions of the Government and what the Government propose to do.</P>
    <P>The whole situation here has been, I would suggest, bedevilled by the failure of the Fianna Fáil Party to keep in touch with the ordinary people of the country.  I think Fianna Fáil themselves realise that they are out of touch.  But, as I said earlier, they hope, by hanging on, that something will turn up which will succeed in getting them back into favour again.  Personally, I cannot see it.  They have only until the Spring of 1970.  If they hold on until the last minute, they have to go at that time.  If they had succeeded in winning the referenda, it is quite possible that they would have got away with something big, but they did not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, is now trying to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; at the constituencies.  He said today, and he is bemoaning the fact, that he has to tear the constituencies as under: to do all the terrible things he has to do.</P>

The very idea is ridiculous that the people of this House, who take an interest in the passing of legislation, will let him bulldoze through here a Bill such as he suggests, in a couple of months, and allow him to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; at the country and to attempt, with gerrymandered constituencies, to win back government of this country.  He will very soon find that he is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach knows that I have the very highest respect for him as a person.  However, I think it was rather ridiculous to hear the report of his complaint to Mr. Wilson, the British Premier, about gerrymandering in the North when his own Minister here was attempting to carry out almost the same gerrymandering, right under his nose, and he did not appear <Col N="2472" /> to know it.  We cannot possibly ever hope to get anybody within this country to believe that the Government are serious about anything if we continue to do what Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, said he was going to do.  If, for the simple purpose of trying to win one extra seat for Fianna Fáil, we try to take portions of counties and put them with other counties with which they have no connection at all and to say that this is the way it should be done then the Taoiseach is a lesser man than I had thought him to be</P>

My time, today, is nearly up but, before I conclude, I want to put two questions to the Taoiseach to which I hope he will reply when he is closing the debate. When the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was made some years ago, this Party objected to it for a number of reasons.  I do not propose to go into them now.  The then Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries guaranteed to this House, as did the Government, that, in its first year of operation, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement would give an extra £10 million to our agricultural industry. Now, when the Taoiseach is concluding this debate, would he say if that £10 million has been made or, if it has not been made, how far short of it have we fallen?  Finally, would the Taoiseach, when he is concluding this debate, tell the House and the country when he proposes to move the writ for the Wexford by-election so that we can test whether the people of Wexford &mdash;a cross-section of the people of this country&mdash;have as much confidence in himself and his Party as he would seem to have in asking this House to give him this evening a vote of confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of the recent referendum campaign we indicated that, at the conclusion of the vote, if the people rejected what we regarded as the audacious proposal of the Government, we would table a motion of no confidence in the Government here in this House.  Accordingly, on 17th October the Fine Gael motion of no confidence was tabled; on 30th October the Labour Party tabled their motion; and on 1st November the Government motion was tabled.  In other words, for a fortnight this Government, in disarray, was trying to puzzle out how best to face up to the Dáil in the aftermath of one of the most crushing defeats that any Government has ever received in a Parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate takes place at the end of the fourth year of this Dáil.  It takes place at a time when an election is almost on the cards.  It is worth recalling <Col N="2475" /> to Deputies how this House was elected in the last general election. Deputies will remember that election held in March, 1965, an election which the present Fianna Fáil Party fought on certain specific lines of propaganda.</P>
    <P>First of all, they said to the people that they were the only political Party capable of forming a government in this country, and their propaganda was along these lines: &ldquo;Well, you might not like us.  You might have things against us, but we are indispensable.&rdquo; That line of propaganda, no doubt, carried some weight with people who were led to believe that the attainment of an overall majority in this House gave added wisdom to Government Ministers and sense to a policy that otherwise might lack it.</P>
    <P>Their second line of propaganda was that they could guarantee that their re-election to office would mean for the ordinary people a continuance of success and prosperity.  If Deputies have forgotten, I should like to remind them of the Fianna Fáil posters in the general election of four years ago: &ldquo;Stay with success&rdquo;: &ldquo;Back prosperity&rdquo;.  These posters were designed to get people to believe that success and material advancement for the worker, for the farmer, for the businessman, was in some way associated with the re-election to office of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Their third line of propaganda&mdash;let us not forget it; Fianna Fáil Deputies may wish to forget it&mdash;was that their Leader, Deputy Seán Lemass, was essential to the future prosperity of the country, to its better Government, and to its survival as a nation.  And need I remind Deputies of the poster: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the way in which the last general election was fought: a political party, a lot of puny little men gathering themselves around a man whom they had described in heroic terms, a man who, they suggested, had gifts of leadership, a wealth of imagination and a dynamic approach which was going to guarantee a flow of prosperity and money and the welfare of the ordinary people.  The result was that they got into office.  They did not get an overall majority but they got enough to get <Col N="2476" /> them back into Government, and so this Dáil came into being.  What happened? Lest it be forgotten, let it be stated now in the dying weeks of this Dáil that the people who voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election, who sent them back over there, and who waited patiently for a continuance of the success and of the prosperity they were promised, found very quickly that there was no prosperity, that there was no success, that, in fact, the election had been held in circumstances of heady, frothy inflation, that the prosperity was phoney, that the success was synthetic.</P>
    <P>They found very quickly that a confidence trick had been played upon them and that this heroic leader, this man who asserted to himself an indispensability to the welfare of this country, had called that election when he saw the black clouds of the economic difficulties beginning to gather. He got the people to vote while the sun was shining, knowing well that very shortly the black clouds were going to wipe out the sun, and that the position was that he had been leading this country on a drunken binge and sooner or later, not he, but the ordinary poor people of the country would have to pay the bill.</P>
    <P>The prosperity disappeared.  The success was not there, and the bills of the inflation had to be paid.  The Taoiseach was then Minister for Finance and he had to come in here, as was his duty as Minister for Finance, with a large bill, the costs of this dissipation of the previous two years, a bill which had to be paid by the ordinary working people.  It was paid for in growing unemployment.  It was paid for in long queues at the labour exchanges.  It was paid for by every young boy and girl who had to swell the groups getting on the boats and the ships to emigrate and to work elsewhere.  It was paid for by every shopkeeper and businessman who found his little shop or his little business dampened down by the new financial strictures introduced by the Government.  It was paid for by thousands and thousands of small people, by pensioners and people of limited incomes who were told they <Col N="2477" /> must bear the burden of a new period of deflation.</P>
    <P>Following that, this Government, that had scrambled into office by this huge confidence trick, was trying to clear up the economic mess they had created.  They turned their backs on the great social problems of our time, on the need in our community for a reform in our social services, for a new approach to our health problems.  They turned their backs on these and on the great need for housing and on many of the endemic social problems affecting our people.  These had to be abandoned and at the end of it all, the heroic figure, the man who asserted he was indispensable to the future of the country, the man whose dynamism was to solve all the problems of our time, the man who had the effrontery to ask the Irish people to let him lead on, left and instead of a hero there was a mouse.  In his place what happened?</P>
    <P>The present Leader of Fianna Fáil came into office and he said himself, when he was elected, that he was a <i>via media</i>, that is, the chairman of a meeting where your only duty is to keep the house.  That is the <i>via media</i>, and during the past two years the country has been led by Deputy Lynch, as Taoiseach, in place of Deputy Seán Lemass.  Where are we two years later?</P>
    <P>He is controlling a team that have the bits in their teeth and he is desperately trying to hold the reins of runaway horses.  He has a number of men on that team who should shame any decent leader of any decent government. What is he doing about them? The people told him quite definitely and clearly to get rid of Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland.  Is he doing it, or are we to have a continuance of this kind of Government with little pocket dictators running around as if in some way they were masters of the Irish people?  In this vote by the Irish people on the 16th October, a clear demand was made that if this Government are to seek to continue in office they should be altered drastically from top to bottom&mdash;that new men should be introduced if Fianna Fáil are to remain in office for the expiration of their term.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach strong enough to do <Col N="2478" /> it?  Certainly if he is not the people will get another Taoiseach and another Government as quickly as possible. During two wasted, miserable years the people have had to worry through 1966 and the best part of 1967 paying for the bills of the incompetence of Deputy Lemass's regime, paying for the profligate spending, the dissipation of the resources of this country, in 1964 and the early part of 1965.  They had to pay for it in unemployment, in want and in hardship, and it was only this year that people felt we were at last beginning to get back to some kind of reasonable circumstances in which employment, one might hope, might expand, in which housing, one might hope, would get attention, in which emigration might begin to curtail itself and in which the country might advance again.</P>
    <P>But what happened?  In April of this year the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government introduced his Budget&mdash;a Budget which it now transpires was a phoney exercise in political playacting.</P>

      <P>The Government that permitted that to be done, that paraded under false pretences in April merely because they were having a test on the referendum and merely because they were hoping to gain an election victory from that vote confronted the country with a Budget containing no provisions for an increase in the remuneration of the public service that was already taking place at the time.  It contained no provision for payment in respect of the wheat harvest though everyone knew more and more wheat was being sown in this particular year and everyone knew we were likely to have a considerable harvest of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It contained no provision in relation to the considerable expansion in milk production that was taking place and which everybody knew was taking place.  The result was that the Budget this year&mdash;the Minister for Finance must have known it and every Member of the Government must have known it&mdash;was a Budget that was deliberately <Col N="2479" /> designed to raise at least £15 million less than the required amount.</P>
    <P>So we now have had this autumn Budget.  One can understand that at any stage in the best regulated governments a completely unexpected contingency may arise which could not have been foreseen but there was not one Member of this Government who could not have foreseen the extra cost in the public service, the need for a wheat subsidy and the added subsidy requirements in relation to milk.</P>
    <P>This autumn Budget is not some slight modification or some slight adjustment in the country's finances.  It is a Budget that imposes taxation&mdash; Deputies should remember this&mdash;which is between three and four times the amount of the taxation imposed in the Budget of April.  Did anyone ever see such a bizarre situation?</P>

      <P>This mini-Budget, this autumn Budget, imposes taxation three or four times that exacted in the Budget of April.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that one can suspect the April Budget was designed to achieve a political advantage for the Government.  It was introduced by a government that are supposed to be responsible, with their tongues in their cheeks.  It was introduced in the knowledge that it was telling a false story, introduced in the hope that it would snatch a false victory.  I do not believe that kind of exercise in political expediency will achieve any advantage in the long run.  I want to go further and here and now give voice to another suspicion.  I want to assert that this Budget is designed to raise in taxation more money than is required in relation to known and contemplated commitments in the next 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that existing commitments in the Budget are likely to be about £27 million.  He is raising now in these taxes, carried over 12 months, an extra £15½ million.  Buoyancy in existing <Col N="2480" /> taxation is certainly running at the rate of £20 million and a simple addition of £20 million and £15½ gives £35½ million to pay debts that do not exceed £27 million.  If it transpires that this is another bit of political action, another exercise in political expediency, merely to provide circumstances for an apparently good Budget next year&mdash; which, in fact, would be another phoney Budget&mdash;then I have no doubt the people will react in a very significant way.</P>
      <P>The fact is that by reason of what has been done after two years of Lynch leadership, we are back where we were in 1965.  We are back at the beginning of another cycle of stop-go economics.</P>
      <P>After the deflation of 1965 and the consequences of it, when the economy is beginning to move forward again, there is the sign &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  This time it is &ldquo;stop&rdquo; with an imposition of taxation which is very severe indeed, taxation which can only have the effect of substantially increasing living costs and industrial costs, which can only have the effect of damping down economic and business activity, leading to a very grave and widespread recession in trade.  Why has it been done?  I do not believe the fiscal situation should have required it.  If it did, it could have been met some months ago without the consequences now entailed. I do not believe the balance of payments situation requires the doing of what has been done.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said on Tuesday that there was a need to absorb excess purchasing power.  That may be so.  You do not do it by regressive taxation because regressive taxation leads inevitably to a damping down of industrial, business and economic activity. It leads to a spiral of living costs and it leads inevitably to a costing of our exports out of markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach, if that is the problem, not endeavour to use a monetary policy?  Why did he not exercise some restraint in credit?  It could be done temporarily.  It could be done easily and it could be done without harming the lives and the fortunes of small people.  He has not done that.  He has decided not to do it.  Instead, he <Col N="2481" /> has decided to proceed with a volume of taxation which, in my view, will turn out to be excessive and wrong.</P>
    <P>What is the cause of the economic difficulties I have mentioned?  Number one, because we have an incompetent government in office, a government that has failed to control even their own expenditure.  Are Deputies aware that current government expenditure in the first six months of this financial year is 18 per cent higher than the year before and that the Government themselves are spending now three-and-a-half times the growth in real national output.  That is one cause for the present economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The second one is that this Government have failed consistently to do anything whatsoever about the achievement of an incomes policy.  An incomes policy is part of the Fine Gael Policy Towards a Just Society.  It was raised and has been the subject of debate in this House 12 or 18 months ago.  There is not one who does not recognise the difficulties towards its attainment.  It can be a very difficult and uphill task and one that calls for a great measure of understanding among all sections in our community, not merely those who work and are employed and earning wages but among management and everybody associated with every facet of industry and economic activity.</P>
    <P>Though an incomes policy is the only means by which a small country like ours can continue to be a viable unit in a highly competitive world, if we do not keep our costings real and significant, if we cannot plan our industrial activity and our drive in the export markets without getting into a situation that planning when it reaches its production stage is destroyed by rising costs, then we cannot survive. An incomes policy is essential towards that end.  It is difficult and it is a formidable undertaking.  This Government have done nothing whatsoever in the last few years to achieve such a policy, nothing at all.  They have allowed a situation to develop in which bodies which are, or should be, under their control in fact are the very first to rock the boat and cause economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>I think the third reason for our present <Col N="2482" /> difficulties has been again the dereliction by Government Ministers of their responsibilities in the last 12 months in relation to the use of credit. I would have thought that anyone who had to live through the inflationary outburst of 1964 and early 1965, when people were able to go into their bank manager and, wishing to speculate on the stock exchange, were able to get an advance for the purpose of speculation, a situation in which the available national credit of this country was dissipated widespread on purposes and on objectives which certainly were not going to help the country, should have understood.</P>
    <P>Everyone should have been aware of that and the Taoiseach in particular should have been so aware because he was a member of the Government, and certainly as Minister for Finance he should have tried to rectify the situation which developed.  Here we are now 12 months or two years later and precisely the same situation has been allowed to recur.  Domestic credit in the past 12 months has expanded by 21 per cent, and again this credit is being used and devoted to purposes which are speculative in nature and which are not productive in their objectives. That means that we have now a Government in office that apparently lacks, collectively or individually, ability. That is a human failing but a government which has failed to learn by experience and a government which as a result has allowed a similar situation to repeat itself is incompetent.</P>
    <P>This is not only incompetence but it is highly dangerous to the future welfare of this country.  I have little doubt that there would be a sigh of relief from Cork to Donegal, from the east across to the western coast of this country, if the Taoiseach stood up and said: &ldquo;I am going to resign.&rdquo; The people would be delighted, not in a vengeful way, because our people are not vengeful or spiteful, but because they see today that we have a government that are just not fit for the job, and the time has come to change that government and to get into office a team that can measure up to what is required.</P>
    <P>May I repeat&mdash;not fit for the job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2483" /> During the referendum campaign&mdash;and I want Fianna Fáil Deputies to listen to this&mdash;the Minister for Finance in advocating a Fianna Fáil proposal said that there would have to be a change, that this Dáil was no more than a debating society, that the Deputies in it were not fit for the purpose of legislating and that the time had come to get better Deputies.  Well, I know the Deputies he knew best, and they certainly are not on this side of the House. He went on to say that in this Dáil it was impossible under our system of proportional representation to introduce the great schemes of social reform which are so urgently necessary.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach: is that the explanation we are going to be offered for the failure of this Government to do anything worthwhile in relation to the solution of the social problems of our people.  If they cannot do it in this Dáil, elected as it is, if that is their feeling, let them make way for those who will do it and do it very quickly.</P>
    <P>Now we have, as a result of the madness of the Government, come to the end of a wasted year.  Here, in the eleventh month of 1968, we in this House end a year which began with a barren, fruitless controversy with regard to our voting system and for the last ten months members of this Government instead of doing their jobs, instead of doing the things that the people expected them to do, instead of devoting their time and energy towards solving some of the problems of our people, spent all their time conniving and manoeuvring among their own backbenchers and elsewhere, collecting money and spending it in order to rig the electoral system and to abolish proportional representation.</P>

It has demonstrated, however, that with the vast expenditure <Col N="2484" /> of money Fianna Fáil indulged in &mdash;I do not know what it is going to cost them, I am told something of the order of £100,000, a vast expenditure of money in any event, in all forms of propaganda and all the rest of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Stone, stark, raving mad.  Everybody knew that those proposals would not be accepted, except Fianna Fáil and the Fianna Fáil Ministers.  They were so smug, so far removed from the people, so much above even their own backroom Deputies, so possessed of instant knowledge and immediate wisdom on everything, they knew all the answers. People now know the score.  A government that could be so utterly irresponsible in relation to their own political affairs, how can we long continue to trust them as being responsible for the affairs of all of us?</P>
      <P>I appreciate that that has been the result of a breakdown in communications between Ministers and those who put them there, but it is symptomatic of what is happening in this country today.  There is a breakdown of communications between authority and the people.  It happens in every walk of life, in every facet of activity.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not in communication with the farmers, with the agricultural industry. That can be repeated in relation to every Minister's office.  It is the result of Ministers being in office too long. Deputy Dillon would perhaps sympathise with this point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have served as a Minister and I know what takes place from half-past nine or ten o'clock in the morning until five o'clock in the evening.  I know how many sycophants come in and say: &ldquo;Oh, Minister you are so <Col N="2485" /> right; Oh, Minister, what you say is so wise; Oh, Minister, you put this in such an original way.&rdquo; You might not believe it for the first week or the first month but, after six months or 12 months, you begin to think that perhaps you are something special and significant and unique; and if you are there, not for 12 months or two years or three years or five years or seven years but for 11 years well, of course, is it any wonder that they are all stark, raving mad, thinking that they know everything and not bothering about listening to anybody else?</P>
    <P>We, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on this side of the House, the Deputies sitting on your right, now have to face up to our responsibilities.  I want to say with humility and sincerity that I believe much more is now required of us than ever before.  We have a responsibility clearly thrust upon us now to develop our policies, to seek for solutions, to project attention towards public service, to give to this country as quickly as possible the kind of alternative Government that it demands and wishes&mdash;a government that will be a government of integrity; a government that will apply consistently high standards in high places.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate inevitably ranged over a fairly wide number of topics, including the recent Budget.  In fact, I was hoping that it would be possible to have both debates together but, in deference to the request of the Opposition, they have been separated.  Nevertheless, both the confidence motion and the Budget debate seem to have been part and parcel of <Col N="2486" /> this debate since last Tuesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The case put forward by Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Corish and their colleagues who have spoken in this debate rests entirely on the proposition that the results of the referendum show that the Government have lost the confidence of the people.  They have not attempted in any way to challenge the policies of the Government on any serious ground because they know they cannot, because they know that they have not been able themselves to put a single line of policy in any field as an alternative to the policy of the Government.  Much of Deputy Cosgrave's contribution in the opening part of his speech was most uncharacteristic of him and of the reasonably serious kind of approach he normally brings to bear on the debates in this national Parliament.  I think the people of the country generally and the Dáil are entitled to expect more from the Leader of the Opposition than the kind of ridicule to which he resorted here last Tuesday.  The technique that Deputy Cosgrave employed was mainly an attempt to ridicule the Minister for External Affairs.  The Minister for External Affairs needs no defence from me or from anybody else.  His record as a soldier and as a statesman can proudly stand on its own.  Nobody in Fine Gael or anywhere else can take the credit from him which is rightly his and which he has won for his outstanding work in the field of foreign affairs and particularly for his work in the United Nations.  Even though that has been scorned by Fine Gael and the Labour Party it has been publically acclaimed and recognised all over the world.  If it is Deputy Cosgrave's opinion that the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in the formulation of which Deputy Frank Aiken played a very outstanding part, was a trivial and wasteful exercise he will find, I think, that this opinion is not shared by any statesman of any standing in any part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave this field I want to refer to statements which were made here and outside about my visit to London last week.  I want to ask, some Members of the Labour Party <Col N="2487" /> particularly&mdash;they are not here now; Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Corish&mdash; if they believe or advocate that in the context of what I had to say in London last week I should not have mentioned Partition?  If I had not mentioned Partition and had come back here answering Parliamentary questions and said I had not done so, I should like to know what would be the attitude of those who now criticise me for having done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell on it but I want to say that in the contacts that my predecessor and I had with Captain O'Neill in the last three or four years there was never any suggestion or understanding that we, on our part, would abandon in any way our aim of a united Ireland.  It has been the aim of this Government, and of its predecessors, to promote the re-unification of our country by promoting and fostering a spirit of brotherhood, mutal understanding and goodwill among all sections of the Irish people.  I have not discussed, nor should I have done so, the details of the conversations I had with Mr. Wilson but I do not think he would regard it as any breach of confidence if I say that I expressed to him my conviction that Captain O'Neill was a reasonable and fairminded man.  I know Mr. Wilson will not object because I know Mr. Wilson agrees with me.  In fact, I said many months ago and again at the press interview in London last Monday, after meeting Mr. Wilson, that I thought Captain O'Neill was a fair and reasonable man.  That being so, I am convinced that he is anxious to ensure that all people within his jurisdiction will get a fair deal.  Therefore, I believe the <Col N="2488" /> spirit of brotherhood to which I have referred can eventually prevail not only in the northern part of the country but throughout the whole country and that this could lead to a new approach to the solution of the main political problem.</P>
      <P>Mr. McAteer in the course of his speech yesterday&mdash;and I believe in a radio interview today he expanded on it even though I did not hear him&mdash; referred to the possibility of this new approach and particularly to the possibility of separate Parliaments, North and South, in a united Ireland.  This is an aim to which I think we would very gladly subscribe but, nevertheless, it is not a completely new proposition.  As most Deputies know, it was mentioned in the course of the Treaty negotiations or rather, it was put forward on behalf of Dáil-Éireann prior to the Treaty negotiations of 1921 and repeated on many occasions since.  It was in these terms: that, subject to safeguards, the confirmation of the position of the Northern Ireland Legislature with its existing powers in an All-Ireland constitution for as long as the people of the north eastern counties might desire it, was something that we, in this part of the country, would accept.</P>
      <P>I introduce this only because I want to indicate that much loose talk and loose expressions have been used about what I said or did in London last week.  Before I go to the main part of the debate I should like to refer to some aspects of the debate that, I suggest, were more appropriate to the debate we shall have next week on the Budget but, lest the absence of reference by me might be taken as acquiescence in the points of view put forward, it is only right that I should refer to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said here last Tuesday that the Government while attempting to control prices was itself raising prices through new taxes and post office charges and that there was no control of the Government's costs. Deputy O'Higgins repeated that charge here today.  I am sure both Deputies must know why the cost of Government is rising.  They must know that it is due to improvements in social welfare and education, improvements in <Col N="2489" /> the subsidies required to raise farmers' incomes and to the effect on the Government as an employer and because of the pay increases that have been generally secured this year.  The Deputies opposite did not consider it politic to say that these improvements in social welfare or education should not have taken place or that farmers' incomes should not have been supported, as has been done, or that wage and salary increases generally should be controlled and limited to a lower percentage increase.  Perhaps that is sufficient to say about this line of argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish went on to refer to our external reserves.  I referred to the matter briefly in my reply to the first part of the Budget debate.  The Deputy referred to these external reserves and generally he appeared to think that all these reserves were invested in Britain. That is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that about 50 per cent are invested in non-sterling reserves.  The Deputy said that these reserves should be invested so as to employ Irish workers at home.  Let us examine that proposition and what its ultimate effects might be.  He asked the Government to decide whether it wants to maintain employment or not. As between maintaining employment and maintaining these reserves the difference is not as sharp as he seems to suggest.  There is no intention on the Government's part deliberately to create unemployment.  On the contrary, the aims of the present policy are to preserve a national growth rate of over four per cent per annum, as is happening now, and, in this way, to continue and insure and safeguard the rise in industrial employment.  Any serious loss of external reserves would react drastically on investment, on production and on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I thought the Deputy might be genuinely in doubt about what level of external reserves it is desirable and necessary to maintain. However, I do not think he should be in any doubt about the absolute necessity to maintain a substantial amount of reserves.  We should have <Col N="2490" /> enough foreign money to draw on to meet large and unforeseen deficits in external payments and these can arise sometimes through circumstances outside our control and, of course, sometimes within our control.</P>

      <P>These reserves are also required to meet unforeseen deficits of our own country.  I do not think the Deputy can be in any doubt that if we were to run down our external reserves to boost employment the stimulus that this would give would be very temporary indeed.  If our reserves were seen to be dropping by £20 million or £30 million a year and the Government took no action, not only Irish investors but foreign investors would soon cease to invest in our country or cease to create the extra stimulus to employment that this kind of investment gives.  If a crisis in these circumstances occurred the question would be asked as to why the Government had not taken action at the right time.  Certainly, that would not solve the kind of problem which arises here now.</P>

      <P>I cannot continue this reply on the basis of question and answer.  However, because of the lack of confidence that such a policy would create, not only would our capital inflow dry up, and that is important, but I think it has been indicated in past years that there would be a steady decline <Col N="2491" /> in the kind of money that we would require to maintain employment and production in the future.  During the years we have had reductions in our external reserves and I need only mention the years and the amounts to give an indication of the trend: 1951, £61.6 million; 1955, £35.5 million; 1964, £31.4 million; 1965, £41.8 million.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will remember the trouble in his own time as a Minister when these reserves began to be run down and when the balance of payments were going awry and the consequences that followed.  As I said, our situation would become all the worse because the capital inflow which now protects these reserves would dry up and what I am saying, in effect, is that the reserves would not only have an important financial impact on our economy but a psychological impact as well.</P>
      <P>By maintaining these at a reasonably high level we are encouraging confidence in our country and this, in itself, encourages the flow of funds from home and abroad and investment in Ireland will, therefore, create higher employment, a higher standard of living and an improvement in the economy generally.  These reserves also provide us with a fund to be drawn on when unforeseen crisis arise in our external trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish's arguments have appeared in one form or another in newspaper comments and in leading articles, some by economists.  We are being accused of putting the brake on too severely when we should have accelerated.  I think, that spending one's way out of a depression is certainly an acceptable type of remedy but no one can regard the kind of advice to spend one's way out of inflation as being a responsible type of advice. It is easy for those who are not in positions of responsibility to adopt courageous attitudes and to suggest that we should throw caution to the wind but the very same economists or, at least, the vocal groups who adopt such attitudes, would be happy in their criticism of the Government if a continuation of the present trend resulted in a crisis in 1969.  They would <Col N="2492" /> lacerate the Government for not recognising the signs when they first appeared and for not taking moderate action to prevent a calamity.  The Government would be accused of doing too much too late.  We have heard all these arguments before.</P>
    <P>As to whether we are doing too much now it is our belief that we are not.  We do not anticipate that the measures will cause any economic setback or depression.  We expect growth in the economy to be at least four per cent in 1969.  I think that is a reasonably good average and I believe we are far from the kind of disastrous stagnation to which Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has referred when one compares it, in particular, with the kind of stagnation that his government permitted in this country ten or 11 years ago.</P>

      <P>I expect it will.  A few minutes ago Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said that we were trying to create a surplus Budget situation. I am surprised that he should make the unwise comment that we provided for certain increases in expenditure by way of this new taxation so as to avoid taxation in any coming Budget and he used figures, which I only used by way of illustration, to bolster up his case.  He said that the amount I foresaw in extra expenditure in 1969 was about £27 million and that this would be covered by the increases we are getting with the new taxation.  The fact is, that the £27 million I referred to was only used by way of illustration.  In fact, the increased expenditure which we are likely to face this year is much greater than the £27 million he referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said&mdash;and I think this is again something that he had heard other people saying&mdash;that we should have anticipated these increases and, therefore, should have provided for them in the Budget of last Spring. I might say in reference to that that the principal internal development <Col N="2493" /> which has necessitated corrective action is, in fact, the size of the 11th round wage increase.  The suggestion is that we should have anticipated this.  The 11th round wage increase had not started, or, at least, had not started to give an indication of what size it would be, when the Budget was introduced.</P>

      <P>I said it had not started to the extent as to give an indication of the size and I want to say that it is usually the case that outside employment leads.  While the Government make their own arrangements with their employees, whether the Civil Service, the Post Office or the Garda, they do not usually precede the rates won in free negotiation in outside employment, and if we had provided for a particular round sum in anticipation of its becoming due and of agreements having been reached, it would have been regarded as quite irresponsible to make budgetary provisions for increases on the scale eventually conceded.</P>

      <P>We have been blamed for not providing money in April to cover the cost of the milk subsidy and the cost of disposing of our surplus wheat production.  Almost every Deputy in the Front Bench of Fine Gael who spoke suggested that we should have been virtual weathercocks, <Col N="2494" /> that as far back as April we should have known exactly what kind of summer and autumn we were going to have this year.  If the Minister for Finance had come in here last Spring and had said on Budget day that he had imposed additional taxation that would be required because we were going to have a wonderful Summer and a wonderful Autumn that would boost milk production and wheat yields, I can imagine the kind of comment and criticism that would have come from the Deputies opposite. They would have asked how the Minister could know in April what kind of Summer and what kind of Autumn we were going to have; how would he know in what way this would boost milk and wheat production.  This, in itself, is dishonest criticism and the Deputies who have made it know it is dishonest.  Having said that&mdash;I will be dealing more and perhaps at greater length with these economic considerations next week&mdash;perhaps, now, I will come to the motion of confidence and the kind of arguments that we have heard, arguments that were bolstered up in order to try to establish that the referendum result meant that the Government should leave office.</P>
      <P>In the first place, Deputy Tully has threatened that the kind of legislation that is necessary before a general election can take place will not be given readily to the Minister for Local Government.  It is the bounden duty of the Minister for Local Government now, under the Constitution as it stands, after the rejection of the referendum proposal for a commission in amendment No. 4, to bring into the House these proposals for a change in the constituencies.</P>

      <P>It was inevitable, of course, that these rumours, which as Deputy Cosgrave said, in Christian charity he could not very well support, should be taken up by no less a person than Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan said on television or in the press some time ago that when he goes around his constituency he calls into the nuns and asks them or the children to say a prayer for him.  I had thought and hoped&mdash;in fact most of us on this side of the House had thought and hoped&mdash;that the nuns' prayers were being answered, because Deputy Flanagan has not been seen here very much in recent years and, when he has been, he has not resorted to these charges of corruption.  However, he came out in full blast on last Tuesday night and alleged not only corruption <Col N="2497" /> and dishonesty against some members of our Party but against every one of us who were all tarred with the same brush.  I am glad to be tarred with the same kind of brush or covered with the same kind of aroma as members of the Government and our Backbenchers because it is only on the basis of the integrity of this Party, on the basis of being honest with the people and only on that basis, that we have been able to resist these charges of corruption down through the years and we shall do it again.</P>

I am not making any secret of my disappointment at the results but I will say that I was glad the people on this occasion acted objectively on the issues and in a mature way; I was glad that they came out in such a high percentage poll which certainly gave an indication that they took the matter seriously, considered it objectively and decided for good or ill to retain the present system.  I have nothing but praise for the action of the people in this respect and the manner in which the electorate generally approached these issues.  I think it was a healthy and wholesome approach and now that the dust of battle and acrimony has settled it is well to make that comment.</P>

If they think that, they can think again.  Before the referendum I expressed the view, and I still hold it, that in the future it will be increasingly difficult for any single Party to get an overall majority under the present system of voting.  People either did not share that view with me or, if they did, they decided to take a chance on the continuation of the present system in the hope that it would, taking one election with another, produce a viable and effective Government.</P>

They will examine the Fine Gael policy &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo; which I said before and which I say again is nothing but a conglomeration of economic and social <i>desiderata.</i> Any young boy in the sixth class could write out that kind of programme saying what is desirable and what we would like to obtain in the social, education and employment fields&mdash;less taxation and more housing, without any regard to where the capital would come from and, as we saw and had evidence of in one of the by-elections, increased expenditure on education amounting to about £7 million without an resort to taxation. These are the kind of things the people will be asking about and on which they will judge the respective policies.  They will ask the Labour Party their policy.  They have not declared it fully.

      <P>Deputy Michael O'Higgins has made overtures to <Col N="2501" /> Deputy Corish about a coalition and, as far as I can understand Deputy Corish, he has repudiated him.  This marriage is not on.  Whether he will do it again or not I do not know.  Whether it is to be a coalition or a minority Fine Gael Government supported by Labour, the people will want to know what part of the Labour Party's programme, the ultra socialist programme, will be implemented, what part they will abandon or, to use a famous phrase, &ldquo;put into abeyance&rdquo; and what part of the socialist Labour programme will the Fine Gael Party adopt?  These are the questions the people are asking.</P>

      <P>I want to put this question.  It is, I think, worth considering. As Deputy Corish said, we are <Col N="2502" /> confident we will get a majority the next time, but we can never be prophets.  If we do not get a majority we know that we will be by far the largest single Party and, if by any chance, a combination of both Parties opposite could outvote us in the election for Taoiseach, then what would the pattern be?  We would put up a candidate and he would be beaten. Fine Gael would put up their candidate: at that stage would Labour vote for the Fine Gael candidate?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have six minutes. The usual charges are being made, apart from charges of corruption, that we are arrogant, and arrogant in particular towards the farming community. I want to repudiate these charges.  What possible advantage could it be to any government in a democracy to set out deliberately on a collision course with any sizeable section of the community, unless there was a principle involved, and the principle involved here is that, so long as we have authority from the people, we are entitled to, and are expected by the people, to exercise that authority and no group can wrest that authority from us?  Certainly, so long as I am Taoiseach, no group will.  I will endeavour to ensure that that authority will not be usurped in any way.  On the other hand, this Government has been and still is anxious to go a long way towards promoting <Col N="2503" /> harmony in all spheres of relationships between government and organisations within the community.  We are prepared to go a long way in order to establish permanently harmonious and fruitful relations with all organised farming groups.  As everybody knows, it takes two sides to make a quarrel.  It also takes two sides to make peace.  I say here and now, on behalf of the Government, that I am prepared to wipe the slate clean, if that will bring about a return to harmonious and fruitful relationships between Government and farmers, the relationships which should, I think, exist between Government and interests of this kind and which, in the interests of both sides, it is desirable to have.</P>

      <P>We regard ourselves in Government as the servants and not the masters of the people.  The power which the Government has is the power which the people, and only the people, give it.  It is for the people to decide in their wisdom at the appropriate time whether or not they will continue to give that power to Fianna Fáil and whether or not they will renew the mandate they gave Fianna Fáil to govern.  We confidently expect they will do so when the opportunity offers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a vote of confidence and, in a vote of confidence, one takes one side or the other.  As far as the record of Fianna Fáil is concerned, particularly the record since we assumed office again 11 years ago, it is a record which I am proud to defend.  Fine Gael must think the people's memories are very short when they pretend now that the two Coalitions in which they participated gave us a land flowing with milk and honey. What was the Coalition record?  What are the facts?  I gave them at the opening of this debate.  I do not propose to repeat them.  Deputy Corish asked us the other day to forget his <Col N="2504" /> term of office in the Coalition Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should not misquote me.  I said I will take responsibility for anything I said, or any decision I participated in, in those Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  That is the only basis on which we and the people can judge the effectiveness of the Parties opposite as against Fianna Fáil.  On that judgment I would be very happy to rest, knowing the sound sense of the people.  The Coalition record speaks for itself.  It is there for all to see.  By any test it is a miserable story of incompetence which brought this country to the verge of ruin.  Fianna Fáil lifted the country out of the slough of despond and despair.  Through its programmes of economic expansion, programmes much decried here by the Opposition, Fianna Fáil raised again the spirit and the courage and the confidence of the people and achieved a high measure of economic prosperity. We do not begrudge the Opposition Parties whatever morsel of consolation they can draw from the results of the referendum.</P>

      <P>I can never understand the Deputy.  If he writes it down I will try to reply.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to these last two wasted years.  I wonder what does he regard as wasted years when the rate of progress in each of those years was eight and <Col N="2505" /> nine times as high as in the years when he himself was a member of a Government?</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I want to say in relation to references which have been made about my responsibilities as Head of the Government that it would have been an easy thing for me to lay about me after the referendum, and try to deny my responsibility for the referendum results by rolling a few heads around the Cabinet table.  If and when there are to be changes in the Government they will be of my own choosing.  I will not be stampeded into this either by Opposition jibes here or by writers outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2506" /> So also will be the timing of the next election.  The timing of the next election will also be of my choosing and I will, as any worthwhile politician would, choose the best time for it. When I do I am confident that the people will continue to maintain their confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
