      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to resume on 23rd October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach why 23rd October?  We had the impression that the date was 9th October.  This is quite a long Recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, as far as I remember, the Dáil resumed on 18th October and I would suggest an earlier resumption date if we are to get through all the business we are promised by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will get through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The original date as far as we were led to believe was 9th October.  Would it be reasonable to assume that the Government intend to have the referendum between the 9th and 23rd October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I answer some of the questions?  When the Whips were discussing some weeks ago a probable date for the Adjournment, I was asked by our own Whip when it was likely we would resume and I said I had not considered that yet.  He asked me if I <Col N="902" /> could convey to the Whips some date and I said some date between the 9th and 23rd October.  That is why 9th October was mentioned.</P>
      <P>This has been the usual practice in this House.  Last year I asked for a resumption at the end of September because a lot of Estimates we had hoped to get through before the Summer Recess had not been got through. We have done fairly well this year and have got through a large volume of the work and I do not think we will have very much difficulty in the next term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should take up the time from October to the Christmas Recess on the Estimates. I think our time could be usefully employed in the autumn otherwise than in discussing the Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Chair allow me to ask one question?  Is it not true that the date we got was 9th October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained how that date was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would have been common courtesy to let us know if 9th October was the date decided on.  We knew only of changes when Ministers mentioned 23rd October for the Second Reading of Bills. Could the Taoiseach tell us, so that the Members of the various Parties will be able to plan the holidays they can take, when he thinks the referendum is likely to take place?  Can he say will it be between 9th and 23rd October?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach give us that answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Whips were not told about 23rd October, I accept responsibility, but no discourtesy was intended.  As far as the date of the referendum is concerned, it will depend on the passage of the Bills through the Seanad and the signing of the order by the Minister for Local Government after the Bills have been passed.  It is hoped that the referendum will be completed by 23rd October.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise in regard to the matter just <Col N="904" /> raised by Deputy Dunne that the previous two speakers were speakers from the Fine Gael Party in this debate.  Deputy Dunne's attitude is the same form of inertia rather typical of the Labour Party which he represents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening we did not have any contribution from Deputy Dunne, but in due course, I have no doubt, we shall be hearing from him in his usual cliché style. However, coming back to the important matter of the debate &mdash; a review of the economic and social programme of Government activity in the past 12 months&mdash;the emphasis should be laid in a certain direction.  First of all, Fianna Fáil have proved that as a Government in the 1960s, as they did in the 30s, the 40s and the 50s, they are a Party of social progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first time Fianna Fáil were allowed to implement their policy was in 1932 and since then they have shown themselves to be a Party of social progress.  Now that Deputy Harte has interrupted me, it might be no harm to refer to a question which he put down recently in regard to the Vote for Education and to which Deputy Cosgrave referred yesterday.  The total Vote for Education in 1930-31 was £4½ million, in round figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  The total vote for Education&mdash;I gave the figure in reply to a question by Deputy Harte recently&mdash;was £4½ million in 1930-31.  The total Vote for Education in the current year is £54 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>But as a percentage, it is 50 per cent less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have raised the matter if I were not aware that Deputy Harte might make this brilliant point which he made in the course of supplementary questions. Deputy Harte sought then to make this point and Deputy Cosgrave sought to lay emphasis on it yesterday&mdash;the point that the Vote for Education then was a high percentage of the total net expenditure in that year.  The total net State expenditure in 1930-31, of which education occupied £4½ million, in round figures, was £20 million, again in round figures.  That is what the State was spending on the whole range of social and public welfare in 1930, the year in which the old age pension was cut, the year of recession and retrenchment, the year in which Cumann na nGaedheal withdrew from their responsibilities and decided to cut back in public expenditure in respect of the less well-off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Harte wants to indulge in flights of fantasy, he is welcome.  Meanwhile, I want to come back to the point on which emphasis was placed by Deputy Cosgrave yesterday and of which Deputy Harte tried to make play.  It is that in 1930-31, £4½ million was spent on education.  What we are spending this year is £54 million and Deputy Harte sought to make the point that this represented a percentage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 21.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte sought to make the point that it represented a higher percentage of the total net State expenditure in 1930-31 than the Vote for Education in the current year.  What I am trying to say is that the total net State expenditure was in the region of £20 million in 1930-31, a year in which there were practically no social welfare benefits of any kind, a year in which even the meagre social welfare benefits there were were cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total net expenditure last year came to £290 million odd.  Up to date there has been a jump from £20 million in 1930-31 to £290 million odd and this explains my whole point.  Since that period, since taking over the Government, Fianna <Col N="907" /> Fáil have consistently been responsible for social progress on all fronts, for progress in social welfare, for progress in health, for progress in education, for progress in regard to the relief of land congestion, for progress in regard to every conceivable development and Deputy Harte certainly had some temerity in coming into the House, and Deputy Cosgrave had some temerity in coming into the House, to lay emphasis on the most depressed year in our country's history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe, but we spent 50 per cent more on education than the amount being spent today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a year in which there was massive unemployment, a year in which there were no conditions of employment, a year in which social welfare benefits were cut, a year in which there was depression all over the land.  That is why, in 1932, the Irish people decided to put Fianna Fáil into Government to embark on a policy of social progress. This drew some comment from Deputies Cosgrave and Harte and I want to emphasise again&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1957 I propose to bring it up to 1968.  The figure <Col N="908" /> spent on education in the last year of the Coalition was £15 million.  The figure in the current year's Estimate is £54 million.  In other words, we have jumped State expenditure on education from £15 million in 1957 to £54 million in the current year, which, allowing for the fall in money values in the meantime, represents three times more. Of all topics, this is one that should be avoided by Labour and Fine Gael because if ever there were famine years in regard to Irish education policy, the famine years were during the last Coalition period of office, when there was a complete lack of thought, when there was a complete lack of investment, when there was a complete lack of policy in regard to the development of education in general.  Indeed, when Deputy Sweetman, as Minister for Finance, was applying the axe all around the place in various spheres of public administration in 1956 and early 1957, education suffered more than any other aspect of public administration.</P>

      <P>The Deputy used to be Trotsky but now he has gone respectable.  There was a time when he was not.  The cut of ten per cent in secondary school grants in 1957 is not the whole story in that at that stage you had no assistance whatever towards secondary school education in the form of reconstruction and construction of secondary schools.  What Fianna Fáil have done in the past two years is to introduce a comprehensive scheme of 100 per cent loan and grant assistance towards reconstruction and construction of secondary schools.  Now there is a scheme of 70 per cent grant and 30 per cent loan assistance towards secondary schools.  That was not in existence at all until the last two years.</P>
      <P>As I say, the meagre grants available to education in 1957 were then cut by the Fine Gael Minister for Education by ten per cent.  It is fair to say that those were famine years in regard to education in this country.  There was no thought, no policy, no thinking whatever on the importance of education as having a fundamental place in our social development.  Of course, there is one thing that can be said, that is, that there was one good idea which came from Fine Gael.  I am going to pay a compliment here to the Fine Gael displaced Leader, Deputy Dillon, in that he in this House, despite the actions of his various cohorts in the Party who co-operated to stir up trouble, consistently advocated a cause for the amalgamation of schools into larger school units so as to provide a wider range of teaching subjects in those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the broad curriculum in our primary schools will be the best way of educating and training our young children and that the abolition of the primary certificate, which we have now done, will ensure that there will be less pressure on concentrated and narrow subjects in the future and that we will have a broad range of subjects in our schools so as to give a broadly-based type of education to our boys and girls.  I deplore the Fine Gael running away from the admirably <Col N="911" /> progressive policy adumbrated by Deputy Dillon in years past.  They have gone away from that in the interest of hunting votes but that is not the way to achieve government in this country or any other country.</P>

      <P>There is one thing we will not do here, that is, engage in clichés.  I want to refer to figures I mentioned earlier on to show that there has been a planned policy in education since our return in 1957 and that this has taken place under successive Ministers for Education.  First of all, there was the Taoiseach himself, then Deputy Hillery, then Deputy Colley, then Deputy Donogh O'Malley and now I am here in this position.  There has been a planned, coherent policy on the part of Fianna Fáil since 1957 in education.  Our investment in education has jumped from £15 million to £54 million in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, as well as Deputy Harte earlier on made reference to the position in 1930 and 1931 but I wish to put certain other facts on the record which show that the total number of students attending primary schools in 1931-32 was less than 37,000 and that the figure for this year is over 160,000. In 1930-31 the population of institutions of higher education was less than <Col N="912" /> 5,000 and it now stands at about 18,000.  I want to see that go up to about 30,000 in the next ten years.</P>

This was ignored by Fine Gael in their policy document before the last general election.

Deputy Sweetman, now opposite, again a potential member of some sort of opportunistic Government in the future, was Minister for Finance in that Government.  Deputy Corish's sole contribution towards socialism between 1954 and 1957 was one halfcrown for all our social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>During the past three years our contribution was 22s 6d. <Col N="915" /> These are the sorts of basic facts which show what was the Party of social progress. I mentioned the figures in regard to education already.  These figures in regard to social welfare bear out what I am saying.  As regards the present point of time, prior to last year the annual increase in numbers attending post-primary schools averaged about 5,600.  This was the average increase until last year.  The numbers last year increased by over 18,000.  So, with the jump from 5,600 to 18,000 in the numbers attending post-primary establishments, it is no harm to reiterate that this was Fianna Fáil policy and Fianna Fáil in action as a Party of social progress.  It is no harm to emphasise that this was made possible because we initiated last September free post-primary education and initiated free transport of boys and girls in rural areas towards post-primary education in their local centres.  This was done at some cost and as a result of Government decision based on a rational assessment of the cost involved and on a Government commitment towards investment in education as the most important field of investment as far as social progress in future is concerned. This was based on a planned policy of improvement in education by Fianna Fáil over the past 11 years under successive Fianna Fáil Minister for Education.  This is an example of a Party of social progress in action.  This is socialism in practice.  This is the just society in practice and not just in talk.</P>

      <P>In this respect, the new Higher Education Grants Bill, which has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas, is a significant step forward in this direction.  Again, coming back to practical socialism and practical facts, last year, the local authorities were able to provide 275 scholarships in the field of university or higher education.  This year, the figure we hope to achieve is 1,000.  We have a jump from 275 to 1,000 boys and girls participating in higher education, so that we have 725 extra boys and girls who heretofore, by reason of their economic circumstances, would not be in a position to participate in higher education who will be enabled to do it in the coming months.  I am not satisfied, and the Government are not <Col N="917" /> satisfied, with that figure.  I regard the Bill which will be law inside the next few days as the first step forward in this direction.  We want to do far more so as to ensure that there is complete equality of opportunity for all our boys and girls.</P>
      <P>I would regard the most fundamental social principle in 1968 as equality of opportunity and this is basic socialism and this is the basic thought which every civilised country today recognises as important, that every boy and girl in the community will get an equal chance to make his or her place in the world, that the community as a whole, apart from the people concerned, can only benefit if talents are maximised to the greatest extent in this manner.  The way to achieve this is to provide a ladder of attainment to all levels of education, and the way to do that is to ensure that the boys and girls who heretofore could not do so by reason of economic circumstances can get into higher education, no matter what the circumstances of their families.</P>
      <P>We have in the Higher Education Grants Bill, shortly to become a statute, a flexible statutory framework within which we can increase that figure of 1,000 in the years ahead. There is ample power given to future Ministers for Education, and indeed if Deputy Dunne happens to occupy the seat, he can wield this legislative measure with the required degree of flexibility to ensure that socialism is put into practice rather than all this talk of socialism from the Opposition.</P>

      <P>As I say, in the coming 12 months we will bring the figure of student-grant holders up to 1,000.  There will be a legislative framework which any succeeding Minister for Education can expand by way of relaxation of means tests or new standards equated to the needs of the community or by an extension of the spheres of higher education to which the Act will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the whole essence of our thinking at present.  We cannot look at <Col N="918" /> education as a compartment in any particular sphere.  Primary, post-primary and higher education are all parts of the unit.  There must be a flow from one to the other, accompanied by the most expert advice for pupils in regard to career guidance and how they can be trained and adapted for the community into which they are moving.  For this reason we at present have 60 teachers on a crash course in career guidance.  We hope to double that figure next year so as to ensure that in all the large centres of post-primary education, we will have teachers available trained in career guidance who will be able to advise boys and girls along the right lines and to direct them towards where their talents should lead them.  We will also have in operation in the coming year eight trained psychologists who will be travelling psychologists linking up with the career guidance teachers and able to give further more specialist advice.</P>

      <P>Any analysis of the situation will show that the Labour Party are more conservative than the Fine Gael Party.  They showed themselves as such during the previous Coalitions when they merged themselves with and lost their identity to the conservative Party.  We are concerned with the practical progress that is required to be made in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was referring, before Deputy Dunne interrupted me, to the emphasis on career guidance in our post-primary <Col N="921" /> establishments and said that we will have 60 such teachers in those establishments in the coming 12 months. From this year out these teachers will have available to them record cards from the primary establishments from which the boys and girls come setting out the primary schools' assessment of the work, ability and aptitude of these boys and girls, so that proper advice can be given to them at post-primary level to guide them in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I hope inside the next 12 months to have published in conjunction with the Department of Labour an overall assessment of the manpower requirements of our community in the years ahead.  In this way every parent will know where the job opportunities are going to be.  They, in conjunction with the school authorities and on the basis of the assessment made by the school of their children's aptitudes, can make a responsible decision in regard to how the children should be educated and in what direction they should train them in order to secure the jobs that will be available.  This assessment to which I have referred will outline precisely where we are going in regard to education and show how education can be geared to the manpower requirements and job opportunities available in our society.</P>
    <P>I mention this because it is a topic in which I think the greatest interest should be shown.  If there has been weakness in our educational system in the past, it lay in the direction of creating job dissatisfaction.  Too often in the past boys and girls emerged from the educational system not properly slotted for their jobs in our community.  We had too many square pegs in round holes.  With a proper intensive career guidance service, proper advice between parents and teachers and proper advice from expert psychologists, we can, as far as possible, guide boys and girls along the lines on which their aptitudes should lead them.  This is a very important matter because if you have the greatest possible degree of job satisfaction, not alone do you get personal problems at family level settled as satisfactorily as possible but also from <Col N="922" /> the community's point of view you have the greatest possible number of people making the greatest possible contribution through their work to the welfare of the community at large.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I think that education as a whole should be recognised as a community obligation.  The State is spending a substantial amount of money in the coming year on education and there will be recognition at all levels, from primary school to higher education, that education is fundamentally a community obligation.  This is the thinking behind the new scheme of re-organisation in regard to higher education as a whole.  We propose to establish a Higher Education Authority to supervise all higher education in the country and ensure that funds are allocated where they should be allocated and that students and faculties are developed and allocated in the areas where they should be allocated.</P>
    <P>In this connection we propose to amalgamate the two university colleges in Dublin into one University of Dublin. We propose to have separate universities in Cork and Galway and we are considering higher educational establishments elsewhere.  We also propose extensions in regard to technical and technological education.  We have just opened a new technological college in Kevin Street and an extension at Bolton Street, Dublin and there will be a new technological institution at Ballymun, also in Dublin.  These, together with the nine regional technical colleges throughout the country, will have their own field of higher education in technological subjects which can be administered in an overall capacity by the Higher Education Authority.  However, their main function in the future will lie in the field of higher technician training.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind this is that we should regionalise education along with various other aspects of regional development which have taken place here in the fields of tourism, industrial and agricultural development.  We propose to have nine regions centered on these technological colleges outside Dublin and in each region there will be higher education in technological subjects <Col N="923" /> related to the industrial requirements of the particular area.  To give one example, in the Carlow College of Technology, we propose to have an advanced Faculty of Food Technology related to the needs of Erin Foods and the requirements of the Sugar Company in that area.  In each area there will be emphasis on a particular high-level field of technology related to the industrial requirements of the area.  We propose similarly to rationalise the situation in regard to the technological colleges in Dublin.  They have already gone a considerable distance in this direction themselves and we propose to further that rationalisation programme. Thus we have overall supervision on the part of the State of higher education and we hope to rationalise higher education in the academic and technological fields according to the requirements of our society this year and each year in the future.</P>
    <P>This is practical planning and practical socialism in action.  It shows appreciation on the part of Fianna Fáil of the needs of the community today and in the future.  We get very little thinking of this kind from the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party.  If a community has to adjust its people to the needs of the day, planning must take place.  Fianna Fáil have shown since 1957 their belief in planning ahead and the first attempt ever made in this direction came about in the First Programme for Economic Expansion in 1958 which was the first attempt by any Government since the formation of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There were two documents, one is 1955 and another in 1956.  These documents were amplified in 1957 when we returned to power.  These showed our concern about planning for the future rather than merely holding on to office.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has become the epitome of conservatism in the Labour Party.  He is trying to become a respectable and conservative member of the Labour Party, full of unctuousness.  If one holds socialist principles, they are as valid in 1968 as they were in 1938.  Our socialist principles are concerned with what I have just been talking about, investment in education, equality of opportunity in education.  This is basic socialism, and it is our basic thinking in regard to the requirements of our society today. Apart from educational matters, there are a number of other questions with which the Oireachtas is at present concerned. The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently announced a comprehensive adjustment of the whole policy in regard to industry.  He has already started the Small Industries Scheme whereby smaller industries throughout the country are being helped by advice from the county development teams and by way of grants from the Exchequer.  He has announced that in designated areas these grants will be increased to 75 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been making a reasonably serious contribution on the whole question of education and was about to deal with the question of employment when interrupted by Deputy Dunne.  The two matters are linked, education and employment. This is what I regard as fundamental in our society today.  We are trying to shape our education to the jobs that will be available and trying to gear our education system from primary to <Col N="930" /> higher education level to the requirements of the future.  It comes down to the question of employment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has recently announced increased grants, increased loans, increased facilities in regard to industrial development.  He has decided to re-organise the Industrial Development Authority so that it will be an active agency in the development of industries, with particular emphasis on the regional aspect.</P>
      <P>Coming back again to the matter to which I was referring earlier, the question of regional development, it is our desire to diffuse prosperity throughout the country, and not alone to promote development in Dublin and Cork but in certain growth centres throughout the country where people can be absorbed in gainful employment.  We intend to extend the scheme of industrial estates, which we have established in Waterford and in Shannon, to the other growth centres on which the regional technical colleges would be based. Therefore we would have there the co-ordination between industries providing jobs and the education and training to equip our boys and girls for jobs.</P>
      <P>This is the sort of co-ordinated planning on which the Government are engaged at the moment, the sort of planning which places emphasis on planned growth from the social and economic point of view in our economy. This is the sort of thinking which has brought us to make our decision in regard to decentralisation of Government Departments, and which has brought us to our thinking that further decentralisation of this kind must take place.  Indeed, events throughout the world in recent months have emphasised again the importance of not having too much economic development in one particular centre, and that it is very important to have economic and social development balanced throughout the community on a regional basis.  I want to emphasise again that in the proposals I announced last week on behalf of the Government in regard to higher education, we have been pursuing precisely that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present in the combined Trinity <Col N="931" /> College and University College structures, we have 11,500 students.  These will be coming together in one university. We have between 2,500 and 3,000 students in the institutions in Cork and Galway.  These will be under the aegis of a Higher Education Authority.  We propose to raise the numbers in university colleges in Cork and Galway to between 4,000 and 5,000, which I would regard as a minimum viable unit.  Heretofore the university structures in Galway and Cork did not get this chance of expanding.  I propose to ensure that they will expand along the lines mentioned.  We anticipate that over the next six years we will have an increase in student numbers in the region of 6,000.  We can absorb this increase to a substantial extent in Cork and Galway.  We propose to rationalise higher education under the supervision of a Higher Education Authority which was recommended by the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to see that students at the universities get the lectures they are supposed to get, and do not turn up at classes to find that the professors or lecturers are not there to instruct them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a point with which I would be in complete agreement.  I would hope that under this overall Higher Education Authority we would have a planned system of recruitment, appointment, promotion, salary scales and superannuation for the university staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On condition that the university staff discharge the functions they undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant the Deputy that point.  This is an example of Government planning in the sphere of higher education, which planning is related to our overall conception of where we are going, how we can rationalise the system of university and technological education, and how we can guide our students through career guidance at post-primary level along lines that will lead them to the jobs which are available in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> Similarly in regard to primary and post-primary education, we must also have regional development.  We wish to see regional education authorities always co-terminous with the catchment areas of the regional tribunal established which will supervise all aspects of primary and post-primary education.  i paid tribute earlier to Deputy Dillon as being the person who first adumbrated the importance of having large central units at primary level.  We want to equip the children in their tender years to face the more testing aspects of post-primary and higher education.  Along with rationalising higher education, we must also rationalise primary and post-primary education.  We must have a planned approach to education as a whole.  I want to emphasise the need to ensure that our educational system will result in boys and girls emerging from it equipped and trained for the jobs that will be available.  This is relevant to the facts of life as they exist in 1968.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter about which I have been taunted in this debate, that is, the question of what I said or did not say to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in the course of an interview.  I would hope that as a result of the improvement in our educational system, people will be able to read and write properly.  This is a cause of some contention at the moment in regard to our new proposals for the language courses for the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to a question yesterday, I was horrified when I came into my present office and took up some of the leaving certificate papers and saw that students who had got honours were unable to write down in an essay in plain Irish, or plain English, or plain French, exactly what their thoughts were on a particular subject.  We are going to place great emphasis on the essay.  I believe it important in regard to language training that a student should be able to communicate verbally or write down in consecutive from what one's thoughts are.  The leaving certificate courses will involve English literature, modern and past, and Irish literature, modern and past, but in the examinations <Col N="933" /> the questions will not be based on literal excerpts from the literature.  It will be a question of interpreting the real message in the literature.</P>
    <P>The statement I made to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> is one which I can stand over completely if people read it without any mischievous notion or without seeking to derive any misconception from it.  People have got into the practice of reading the headlines and not reading the small print.  The small print is very important because it is there that the full emphasis of what one is seeking to say emerges.  Briefly what I said to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> was a very simple message concerned with the fact that national independence, <i>per se</i>, of itself, is not the answer to the problems of any country or any region.  This has been amply proved in Africa and in other places which have national independence.  Indeed, Jomo Kenyatta has been at pains over the years to say to the people of Kenya precisely what I am saying.  Briefly that was the message I set out to give in that interview.  I said that the mere securing of independence, of itself, by the Scots or the Welsh, or any other people, or any other region, would not be the answer, and that further planning would have to be undertaken to build up the nation.  However, in zealous work in building up institutions, in ensuring that social and economic development will take place, hardships have to be undertaken and difficulties have to be overcome.  All of these difficulties have to be undertaken in regard to independence.  The mere &ldquo;Uhuru&rdquo;, as some Africans would say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely the point I am making and it is the only point I am making in relation to the <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> It can be acknowledged as a fact of life that, as far as <Col N="934" /> Scotland and Wales are concerned, there are obvious material disadvantages in the complete independence of those countries and those disadvantages must be balanced against whether or not the people want autonomy.  It is a question of balance between two attractions and I made the point in order to put the whole matter in a balanced context.</P>
      <P>I also said &mdash; and was again misquoted &mdash; that, in the context of Irish history &mdash; as a personal point of view &mdash; I feel that if we had secured through the actions of Parnell and other people, including Deputy Dillon's ancestors, a 32-County Home Rule Parliament in 1884&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;1885, when Gladstone wanted it and had persuaded the House of Commons to this end and was defeated by the House of Lords, at that stage we might have evolved &mdash; it is merely an historical speculation &mdash; from that 32-County Home Rule situation into a 32-County independent Republic today.  This, again, was historical speculation on my part.  This does not in any way reflect on the necessity for 1916, the necessity for the War of Independence between 1918 and 1921 in the context of the situation which arose by reason of the British Government's betrayal of John Redmond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If malcontents wish to interpret a balanced interview with a serious newspaper in the manner in which they have chosen to interpret it, they may do so.  1916 was completely necessary in its time and so was the War of Independence because of the context of the time.  Redmond and the Home Rule movement had been betrayed by the British Government and there was need for Pearse and 1916 after that.  People should read the <Col N="935" /> small print and read in detail what is said and should not just be led away by the facile perusal of a headline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I shall not be drawn any further, Deputy.  I also said that, in my view, it would be very wise, having regard to the Irish parallel, for the British Government to grant Home Rule to Wales and to Scotland, having regard to the history of the Irish situation, having regard to the disadvantages that would arise.  I said some sort of regional or Home Rule Parliament might be desirable for Wales and Scotland in the context of what happened in Ireland.  That is precisely what I said.  If the matter is read in depth, as well as the small print, it will be found that what I have said is the correct interpretation.  I am glad of the opportunity to say all this in view of the misinterpretation and misconceptions that have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible in politics to avoid the situation but every man in public life should speak out on matters of serious importance and of historical importance in such a way as to help people to think, to speculate, to examine and question problems.  It is part of our duty, as public men, not to utter clichés but, instead, to stimulate and further try to provoke serious thought on all aspects of our social, economic and philosophical development. It is important that, in our integrated community, we build up a better philosophy of life that will lead to a greater quality of life.  Our whole education is fundamentally geared to that end.  The subject of manpower requirements engaged me at some length this morning but far more fundament al than that is the whole basic problem of education which is to lead people on to a better life.  The Latin word is <i>educare.</i> This is the whole essence of education &mdash; to lead our boys and girls into a community in the future that will have a higher quality and a better way of life in which they will be able to play a better part and enlarge and <Col N="936" /> enrich themselves.

      <P>I observe, though, that the Minister for Education, in the course of his interruption here, could not resist the temptation to smile cynically at his own political asseverations on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party. He is really laughing up his sleeve, as it were, doling out these things in which he does not believe and in which his Party do not believe.  He talked about equal opportunity for all our citizens which we see of course embraced in the Proclamation of 1916 and in all documents of that nature around the country and elsewhere throughout the world.  What equal opportunity is there in this country at present can the Minister tell me?  Look around this House and tell me where is the equal opportunity?  Let us take first things first.  How many people are sitting in these seats because of nepotism and because of the fact that they were born into a specially privileged position?  How many of them had to come in here on their own merits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that that is one aspect of equal opportunity that might be looked at and you can take it from there through the whole of our society. Amongst the working people, it is an accepted thing and it has become the cynical cliché of our age that it is not what you know but who you know. Is this not particularly true of this whether he is living in the city or in administration?  If a working man, <Col N="938" /> the rural areas, whether he is self-employed or working for wages, wants to place his son or daughter in employment, can it be said that he has equal opportunity for doing that with the person who is well connected politically and well endowed financially?  Is there any suggestion that there could be equal opportunity in that kind of situation?  Do we not all know very well that if you are not well connected and that if you do not know people to get you a job, well, that is just too bad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying that the Leader of the Labour Party pointed to the need for the reform of procedures in this House.  The need for this reform was underlined and emphasised last night by the fact that despite the presence of Members of the House, albeit ordinary Deputies, such as myself, who were awaiting a call from the Chair, it was possible and is apparently accepted as part of the procedure of the House that if at any time the mood falls on a Minister, he may come in here, sit down for a few minutes, wait until the <Col N="939" /> speaker in possession has finished, and then get up and talk for whatever length of time he likes and then depart. He may be as irrelevant as he likes and I may say that the Minister who has just left the House went into matters of detail for which other Members last night were upbraided and called to order by the Chair.</P>
      <P>As I say, this emphasises this gross abuse of the rules of debate by a Minister and emphasises the very great need which exists for reform of our procedures, for their modernisation and indeed for their democratisation also, as was referred to by Deputy Corish.  In the near future, we hope to put matters in this regard before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the Members' consideration.  We hope that whatever steps are taken will meet with the approval of the House because if we are going to have a debate of this kind conducted along the lines of which we have seen some evidence this morning, that is to say, by the intervention at will of members of the Government and the denial of time to ordinary Deputies thereby, then the thing becomes a farce and whatever democracy may be argued to exist in this Chamber disappears.</P>
      <P>Remember that when Minister and Parliamentary Secretaries come in here to talk about their Departments, they are provided with briefs and they do not have to exercise their intellects to any great extent except to read what is in front of them, unlike Deputies who have the task of composing their thoughts &mdash; even Deputy Dowling, and goodness knows anybody confronted with the task of composing Deputy Dowling's thoughts could not be blamed for becoming somewhat affrighted.  Here you have Ministers backed by hundreds and in some cases thousands of civil servants providing them with their briefs and they can come in here and abuse the privileges of the House to the detriment of the ordinary Deputies and take up the time of the House.  This is something that will have to be attended to by the House when the opportunity arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I will not be a weak Taoiseach.&rdquo; Where did we hear that before and <Col N="940" /> how often did we hear it?  &ldquo;I will not be a weak Taoiseach.&rdquo;  I suppose we could take this as the text for this debate.  It is a betrayal of the man and the individual who occupies the high office of Taoiseach that he found it necessary to affirm publicly in this silly fashion his intention to rule his Cabinet with some degree of firmness. Briseann an dúchas tré shúile an chait, nature breaks out through the eyes of the cat, and in fact he has been a weak Taoiseach.  Not alone that, but it is well known that his Cabinet is riven and split in a power struggle.  There is no doubt about that.  We are all aware of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows it. It does not really matter what struggling is going on in the Cabinet because I can plainly see that this is a transient Government; it is on its way.  I have heard so much talk here about coalition, all from the Government side, all from people haunted by this idea that there might be a coalition and they might lose their little soft Ministries. All that is coming from the Front Bench of the Government.  I have heard so much about it in the past few months that I can believe, particularly in the case of my esteemed colleague, who is trying to put over the referendum and who seems to have almost a little death wish, and not alone for himself but for the Fianna Fáil Party, that coming events are casting their shadows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government can hardly make any statement at all without this spectre of coalition emerging from his mind.  He is haunted by the fact that he may find himself in an extraordinary position, a position in which he has never been before.  This was remarked to me by a constituent: &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Boland, was never a TD.&rdquo;  I thought it over for a moment and then I realised that it was, of course, quite true; he was never a TD.  From the first day he came into this House he has been a Minister.  He became a Minister when he walked into this House.  He has never been a <Col N="941" /> TD.  He has never had to do the ordinary collar work and the drudgery that others of us have had to do in order to maintain our position as Members of this House.  Now he can hardly make any statement at all without mentioning this obsession he has, this idea of a coalition, obviously because he is afraid the day it comes, he will be out.  If it comes, or if we were ever to find ourselves in a set of circumstances in which another Government might be formed, in that eventuality then the Minister will be out.</P>
    <P>When this Administration goes, there will be no road back for them, unlike the previous Fianna Fáil Administration when you had at the top a figure who seemed to have a magnetic attraction for the Irish people.  That figure is no longer there.  The magnetic attraction is gone and the younger people of today are inclined to judge more on performance than on mystique. That, of course, is a good thing. Judging on performance, in the absence of any significant figure leading what was once a very numerous Party, it seems to be inevitable that there will be a diminution of support for the Fianna Fáil Party and, on that, will follow its disappearance eventually into obscurity, because nothing lasts for ever.  I know there are certain people in Fianna Fáil who suffer from the same delusions as afflicted Adolf Hitler.  He talked about the Reich that would live for a thousand years.  Certain Fianna Fáil people have the same approach, but they will meet their bunker too.  The Irish people are building the bunker for them and the strange thing is that Fianna Fáil are themselves helping to dig their own political grave because, unquestionably, the attempt to put over the so-called &ldquo;straight&rdquo; vote, the single non-transferable vote, will meet with a violent defeat.  That will mark the beginning of the end of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We are not too far away from an election day.  I suppose at the outside it will be another 12 months.  It is reasonable to assume we will have an election within 12 months.  I think we really need an election.  I do not say that as one who enjoys elections, but I <Col N="942" /> think we undoubtedly need a shake-up. There is very great need for an infusion of energy and the replacement of the present cynicism by some tincture, at least, of idealism, a cynicism which characterises every action taken by this Government.</P>
    <P>I listened last night, for my sins, to Deputy Corry and I regret that I was provoked into making some comment about his membership of this House. That is something I would not wish to do because, in spite of his shortcomings, and he has his share of them &mdash; we all have shortcomings &mdash; he is a man of venerable age and it can be said, I suppose, he has survived here over a long period and, for that reason, one should feel a certain kindness towards him.  But that is very hard at times.  It would be easier to feel kind towards him if one had a few Aspro, or something, to prevent the headache he always induces when he starts to speak.  However, that aside, he talked about his constituency and I can only conclude &mdash; I hope the good people of his constituency will read his remarks &mdash; that there must be down there a kind of Paradise, according to Deputy Corry's definition at least.  Apparently all he has to do, if there is unemployment, is to get on the phone to Lieut.-Gen. Costello and Lieut.-Gen.  Costello will arrive in the town with a fistful of money to set up a new industry which will benefit both the farmers and the townspeople.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, it is well to be like Deputy Corry.  But one is inclined to think that it is not, perhaps, quite like that, because he went on to say, in a tone of wonder, that the county manager in Cork had sympathetically considered a man for a medical card, a married man, with six children, earning £20 a week.  He was sympathetically considered for a medical card and, to Deputy Corry, this was something remarkable.  The civilisation which Deputy Corry, apparently, has imposed on that area has to be seen to be believed: £20 per week amongst eight people.  That such a person should get a medical card is regarded by Deputy Corry as a remarkable thing.  That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>He also talked about tourism in the <Col N="943" /> town of Youghal, the beautiful little town of Youghal, which, according to him, has industry instituted by Deputy Corry himself, encouraged and set up by Deputy Corry himself, and he defined &ldquo;tourism&rdquo; as &ldquo;rooking the visitor.&rdquo;  The people of Youghal, the hoteliers and the guesthouse proprietors, who make their living from that industry will have a view, I am sure, as to whether there is any validity in that comment.  He capped his remarks by saying that Deputies who are groaning and moaning here about the plight of the people should themselves provide jobs for the people; in other words, each and every one of us should create jobs in our own areas for the unemployed in those areas.  Apparently, Deputy Corry moves in a world in which we may assume that the Government have no responsibility of this kind and that everybody has a Lieut.-Gen. Costello at his elbow, complete with a fistful of money to run to his assistance. This is not the case, and despite Deputy Corry's far from polite remarks regarding the people of Dublin and its environs, who, he said, would not work in a fit, there is a great anxiety among the working class people of this city, large sections of it, in regard to unemployment, and a justifiable anxiety.</P>
    <P>People are coming to me seeking help to get them work at the present time and this has been the case for some years.  This is a fairly good way of measuring the prosperity of a country.  I represent Ballyfermot where there is a considerable degree of unemployment and that is true of all parts of the city.  Unemployment is, after all, the key to the question of how well or ill a Government may be doing.  No matter how the Government may endeavour to conceal the fact, to conceal the figures by manipulation or argument, it seems to me, and it is shown to me quite plainly &mdash; I can show lists of the people who are looking for work in my area to any of the people who are interested, not that any of them are interested &mdash; by absolute proof that unemployment is not only present but growing.  What this may mean to this country and to the working <Col N="944" /> people of this country in terms of full-blown free trade is better left to the imagination.</P>
    <P>We have had endless talk about free trade conditions, about the Common Market, and what it will mean.  But, so far as I can see, we have made little effort to prepare for that condition of affairs and it really is a matter of great worry to everybody concerned who has an appreciation of what is facing us.  One wonders how in God's name we will compete if the day should ever come, how we will exist as a nation when we will have to compete on equal terms with these continentals.  It is all very fine talking about a large market being available there but if you cannot produce the goods at the same price as your competitors and if you cannot provide employment in the production of such goods which will give satisfaction at home, the end result must be chaotic.</P>
    <P>However, mercifully, this business of the Common Market is not as immediate a problem as would appear. In the next few months, it might well be that things will be another way but with de Gaulle still hale and hearty and as long as he remains hale and hearty, we may rest fairly easy for the time being.  We should be making, as many people state, the fullest possible use of our time of preparation.  We have a lot of time to make up.  We have to overtake the British and the other countries who had an industrial revolution, something which we, in fact, did not have.  When other countries were developing factory power and mechanical power, we were still under the heel of the feudal landlord system, tenants at will, held there in economic subjection and it was not, one might say, until recent years that we got the opportunity at all to develop any kind of industrial potential.  Even at best, our industrial potential would seem to be limited.  In these circumstances, this business of absolute free trade is something that worries all thinking people.  The most interesting thing to me as far as this Government are concerned has been their absolute about-face in the matter of their use of what is known as the national position <Col N="945" /> Was anything more flogged to death than Partition?</P>
    <P>In spite of the remarks of the Minister for Education here this morning, in which he sought to be at one with Parnell, Griffith, the men of 1916, and Uncle Tom Cobley and all, in which he sought to be on everybody's side, can anybody explain how a Party, who barefacedly and brazenly abandoned the devices with which the Irish people were deluded for so long, can have the hardihood to expect people to accept them as <i>bona fide</i> reasons?  Either Mr. de Valera, as he then was, was right in his pursuit of a 32-County Republic when he said that the Ulster Government was illegal and, indeed, on a previous occasion, that this Assembly here was illegal, or he was wrong. Personally, I find it a fascinating thing that he should have induced people to follow him in that situation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a great anxiety amongst the present day people of Fianna Fáil to avoid discussion of this issue of the disservice the Minister for Education has done to the Fianna Fáil Party in talking loosely to correspondents of newspapers concerning Scottish or Welsh nationalism, the great disservice he has done by raising embarrassment over the past of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There was supposed to be nothing more pure when I was a young lad than the Republican faith as interpreted and enunciated by Mr. de Valera.  It was almost as if Wolfe Tone had whispered secrets into his ear for transmission to the Irish people.  As time went on, things changed.  We now find ourselves in the position that this Party who were said to be extreme left Republican, are now the Party which are more pro-British &mdash; you could say more imperialist &mdash; than any other group in the country.</P>
    <P>Yet Fianna Fáil apologists expect the Irish people to regard them as <i>bona fide</i> idealists.  Of course this kind of exercise is part of the explanation for the cynicism that is abroad, particularly in regard to politicians.  The Taoiseach and the Government are to be blamed in no small degree, and their predecessors, for the generating of the lie that everybody in public life <Col N="946" /> is a chancer and on the make.  That is not true.  I have met many people in public life in all Parties who have been self-sacrificing individuals, and I exclude myself from that noble company in case anybody might think otherwise; but because of the double-dealing, the departure from procedure, the specious arguments, the taking of positions opposite to those taken the day before, there has been a cynicism sown and encouraged among the public concerning politicians generally.</P>
    <P>That is a very bad thing because politics, contrary to what some transient Members of the House may say, is far from being a dirty game, in my view.  Any ordinary business outside contains far more opportunity and indeed involves the practice of far more duplicity than does the art of politics. There is the saving grace about a politician that his every act is subject to the searchlight of public opinion, something which is not applicable to the so-called businessman who may have the instincts of a privateer or a buccaneer and may very well get away. The Minister for Education today spoke about the diffusion of prosperity throughout the country: &ldquo;diffusion of prosperity&rdquo;.  One thing I will hand to the Minister for Education is that he is the master of cliché in this House: he hardly finds it possible to make a statement without employing platitude or cliché and he has given birth to a new one &mdash;&ldquo;diffusion of prosperity&rdquo;&mdash; meaningless and utterly untrue because there is not prosperity in the country.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority apparently are in for renaming. This is another aspect of the Government's attitude towards institutions. The IDA were set up by the first inter-Party Government, I think, and one of the first officials of the IDA was a former secretary of the Labour Party, Senator Luke Duffy.  It was a progressive move and that body did very progressive work during the years in exploring the possibilities of introducing industries to areas in need of them.</P>
    <P>However, the IDA were an inter-Party or, if you like, a non-Fianna Fáil invention and therefore it must be changed to make it into the image and <Col N="947" /> likeness of Fianna Fáil.  We must first of all alter the description &mdash; the name must be altered from the Industrial Development Authority &mdash; and the IDA will now disappear and a new name will be given to that authority and as time goes on, the idea will be fostered that this was a Fianna Fáil idea.  It is part of the exercise.  We are well used to it and it is one of the undesirable things.  There is inculcated a hatred of anything which does not spring from the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; an actual hatred, and I have seen it.  I have seen the faces of some of the Fianna Fáil fraternity, heavily injected with this idea.  It was positively poisonous.</P>
    <P>This is not the approach to build in modern Ireland, to bring to politics in modern Ireland.  It is not what the people need.  Sometimes there are outbursts in the House when certain people say certain things for which they are sorry.  One does not mind that.  At least one hopes too much notice is not taken of them but these things are seized on by anonymous gentlemen who do not like public representatives, anonymous gentlemen who are able to write editorials in newspapers about all kinds of things, including the salaries of Members of Dáil Éireann, but of the salaries of those gentlemen or of their identities we know nothing.  As I have said, these momentary aberrations, these temporary outbursts of temper, are seized on by people outside the House.  These things really mean nothing but they show the hatred which is nourished and encouraged by certain elements in the Fianna Fáil Party of anything outside their own Party which has been suggested or proposed.</P>
    <P>Hatred, of course, is self-destructive; it destroys itself, destroys the person who indulges in it.  I have long been convinced that the present Fianna Fáil Party are pursuing the road to self-destruction and the first milestone will be the referendum and, Lord, what a belting that will get in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education spoke about crash courses in career guidance. This brings me to the Department of Labour.  I have had occasion to make inquiries as to what the Department of <Col N="948" /> Labour are doing concerning career information and so on and I have here leaflets from that Department &mdash; these are only some of the leaflets which are available &mdash; setting out the jobs that are said to be available in the country and how one can go about getting one of these jobs.  There is one, for instance, entitled &ldquo;The Barman and the Barmaid&rdquo;.  You get three pages of in formation here about the work of a barman and a barmaid, education and other qualifications, how to become a barman, practical training, technical training, theoretical training and so on. Air traffic control assistant: is anybody interested in becoming an air traffic control assistant?  We have a special leaflet for that.  Now, to become an air traffic control assistant: this job is filled by open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission. It consists of an oral Irish test and an interview.  Competitions are held not more frequently than once a year and not less frequently than every alternate year.</P>
    <P>We must have endless opportunities for air traffic control assistants.  Indeed I am certain the people of my constituency who have young boys anxious and interested in aeronautics would be glad to put them forward for those opportunities.  I wonder how many air traffic control assistants we have. I would suggest there are very few but they merit a leaflet about career guidance.</P>
    <P>Here we come to something of importance, that arm of activity which is so badly in need of additional recruits, the barrister-at-law.  This is where equal opportunity comes in for all our citizens, to which the Minister for Education addressed himself at such great length this morning.  It does not set out how to become a barrister-at-law but it mentions some of the fees. It does not tell you how much you will have to pay to become a barrister-at-law. It does not tell you of the long training you have to reach the matriculation standard of education before you go after a King's Inns entrance or how much it will take your parents to keep you while you are studying at King's Inns.  It makes some mention about how much it takes to enter King's Inns. <Col N="949" /> The barrister-at-law is one of the job vacancies, the job opportunities, of the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the storeboy in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. A whole leaflet is devoted to him. There is one position of storeboy in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. How do you get this?  You apply to the Controller of Stores.  A competition for vacancies is held from time to time which consists of an interview and a simple test in Irish.</P>
    <P>The solicitor is another job opportunity offered by Fianna Fáil.  It is marvellous how the Fianna Fáil Party have invented all these job opportunities of barristers and solicitors. The solicitor, the great beneficiary of the public, a philanthropist without whom it would be impossible for civilisation to go on its way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The point I want to make is that this job of solicitor, by implication, is one of the jobs provided by virtue of the Fianna Fáil policies.  They invented solicitors as well as barristers, the storeboy, the barman and the barmaid.  The public relations officer is another one.  We are all public relations officers to a greater or lesser degree.  How many opportunities are there for this, apart from membership of Dáil Éireann?  That is a very hard role for anyone to try to follow.</P>

      <P>Here is another Fianna Fáil job: announcer in Radio Telefís Éireann.  How can you go about that: how to become an announcer?  Vacancies on the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann must be filled by special competition and accordingly it is the practice to put particulars of the vacancies in the daily morning papers.  That is a ritual many people go through, putting in those advertisements. A written application must be sent to the personnel officer.  Afterwards the final selection is made from persons who have been trained. Thereby no doubt there hangs a tale. This is another example of the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The calculating machine operator is another one.  That would not apply <Col N="951" /> to politicians although it would appear so at first glance.  Those jobs are for girls.  I dare say there may be a fair amount of opportunities in that regard.  The geologist is provided for.  Those are career opportunities by Fianna Fáil.  A designer has certain elements, I would say.  Then we have the footwear factory operator.  It would be very useful to hear how one could get a job as a footwear factory operative, particularly when that whole industry was threatened with extinction a few weeks ago, were it not for the efforts made by Deputy Treacy to ensure that there would be an extension of protection.</P>
    <P>The painter, the artist &mdash; that is a career for boys and girls.  There is a leaflet on how to become a painter, describing courses in the National College of Art.  I do not know how many persons there are in this country who are making a living by being painters.  I would suspect that there are not many.  Nonetheless, the career is made the subject of a leaflet produced by the Department of Labour.  It is a well-known fact that it is very difficult to make one's living as a painter or artist in any country.  It is probably more difficult in Ireland where the population is small.  However, that consideration does not deter the propagandists of the Fianna Fáil Administration from claiming that they have created openings in this direction also.</P>
    <P>How to become a journalist is the subject matter of another leaflet.  I do not know how this can be achieved. It would take a long time to read the details on this leaflet and I do not propose to do so.  I suspect I know a little of how to remain a journalist, especially a journalist of a certain kind.  If you write stuff that will please those who employ you consistently and long enough, you are sure of security but then I suppose this consideration applies in practically all walks of life. There is a great deal I could say on this matter but I have no doubt that I would be ruled out of order.  I do hold in my mind the intention, if and when necessary, to say a great deal on this matter.  For the nonce, we will leave it be.  I would not think there are <Col N="952" /> many openings for journalists.  It is a highly desirable profession but I would like to think that the children of workingclass parents in Dublin would find it possible to gain ready access to the profession.  I do not think that that is the position, for many reasons, one being that the number of vacancies is limited by the number of papers published here.  However, apart from that, the idea, here again, is to suggest that if you want to be a journalist, you must vote Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There are leaflets dealing with careers as auctioneer, estate agent, veterinary surgeon, waiter and waitress, architect, radiographer, law clerk. The question I want to ask is: where are the jobs?  I am very interested because I have many people looking for jobs.  Where am I to send them for a job?  Where are the jobs?  What is the point of having leaflets describing these careers unless the jobs are available? I have not been told where the jobs are.  I made inquiries.  In one or two instances, it has been possible to gain employment for men but in the vast majority of cases I have not been successful and I am being asked day in and day out, as are most Deputies, to help people to get employment.  I want to know where are the jobs.  Certainly, the Taoiseach and the Government have not provided the answer.</P>
    <P>This Taoiseach and this Government were responsible for the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, 1966. I see a question on the Order Paper today in the name of Deputy Dowling, no doubt inspired.  By &ldquo;inspired&rdquo;&mdash; I may as well spell it out &mdash; I mean that the Minister concerned asks Deputy Dowling to put down the question because he feels he has a suitable answer.  The question is:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Labour if he will consider taking steps to repeal the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, 1966.</P>
    <P>Any Fianna Fáil Deputy who would put that question on the Order Paper must think the people outside this House are completely clueless.  There would not be any Act of this kind on the Statute Book were it not for Deputy Dowling and this Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> It is not that the Government were not warned that they were pursuing a disastrous policy so far as industrial relations are concerned when they proposed to put men in jail because they were on strike or because they were picketing.  The Government were fully informed of this.  They were advised from these benches.  Efforts were made to hammer home the lesson as far as possible when we were opposing &mdash; and we opposed it as strongly as we could &mdash; this Bill which Deputy Dowling now, in a tremulous kind of way, asks the Minister to take steps to repeal.  Nobody will be misled, I am sure, by Deputy Dowling's effort to suggest that he has done other than support the Bill.  Deputy Dowling and every member of Fianna Fáil are as guilty as the Minister in so far as the committal to jail of the ESB men who went on picket is concerned.</P>
    <P>It should have been obvious to any reasonable person that that just cannot be done.  I am not going to talk about the special nature of Irishmen. Ordinary human beings in any part of the world will rebel against indignity. If you use force to try to compel people to do something they do not want to do, and in large numbers do not want to do, you are inviting failure.  You cannot hope to succeed.  There have been plenty of examples of that in our own history and in the history of the world generally. Not just Irish people, but human nature generally is such that you cannot drive people, unless you are prepared to go to the extremity, as Hitler was, of the gas chamber.  You cannot drive people.  You have to get their co-operation.  You have to lead them and go a bit of the way with them, if you want to get anywhere.  It was on the proposition that people can be driven, can be forced, can be compelled and coerced that this Bill was passed through the House by the Government and enacted with the help of Deputy Dowling and the other so-called, moryah, trade unionists we were told about here this morning. Not alone can they be described as nominally members of a union but they certainly do not know anything about human nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> I would say that the entire Dáil was held up to public odium and contempt by the futile and irresponsible arresting of these men and their committal to Mountjoy Jail because they went on picket.  There is a long history in this town.  It may be difficult for certain people to grasp how deep-rooted the emotions are in Dublin city concerning trade unionism, concerning the picket and concerning jobs generally and the relationship as between employer and worker.  I can understand if you have not been in close contact with it and have not lived amongst the people, it is difficult, perhaps, to grasp just what is going on, just as it is difficult at times for a city man to grasp what is going on amongst the farmers.</P>
    <P>In the city of Dublin the workers, who up to recently spread their votes in all directions, are inclined now to concentrate in support of the Labour Party.  They have a great tradition instilled into them.  They listen to their fathers talking about the titanic struggle of 1913 and the results thereof &mdash; the demolition of the slums which is proceeding under Dublin Corporation, the creation of new housing schemes and better living conditions generally than the days of the tenements, when it was not unusual for 150 people to live in one tenement house with the use maybe of one or two toilets outside in the yard, houses where men, women and children used to live 12 to 15 in one room very often on heaps of straw.</P>
    <P>This was recounted by the Commission of Inquiry set up by the British Government as a result of the strike of 1913 at which the conditions of this city at that time were described as being comparable with those existing in Calcutta.  This description was not applied by Larkin or the people avowedly, openly, bitterly and fanatically for the slum dwellers, but by people who were said to be independent judges.  All that has changed.  That huge body of history enters into the question of the feelings of the ordinary worker whom we see on the job in Dublin and his attitude to industrial relations, strikes and so on.</P>
    <P>When we realise that this is the <Col N="955" /> situation, it must surely be apparent that you cannot solve the problem by any simple means.  Happily, the day has long passed when all that was necessary was a few shouts from a ganger, a stevedore or a foreman to bring workers into line.  The unions have brought about that change.  Union pressure has brought about social justice. When dealing with that kind of situation, you have to have a sensible approach, but the approach by this Government was one of force.  They said to the ESB workers that if they went on strike and picketed they would go to jail.  They were put to jail and that made the position worse than ever it had been.  It ended up with our own institution of Dáil Éireann being held up to public odium and contempt because it was shown to be ineffectual. What was known to be a fact was proved to be a fact, unnecessarily so. It was not necessary to pursue that line of conduct, but it was pursued to our detriment.  It is to be hoped that in future, in whatever little time is left to them as a Government, the Government will not act so foolishly again.  The temper of the people is such that they will not tolerate it.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations is a most difficult subject.  It will always be difficult because there is no ready answer for all the problems between worker and employer.  Every problem is different, if only to the extent that different people are involved.  Basically, all problems come down to personality differences and to questions of wages more than anything else.  I would urge upon the Government, as has been done elsewhere, the need to create in the mind of the worker a feeling that he is a person of importance.  We can do that only by making him feel he owns part of the business in which he is engaged. I will give an example of the effect of that.  When county council cottages which for many years have been rented to tenants are purchased by them under a purchase scheme, they improve visibly because the element of ownership enters into it.  We have all seen that. This is the key to industrial relations. More and more the employer is coming to be regarded as a person with a managerial function.  More and more <Col N="956" /> the worker should be regarded as a person with a vested interest in the business.  To get him to accept that message is difficult.  It needs time, care, patience and, in the heel of the hunt, basically enlightenment.  Until we do that we are going to have the difficulties of industrial conflict.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education was on this morning about Fianna Fáil being the socialist Party.  I commented before on this anxiety which has descended on all kinds of odd elements to race further and further to the left and to pre-empt the position of the Labour Party on the left.  I remember the time when the left was as deserted as the Sahara Desert, a lonesome place.  If it was visited at all, it was by gentlemen like Deputy MacEntee, who came like the Chinooks in a scorching breeze &mdash; usually on the eve of an election &mdash; to do the maximum damage to the decimated tribes who occupied the left in those days.  Now everybody wants to be on the left.  Everybody claims to be a socialist.</P>
    <P>I do not think the people fall for that line as readily as might be thought.  Some members of the Government may feel they are putting over a convincing line, but they are kidding nobody but themselves.  They are transparently insincere when they talk in these terms.  Everybody knows they have no real socialist convictions of any kind.  We feel that the advent of socialism is inevitable.  If you leave economic forces to settle, as it were, their own questions, where you have no governmental regulations and laws to ensure the protection of the weakest in the community, then the brigands &mdash; very often known as private enterprise &mdash; will operate as they have always operated, on the basis of a Dick Turpin approach.  They will take no heed of the needs of society.  They will be intent on taking the maximum profit from whatever transaction in which they are involved and the devil take the hindmost.  Socialism implies an obligation on the State, the Government, to intervene and regulate relations between private enterprise and the remainder of society so as to ensure that the bulk of the people who spend most, if not all, of their lives in <Col N="957" /> economic difficulties are protected.  The State must intervene on their behalf more and more to see that they will get a greater share of the wealth they produce. That is socialism to us.  Perhaps it is inadequately expressed but it is a deeply-held conviction and always has been in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and others in Fianna Fáil make a point of emphasising, where housing is concerned, that if there is a shortage of housing in any area, it is the fault of the local authority.  If on the other hand, a lot of houses are being built, that is to the credit of the Government. I charge the Minister for Local Government with evading the issue in regard to his housing responsibilities. Surely there resides in the Custom House final responsibility for the overall national housing position, and for meeting the need for houses? That responsibility has not and is not being discharged by the present Minister. Without being repetitive, I shall say in one sentence how much more useful it would have been if the past two and a half or three months had been taken up with discussions on what we could do to improve the housing situation in every area rather than in the idle exercise through which we were compelled to go concerning the referendum.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the housing shortage must be laid at the Minister's door. He cannot get away with saying that if there are not sufficient houses in Dublin it is not his fault but that of the corporation or if there are not sufficient houses elsewhere that it is the fault of the local authority.  The Minister has an obligation, if he feels local authorities are remiss and not providing houses, to take steps to ensure that they do their job.  In other words, he is in a position to put them out of existence.  Any local authority which does not do its job in providing houses should be put out of existence because it does not justify itself, since housing is the primary need of the people today and therefore any local authority which neglects housing should be abolished, in my view.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the power to make life impossible for local authorities if <Col N="958" /> they are not doing their job.  He does not do that.  He simply stands up here and is content to blame local authorities, particularly local authorities which he may feel are controlled by Parties other than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Very unlike him.  The late Tim Murphy faced a harder task than faces the present Minister.  When Tim Murphy became Minister immediately after the formation of the inter-Party Government in 1948, the housing need in Dublin was 30,000 houses.  At present, allowing for exaggeration, it is in the neighbourhood of 7,000 or 8,000.  I forget the figure for the country in 1948 but it was astronomical because there had been no building for the previous eight or ten years or more. He was a man with a mission and, like Deputy O'Malley in Education, Deputy Murphy died in pursuit of an ideal.  He died on a platform speaking of the needs of children and of houses.  We have not got that idealism and zealousness in this Government at the moment and it needs an infusion of that spirit to cope with the needs of our housing situation.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, at any rate, we are faced with a problem which I think can fairly be claimed to be worse than any obtaining elsewhere.  Week by week we see visible signs of the drift from the land.  Young people leaving the land to go to England very often stay in Dublin city &mdash; or perhaps they stay there while on their way back from England to the rural areas &mdash; and do not leave. They marry and settle here and Dublin Corporation has the problem of providing them with accommodation.  We also have the tremendous task of providing accommodation for many thousands of families occupying the remnants of old Georgian Dublin, all these tenements which appeared in other times and which are now in the process of being knocked down and replaced by new dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of housing accommodation represents at all times the great task confronting Dublin Corporation. However, leadership in the approach to housing must come from the Government. <Col N="959" /> If the attitude of a Government on housing is lackadaisical, semi-interested, that attitude will reflect itself right through the country.  We must take into account that there is a managerial system there which is much closer to Government administration than the membership of councils would be or could be said to be.  The managerial <i>apparat</i> reflects, by and large, Government policy as laid down by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is not and there has not been for years any determined or realistic attack on this problem from the centre, the Custom House.  I listened to the Minister for Education talking about the record of Fianna Fáil since 1957 in the matter of housing.  Those of us who can cast our minds back to the time when Deputy Smith or Deputy Blaney occupied the ministerial chair in the Custom House remember only too well the frustration we had to endure by the inactivity of both of these Ministers in regard to housing, their complete lack of appreciation of the problem of housing.  The only contribution Deputy Blaney, who was the more recent of the two, made to the solution of the housing problem was to give us the estate at Ballymun, these colossal 15-storey blocks of flats standing up in the middle of what was once a beautiful rural countryside and on the fringe of an airport with planes flying in by the score every day. Deputy Smith made no contribution at all, but he made no bones about making no contribution.  He did not care and he let you know he did not care.</P>
    <P>What is needed is leadership from the Custom House that will bring a dynamism to the task of the provision of housing.  At the moment it seems to be sufficient, and it certainly seems to satisfy the Minister, that local authorities, corporations, local councils or whatever they may be, make an assessment of the housing needs in their administrative area, and make these assessments on the basis of counting the number of families who are in a desperate plight for housing, and only families who are in such a desperate plight; this is described as the housing <Col N="960" /> need.  By the time these estimates are digested and processed through the county council, by the time land is acquired for the building of houses and the houses are planned and designed by local authority engineers, and by the time these plans are finally inspected by the engineers in the Department of Local Government, years will have passed from the time of the original estimate of the housing needs.</P>
    <P>I have often seen two years pass in that way.  The county council would estimate the immediate housing need at 1,000 houses on the basis that 1,000 families were urgently in need of accommodation.  By the time these houses would be finally erected two or three years would have passed, and the figure of 1,000 would be completely irrelevant and would have doubled itself, and more.  The result is that we have always been lagging behind the existing need.  No matter how many houses were built, there were always five, six or maybe ten applicants for each house.</P>
    <P>All this suggests a great need for the elimination of the duplication of work which goes on.  For instance, why should it be necessary, when a housing scheme is planned in any local authority area, to have these plans examined in detail over a long period by the Custom House, referred back for alteration and then back again to the Custom House, and have up to a year wasted in that way?  Why should this be necessary in a situation which does not admit of delay?</P>
    <P>This bureaucratic approach with which we are saddled is responsible for a great deal of unnecessary suffering, because delay in the provision of houses means suffering and suffering of a very refined kind.  There are few areas of collective human hardship to compare with the situation in which two families, or in some cases three families, have to occupy a small local authority house, whether it be a county council cottage or a corporation house. There can be up to ten or 12 or 14 people in four small boxy rooms and you get a condition of affairs which is hell on earth.  It is small wonder that the people express their <Col N="961" /> frustration and their suffering not in the most polite terms at times.</P>
    <P>Why do the Government condone a situation in which we are at all times in arrears in the provision of housing? Surely it should be a priority that houses be planned in such numbers as to anticipate the increase in population which it is reasonable to expect will occur in specific areas? Surely it is not asking too much that a Government should try to meet the need that is already there?  Apparently it is asking too much of the Minister of this Government in charge of housing, the Minister for Local Government, because he is more concerned with abstract notions of electoral systems and notions about getting himself and his colleagues cemented in office, than he is about the condition of the many thousands of people for whom he is charged with responsibility to provide housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education talked this morning about Fianna Fáil and long-term planning.  I will say this for Fianna Fáil Administrations and long-term planning.  They hold the record for long-term planning in at least one instance, that is, the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme. It was first mooted in 1937, and it has been paraded since then by my eminent and distinguished colleague, now dechained, at successive elections.  The imminence of its arrival has been proclaimed at chapel gates throughout the length and breadth of our constituency but, lo and behold, no water has yet flowed through the pipes of the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme.  I am beginning to lose hope that Deputy Burke and I will live to see the day when water will run through those pipes.  This has been going on for 40 years.  That is long-term planning with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>It was meant and said to be something which would arrive in a few years, but it is still not there.  It is no harm to recall pleasant memories.  I recall being in the Spa Hotel in Lucan going on for ten years ago.  The then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, was present.  He performed some function &mdash; I forget what it was &mdash; in relation to the North County Dublin regioral water supply scheme. <Col N="962" /> I think it was the signing of some document, but I forget.  He was presented with a piece of Georgian silver, <i>circa</i> 1760.  That was so long ago, but we still await the advent of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Great speeches were made about what the scheme would do for the north county.  The Tennessee Valley Authority faded into insignificance compared with this tremendous engineering achievement, and yet I have passed from youth to middle age, and am advancing towards the sere and yellow, and I do not see any positive evidence of this scheme, except that if you go across the country, you will see pipes and knots of men, and if you inquire from a local resident, you will be told: &ldquo;It has something to do with you know what.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last Monday-week I attended a function with the Minister for Local Government and, during the course of his address to the people present at the luncheon &mdash; nowadays there is a luncheon after the opening of any type of scheme at all, but a very decent man gave us lunch on this occasion &mdash; when he started to talk about the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme, he scarce forbore to smile, and that is not easy.</P>

      <P>You would be lucky if he did not take a bite out of you. Of course, all these things are in the pipeline, in the immortal words of the Minister for Education, the master of the cliché, and if they are not in the pipeline, he is spelling it out somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very serious situation in this city which I want to draw to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Government.  There are thousands of families in this city who are paying rents of £5 and £6 a week for single rooms, flatlets and flats, because they are unable to get accommodation from Dublin Corporation, due to their position on the lists.  In many cases they are childless couples, or newly-married young couples awaiting the birth of their first child, or perhaps the first child is born.  I met a man who works in CIE.  His take home wage is £11 <Col N="963" /> odd and he is paying £6 a week out of that for a flat.  He has a wife and one child.  There are thousands of such cases.</P>
    <P>I suggested to Dublin Corporation that we must go outside the ordinary conventional means for the provision of houses to relieve this very worthy section of the community for whom housing prospects would seem at best to be somewhat dim, at the present rate of progress of house building. Something will have to be done to rescue them from the awful trap in which they find themselves, paying more than half their weekly wage for shelter.  The only method whereby they can be helped is by the provision, as a temporary measure, of pre-fab or chalet-type buildings.  It is interesting to note that the Minister for Local Government was asked three years ago by Dublin Corporation to sanction the provision of 100 such dwellings which the corporation would purchase to provide for the people I have mentioned, but no sanction has yet been forthcoming.  Three years ago we asked for sanction and we have not heard of it yet.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dowling has just come into the House, I will remind him of the fact that three years ago &mdash; and he is a member of the corporation &mdash; sanction was sought for 100 pre-fab or chalet-type dwellings, but no sanction has yet arrived from the Minister for those dwellings.  That is a scandalous situation in the light of the fact to which I have been adverting while he has been having his lunch, that thousands of families, childless couples, young, middle-aged or elderly, are in some instances paying up to £6 a week, as he will have heard from myself and others, for flatlets.  These are amongst the most long suffering victims of our housing situation.  I want to make a special plea to the Taoiseach for God's sake to get a move on with regard to this matter of the provision of houses.  At least an attempt should be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, who is now available, I see &mdash; I hope &mdash; gave some time this morning to defining what he considered to be socialism, and <Col N="964" /> so on.  He claimed to be the lineal descendant of Karl Marx, in effect: he did not use that word.  That was the general trend of what he was saying. As I mentioned earlier, he felt himself considerably to the left of the Sorbonne and Cohn-Bendit.  It is a pity Deputy MacEntee was not here. The only person I know of who was a member of a Fianna Fáil Government and who was, in fact, a socialist &mdash; a member of the early Socialist Party of Ireland &mdash; was Deputy MacEntee, along with James Connolly, in Belfast.  Whatever kind of a relationship Deputy MacEntee established with the socialists in those days, it certainly was not one of love because witch-hunting and anti-socialism were his favourite pre-occupations. However, I should have liked him to be here to hear the Minister for Education tell us how much he loves the idea of socialism.</P>
    <P>Of course, you know, I do not like to hurt the feelings of the Minister for Education.  He is a young man.  The fact is that we do not believe in him. We do not believe what he says.  I take it that I shall be given the same latitude as he was given.  He made no reference, of course &mdash; when he was branching into the sphere of the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; to the Potez factory.  He made no reference to the dreadful piece of inefficiency that that represents.  He made no reference to the expenditure of such large amounts of money and the small return we appear to be getting from it in terms of employment.  So much was promised but so little was delivered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education referred earlier in his speech to the First Programme for Economic Expansion.  I wonder if he ever read it.  That document was written by a civil servant whose name is on it, a very eminent and able civil servant.  It was appropriated by the Fianna Fáil Party and produced as if it were all their own work.  In fact, of course, it was anything but their own work.  I do not think the Fianna Fáil Cabinet at any time got down to really constructive and intensive examination of our economic situation.  Some effort was made in this direction, right enough, by the National Industrial Economic Council.  However, the Fianna Fáil <Col N="965" /> Cabinet has not been capable, to my mind, of formulating anything constructive arising from the deliberations of that body.</P>
    <P>We did have these chancy things like the Second Programme.  I suppose it sort of helps the Party at chapel gates to have silver-tongued people such as Deputy Dowling down from Dublin to tell the electors, as they came out from Mass at Dunlavin, for instance, of the glories of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  It might have been thought to serve a useful prupose.  It is a sad reflection upon what people consider to be the intelligence of the people of Dunlavin because, from my knowledge of them, they are highly intelligent people who are well-fitted to see through a mounte-bank politician who might come to persuade them to do things which were against all commonsense and against all natural justice, as Deputy Dowling would be liable to do.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme is admitted by everybody to have been a flop.  I remember when I first described these Programmes for what they were, just tales of mystery and imagination: I think I was the first to do it in the House.  There was a certain reverential awe evident whenever these moryah Programmes were mentioned, as if people were somewhat afraid to say anything derogatory about these polysyllabic productions.  Of course, the whole purpose of them was to baffle and bemuse people and to give the impression that something was in fact being done when nothing was being done.</P>
    <P>I would put this to the Taoiseach and to the Government.  If there has been any advance in any area, so far as the creation of industry is concerned, that is not due in the slightest to any action on the part of his Government but is due simply to the fact that it suits the convenience of certain international interests to come here and to exploit this country.  The day it does not suit their interests, they will go.  God knows, they have got every advantage by coming here.  They have escaped taxes of various kinds.  I am not suggesting that these advantages <Col N="966" /> should not be offered: it is well that they should be offered.  However, let us not exaggerate the extent of the so-called success of a policy in this matter.  These interests will go only where they can make money.  They found this country to be such a place. As we know from experience, some of them came here and were supplied with a considerable amount of money which, in the heel of the hunt, came from the ordinary people of this country, the taxpayers.  These people apparently had no knowledge of what was expected of them in the field of industrial relations.  Apparently, they were under the impression that they could operate in Ireland as they can operate in some other countries such as the United States of America and so on, whereas, in fact, such is not the case.</P>
    <P>I join with others, not to discourage &mdash; indeed, far from it &mdash; investment from outside but to urge that in future we ensure that there will be progress when such investment arrives and that there will be uninterrupted co-operation.  I would urge that foreign industrialists, or interests coming here to invest, be left under no illusion of the situation that, over a long period, we have established certain courses of conduct or traditions which are held to be very important such as the right of a man to belong to a trade union and the right of a trade union to represent his interests, if he feels that way.  Let these things be impressed on all who seek to come here.  If they do come with that attitude, prepared to accept these conditions, then they are more than welcome.</P>
    <P>I was among the first to raise the matter of Biafra by means of a question here.  It looks as if it has now become a kind of hobby-horse for many who are just interested in the publicity end of it.  Because I did raise it first, I want to mention now that I think more is called for from our Minister for External Affairs so far as intervention to secure peace is concerned. When I raised the matter about three weeks ago, Deputy Corish in a supplementary question to the Minister asked about the feasibility of airdrops of food and he was told that it was <Col N="967" /> out of the question and that it could not be done.  Now this has become a matter of common discussion among countries which are anxious to help the starving people and airdrops seem to have become quite a possibility.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should judge the position there.  Certainly I am in no position to do so as I know nothing about the Nigerian situation except that I have had relatives there for a long time but they do not know sufficient about the political situation to give an opinion on the relative merits of the position.  However, one must have a definite opinion about starving people and there can be no argument there.  As I mentioned when I raised this matter on the Adjournment with the Minister for External Affairs, we who are living on this island have a special relationship with starvation.  I am a middle-aged man of nearly 50 and in my youth I met old people who had been children at the time of the Famine.  This gives us a kind of fellow-feeling for those who are suffering this terrible agony.  We think of what our own people suffered and endured and from whom the marks of the Famine have not yet been erased because a lot of diseases, tuberculosis and so on, are no doubt traceable to the hardships of that time.  As I say, this gives us a fellow-feeling with the Africans who are now suffering.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that the Government have done all they might to intervene in the interests of these people.  I feel our Minister for External Affairs is inclined to spend too much time at the high level cocktail parties around the Hudson and too little time thinking about what steps he could take to help people who are in such dire distress.  I am not accusing him of being less humane than anybody else but I feel he is far too conservative in his approach to this matter.  He is not prepared to take any diplomatic chance in making a forward move as he might very well do.  I do not know the reason for this but it is obvious to the Irish people that that is what is happening. He is not prepared to go that little bit forward and offer to negotiate.  Possibly if he did so he might succeed in getting <Col N="968" /> a cease fire which seems to be the one way of really helping these people.</P>
    <P>The very thought of their suffering must trouble our consciences.  It is not a question of money or help; everybody in Ireland is willing to do that and not only are they doing it in a variety of ways but many are doing it by stealth which is the way in which most good is done.  Most good is invariably secretive and unacknowledged.  At the same time, there rests on the Minister this obligation to go further because with every hour that goes by, people are starving. A person who is dying of starvation dies a thousand times a day.  I had a little acquaintance with starvation myself and that is how I know.  I was not very starved, and I wish I could possibly have a little of it now and it might do me a little good, but I was 21 days without food and I know a little about it.  It is a most excruciating thing but for a little child, it is just appalling.  I simply want to say to the Minister, for God's sake get moving; let him take his courage in his hands and forget about protocol and who might be hurt and who might not, but simply try to bring them together to get a cease fire.  Maybe both sides are as anxious for it as we are.</P>
    <P>I have not said all I would like to say and certainly not in the terms in which I would have liked to express myself but the rules of order are such that they must be obeyed.  I daresay before we meet again in this House, we will have had the referendum, and if that be the case, it is reasonable to expect that the Government will have had a very severe beating.  I do not say this for any reason other than that I believe it sincerely, and most sensible people will believe it also, that the Government are going to be very thoroughly thrashed in the political sense on this issue.  We will then have a situation in which the Government will have lost the confidence of the people and it must bring a general election much closer.  I hope the Minister for Local Government is working on the recasting of the constituencies and that he will have the job ready because it will be essential if the Government's proposals are defeated, <Col N="969" /> to recast the constituencies in accordance with the figures of the last census of population distribution level.  If that is not done, there will be the danger of an election being held and subsequently being upset by a citizen who might establish that it had not been held in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In any event, we are not all that far away from a general election and the next general election will be fateful for this nation.  I hope the Taoiseach, when he is considering the date of the general election, will have regard to the weather. It was not the custom of one of his predecessors to have regard to weather. Or, perhaps, it was; it was always at the coldest possible time, in the worst possible weather, possibly in order to enable him to don the longest coat that existed in Western Europe.  In any event, I would urge the Taoiseach and the Government to prepare themselves, as we are preparing ourselves, for an election because, as I indicated earlier, the country needs an election.  The people are anxious for an election.  The people are anxious to see this Government out.  There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>As far as I personally am concerned, as I said, I suffer more than most at election times from the normal anxieties of a politician.  I do not like elections, unlike Deputy Lemass, who was the only politician I ever heard say he enjoyed elections.  Do you recollect that?  He said he enjoyed elections; that could only be the remark of a masochist, someone who enjoys suffering. Nonetheless, there comes a time when we have to face up to difficulties in the interests of the people and the interests of the people demand that there should be given to the country the opportunity of rejecting this Government. I feel the people will do that, without question, and, when that has been done, the future of this country will then be a matter for those who come in here.</P>
    <P>It seems to me we are at a crossroads even in that regard.  Many of the older faces will possibly disappear at the next election, either voluntarily or through pressure of events.  We have <Col N="970" /> seen things electoral in the past week or two that would not have been conceived as possible a few years ago.  We have seen people who were regarded as permanent fixtures in certain organisations shown to be expendable, just the same as everybody else.  It is the one remaining and permanent truth of political life &mdash; the expendability of the particular Member.  We saw that in the case of even Presidential elections when what people thought was impossible was brought within a hair's breadth of achievement.  There can be very great changes when the election does come. The sooner it comes the better.  Let us get it over because what we want more than anything else is a shake-out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our purpose today is a general review of Government policy and of matters related to this House. One of the most important matters relevant to this House is that its proceedings should be effectively communicated to the country.  We hear much criticism in this House from time to time of press, radio and television because, it is alleged, they have failed in that regard.  I think it is important that the House should, when opportunity offers, find an occasion to compliment such members of the Fourth Estate as may from time to time adequately serve the purpose of communicating the proceedings of Dáil and Seanad Éireann to the Irish people.</P>
      <P>There is one feature I want to name. I do not know who is responsible for it.  I do not know who prepares it, but, in my judgment, it represents the perfection of political reporting.  It is the feature on Radio Éireann, &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;, at halfpast ten at night.  I know of no piece of reporting which more equitably describes what passes in the Dáil from day to day and I liberally recommend the people of the country generally, if they want a fair description of what passes in the Dáil from day to day, to depend confidently on the report provided by Radio Éireann at halfpast ten under the title &ldquo;Today in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly now to the remarks of the Minister for Education this morning.  I know that, for procedural <Col N="971" /> reasons, it is inevitable that at the end of a session, the debate on the Adjournment should be limited in time, but I think, for the benefit of the Dáil, it is right that I should go on record as observing that, if we are to continue that prudent rein, Deputies should have regard to the fact that a limited time carries with it the obligation that the maximum number of Deputies desiring to participate should be facilitated by their colleagues and that marathon speeches on these occasions should, in so far as practicable, be avoided.  I hope to set a good example in that regard myself today.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education touched on the particular issue of the developments in education, developments for which he claimed exclusive credit for the present Government, and said that theirs was the vision and theirs was the zeal to realise these objectives.  I want to remind the Minister and the Government of which he is a member that the concept of education for all our people did not originate with the Fianna Fáil Party.  At the 1964 Fine Gael Ard Fheis, it was my duty as Leader of the Fine Gael Party to address the Ard Fheis of that organisation in May of that year.  I invited the Ard Fheis on that occasion to commit itself to four propositions.  The first was to abolish poverty in our society; and I offered them that objective not as a remote ideal but as an urgent necessity of the kind of Christian society that should obtain in this country.  Secondly, I exhorted them that the best we have to offer in primary, secondary, vocational and university education should be made available, through State aid, where necessary, for every boy and girl so that in future no child, who could benefit from higher education, will be excluded from it simply for the reason that his or her parents cannot afford to pay.  That objective was formally accepted at that Ard Fheis in May, 1964.  It was on the four points the programme of the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; was built and, when the Minister for Education speaks of no reference to education having existed in that programme, I would remind him that it is not legitimate to misrepresent the facts. <Col N="972" /> The facts are that that was the programme of the Fine Gael Party as announced and formally adopted at a public Ard Fheis on 9th May, 1964.  It is on the record and any progress we are making today is in fulfilment of that programme and the Government proposals for the widening of educational facilities are, I think, in no small measure inspired by the knowledge that, on this side of the House, such proposals were guaranteed in advance the cordial support of the principal Opposition Party, as indeed they were guaranteed also by the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of which Deputy Corish is Leader and, not surprisingly, I find in this matter, as in divers others, the difference between himself and myself as far back as 1963 was not very wide, seeing that we sat in a Cabinet together to good effect on an earlier occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make is this, and it is a point often forgotten. If at this moment we are equipped and equipping ourselves to receive an evergrowing tide of students into university education in this country it is because we are in a position to provide additional facilities at University College, Dublin, at the Belfield site.  I want this House to remember that the inter-Party Government, of which Deputy Corish and I formed a part, with the late Bill Norton and Tim Murphy and Michael Keyes &mdash; God be good to them all &mdash; was denounced by Deputy Eamon de Valera, as he was then, in 1952, when he resumed office after our first Government, because we had bought Belfield and authorised the President of University College, Dublin, Professor Michael Tierney, to acquire that vast site by stealth &mdash; observe the word &mdash; so as to avoid the university being charged intolerable property prices if it were known publicly that they were in the market.  We it was who guaranteed the overdraft necessary for University College, Dublin to raise in order to acquire that property and to come to Dáil <Col N="973" /> Éireann <i>ex post facto</i> to get the Dáil's approval of the guarantees necessary for the capital expenditure involved for the purchase of the entire Belfield site, without which no single structure designed for the accommodation of the natural sciences in University College, Dublin would be available today.  Let us not forget that.  I remember it with pride and I rejoice that it should be so.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I want to say something in that regard.  There used to be an old saying that the great danger of the Christian church was that in its earlier centuries they had wooden chalices and golden priests but in the immediate pre-Reformation days a time had come when the Church of God had golden chalices and wooden priests, to the great detriment of Christianity with all the divisive and hidden consequences of that period of degeneration.  I want to sound this note of warning.  We may establish four universities in Ireland; we may crowd them with new students coming from every stratum of society and every household rich or poor, but unless the professorial staff of those universities conscientiously discharge their duties to the students committed to their care, we will live to have to admit that we had wooden universities and golden professors and that we have exchanged them for golden universities with wooden professors.</P>
    <P>I point my finger in no particular direction at this time but if what I am saying now is not attended to, I will point my finger directly at the department to which I refer.  It must stop in every academic institution in this country that students are summoned to the lecture hall only to discover that the professor or the lecturer has not bothered to turn up.  That is happening now and it has got to stop.  If the alibi for its continuance is that the charters of these learned institutions confer on nobody the right or the duty to put an end to this abuse, then let the charters be amended and be amended now.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as the greatly increasing number of university students enter the precincts of the buildings we provide, it is intolerable that it should continue to be the case, as it was the case 40 years ago when I went into university, <Col N="974" /> that it is possible for young students to come up from rural Ireland and ramble through the corridors of the university having no human creature in the ranks of the teaching staff on which as individuals they have a right to call for guidance, direction and tutorial service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into greater detail on these two topics today, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I want to fix Dáil Éireann with notice that if the appropirate steps are not taken to bring these matters to a prompt and, if necessary, <i>ad interim,</i> conclusion, I do not think it is safe to wait until the new institutions are established.  Where these evils exist they must be controlled now, for I do not want mischief-makers who have been sent in here from abroad to create and canalise student zeal and enthusiasm into misdirected channels, bringing them out in the streets to protest, and finding myself in the position of being constrained to admit the grievances they allege are well founded and rational representation has failed to remedy them.  I am making the representation in public now.  It is for the Minister for Education, it is for the Government, to consult with the authorities of the university and to confer upon the authorities of the university not only the right but the duty to put these matters on a proper footing and to negative grievances that could be exploited by foreign agitators sent here for the purpose of precipitating in Ireland the kind of antics which have disgraced so venerable an institution as the Sorbonne itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On these occasions it behoves the people who have been in public life for a long time to arrogate to themselves the duty and obligation of saying certain things that are extremely disagreeable. I feel I have a duty to do it now. I do not think it is wholly reasonable for the Taoiseach, on the one day in the year when his Estimate is under discussion, to absent himself entirely from the House.  Much as I admire the Parliamentary Secretary who represents him on the Front Bench today, I do not think he adequately represents the Government on the occasion of the discussion <Col N="975" /> of the Taoiseach's Estimate.  I sympathise that it is a laborious task for the Taoiseach to sit here for a day and a half and listen to a discussion of this kind, but I do not think it is an unreasonable demand to make on him once a year.  Whatever criticism we had of his predecessors, it was their practice to be present; and it did them good to hear what ordinary Deputies were thinking and speaking of in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am going to say something now I would have preferred to say in the presence of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government, because I think there is a real danger to our institutions.  I want to say that the whole system of planning appeals is beginning to stink to high heaven.  That is strong language.  I have tried to sound a note of warning on this topic several times before.  Our Party introduced a Bill for the purpose of setting up a tribunal procedure which would bring this whole business of planning appeals out into the light of day.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach were sitting there where he ought to be opposite me now, I would say to him: &ldquo;I am not asking you to believe me.  Go to any prominent solicitor in the city of Dublin and ask him of the talk that is going on in Dublin.  Go to any prominent firm of real estate dealers in Dublin and ask them of the talk going on in the city of Dublin today.  Go to any firm of architects and ask them of the talk going on in the city of Dublin at the present time.&rdquo;  I know that the Taoiseach, if he were present, would be entitled to say to me: &ldquo;If you know of any scandal, why do you not give us particulars?&rdquo; I cannot give him particulars.  All I know is that I am being stopped in the street by prominent solicitors, by prominent members of the real estate business, by prominent members of architects' firms, and being told that the common gossip is that the whole business of planning appeals, in which vast sums of money are involved, is becoming a reeking, stinking scandal in this city.  I say it is the duty of the Taoiseach to institute such inquiries as he thinks proper to determine the source of that trouble. <Col N="976" /> I invite him to address his inquiries to the categories of persons I have mentioned because it is from these persons that this news is reaching me.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the general problem of housing, but I do not want to go into it in detail.  It makes me physically sick, in a city where we are telling married people with two children that their names should not be put on the housing list, to see all around me vast office buildings being erected to be set at 30/- per square foot, the bulk of which will be set to Government Departments before the foundations are laid.  God knows, I think the homeless people of this city show a degree of public spirit and restraint which reflects immense credit on the stability of our political institutions. But when I think of a man and his wife and two children sleeping, eating, cooking and living in one room and being told, when they apply to the housing authority for alternative accommodation, that their names cannot even be put upon the list, and when I think that the same people walk down the city and see millions being spent on office accommodation to be set to their own Government at 30/- per square foot, I marvel at their patience and forbearance.  I marvel at what appears to me to be the criminal irresponsibility of the Government who allow that situation to obtain.</P>
    <P>It is wholly illusory to say that this is a matter for the local authority.  I sat in the Cabinet with the late Tim Murphy.  I saw him wear himself down to death.  Deputy Corish was in the Cabinet Room with me the day Deputy Murphy collapsed and we put him sitting in the armchair in the corner of the Cabinet Room until he was able to be taken up to his office.  He wore himself out following the local authorities in all four corners of Ireland.  I remember him asking the Government to give him a new officer in his Department who would be charged solely with constraining the local authorities not to let the people go homeless.  That officer was Mr. O'Mahony, later to become City Manager of Dublin.  As a result of that pressure from the Custom House, with Tim Murphy as Minister for Local <Col N="977" /> Government, we created a situation ultimately in which we had more houses than we had tenants to go into them.  I compare that with the situation today and say to the Taoiseach that he should examine his conscience, because the present situation represents an evil which, in my judgment, appears to be virtually intolerable.  There are two other matters I want to mention and I shall name one of them before reporting progress.  I want to speak on the subject of old people.  We are, I think, losing sight of the gravity of the problem growing up around us if the number of elderly people multiplies in our community as it does in every other community in the world.  I suppose as one approaches that status one becomes more conscious of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of (a) the recommendations of the Committee on Science and Irish Economic Development that electricity production is a suitable method of using coal produced in the Arigna coalfield, (b) the fact that reserves of coal in the field are estimated to be twice the figure stated by the geological survey and (c) that the Committee accepted a target annual output of 170,000 tons, he will take steps to either increase the intake of the present station at Arigna or to construct a second power station in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question by Deputy Reynolds on 21st October, 1965, on the subject of extending the Arigna station, a full investigation was carried out by my Department into the technical and economic possibilities of utilising the reserves of coal in the Arigna area for the generation of electricity. <Col N="983" /> While the project is technically feasible the economics of using these reserves of coal which have a very high ash content were found as a result of this investigation to be highly unfavourable. The extra cost arising for the Electricity Supply Board from the construction and normal operation of the extension would be prohibitively high. The situation remains substantially unchanged.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Board accepts the maximum quantity of coal which it is possible to utilise at the existing station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Science and Irish Economic Development reported that there was twice the amount of coal in the Arigna coalfields than stated in the survey and that the output should be increased to something like 170,000 tons per year, which would reduce the cost.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated during the debate on the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1968 the ESB in carrying out the post-development scheme, are recanvassing the country in a planned sequence of areas so as <Col N="984" /> to ensure orderly development and to keep costs to a minimum.  Any departure from the planned arrangements upsets the Board's programme and increases the costs involved.  Preference for any area can be arranged only by delaying supply to other areas.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that work under the post-development scheme is proceeding in South West Cork and that construction crews are at present operating in two areas, Drimoleague and Caheragh.  In addition, a proportion of the resources available is being applied in supplying a small number of individuals who establish reasonable priority either in relation to tourism or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an answer to what I have in mind.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in West Cork we have applications from individuals here, there and everywhere who are anxious to have an electricity supply provided, applications from households which could not be connected in time past due to isolation? Houses have been erected in recent times, and my question does not relate to any particular area but to applications from people who are writing to the Board and writing to public representatives to try to get a connection &mdash; from John Murphy or John O'Sullivan, this type of individual application. What kind of system has the ESB devised for meeting their requirements? Is there some impartial system devised or is it a question of the local officer saying: &ldquo;We will connect this man here and let the other man wait till next year&rdquo;?  That is what I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very wrong to allow the allegation that the extension of electricity is not being done by ESB in an impartial way.  It is being done impartially, and if the Deputy is speaking specifically about individual applications, I can say that special consideration is given to new houses where the occupier had electricity in the old house.  Special consideration and priority are also given to any type of small industry where employment is being given.  However, this is a five-year programme and in any such programme <Col N="985" /> all applications must be taken in rotation.  Any cutting across the rotation only slows up the process.</P>

I have seen people who have come into this country to West Cork and who have had no delay in having their houses connected, whereas the Irish person, the small fellow, is left over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an estimate is not available, but 588 unlicensed bulls were detected in the course of a widespread search last year.  Court proceedings were taken against the owners in respect of 483 of these.  Appropriate warning letters were issued in the remaining cases.</P>
      <P>Each year, an extensive comb for these bulls is carried out by the Garda Síochána and by officers of my Department, including some staff specially employed for this purpose.  Last year, additional staff were employed over a longer period, and similar arrangements have been made this year. Furthermore, grants are not paid under the Calved Heifer Scheme to any farmer found to have an unlicensed bull or an animal which was mated with an unlicensed bull.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether in view of the effect that the disappointing salmon season has had on the livelihood of fishermen and on those engaged in the trade he will extend the season this year for one month on an experimental basis; and, if the results are satisfactory, if he will give consideration to lengthening the season for future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think such action would be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on the reasons which influenced him in declining such a reasonable request, having regard to the hardship and losses which accrued to the fishermen concerned?  Would he say what proposals, if any, he has to alleviate that hardship and render <Col N="990" /> more secure the livelihood of the fishermen concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons, and there are other probably less important ones.  The first is where salmon are not being caught in numbers which indicate that they are running in numbers, that is indicative of a situation wherein the extension of fishing facilities would not be in the interests of the fishermen.  If they do not get up the river, they cannot get back and they have not spawned.  In the long run, that would be to the detriment of the fishermen.</P>
      <P>The second is that while this disease is still with us, and unfortunately it is still with us, the best advice I have got in this regard is that we should endeavour by any means at our disposal to build up stocks of fish which have developed an immunity to the disease.  That is a theory, but it is probably well based.  Whether it is or not, it is the advice I have got.  Therefore it is in the general interests of the fishermen, whether they be net fishermen or rod fishermen, that the runs of fish going up to spawn should not in any way be reduced at this time, particularly in view of the disease, and that they should be allowed through to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>In addition, I should say it is not, it never has been, and I doubt that it ever will be, the policy to extend indiscriminately the season for net fishing in any estuary or river.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Even on an experimental basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been done, and I think it unwise to contemplate doing it.  If the season is to be extended or reduced, this clearly should be done only after an inquiry or investigation has taken place about the specific river in question.  A number of these rivers are, in fact, being investigated at the moment, but it cannot be determined over one or two seasons.  We have investigated some of them over a couple of seasons and we propose to continue investigating them this year. If the outturn should show that the runs of fish up the river to spawn are sufficient, or regarded as sufficient or <Col N="991" /> more than sufficient, this would give us justification for contemplating in the future an extension of the season on any river where that is so.</P>

      <P>Since it commenced operations in January last, the West Limerick Development Team has examined a number of projects and schemes aimed at furthering the economic development of its area.  It has devoted particular attention to small industrial projects and the provision of amenities for tourists.  Some of these proposals will be approved in the near future.  I am confident that the Team's activities will make a significant contribution to the development of West Limerick.</P>

      <P>It has been ascertained from Córas Iompair Éireann that there was a delay in the issue of tickets for free transport on school services, in some areas in County Kerry, due to organisational difficulties.

Files of years since then will be available on request as soon as additional storage space already provided has been fully equipped.

We are dealing with files and newspapers running back a hundred years and it seems to me it would be an immense advantage if the files could be filmed and a projection room made available so that anyone who wanted to consult a newspaper of 1853, instead of having to lift an immense file, bring it upstairs and thumb through it, would simply turn the relevant roll of film on to a screen and carry out any research required in that way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received representations dated 3rd July, 1968, from Tullamore Urban District Council expressing serious concern at the increasing unemployment situation and explaining that there has been a reduction of 700 employees in the town in the past ten years and that it is expected that a further 40 persons will lose their employment because of the closing of the local malting industry; if he is aware that the council is at present engaged in an effort to acquire land suitable as an industrial site; if he will receive a deputation from the council to discuss what immediate action can be taken with a view to attracting a worthwhile industry to the town; and if he will make a general statement on the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I received and have under consideration the representations referred to by the Deputy. The Government have provided valuable facilities to encourage the <Col N="1017" /> establishment and development of industries in all areas.  It is for private enterprise to take advantage of these facilities and local interests should do their utmost to encourage private enterprise to set up industries in their own areas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that any sound proposals by local or other interests for the establishment of industries in Tullamore will receive most sympathetic consideration by the Industrial Development Authority and by me personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he takes a very serious view of the situation in Tullamore?  This was a very progressive town but the figures revealed recently show an alarming decrease in employment; there are 700 fewer people employed in Tullamore today than there were ten years ago.  The position will further be aggravated by the fact that 40 more people will lose their employment as a result of the closing of the local maltings.  Steps should be taken to see that the workers displaced as a result of the closing of the maltings will be employed and some effort will have to be made to stop the growing unemployment in the Tullamore area. Some effort should be made by the Minister's Department and by the Industrial Development Authority to ensure that employment will be provided in this area in order to check the continuous decay which exists in Tullamore at the moment.  The Tullamore district seems to be the worst in the Midlands at the moment.</P>

I would prefer to see the hospital in Tullamore than anywhere else in Ireland.  I ask the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to consider sympathetically between now and the reassembly of the Dáil meeting the members of the urban district council because they are very perturbed and alarmed about the continuing decay in the whole economic fabric of Tullamore.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of industrial consultant firms which are operating in this country; if he will outline the nature of any complaints received by his Department regarding the operations of any of these consultant firms; and whether he considers it necessary to introduce legislation to safeguard Irish firms in view of these complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to state the number of industrial consultant firms operating here.  Industrial consultants come to my notice only when firms employing them apply to my Department for grant assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant Scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of the scheme, approximately 100 firms of consultants, Irish and foreign, have, at one time or another, carried out consultancy projects for which grants have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as consultancy projects are concerned, this scheme operates on the basis that the applicant firm is in the best position to decide on its requirements and to employ the consultants which, in its considered opinion, are competent to meet these requirements. The experience to date has been that very few complaints about the efficiency of consultants work have been received and, even in such cases, it is not possible to say, with certainty, that the fault lay solely with the consultant <Col N="1019" /> firm.  I do not consider that it is necessary to have legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Following a detailed examination by my Department of a proposal by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. to increase the price of sugar on the home market, I agreed to an increase of £8 per ton in the ex-factory price of sugar which would result in an increase of 1d per 1b at retail level.  This increase in price was necessary mainly to compensate the company for an increase in 1967-68 in the growers' price for beet, and for an increase in the production of sugar from beet rather than from low-cost imported raws.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Roscommon Health Authority consider that the person in question is entitled, as a hardship case, to receive half his regular requirement of medicines free of charge.  They have provided this level of assistance by forwarding a month's supply of medicines every other month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that this case is a hardship case.  The man applied to the local authority for free medicines.  That was granted.  Then they made the decision that he would be entitled to receive medicines free of charge only every alternate month.  If this local authority get away with this, where will it end?  Either the man is entitled or is not entitled.  It is the first time that this has happened, to my knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

It quite often happens that the authority decides that the applicant is not entitled to have all of his drugs supplied free but that he must bear some proportion of the cost.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, it is not an economic proposition but the Department are planting a certain amount of hardwood and, as the Deputy is aware, it takes rather good agricultural land to grow this type of timber and the Forestry Division does not get very much of that type of land.  However, there is a certain amount of this type of wood being planted by the Forestry Division.</P>

      <P>I am going to talk about affairs that are of concern to him and to me because we are both entering that category of humanity which could aptly be described as senior citizens.  Much as I have crossed swords with Deputy Corry, I recognise his right to veneration and respect in this House as a Member who has been here for 40 distinguished years.</P>
      <P>I want, Sir, again, to deplore the Taoiseach's absence &mdash; I assume for good reason &mdash; from this debate.  Perhaps there is good reason for it but I do not understand it.  However, he is not here.  The Minister for Lands for the moment represents him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to confine myself to questions of broad policy concerning the Government, but, as you will remember, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, during the past 12 months the Government have been concerned, as every government are in every year, with certain adjustments in the social services. I want to submit to Dáil Éireann that we are all making a terrible mistake in that regard.  We have got into the habit of believing, through, I think, want of though, that all social problems can be resolved by voting money and I think that is profoundly untrue in respect of a growing section of our community.  I refer to the aged.  I believe that in our community, as in every other community, the really grievous problem in regard to the aged is a dual problem &mdash; one, when they are no longer able to look after themselves, which involves the whole problem of their domicile and future happiness; and the other, when they are not physically incapacitated or <Col N="1028" /> even poor to the point of destitution. I now acknowledge the arrival of the Taoiseach on whose absence I animadverted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <P>I am glad to notice that you missed me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the problem of old people.  In dealing with the social services, all of us had, I thought, in some measure overlooked the fact that there were certain social problems that the provision of finance did not actively resolve and that notably in that connection arose the problem of the aged and that their problem was of a dual nature &mdash; one, old people were no longer able to look after themselves and needed care but, apart from them, there is another problem of old people who are not destitute and whose primary problem is not finance but the far greater burden of loneliness.</P>
      <P>I remember recently I was troubled by a phenomenon I had noticed constantly during my life of middle-aged and elderly people suddenly appearing in the streets, notably in the cities, shouting and very often most incongruously shouting obscenities at nobody at all &mdash; striding through the streets, sometimes relatively respectably dressed, often in a state of considerable disarray, but having the common characteristic that they were shouting at nobody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It often puzzled me what the basis of that syndrome was, what its ideology was.  I asked a distinguished psychiatrist who happened to be a personal friend if that had ever come under his attention.  I was greatly struck by the compassion with which he described to me his familiarity with that syndrome.  I asked him what caused it.  He said simply &ldquo;loneliness&rdquo;. These are people very often not desperately poor &mdash; some of them are but some of them are relatively comfortable. They get to the stage where they are living in one room or in a flatlet in Dublin.  They get so lonely that they begin to talk to themselves. Then gradually the figment grows in their minds that there is somebody in the room with them to whom they <Col N="1029" /> speak and from whom they get no reply.  The next stage is that they suddenly burst out into the streets, shouting at all who pass.  They are really suffering now from a form of mental instability born of the yearning for companionship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use dwelling on Deputy Corry's age because we are both approaching senior citizenship. I am talking about a problem which I think is guaranteed the sympathetic understanding of all sides of this House when it is expounded to them. I asked that psychiatrist if there was a ready remedy for that situation.  He replied, &ldquo;Yes.  There is not any difficulty at all.  If these people can be committed to psychiatric care, companionship and nothing else &mdash; simply to bring them into company where they can have somebody to chat with&mdash; relieves the whole problem and they can be returned to perfectly normal living, but with the virtual certainty that if they return to solitude, exactly the same syndrome will manifest itself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That condition I have described is, of course, the extreme end condition of a problem I believe is borne patiently by hundreds of our fellow citizens of whom we here in Dáil Éireann know nothing.  Strangely enough, I want to make the case on the Taoiseach's Estimate that this is not a matter I can with propriety draw the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare to, because I do not think there is anything the Minister can do about it.  I do not believe it is susceptible to bureaucratic control or remedy.  But I <Col N="1030" /> believe that a Government &mdash; whether it be the Taoiseach or a Minister to whom he designates the task, be it the Minister for Health or the Minister for Social Welfare or whomsoever he may consider the appropriate Minister &mdash; can find a solution.</P>
    <P>I think the solution is this.  There are a number of voluntary charitable bodies in the country, such as the Legion of Mary and the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and particularly a number of charitable voluntary associations the personnel of which are primarily young people anxious to be of some disinterested public service.  If an appropriate Minister of State would act as a co-ordinator of these charitable institutions by meeting them once a year, discussing with them that kind of problem and saying to them: &ldquo;How best can we co-ordinate these activities so as to ensure that those who are alone and lonely will be visited?&rdquo; it would require no more than that.  If there were individuals in similar circumstances, these people could call on them with a quarter of a pound of tea and ask could they have a cup of tea with them.  They could brew a pot of tea, share a cup of tea with them and spend an hour or an hour and a half chatting and talking with them.  They could visit them once a week or more often, if that were possible.</P>
    <P>One has to be tactful in approaching this extremely delicate problem.  I have myself visited the destitute poor in the casual ward of St. Kevin's.  One of the great difficulties is that at that level you frequently find that an approach to the lonely and destitute is not received with much enthusiasm.  You must be prepared to be received in certain cases with an extremely violent reaction in which your approach is characterised as an intrusion on their privacy.  In fact, that may be a symptom of their desolation, but I want to emphasise that the solution of this problem is one calling for a high degree of tact and discretion and it is not susceptible to the ordinary processes of bureaucracy which are not adapted to meet this peculiar social problem which is present in our midst and which, with the present trend of extended life &mdash; in my own lifetime, life expectancy has grown by five years &mdash; threatens to <Col N="1031" /> become an ever-growing problem which all of us are only too prone to forget.  I commend that matter to the Taoiseach.  I believe it will receive sympathetic consideration from him.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the destitute poor.  In my experience, it is very largely a rural problem.  Certainly, the solution I want to propose to it is the solution primarily adapted to rural conditions.  I am appalled at the policy decisions taken by this Government to spend millions on the rehabilitation of what are euphemistically described as county hospitals but which we used to call workhouses.  To take an old person from any town in Ireland, an old person who is living alone and who admittedly is no longer able to look after himself or herself, and bring them to the county hospital miles away is, to my mind, a tragedy.  The ordinary picture in rural Ireland is that neighbours will go in and bring soup, clean up the house and so on until the day comes when the old person falls in the fire and it is manifest that they are no longer safe alone.  Then there is the appalling tragedy of the arrival of the ambulance and the old person leaves and goes, perhaps 30 miles from home, and drops out of everybody's memory.</P>
    <P>I remember an old friend whom I shall call Charles, although that was not his name, who used to be up every morning at 5.30 and was a hardworking man all his life.  The time came when he could no longer work.  Neighbours came round to clean the house and give him a meal.  Then the day came when he fell in the fire and it was generally agreed in the locality that it was no longer safe for him to be alone.  The ambulance came and he was removed to the county hospital. Five years later I was visiting that hospital and as I walked through the ward, an old man called me from a bed.  It was Charles.  I thought the man was dead and buried for three or four years.  He had simply vanished completely and everybody had forgotten about him.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many Deputies received a circular that I got recently from the Gift Houses Restoration Committee <Col N="1032" /> at Kinsale.  That describes what is very widely known as rural Ireland, medieval charity.  There is another in Castleblaney and another in Mitchelstown. They are scattered all over the country and are all medieval endowments designed for the provision of accommodation by way of cottages or sometimes flats for the parish.  In Castleblaney, if such a person as I have described becomes helpless and unsafe alone, he can aspire to become elected to residence in the local charity and he has a room of his own.  If it is a married couple, they may have two rooms.  There is an endowment attached and they get about 12s 2d a week, in addition to the old age pension.</P>
    <P>There is a lady almoner who lives there and those people are as happy as kings and queens because not only can they go down the town and visit neighbours and have a cup of tea with them but what is infinitely more precious is that they can invite a neighbour in and make tea for him.  If they fall ill, the lady almoner is there and she will look after them or, better still, go to some more active person living in another room in the charity who will be delighted to have the opportunity of being of service to her neighbours.</P>
    <P>Instead of spending millions building workhouses, we could create charities of that kind.  I have no hesitation in using the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo;; it is the loveliest word in the language.  If I ever had to go to the workhouse &mdash; I do not think I shall, as I have my pension&mdash; I would rather go to a charity in Ballaghaderreen than to the County Home in Roscommon even though it is very well run by the Sisters of Mercy who have devoted their lives to that extraordinarily difficult work.  To be near home, to be near your neighbours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am asking that instead of committing ourselves to large capital expenditure on county homes, we should try to <Col N="1033" /> consider the alternative of keeping the old near their neighbours so that they can visit and be visited.  These are two matters urgently needing sympathetic consideration.  We could do something here in Dáil Éireann to remedy one of them by the provision of charities such as the Gift Houses in Kinsale.</P>

I want also to say to him that livestock is the basis of economic life in this country and the metamorphosis that <Col N="1034" /> has taken place in the face of rural Ireland in the past six months is a drama to behold.  I cannot say all I would wish to say about the economic stability of the world in which we live but I commend to the Taoiseach's attention an article in last week's &ldquo;United States World Review&rdquo; by the Chairman of the SEC in which he joins his voice to mine and that of others in saying: I smell 1929 in the air and it would be well for every country in the world to watch and prepare their own domestic economic situation to meet any tornado that may come sweeping in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very tempted to go a small bit of the road on the subject which Deputy Dillon was discussing five minutes ago, that is, in regard to the aged in the country.  I have said here again and again that we may call ourselves a very Christian nation but the treatment of the aged by the young is something of which we cannot be very proud.  There are far too many cases where men and women who rear big families, and experience great hardship in doing so, finish up in what is now called the county home.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately I cannot agree with the solution suggested by Deputy Dillon as being one that is at all possible. The cost of running such institutions, of providing staff and medical care is so great that, as things are at the present time, I fail to see how it could be possible to introduce a system which would compare with the old charitable institutions which do cater for large numbers of these people.</P>

      <P>I studied this problem in a number of countries, and while it is possible to deal with the people who are able to do something for themselves and to make them very comfortable, even away from the <Col N="1035" /> environment in which they have been living, but living with people of their own age, it has not yet been found possible to deal with the people who are not so much ill as just old, becoming senile.  I do not think what Deputy Dillon has suggested is the solution to it.  Let me say just in passing that the problem of senility in the county homes is now becoming a big problem. While it is true, and it is a shame, that we have long waiting lists of people, not those who want to go to these homes but who have to go there from sheer necessity, many of them will ultimately finish up in mental homes because they are mentally deranged through senility.</P>
      <P>Until we are prepared to allocate a reasonable amount of money to deal with this problem we just cannot do anything about it, and having regard to the priorities which this Government seem to have, this one would be pretty low on the list.  This has taken me away from what I had intended to say.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday and when he was finished, I felt he had not said very much, that he did not seem to be very enthusiastic about what he had to say; in fact I wondered if he felt it was worth while saying it at all. Then I thought maybe it was a cockeyed view I had and that I was not doing him justice, until I took up one of this morning's papers and found that the Taoiseach's Estimate speech, which corresponds every year with what is known as the State of the Nation speech by the American President in which he runs the whole gamut, in which he highlights the good things and glosses over the bad things, and gives a fairly good account of what has been happening in the nation up to that part of the year, has been allocated less than a column in one of the morning papers.  To show how little it appeared to count, I turned over another page and found that a photograph of the Taoiseach sucking a lollipop gets as much space.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that this seems to bear out my conclusion that the Taoiseach's speech was a very uninspiring one.  The Taoiseach is well known as an excellent orator who has the gift of putting things well if there is anything to put well, and it would appear from what I had listened to yesterday that there was nothing very much he could say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach dealt briefly with the fact that devaluation has had a certain effect on the balance of payments, the import-export balance, and said we would appear to be buying more than we are selling abroad.  Of course, if what we are buying is costing more and if we must export more for the same cash £ for £, this is only natural, but there is more than that in it.  The Taoiseach should have admitted that the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, as Deputy Corish said here yesterday, is turning out, as time goes by, to be a worse and worse bargain. The fact that we got very little for agriculture and gave away a great deal in regard to industry seems to be having an effect.  I challenge the Taoiseach to go to any shop in Dublin or Cork and ask for a shirt, a pair of socks, any kind of wearing apparel, and he will find that three British-made articles will be put on the counter before he will get one Irish-made article.  The same thing will happen with shoes and other goods.  People are getting into the <Col N="1037" /> habit of not worrying what is happening to Irish industry.  It is no concern of theirs.  Their job is to make a profit for themselves or for their employers. The Irish people are beginning to realise, apparently, that they can buy cheaper stuff sent in here from Britain; in some cases it may not be as cheap as the Irish-made article, but they will never try to find an article made here and consequently give employment. This is one example of the effects of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  It is getting worse as time goes on, and the Taoiseach should have the matter reviewed before it goes too far.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that our exports to the EEC countries were disappointing. I do not know whether anybody else has noticed it or not, but up till about six months ago, everybody on the Fianna Fáil Benches was saying: &ldquo;Let us get into Europe as quickly as possible and everything else can be forgotten.&rdquo;  The suggestion was nearly made that the farming community would not have to get up more than a few days a week, and that there would be money for the picking up for agricultural produce if we got into the EEC.</P>
    <P>This has now become something of a bad word so far as the Government are concerned.  They are not inclined to talk about it.  As a matter of fact, when the Taoiseach was asked the other day if it was now likely that we would get in by 1970, I thought he was almost relieved to get away so handy when he said he did not think it was likely.  He knows as well as I do that in Britain it is now being accepted that even if the bar to Britain's entry were removed, it would take about five years negotiations before Britain could become a member. If that applies to Britain, I am sure we are not blind enough to say that it does not apply to us as well.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish said, we entered on a Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, as the Taoiseach and the Minister said, for the purpose of preparing us for entry to the EEC.  Now that it appears that the EEC is as far away as ever, and going further away, would the Taoiseach reconsider the whole matter?  The Taoiseach was quite correct <Col N="1038" /> when he said there were mountains of butter in the EEC.  Deputy Dillon commented on our whole economy being based on the cattle industry.  If we have cattle, we must find something to do with the milk.  Apparently all we can do with it is make butter, and cheese to a certain extent, and send it to markets where we sell it at a highly subsidised price.</P>
    <P>This problem does not seem to be faced by the Government.  They should start trying to sort that one out.  We are encouraging people to go into the dairying industry, but it is becoming increasingly evident that in a relatively short time a serious crisis is likely to arise and it will be impossible to sell our butter on our traditional markets because it will be selling at a fraction of the price.  There is no use in waiting until this is at our door.  Now is the time to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that towards the end of last year we had a tremendous increase in our exports to Britain particularly.  It is said that it is an ill wind that blows no one any good.  There was foot and mouth disease in Britain as a result of which, or partly as a result of which, there was a huge demand for Irish cattle. We were able to sell many cattle to Britain and it was good that this was so, but the Taoiseach himself commented that our cattle population was down.  We were also told that last year the pig population had dropped, and that this year it was up.  The pig population should never have been allowed to drop.  It seems ridiculous that the biggest obstacle to selling Irish bacon in Britain is not the quality but the fact that it has not been possible to guarantee supplies.  We were talking about peat briquettes the other day and about the fact that when markets were found across the water, supplies could not be maintained.  It is only natural that when people find that the Irish are not able to maintain the supplies they originally said they would supply, they find another supplier.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the increase in the population.  He is an honest man but he suggested that one of the main reasons why the population seems to be increasing is that even <Col N="1039" /> though we have fairly hefty emigration to Britain, the number of people who are not now staying in Britain has increased, and that there are people coming back who if they were out of a job would normally go to Britain, and staying here because of the economic conditions there.  I am quite sure that results in the number of extra people in the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says we are up 4,666 on last year's figure as of now.  He makes the rather ridiculous suggestion that this increase is apparently due to the fact that persons on unemployment benefit can now draw that benefit for the full year instead of six months as was the case formerly.  I am sure that, on reflection, the Taoiseach will realise that if they were not able to draw unemployment benefit for the full year, they would be drawing unemployment assistance, and would be on that register. People do not sign on the register and stay on it because they like it. They stay on it until they can get a job.  There are some chronic unemployed who have been so long unemployed that they have become unemployable, but mainly the people who sign on are praying to God for the day when they will get a job and can go back to work and get away from the exchanges.  The Taoiseach should not have made the statement that they are staying on because they get a few shillings on unemployment benefit more than on unemployment assistance. On reflection, I am sure he will agree he was wrong.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about employment and unemployment.  The Taoiseach went into a fair amount of detail.  He talked about industries not coming in here. He referred to strikes discouraging people who might otherwise be inclined to set up industries here.  I agree that industrial unrest is bound to create a situation in which people might not be too anxious to go into a country where strikes are endemic.  I am sure the Taoiseach must agree that these strikes are caused mainly by the stupidity of those who are allegedly managing industries. I am sure he will agree from recent events that this matter must be cleared up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> We now have the Minister for Labour setting up a committee to investigate a strike which occurred in Bord na Móna.  I suggested in this House when that strike started that something should be done to have the matter investigated and cleared up, and the Minister said it had nothing to do with him, that there was machinery to deal with it.  Similarly, we have had other disputes, and investigations carried out for the purpose of finding out what caused them.  We should try to find out what is creating the situation which will cause the next strike because, like the next war, it will come inevitably unless some effort is made to try to solve the problems which cause strikes again and again.</P>
    <P>Negotiations take place for wages and improved working conditions. When they take place, the trade unions are usually able to deal reasonably with reasonable management.  When management is reasonable, the trade unions are reasonable too.  We have Ministers of State holding forth on every possible occasion about the necessity for good labour relations, the necessity for speedy negotiations and the necessity for employers to deal with these matters as quickly as possible; yet the State itself pays the worst wages in the country.  It pays forestry workers, Land Commission workers, Board of Works employees, and anyone else at that level of employment, ridiculously low wages. When negotiations are opened with the State, it takes longer than anyone else to make an offer.</P>
    <P>This year the local authorities on whose rates wages are normally based, offered an increase of £1 a week with effect from 1st April this year, with service pay of 5/- for five years, 10/-for ten years, 15/- for 15 years and 20/- for 20 years and over, and between three and five days holidays extra.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Lands sent for the trade unions and offered them 15/-flat.</P>

      <P>When the matter was disputed, they said they would consider it and a month later when I put down a question in this House, an agreement was made that the employers' representatives would meet the unions again.  This morning, knowing quite well that this debate was coming up, the Department of Lands sent for me and an official of another trade union and offered us £1.  When we asked about the other matters, service pay and extra holidays, they said they had not had time to consider them. They had these demands before them since December of last year.  These are the people who tell us we must show restraint and that the employers must, at all times, make arrangements so that reasonable offers will be made.</P>
      <P>Nobody knows as well as those in the Department of Lands and in the Department of Finance that the matters which have been asked for&mdash;and which have been conceded generally&mdash; must eventually be conceded by them. Do Deputies know why this matter is not being dealt with now?  It is not being dealt with in the way it should be dealt with because the Government Department feel that their employees &mdash;most of them what they term &ldquo;unskilled labourers&rdquo;&mdash;cannot, under the circumstances in which they work, go on strike because forests will continue to grow and the rivers these men are cleaning have been left there for hundreds of years without being cleaned and will remain that way.  The Government are in for a rude awakening if they think they can carry that on much longer.  That attitude has just got to stop.  We cannot have industrial peace, we cannot offer to prospective employers coming in here any hope of industrial peace, so long as the Government themselves are responsible for causing so much unrest&mdash;and unrest they are causing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a discussion on education. Apart from the fact that the Minister for Education was this morning pretty anxious to score off anybody he could, particularly Labour Party, he seemed to be more inclined to deal with those who were or were not former members of the Party than he was to deal with his own Department. However, in passing, he did comment <Col N="1042" /> on a number of aspects of it.  I should like to comment on a few more.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Dillon was quite correct when he referred to the scandal of university students attending for lectures but no lecturer turns up.  It may be said that only a small number of lecturers are concerned.  Nevertheless, it is true that, in certain faculties, some of these people feel they are not answerable to anybody and that it is quite all right if a student gets up at 6.30 a.m. in order to be present at a lecture at 9.30 a.m. only to find that there is no lecturer, and not even an apology on that day and maybe the same on next day, too.  That should be stopped.  If the Government have not responsibility for it, they should take responsibility for it.  After all, our first-year students, if they fail, have to sit it out until they succeed in getting their pass.  It is most unfair that they should be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education referred to the wonderful improvements in educational facilities, particularly in past 12 months.  Along with other people, I should like to refer to the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley who did make a great effort&mdash;I believe mainly because of his strength of character&mdash; to have certain things done with regard to education.  Probably I was not amongst his most ardent admirers when he was alive but nobody, certainly not myself, will try to take credit from him and his efforts to improve educational facilities for the children of this country.  It is to be noted, however, that the Government do not seem to be whole-heartedly in support of what he started.</P>
    <P>Last week, I asked a question to find out how many untrained teachers there are in my constituency and where they are located.  I was horrified to find that there are over 50 untrained teachers in primary schools there.  Previously I had asked the number of schools in my constituency which are unfit for use.  The number&mdash;between those unfit which could not be repaired and those unfit which could be repaired &mdash;is more than 50.  I understand that the same is true in every constituency. Yet, this is the type of school in which, we are told, extra educational facilities are being provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> It is ridiculous to start talking about what will be spent on education so long as we have the situation that we have neither the teachers to train the children in their early years nor the schools in which to put them.  The size of classes is another problem which we all come across from time to time.  While it may not be as bad in the country districts as it is in the city, nevertheless we have the scandal of one teacher trying to teach three or four classes in one room at one time in a country school.  It is true that the classes may be small but it is a miracle that any of these children pick up the rudiments of education at all under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>While the free transport for children has been a great boon to many of them there is the terrible problem of those who are just inside the three-mile limit and who, therefore, are not entitled to free transport.  I have been in correspondence with the Minister for Education for the past three months about a little boy of six years of age who lives 100 yards to the west of neighbouring children who have only to walk a mile to a bus and get free transport to school.  There is a school within two miles of this little boy and he is expected to walk, all on his own, that two miles to school while everybody else travels on the bus to the other school.  All the children he is growing up with must go to one school while he must go to the other.  I understand that examples of this kind can be instanced all over the place.</P>
    <P>We also have the situation that the bus will bring children who were formerly brought to school by parents lucky enough to have a car&mdash;and who carried other children on the way&mdash; while the children who got the lift have to walk even though a half-empty bus passes by them.  The Taoiseach may say this has nothing to do with the Estimate but it causes dissatisfaction and unrest and it is easy to deal with it, if the will is there.  At least, let the Minister be human in dealing with these matters.  Let him cut the red tape and deal with the matter as if he himself were directly affected by it.</P>
    <P>We have had an awful lot of talk <Col N="1044" /> in this House about housing.  According to the Minister for Local Government, if one needs a house all one has to do is to write to the local authority or to the Department of Local Government and a house goes up by magic. Over a number of years in my local authority area, for one reason or another, we failed to get any satisfaction from the Department of Local Government with regard to the building of houses.  After the last local government elections, there was a change in the council there.  The Fianna Fáil Party who, up to then, had controlled it, no longer controlled the council.  Following this, it was possible to submit applications to the Department for permission to build quite a number of houses.  The Department agreed that they could be built and tenders were sought.  The tenders were submitted to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>After many months, the tenders were sanctioned.  Then applications for permission to borrow from the Local Loans Fund were sent up but the Minister, being a very busy man, has not got around to dealing with them yet.  Meanwhile, month after month after month, people are living in virtual hovels.  We have over 300 people in County Meath alone who require the county council to house them.  Yet, the Minister for Local Government says the housing problem is being dealt with and that nobody has any valid complaints about housing.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on what is happening in this city except to say that I am more than surprised when I see Deputies stand up here and brag about the fact that the housing situation is almost solved, that only a few thousand families require housing, that the figure of 10,000 homeless people is wrong and that it is only 5,000.  This morning, one Deputy said that nobody in Dublin is homeless.  He felt it did not matter if ten people had to live in one room so long as they were under cover.  That was all right, they are not homeless.  This is the attitude and the approach which we have to housing.  As long as we have that approach, then we are still going to have complaints coming in to all of us, with all of us <Col N="1045" /> bringing them on to the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>The question of building a new house or reconstructing a house has become a nightmare.  It does not matter what anybody does because for the past four or five months the Department of Local Government do not seem to be terribly anxious to inspect or to pay on inspected houses.  Responsibility for this must go straight back from the Minister to the Taoiseach because if the complaint is brought to him and if nothing is done about it, he must carry the can.  For months we have had the time of this House being wasted by the Minister for Local Government who again and again repeated the same excuses he had for introducing the Bill to abolish PR.  When I listened to him, it became obvious to me that he must wake up at night time, screaming in case a Coalition has got him because every time he was cornered, he went back to the Coalition as if they were going to do something to him.  If he spent more time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No; Coalition is the word he used.  I want to give the poor fellow my full sympathy.  Apparently he has this on the brain and he cannot give the time which he should to important matters in his Department. Planning was mentioned earlier today and somebody said that the appeals system stinks to high heaven. I do not know anything about that.  A long time ago I stopped advising anybody to submit an appeal on houses to the Department.  I felt after the experience of about 12 months of the handling of this particular section of the Planning Act that it was a complete waste of time.  Therefore I am not in a position to comment on the situation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about social welfare in recent times and I do not intend to dwell too much on it except to say that it appears that the Department of Social Welfare feel that if they give what they call a percentage increase to old people, they are treating them fairly.  How they can decide that if a married man gets a £1 a week <Col N="1046" /> increase plus £1 service pay, which makes £2 per week, and they give 7s to his counterpart on social welfare benefit, it is going to compensate him is something I cannot understand.  We all know that when prices go up, they go up for the person on the fixed income just the same as they go up for the person who can have his income adjusted.  The result is that unfortunate people on social welfare are being left behind.</P>
    <P>Again and again it has been pointed out in this House that the percentage of the national income being spent on social welfare is dropping.  I do not know why that is so.  It is no excuse to say: &ldquo;It is quite all right; we are giving these people an increase.&rdquo;  I should like to point out that when the non-contributory old age pension was introduced in 1908, an old man who reached the age of 70 got 5s and when his wife reached 70, she got 5s as well, making 10s.  The wages for a farm labourer at that time were 9s per week and when he reached 70, he had one shilling more than if he were working full time.  Now the labourer's wage averages something around £10 per week and the most he can get from the non-contributory pension is £2 17s 6d for himself and if he is married he gets less than £5.  If he is married and has had stamps all his life, he will get £5 7s 6d.  We are supposed to be dealing with social welfare sections fairly but it does not take very much to see that that is not a fair way to deal with them.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is this scandal of delays.  The person who applies for a change from a non-contributory old age pension to a non-contributory widow's pension, or from a contributory widow's pension to a contributory old age pension, encounters delay because the pension book has to be returned to the office and months will pass during which the unfortunate concerned will not have a shilling unless he is able to get credit in the local shop.  I have raised this matter before and so have other Deputies until we are sick and tired, but it does not matter.  Apparently there is some system in the Department which prevents these matters from being dealt <Col N="1047" /> with quickly.  On one occasion when the 5s increase was introduced&mdash;which was not given to all&mdash;the excuse given to me when I inquired why an old age pensioner who had sent in his book to have the 5s added only got it six months later, was that there were thousands of books all over the place and not enough staff to deal with them. However, there was enough staff to call them in and no doubt the people dealing with them got their fat cheques at the end of the month and they did not have to go hungry while something to which these people were entitled was not given to them.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister for Finance talking about children's allowances and about the investigation he was carrying out for the purpose of having the system of paying children's allowances altered.  I wonder when he is likely to do something about this?  We all know that there are those who do not need these allowances drawing them while those who do need them are getting a miserly sum.  As I said on the Estimate for the Department, while I do not agree in principle with means tests, if a means test is the only way in which this can be dealt with, then something like it should be introduced to ensure that whatever children's allowances are being paid will be given to those who need them and not to those who do not need them.  If an unfortunate old age pensioner has to undergo a means test, surely the person with £10,000 a year should have a similar test before he draws £3 or £4 a week in children's allowances.  There must be something wrong with the system when this can happen and it will need the intervention of the Taoiseach before the matter can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on the health scheme was mentioned here this morning and all sorts of arguments are going on whether or not our hospitals alone are being regionalised or whether the whole area is being regionalised, but all this is getting us further and further away from whether or not we will in the foreseeable future have a system of a choice of doctor or free medical attention or medicines without people having to take off their caps and beg <Col N="1048" /> for these services.  The introduction of the medical card system, the general medical services register, as it is called, is only a substitute for the old red ticket.  We have the unfortunate position that people who under the red ticket system were entitled to free medical treatment find that because they did not go through the routine of applying for a medical card, they are unable to get free treatment under the system which replaced it.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we must face up to the fact that there are far too few facilities for medical attention at present.  I shudder to think what happens the unfortunate person who has an accident or becomes seriously ill and goes through the routine of having medical attention without being able to follow it up.  I know somebody who was discharged from hospital and who but for the intervention of those who were able to pull strings, would according to the surgeon who operated a week later have been dead in two days if the person had not got the attention which was needed.  What happens to those who have no one to pull strings for them?</P>
    <P>The whole system of medicine will have to be changed.  We have literally thousands of dedicated doctors and nurses, thousands of people working day and night in order to deal as best they can with those who are ill.  The whole system is wrong.  We have people who become ill transported 30 and 40 miles for treatment, despite the fact that there is a hospital immediately adjacent to their homes.  Because of red tape, they are prevented from using the nearest hospital.  This happens in 1968 and it is certainly not improving the position of the sick in this country.</P>
    <P>We must face up to a new health system, and that pretty quickly.  It is not right that the Minister for Health should simply say he is having discussions about this, that and the other. Deputy O'Connell asked a question here about the discussions taking place with the Medical Association to find out if doctors will participate in a new scheme giving a choice of doctor.  The replies he got from the Minister could hardly be termed courteous.  The Minister may have his own views on this, but we have ourselves built up a new <Col N="1049" /> form of procedure in this House.  I have been in the House since 1954 and it is only within recent years that this new procedure seems to have evolved.  The procedure is that Ministers consider that, instead of giving the information for which they are asked by way of Parliamentary Question, they can give a smart answer.  They will, in fact, be both insulting and arrogant, if they think they will get away with it.</P>
    <P>Now that is wrong and the Taoiseach will have to do something about this because the blame will eventually be laid on his shoulders.  If any Deputy, be he a Government supporter or anyone else, wants to ask a question and that question is allowed by the Chair, then the question is supposed to be answered by the Minister.  Formerly, it was the practice of only the Minister for Transport and Power to say that he had no function in the matter; that has changed.  We now have Ministers who say: &ldquo;I will not give the information.&rdquo; This has happened on more than one occasion.  I ask that that whole approach be changed completely.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been mentioned.  We all know the kind of mess into which agriculture has got itself over the past few years.  One Minister after the other seemed to have his own private war with farmers' organisations.  I do not want to add fuel to fire, but it is quite clear to anyone, who wants to see, that the result of the beetgrowers' election recently is evidence enough that that body of farmers are well able to look after their own business.  They have proved that, if they join together to make a decision, then that decision will be made.  In view of what has happened, instead of entrenching themselves, as I believe the Minister and his Department are doing, in their old positions, I suggest that both the Minister and the NFA should now have a new approach to this whole matter.  They are, after all, adults.  The interests of the country are at stake.  Agriculture, whether we like it or not, is our most important industry. I ask the Taoiseach to use his influence, now that there will be a breathing space, to try to ensure that this stupid cold war between the farmers' organisations and the Department of agriculture ceases.  I think a cessation <Col N="1050" /> of hosilities, so to speak, can be brought about by reasonable discussion and I am quite sure the Taoiseach is the man who can mediate successfully, if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Department of Lands, the old system of purchasing land and holding on to it indefinitely still operates.  Two years ago a decision was made that all land must be distributed within two years.  That decision has changed and we now have a situation in which land is held on to year after year and let year after year and, if anything, the position is worse than anything that prevailed under the landlords.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, when the Taoiseach was addressing the House yesterday, he should have laid down the blueprint for the nation for the next 12 months.  Instead of doing that, he dealt with simple matters, matters in relation to which he could claim a certain amount of credit.  Sooner or later the Taoiseach will have to decide that three things must be done.  First of all, we must have full employment and unless the Government make up their minds to have full employment we will not get out of the mess in which we have been for so many years now; secondly, we must make some attempt to try to control our finances so that money will be available for the important things; and thirdly, we must have our priorities right and, when spending money, the Government must ensure that the money is spent on the things on which it should be spent and not on some harebrained schemes which the Government feel will give them kudos for a short term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Tully when he says the Taoiseach availed of the opportunity yesterday to give us a set of statistics rather than a policy for the future and a headline which the country could copy.  I want to take him up now on one figure he gave.  It was the figure for the number of insurance cards, a figure on which he tried to prove there was actually more employment.  I could produce statistics to prove that there has been less employment since the Government took office in 1957, but I will content myself with just one statistic. <Col N="1051" /> It is not up to date because we get the final figures a year late.  I will quote from the volume <i>Employment and Unemployment</i> which is circulated to Deputies from time to time: the work force in 1957 was 1,207,000 persons and in 1966, which is the last year for which final and clear figures are available, the work force was 1,118,000, or a drop of 89,000.  I am using this statistic deliberately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The figure shows that there are 89,000 fewer in employment and the figure for unemployment is 5½ per cent of that work force which, by any European standards, is extremely high.  The figure given to us in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion in regard to the necessary increase in productivity year by year to produce full employment in 1987 is an annual increase of eight per cent. During the 11 years from 1957 to 1968, this Government have never exceeded in their best year, remembering the fluctuations there were, an increase of 4½ per cent.  This means that, no matter what way we look at it, we are falling behind and, if Fianna Fáil continue as they have been doing for the past 11 years, we will be faced with a future of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to our efforts to increase industrial employment and industrial production.  We accept that, as farms become more mechanised, a great many people will have to leave the land.  These will have to be employed in industry.  I have said before, and I was not contradicted, that the risk we run in encouraging new industries is that we seem to have a far greater number of failures than we <Col N="1052" /> should.  We all agree there is a risk. We all agree that any developing country must take risks, but when we find that between £10 million and £20 million have been wasted on ventures that collapsed, it is all too obvious that the Government have not done their job, and it is no defence to say it was Foras Tionscal or some other body which was at fault, because the major failures occurred where grants or loans of over £250,000 were made, and, in that case, it was a Government decision and responsibility for the failure must rest with the Government.  Collective responsibility for the high degree of failure rests with the Government. There is no point in numbering them out because we wish well to those who are staggering along and trying to rejuvenate themselves.  Let the Government accept that that is true.</P>
    <P>At the time when the Prices Stabilisation Order was in operation what happened was that when the cost of raw materials went up and it was obvious that there would have to be an increase in price, there was delay of six or nine months during which time certain companies in this country&mdash;I am glad to see that one is starting a new industry in my constituency&mdash;lost as much as £½ million, which does not encourage investors to come here and start new industries.  In one case where there was control of price, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to come in here for a Supplementary Estimate of £½ million for price increases that he had refused to give previously.</P>
    <P>In all this effort to employ people existing industry has been entirely neglected.  All that you could get by way of grant for existing industry was half of what one could get for a new industry.  At the same time, existing industry which was supplying largely for the home market was paying income tax, corporation profits tax, rates and everything else whereas the new industries which were producing for export got huge grants&mdash;which I do not object to&mdash;and paid no income tax.  It is highly questionable whether or not the accent on that side of the scales of justice was proper or right.  The first point is that it has not employed our people and the second point is that <Col N="1053" /> there has been far too high a degree of failure.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the housing position. The Minister for Local Government stands up and blithely says that we are building more houses now than ever before.  Remember that at the end of the credit squeeze in 1957, when by a trick the Government succeeded in getting the inter-Party Government out of office, their manner of curing that credit squeeze was to reduce the number of houses being built from 10,000 per year to 4,000 per year.  That figure was maintained as an average until 1963. That means that from 1958 to 1963 there was a backlog of 30,000 houses not built.  That is the reason why Deputy Tully can advert to the fact that there are five and six people living in one room in his constituency and in mine.  It is true that in the administrative areas of Drogheda and of the Louth County Council, in my constituency, there are pitiful cases of young married couples who cannot get a house.  We are trying to do something about it now, I agree, but it is the backlog that was built up during their term of office from 1957 to the present day that is the cause of that position.</P>
    <P>Let us also consider the fact mentioned here today that the percentage of Government spending on social welfare is dropping year by year.  In 1958-59, 20.1 per cent of Government spending went to social welfare recipients. I do not want to bore the House with the details of every year since but in 1968-69 that figure has been reduced to 14.4 per cent.  I want to point to the fact that when producing his own figures yesterday the Taoiseach included, as far as I can see from a scrutiny of the figures he gave, things like workmen's compensation which have been included now in the stamp for which the employer and employee are paying a very high premium.  It is from these sources that it is coming&mdash; the employer and the employee&mdash;and not from the Government.  At the same time, of course, they must cover themselves in the normal way against common law actions because the number of compensation cases that go through the courts as opposed to common law actions, as the Taoiseach knows very <Col N="1054" /> well, is not more than ten per cent because most industrial accidents result in common law actions and not in workmen's compensation cases.</P>
    <P>We have been 11 year waiting for a comprehensive health scheme.  I have read the circular sent out by the Irish Medical Association a fortnight ago. It tells us that the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union have again reached violent disagreement with the Minister for Health and that we are as near to a comprehensive health scheme now as we were 11 years ago, and that is not very near.  The answer is the insurance system proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The beet growers' elections have shown the Government that neither their farming TDs not their Minister for Agriculture are acceptable to the farmers.  Deputy Corry had a question here yesterday which is interesting and I will deal with it next.  He was routed in his own area and he is the man regarded as the father of the Beet-growers' Association.  The Taoiseach can take note that the farmers will have no dealings with his Minister for Agriculture.  The action of putting a political Machiavelli into this office instead of someone who knew something about it was prompted by nothing more than a desire to crush the farmers' organisation and to see to it that Fianna Fáil would be the centre of power in this country.  Their entire ideas are based on power.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> is the main farming paper circulating in this country.  Do not think that I hold anything for it in my heart.  In fact, I have a letter in it this week disagreeing with their editorial of the previous week.  It is the paper read by 90 per cent of farmers and has five times the circulation of any other farming paper. Because of a row with the Minister for Agriculture and because of disagreement, the Department of Agriculture no longer places advertisements with that paper.  That means that the farmer who buys the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> cannot see what he can get by way of grant or loan or what the Department's policy is and must buy the <i>Irish Press</i> or some other daily paper in order to <Col N="1055" /> consult the advertisements that help him to conduct his business.  That is nothing but pure spite, malice and vindictiveness.  It shows that Fianna Fáil believe that they have the power to rule and that nobody can take it from them.  Let it be known to the House and to the people of the country that I have checked today deliberately, so that I could say it in this House if it were true, that from the time of the farmers' row, not one Department of Agriculture or Government advertisement has appeared in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, the main farming paper.  As I have said, I hold no brief for that paper and have a letter in it this week criticising the leading article of the previous week.</P>
    <P>There was the infamous calf subsidy. Deputy Corry obliged us yesterday by asking a question as to how much it cost.  Up to the present date it has cost £8,797,470.  I now want to advert to a statement by the Minister for Agriculture a few months ago when he came back from the British Minister for Agriculture with his tail between his legs because he could not get any extra subsidy on beef above the quota of 25,000 tons of Irish beef included in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  His statement was that there were 200,000 less cattle to export this year than last year.  I listened to the Taoiseach's statement last week that there are less cattle in the country. Three years ago we proposed a heifer subsidy whereby every heifer would get a smaller amount of money but just because we proposed that sound and detailed scheme, Fianna Fáil had to do something different.  The first year they included a figure of £350,000 in their Book of Estimates for their heifer scheme and so wrong were they when the <i>entrepreneurs</i> jumped in and got their 100 heifers and £1,500 and got out, that they had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in the same year for £1,900,000.</P>
    <P>Let us face it then, there is no solace for the farmers from Fianna Fáil.  There is no means, no policy, that can substitute for the long-term Fine Gael policy of consultation with the farmers on agricultural credit and agricultural <Col N="1056" /> investment and the building up of production on the farm along the right lines at the same time as you build up your marketing arrangements. That has been Fine Gael policy for many years and all we want is the opportunity to get in.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach devoted much time to education.  He adverted to the school buses and the devil-knows-what.  I want to advert now to three matters.  First, the technological colleges all over this country, which were to educate our boys and girls for industry after two years in the ordinary technical schools, have not yet been built.  It is years ago since we were discussing at Louth County Council the site for the technological college for Louth, Monaghan and Cavan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not before time. Second, no matter what the Taoiseach says and no matter what gimmicks he produces, after 11 years of continuous Fianna Fáil Government and most of the time since 1933, the school-leaving age is still at the miserable figure of 14 years.  In rural Ireland, most children are being taught by unqualified teachers because there are not sufficient qualified teachers.  The Taoiseach regarded it as a great step forward that we had the same number of pupils but had 1,000 more primary teachers.  You have been in office most of the time since 1933 and most of the boys and girls in rural Ireland are still being taught by unqualified teachers.  That is another reason why you should be out.</P>
      <P>The vital business of this session of the 18th Dáil has been the Fourth and Third Amendment of the Constitution Bills.  The Fourth Amendment is to remove proportional representation&mdash; the people's right is the phrase to use for that.  The Third Amendment is to allow Fianna Fáil to make three votes in one place the equal of one somewhere else.  I do not think anybody is innocent enough to believe that this is being done for the good of the people. Everybody will agree that it is being done for the good of the Fianna Fáil Party and nothing else.</P>

In the last six by-elections, certain trends were evident.  In the cities, Labour made spectacular gains.  Fine Gael held their ground in the cities and increased it spectacularly in the rural areas.  Percentage-wise Fianna Fáil lost votes in every one of them.  Those trends are there, but before they were established in the local elections last year certain studies were made&mdash;I am not claiming Fine Gael are going to get a fantastic increase&mdash;by two well-known economists: Senator Dooge of Cork and Senator Garret FitzGerald, both Fine Gael men.  I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil and Labour made their studies, too, but I am presenting the result of our studies, whether it bodes ill or well.</P>
      <P>If the next Dáil contains 145 seats instead of 144, the results would be as follows: Fianna Fáil, 65 seats; Fine Gael, 55; Labour, 25 seats.  I now want to advert to the state of the 18th Dáil. At present the Government have 75 seats.  One of them is your own, Sir. You have come to occupy the office of Ceann Comhairle.  That leaves an ordinary voting strength, except in the event of a draw, of 74 for Fianna Fáil. Three of those seats are seats won in by-elections which under PR could never be won again by the Government. For instance, they could never hope to have a second seat in Waterford or in some other place where they had their maximum number.  This means that, if one takes away your luck, the figure in the 18th Dáil would be 71 seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we then take into account the trend in the by-elections away from the Government, a good increase for Labour in the cities, Fine Gael holding their own in the cities and increasing spectacularly in the country areas, there is no doubt at all that in the 19th <Col N="1058" /> Dáil Fianna Fáil will not have an overall majority.  I want everyone in the country to know that this is an inescapable fact.  Unless the Government can wave a magic wand and reverse the trend in some way their position will go from bad to worse. The Referendum will be defeated and the next election will be held under PR. In that situation we are going to have something of the order of a majority of 80 seats against the present Government.</P>
    <P>Nothing sickens me more than all this talk about coalitions and loss of integrity.  Fine Gael distinguished itself in two inter-Party Governments, and I use that word deliberately.  From 1948 to 1951, 1,000 people were put to work for every month of 36 months.  Fianna Fáil before they went out of office had removed the food subsidies, but never forget that the inter-Party Government restored £9 million of food subsidies in their first six weeks of office.  That is a record of integrity worth repeating.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government were removed from office by the &ldquo;spoiled five of Irish politics&rdquo;, the five defectors. We all know that the day of the Independent in Irish politics is gone.  The position now is that the Parties are so well organised in every constituency that possibly one Independent might be returned at the next election.  As we will have a Dáil composed of Party members, if there was a Party supported by a majority of the Dáil or if an inter-Party Government were sitting, they could not be got out.  Let us consider those five Independents.  Some of them, God rest them, are now gone to their reward.  A while ago I adverted to one of them&mdash;he is still living&mdash;and said that his reward was that he was made chairman of the Hospitals Commission at £1,000 a year.  I want to apologise to you, Sir, for making a slight error.  I understand the figure is £2,000.</P>
    <P>The second inter-Party Government was brought down by the defection of Clann na Poblachta, a small Party.  I want to ask the people outside and the skilled politicians here: is it likely we are going to have any more small Parties here?  If the Fine Gael Party is organised in every constituency as it never was before, if Fianna Fáil and <Col N="1059" /> Labour are similarly organised, is it possible that there is an opening for small Parties such as Clann na Poblachta?</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that, if there is a majority against the Government after the next election, as there surely will be, whatever Government will follow will not be Fianna Fáil.  I want to suggest to the 18th Dáil, which I hope is largely the same people as will be in the 19th Dáil, that the Fine Gael policy for a Just Society is the only policy that can possibly succeed where Fianna Fáil have failed.  I want to show the difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  The difference is that they exist for power and we exist for policy.</P>
    <P>That man's father, the late Mr. W. T. Cosgrave, God rest him, is the proof of that.  He did not seek to get back into power when the people indicated they wanted somebody else.  He retired in decency.  When we came to bury this man we know how many people thought so much about him.  He had the biggest funeral ever seen in this city and country.  His son does not seek power, but his son will work for a policy.  One thing will happen <i>Deo volente</i> after the next election, and that is that Deputy Cosgrave will be proposed as Taoiseach and will be proposed on the basis of this policy, the policy of a Just Society.  As regards industry, we are a private enterprise Party and we will encourage and help private enterprise in every possible way, but when private enterprise has failed to give us the full employment that Fianna Fáil could not give us and which, judging by all the trends, they cannot give us by 1980, we shall, horse, foot and artillery, by any means in our power, see to it that we have full employment and that our gross national product is increased by the necessary eight per cent per year in order to achieve that target.</P>
    <P>I use the phrase &ldquo;horse, foot and artillery&rdquo; deliberately.  At the same time, I want to assure businessmen that Fine Gael has its feet on the ground and that its policy will be stable and will allow them to get their chance, as Fianna Fáil did not allow them an equal chance with foreign industrialists <Col N="1060" /> coming in here, to defend their jobs in the case of 75 per cent of our industries which will be wide open to competition under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in 1975.</P>
    <P>It is highly important that we should discuss this: there is no great need in this country for a father figure at 84 years of age sitting in the Élysée Palace who sacks a 38-year-old man and puts in a 61-year-old man because the 38-year-old man does not believe in the full co-operation of labour in management and industry.  We are not a nation of monopolists, not a nation in which we have a great number of monopolies or cartels.  We are a nation&mdash;thanks to Deputy Dillon's forbears&mdash;of farmers who own their own land and are proud of that, and they now, as proprietors, can work their lands and get profit for their families, and of shopkeepers who are not getting too much profit&mdash;in many cases, getting too little&mdash;and of industrialists who are not getting too much profit but in many cases too little, and are not organised in cartels or monopolies.  There is no need for any kind of nineteenth century socialism or for the kind of thing we see in continental countries.  We are a country of people who, apart from the unfortunate social welfare recipients, are more or less all in the same income bracket.  Therefore it is impossible for us to make wild surges to the right or to the left.</P>
    <P>May I advert to labour relations?  I was proud of our Leader, Deputy Cosgrave, yesterday when he spent a full 30 minutes talking about labour relations.  Let it be recorded here and now that the 42-point plan put up to the trade unions 18 months ago is rejected and that nothing has been done since.  Labour relations, particularly with Government Departments, have assumed the appearance of catch-as-catch-can wrestling.  The Fine Gael policy enunciated some years ago of contract service taken up by such firms as Aer Lingus, Guinness and many others is the only means by which we can have good labour relations.  On that basis we can all go forward.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael policy is this: we will work for the people of the country, <Col N="1061" /> not for power but for policy.  We will work with anybody supporting us and we will do that on the basis that not one iota of integrity or policy was sacrificed in 1948 or in 1954 and there is no intention of sacrificing one iota of the integrity of our Leader or our Party in the 19th Dáil.  One thing is certain and it is that on the figures &mdash; and the people should know &mdash; Fianna Fáil are out and most probably we are in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by referring to Deputy Dillon's observations on my absence during the forenoon.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the office of Taoiseach is a fairly busy one and that there are many calls on his time, and that on no particular day can he devote his attention to only one particular topic.  I was unfortunately called out of the Dáil this morning to attend to a number of matters, including consultations with some Ministers.  It was not my deliberate intention to be absent from the Dáil during the debate.  Certainly, it was not by my choice, although what capital or what point Deputy Dillon wants to make out of this I do not know.  I am sure he realises the position as well as I do.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Donegan has gone because I am sure there are knees quaking in the Élysée Palace today after that speech which I think might as well have been delivered from a fence at the crossroads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting: I am just expressing regret that he has gone.  In introducing the debate yesterday, I said we had made very good recovery from the economic difficulties which beset us as well as every other country.  I said, however, that we were not satisfied with the rate of progress we had achieved or with the number of new jobs we have created.  Nevertheless, I highlighted the advance and the progress we had made and since then Opposition speakers seem to suggest that no progress whatever had been made in the past couple of years since the recession was overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The rate of economic growth, the level of employment, the level of exports, are all generally regarded as firm and reliable indicators as to how the economy is going.  The rate of economic growth which is estimated, as I said in my opening statement, at 4½ per cent this year is higher than the average rate between 1960 and 1965, and is, I think, one which would indicate progress.  A big increase in employment is another.  The remarkable increase in our exports, both agricultural and industrial, is another indication of the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>I agree that one of the main tasks in any economic development is to create new jobs in industry, not only to absorb those coming off the land but to absorb also the increasing population which we now happily enjoy. Another of the main tasks, even though we must admit the phenomenon of people leaving the land, is to ensure that as many as possible will live on the land, in reasonable comfort.  The guidelines for full employment were, as the House is aware, set out by the NIEC Report on Full Employment a couple of years ago.  It is the full attainment of that objective to which this Government are committed and which will be the mainspring of all our economic policies and plans for the future.  It is within the framework of that NIEC Report that the Third Programme will be framed to highlight the policy changes which the Government envisaged and the action which will be necessary in order rapidly to advance towards the achievement of this national objective of full employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan, in the course of his remarks made what appeared to me to be some disparaging references to our efforts to attract foreign industrialists. As I understood it, the policy of all Parties, as endorsed by the Leader and Deputy Sweetman in the Fine Gael Party, and to some extent initiated by the late Deputy Norton when he was Minister and Leader of the Labour Party, was, to the fullest possible extent consistent with our own concept of national progress, to encourage industrialists from abroad to come to this country.  We encourage them not only because they bring in <Col N="1063" /> foreign capital, which is needed in any event, but also because they bring to us technological know-how in which we have been, and still are, deficient to a considerable degree.  As well as that, they bring access to markets which they, as already well-established international industrialists, have and which would be difficult for us to attain without their presence.</P>
    <P>This country is far from being the automatic choice for the location of industries for those from abroad who have the skills, the capital and the markets.  Other countries have the same kind of inducements &mdash; in some cases, they claim better inducements&mdash; to attract these industrialists to particular locations.  In order to attract industry, in order to attract people with investment, whether they are native or non-native, we must first be seen to be able to run our own affairs in a prudent and reasonable way.  We must ensure that not only Government affairs but management and industrial affairs and trade union affairs are also run on proper lines.</P>
    <P>First of all, we must ensure that if we have industrial disputes, they are settled in a reasonable and civilised way.  If we cannot settle our disputes in that way and if we are going to have the reputation, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out yesterday, of being the second highest country in Europe in the league of lost days through industrial disputes, then we will not succeed in attracting this type of industry. Furthermore, outbursts against industrialists, whether they be foreign or native, will not help to solve the kinds of problems we are trying to solve here.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to one of the main points raised by Deputy Cosgrave when he spoke about consultation with industrialists.  Deputy Cosgrave is obviously not aware of the kind of consultation that has been going on in recent years between the Government and the Minister immediately responsible, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and industrialists.  Exactly that type of consultation that he proposes now has been going on in a variety of ways.  I should like to spell <Col N="1064" /> them out.  For example, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been in continual consultation with the Federation of Irish Industries.  He has established a system of periodic meetings with them, of periodic meetings with representatives of different sectors of industry and also with the chairman of the adaptation councils.  The Minister personally conducts these conferences, and a wide range of matters of mutual interest to the industrialists and to the Department are discussed.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the Industrial Reorganisation Branch was set up about six years ago in the Department of Industry and Commerce and has regular contacts with industry.  Representatives of the branch regularly visit factories, finding out what the problems of industry are and what suggestions industrialists have to make.  They have been carrying out these visits in the past few months at the rate of about 50 or 60 per month.  If that is not consultation, I do not know what is.  As well as that, contacts with individual industrialists are made by the Branch and not only with individual industrialists but with the chairmen of the different adaptation councils.</P>
    <P>The Branch is also responsible for conducting the annual reviews of industrial progress, and these afford further opportunities of making these contacts, of getting the views of industrialists, of hearing the problems with which they are confronted and seeing how best they can be solved mutually. Apart from these direct contacts by the Department itself, by the Minister, by his officers, there are the other agencies in the Department.  The Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, all have regular contacts, regular seminars and regular meetings.  In addition, as the House is aware, the industrialists are represented on the National Industrial Economic Council where their views on behalf of industry are expressed, and I might say very well expressed, and conveyed in regular reports from them to the Government.</P>
    <P>Therefore, far from there being no consultation with industry, as Deputy Cosgrave seems to suggest, there has been no complaint on that aspect, that <Col N="1065" /> there has not been adequate opportunity for consultation; indeed the complaint might well be that executives in the various companies have much of their time, too much maybe, according to some of them, taken up by these consultations.</P>
    <P>Speaking of consultation with industry, we are anxious to establish and to keep established proper consultation with the farming community.  Four years ago, the then Taoiseach pointed out that it was difficult for the Government to have the degree of regular and close consultation with the farming community they desired because of the existence of different farming organisations, many of which did not appear to see eye to eye.  Indeed, it was difficult to achieve that degree of close co-operation with farming interests as long as that situation persisted.  Unfortunately, at the time, the organisations did not respond to the appeal made by the Taoiseach and the disunity between the different organisations persisted.</P>
    <P>For the next two and a half years, as the House is aware, there were innumerable and separate contacts between the then Minister for Agriculture and the different farming organisations. In that period, he or his Department had no less than 150 meetings with the organisation that claimed ultimately they were being ignored.  This was the situation that the present Minister for Agriculture faced when he came into office at the end of 1966.  Therefore, early in 1967 he proposed the setting up of a National Agricultural Council.  Let me say at the outset that this was welcomed on all sides at the time.  When it was set up, it was stated that it was not an inflexible organisation, that all farming interests would be welcome to serve on it and that the members themselves within their council would determine what form it would take and how it would operate.</P>
    <P>Although the council, through no fault of the Minister, did not include representatives from the NFA, it did extremely useful work since its setting up.  It can take credit for promoting the introduction of many useful schemes for the benefit of farmers.  These range <Col N="1066" /> from the derating of agricultural land up to £20 valuation to the establishment of the small farms incentive bonus scheme.  That scheme, as the House is aware, was first recommended in a certain form by a committee set up by the Minister to investigate the suggestion of a two-tier price for milk.  They came up with the suggestion of this incentive bonus scheme.  It was examined and processed by the National Agricultural Council, and happily it is now in existence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has recently stated in the House in reply to a question on this very subject that all aspects of the constitution of the National Agricultural Council are receiving consideration and that a statement would not be appropriate at that stage.  I should like to repeat what the Minister said on several occasions, that he personally has no quarrel with farmers as such.  The Minister is not in dispute with farmers or with any organisation.  He is prepared to meet and deal with a council representing the major organisations, if such a council is formed by them.  What is needed now is a dialogue between the farming organisations themselves to see if they can establish a council that will serve all farmers and ensure that no one farming organisation can arrogate to itself the function of speaking on behalf of all farmers.  I want to repeat again that this Council was set up to be a flexible one in which the members themselves could determine its form and function, and that is still the case.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Cosgrave comparing Government expenditure on education in the current year with that in 1930-31.  He made the point that the proportion of State expenditure devoted to education in 1930-31 as against the present time was 22 per cent compared with 14 per cent. He failed to make the point that currently expenditure now stands at £49 million, and is no less than 11 times as great as it was in 1931 in absolute terms.  Deputy Cosgrave did not make another comparison which he might lawfully have made between 1930-31 and the current financial year, that is, a comparison between the amount of money allocated to agriculture which <Col N="1067" /> has increased no less than 55 times.  If any Deputy wants to check that, he can look it up in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I was also surprised to hear Deputy Cosgrave speaking about education because, as he knows, the record of the Government of which he was a member in 1956-57, in their desire to improve our educational facilities, was that when they were seeking a retrenchment in the economy, they turned first to education and cut the grant payable to vocational schools by six per cent, and the grant payable to secondary schools by ten per cent.  Is it any wonder that we regard the announcement by Fine Gael of plans for education with a great deal of suspicion?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke at great length on industrial relations, as Deputy Donegan just mentioned.  As I said already, unless we can settle our industrial problems and industrial disputes in an orderly and civilised way, we will have great difficulty in attracting industry from abroad, or in inducing our own people who have investments to make anywhere, to invest in this country.  Unless we can do that, we will stand condemned not only before people abroad, but before our own people, people for whom we are anxious to procure new employment. Industrialists are certainly not likely to invest in our industries if they are to be characterised by people who ought to know better as hooded crows and international ghouls.  I do not think that that kind of outburst coming from the man who made it recently, or any responsible person, will serve the cause of increasing industrial employment. Neither will the wanton destruction of property which was associated with at least one dispute in recent times.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the old barriers which existed between workers and employers should be broken down.  The old days when the workers were regarded as only another chattel in the stock in trade of industrialists will have to go.  It is not enough nowadays to employ a personnel officer and entrust all personal relations to him.  The personnel officer must be trained and, if the organisation <Col N="1068" /> is big enough, he must have a properly trained staff.  He must not only ensure that as they arise the grievances of the workers are properly investigated and eliminated where possible, but he must also seek out different areas where grievances are likely to arise.  He must not be only a buffer between management and workers but must take the part of the workers when he sees it to be his duty and he must bring up problems, if they do not raise them themselves, before the management. That is the role I see for a personnel officer in our modern industries and our economic set-up.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about industrial democracy by people who do not know much about what it means.  It is something which the Government are anxious to examine, and if we can ensure that if we introduce it, it will be to the better advantage of our industiral expansion, we will do so.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have recently made an examination of it and, if they have not published a report, they have certain views to disclose on it.  Some time ago the Minister for Labour asked the Federated Union of Employers to examine this question and make their comments to him. These, and many other problems, are some of the items which are engaging at present the active and continuous attention of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said glibly the other day that the Minister for Labour saw his task as one of introducing legislation only.  I am very glad that a Fianna Fáil Minister for Labour introduced the type of legislation for which he was responsible recently.  I am happy that he introduced legislation which provided for retraining and resettlement grants, for the setting up of An Chomhairle Oiliúna, and also legislation providing for redundancy payments for workers who, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of employment.  This is an important aspect of his work but, as Deputy Corish knows well, it is not all he is doing.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Corish forget the part the Minister played in resolving the recent EI dispute, a dispute which apparently the trade union leaders <Col N="1069" /> themselves were unable to resolve? After the failure of the trade union leaders, the Minister for Labour got back into the picture himself, and not only by himself but through his officials, and fortunately a happy settlement in that situation has been brought about.  Similarly in the recent ESB strike, it was the personal intervention of the Minister for Labour which resolved the breakdown of communications between the trade unions and the trade union leaders themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned a few minutes ago that they have some plan for the betterment of industrial relations. We should all like to have improved wages and conditions of employment without the destruction, without the disturbance and hardship, which usually follow in the wake of strikes.  To accept the freedom which we believe should exist, that is, freedom in negotiations between workers and employers, is to accept the inherent risk that this freedom may well lead to strikes, or to a degree of inflation, or even both.  If Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Corish has a different policy, I should like to hear it.  I should like to see how that different policy could be proved to be better than the one which now exists, of free negotiation.  If they have a different method, it could well have worse faults, but, as I see it, we are prepared to have the faults and the merits of the system we now have examined, to eliminate the faults and enhance the merits where possible.</P>
    <P>Whatever system emerges our policy, like that of anyone else, is to ensure that conditions of employment, or wages and working conditions, will be improved, consistent with the improvement generally in our economy.  There is no point in Labour Deputies who are in trade unions defending their own side when, in defending their own side, they disregard the consequences of that defence or close their minds to any change that is necessary.  They can talk about a breakdown in the relationship between workers and management, but there is one aspect of communications and relationships which I should like to put to the trade unions, that is, the continuous breakdown of relationships and communications between the workers and the trade union <Col N="1070" /> officials themselves.  In strike after strike, what is happening nowadays is that it is an unofficial strike.  An unofficial strike obviously means one that is effected, first of all, without the knowledge, and secondly, without the approval, of the trade union leaders.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an onus on the trade union leaders in particular to ensure that the system of communications between themselves and the people they represent is properly established and maintained, and to ensure, as far as possible, without merely decrying unofficial strikes, that, within their ranks, they will eliminate whatever imperfections there are that may cause unofficial strikes.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of these few remarks that our main task is to increase employment.  I agree with Deputy Corish in the point he made in that respect.  In the review of the National Industrial Economic Council of our industrial potential generally, they estimated, in their Report on Full Employment, that it would be necessary for us, in order to achieve full employment by 1980, to increase our industrial output one-and-a-half times in the intervening period.  That, possibly, is an understatement.  Even if it is an understatement, it will be difficult for us to achieve it but I believe it is within our capacity.  I believe the plans we are now putting into effect will achieve what we seek in this respect.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, we announced a year ago that the whole concept of industrial development inducements, aids and assistance was to be reviewed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Since then, there have been further announcements &mdash; the establishment of the Small Industries Scheme, the availability of the re-equipment and modernisation grants to replace the old adaptation grants that were of limited duration only and, as well, the plan for regional re-organisation for industrial development.  The plan for the re-organisation of the Shannon, Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary region has been started.  The committee embraces the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and, in addition, represents the county councils <Col N="1071" /> of these areas and the development councils.  If this is not the type of consultation Deputy Cosgrave suggests, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>All of these things are being done and at a considerably increasing rate. Our aim is to ensure that the facilities to assist industry are expanded as a matter of urgency, that procedures for dealing with grant applications are simplified, improved and as streamlined as we can possibly make them and that the range of incentives which this country has to offer to our own or to incoming industrialists will be at least as attractive as that in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>In the light of the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation and its resolve to encourage existing industry to do everything possible to adapt itself to free trade conditions, the Government, through that scheme of adaptation grants and the modernisation and improvement grants, have succeeded in bringing about an upsurge of capital investment in new plant and machinery which I think everybody will agree is the basic need for the expansion of employment.  As well as that, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced the other day new proposals he has in mind for the improvement of our industrial grants system.  He announced the re-organisation of the Industrial Development Authority and other measures.  Many of these measures are already in existence. Their implementation is now under way, even though, in some cases, the necessary legislation is not passed, but the Minister will be introducing, in the coming session, the legislation necessary to cover what is being done now and to cover what it is not possible to do without that legislation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in last year's Budget, the Minister for Finance introduced a system of free depreciation allowance on plant and machinery in western areas: in other words, he left it to industrialists themselves to decide when they would choose to take advantage of the tax allowances which free depreciation gives them.  In the rest of the country, he increased last year from 40 per cent to 50 per cent the <Col N="1072" /> initial allowances on depreciation of machinery.  This year, he has increased it to 60 per cent but this 60 per cent rate will operate only up to the period ending 31st March, 1971.  That is to ensure that the necessary degree of expedition will attend the efforts of our industrialists.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned social welfare in the course of the debate &mdash; the deficiencies of social welfare and the things that ought to be done.  I do not propose to go into it in any detail now because it is only a little over a week since the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare was discussed in this House.  However, as I announced last year, I charged the Minister for Social Welfare to undertake a complete review of our social welfare system.  I do not know if he told it to the House last week but I can now say that not only has that review been under way but that the recommendations, as a result of that review, are now before the Government. I think we can reasonably expect that we can implement some of the recommendations in the near future. Let me say, however, that it is one thing to make a review but another thing to introduce legislation to cover the details of that review.  The important thing is to ensure that we generate sufficient economic activity whereby we can pay for these services which we know our people so badly need.  Nobody owes us a living from any part of the world.  Unless we create it for ourselves, unless we create conditions whereby we can help the weaker sections of the community out of our earnings, we cannot have the sort of social services everybody desires.</P>
    <P>Housing was mentioned on a number of occasions during the course of the debate.  I should like to refer to some of the criticisms.  I welcome criticism so long as it is constructive.  Many people in this House make criticisms and I readily admit they are entitled to do so. However, many people outside this House have been criticising our housing progress for their own ends which are not always wholesome ones.</P>
    <P>From 1959-60 up to the present time, we have expended more than <Col N="1073" /> £300 million on housing in this country. That is three times more than was spent in any ten-year period since 1930.  People can say, as was said yesterday, that the value of money has decreased considerably but nobody will tell me that the value of money now, as compared with some few years ago, has depreciated by three times.  Out of that £300 million, the Government provided £164 million in direct subvention of houses, the rest coming from private sources &mdash; building societies, insurance companies and others.  Let me take 1959 as an example.  In that year, the total expenditure on housing was £12.7 million, of which the State provided £7.88 million or almost £8 million. This year, the total will be £52 million, of which the State will provide £28.8 million or almost £29 million.</P>
    <P>Time and time again, we hear about the empty houses that existed in 1956-57. I was a member of a local authority in 1956 and in the early part of 1957. At that time, as a member of a local authority, in company with other members, I was refused a loan for necessary housing in Cork by the Munster and Leinster Bank.  At that time, as everybody knows, there was a slump in housing.  Housing dropped off. No new building commenced in that year or in the following year and the industry began to recover only the year after that again.  The result was that of the 10,000 houses or so built about that time, there was a gradual reduction because it takes a cycle of about three years for the houses planned now to come out of the pipeline in three years' time.  There was a fall-off by reason of the fact that money was not available and only 6,300 were built in 1959-60.  There was a slow recovery but it was well-advanced by 1964.  Then the Government announced that in the next six years up to 1970, they aimed to build between 12,000 and 14,000 a year.  We have made that recovery and last year about 12,000 houses were built and this year there will be no less than 13,000 houses built.  Therefore, we are back on target again and we hope, and I am confident, that the target of 14,000 houses per year by 1970 will be reached.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with <Col N="1074" /> remarks made by Deputy O'Leary yesterday.  He made what I regard as a cynical speech, a rather cynical approach to our problems generally. Deputy O'Leary is a young, able and versatile Deputy but I do not think that the type of tactics he used yesterday in sneering at his opponents will get him or his Party very far.  For example, he sneered at my visits to the capitals of the Common Market countries.  I do not like to conduct this or any other debate in this House on a personal basis, but he said that he wondered whether I had discussed with the heads of Government of the Common Market countries hurling &ldquo;or some other subject dear to my heart,&rdquo; and he tried to belittle these efforts and to suggest that because I have an attachment to a particular game, I can exclude everything else from my mind.  I want to assure the Deputy that when I went abroad, the subject dearest to my heart was the advancement of the Irish nation and our earliest possible accession to the European Economic Community.  I am not going to refer any more to what he said, except to say that he ended his speech with an announcement of the publication of a new labour policy in about a fortnight.  I do not mind Labour competition with Fine Gael over which Party can get out more policies in the shortest time but I would like to know if this policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would be interesting to know, and it would also be interesting to know on what basis this coalition would be effective.  Would it be on the basis of a policy of retrenchment of our capital programme which Deputy Sweetman foreshadowed a couple of weeks ago?  Deputies will remember that when we announced our capital programme of £130 million, Deputy Sweetman said that it was too much and that we should cut back on something or other but he did not say on what.</P>
      <P>Would it be on that basis or on the basis of the policies of the workers' socialist republic, or on the basis of Deputy Cosgrave's Ard-Fheis speech which Deputy Dillon has since characterised as the policy of Lord Lucan, of the Great Exterminator, or would it be on the basis of membership of the EEC which Fine Gael say they favour and which the Labour Party say they are against?

      <P>I think I can claim permission.  I want to pick out one statement made by Deputy Dillon, not in the course of this debate but in an earlier debate.  He said something to the effect that, if I had the strength of character I ought to have, I should ensure that the referendum proposals were dropped.  That is a fairly strong statement coming from a man who himself has not got the strength of character to maintain what he believes in, to maintain his opposition to the <Col N="1078" /> proportional representation system as a fraud and a cod.  He now says it is no longer a fraud but something that is going to protect the Labour Party. Deputy Dillon is very concerned about the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no problem at all.  It is the Labour Party who have the problem.  As I understand strength of character, it means that, if a person believes a thing is right, then it is his duty, and he accepts it as such, to ensure that he acts accordingly and not like a coward who, for the sake of expediency, runs away from what he believes to be right.  That is what I believe strength of character is and it is because we believe that what we propose to the people in the referendum is right that we have vigorously pursued these proposals, without amendment, in this House.  It is because we believe that, that every member of the Government and every member of our Party will fight hard and often to ensure that these proposals are, first, properly explained to the people and, secondly, adopted by the people.  We believe these proposals are in the long-term interests of the people.</P>
      <P>The Parties opposite claim that it is because we are anxious for power. Of course, we are anxious for power because, without power, we can do nothing to implement our policies.  The Parties opposite do not seem to want power.  At least one of them seems to be glad to sit it out, waiting for Labour to give them a piggyback into power. We are anxious for power in order to implement our policies.  To the Parties opposite I say that we will fight not only the referendum but the next election every inch of the way in order to ensure that we will continue in office to implement our policies of economic advancement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon I asked the Minister for Local Government a question in regard to local improvements scheme grants given to Cork County Council. For the past 40 years local improvements scheme grants were given by the State.  This year the county council were invited to take them over.  We were quite prepared to do so.  What we were not prepared to do was to take over the neglect by the Department of Local Government represented by the three years' backlog.  Schemes were sent down to us with a £25,000 grant to do them.  Mark you, I have a far higher opinion of our county engineers than I have of the geniuses of engineers in the Department of Local Government. When we handed the schemes over to our county engineers, we found that a <Col N="1080" /> backlog of 124 schemes which had been lodged with the Department of Local Government over a period of years was sent down to us to be done, in addition to the proposals from our local people.</P>
    <P>My question asked the Minister whether he was prepared to give us the amount of money necessary to cover the backlog due to the neglect on the part of his Department.  That is what this matter rests on.  I am in a responsible position as chairman of the largest county council in this country.  I fully realise the honour conferred on me by my colleagues in the county council.  A couple of years ago I had to prove how much I prized the honour that had been conferred on me in that respect and I did prove it.</P>
    <P>It is a straight question.  The only thing that I can advise my county council to do if the Minister refuses to do as I have asked is to return the schemes to the Department and let them carry them out.  What I am not prepared to do is to have the representatives of the ratepayers in Cork County blamed and held responsible by the ratepayers whom they represent for not having the proposals carried out.  If I cannot get some reasonable agreement here with the Minister this evening, my advice to Cork County Council will be to return immediately to the Department of Local Government the backlog that exists and let the Department do the work.  I am not going to have the blame for the failure to carry out these schemes transferred from civil servants in the Department of Local Government to my engineers and my comrades in Cork County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the course that I intend recommending to my council. We were asked, and I agreed, that, in the interests of economy for all the parties concerned, this work could have been done far more reasonably and more cheaply by Cork County Council than through the Department of Local Government.  I know my engineering team in Cork.  I have been associated with them for the past 44 years.  I have <Col N="1081" /> known each generation of them.  I know their value; I know their worth.  It is grossly unfair and unjust for any Department of State to ask a local authority to take over proposals such as these and then to send them two or three years' arrears of work and send them only the money to cover their present requirements, ignoring completely the backlog that exists.  That is the situation.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister here today to meet this backlog.  I do not think I am asking too much.  When I see the money that is being squandered in millions by that very Department for the improvement of roads for tourists, surely something can be allocated to carry out this work to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in Cork is that in the case of ratepayers living half a mile up a boreen the roads will be brought up to standard under the local improvements scheme and will then be taken over by the county council and maintained by them.  That policy has been <Col N="1082" /> operated for the past three years and I want a continuation of that policy but I do not want to have to tell the farmers in my area who have been paying rates all their lifetime and who are not fly-by-night tourists, that their roads cannot be brought up to standard or that for three years they cannot get any of the amenities of life to which they are entitled.  That is what the present position means.  That is my reason for raising this matter today and on the Adjournment.  I realise my position and the responsibility I have as chairman of the largest county council.  While I am in that position, I do not care what Party or what Government are here, I will do my duty by the ratepayers of the county.</P>
