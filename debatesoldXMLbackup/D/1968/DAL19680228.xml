      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that CIE are seeking a ten per cent increase in freight charges on the transport of beet for next season's crop, while they have made package deals with some growers at from 15 per cent to 20 per cent reduced freight charges and while 60 per cent of their total road haulage is carried out by unplated lorry owners who have to pay 12½ per cent to CIE; and that instead of an increase in the price of beet, beet growers are now faced with what amounts to a cut of 10s 6d per ton as against last year's price and conditions; and if under these circumstances he will be prepared to liberalise beet transport and allow it to be delivered by tractor or unplated lorries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 8 of the Transport Act, 1958 CIE may fix such charges as they think fit for any service provided by them.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that they are at present negotiating with representatives of the beet growers about beet haulage rates for next season's crop. On the basis of the information available to me there are no grounds for the Deputy's suggestion that beet growers are faced with an additional expense of 10/6 a ton arising from revised haulage rates.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that there is a need for an amendment of existing legislation to exempt beet haulage from transport licensing controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations are taking place and I have asked for a statement in regard to the increase in the cost of beet haulage arising from the charges made by CIE.  I am informed that as in the case of other commodities, they do make package deals.  I am told the increase would be of the order of 5d to 5/5d a ton maximum, depending on the distance.  I understand that CIE and the plated lorries take about half of the total beet tonnage, the other half being transported by other methods.  CIE are doing their best by negotiating to arrange the best possible price for the members of the Beet Growers Association.</P>

      <P>I am informed by CIE that the section of the Royal Canal between Binn's Bridge and Newcomen Bridge is not, as suggested by the Deputy, at present filled with refuse of all kinds and it is not in an insanitary condition or a danger to public health.  There are small quantities of rubbish in that section of the canal at present which will be cleared away by CIE in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the people of Bonane, County Kerry are anxious to have an ESB survey carried out in the area; and if, having regard to the fact that in the draft development plan for County Kerry it was noted that in the Kenmare rural area 60 per cent of the people <Col N="1924" /> were without ESB connections, he will take steps to have a survey carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that Bonane is in the Board's Tuosist rural area which was developed under the original rural electrification scheme during 1963.  It is planned to start the re-canvass of the area under the rural post-development scheme next October and it is expected that applicants who accept the terms quoted and have their houses wired will be given electricity supply during the following spring.</P>
      <P>The Board say that it is important that the maximum number of householders in the area should agree to accept supply during the re-canvass; the houses in the area are scattered and the refusal of some householders to take supply could have the effect of increasing the terms of the remaining consumers.</P>
      <P>The Board's Kenmare rural area which comprises Kenmare town was developed under the initial rural electrification scheme in 1957.  There was almost one hundred per cent acceptance of the Board's terms for supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that telephone calls from Cornamona to Maam, County Galway, a distance of three miles, are in fact routed through a distance of 120 miles approximately before being connected; and that this causes a disproportionate charge for a call which would normally cost 4d; if he will take steps to ensure that such calls are charged only at the local call rate and, if necessary, arrange for the appropriate telephone lines to be provided, especially to facilitate contact with a doctor or nurse in the areas concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The charge for a call between Cornamona and Maam is 1/- day rate and 9d night rate, plus 3d in each case where the call is made from a coinbox or public telephone.  For charging purposes exchanges are arranged into groups; charges are determined by reference to the radial distance between the group centre exchange in each group and are not influenced by the distance or routing between individual exchanges.</P>
      <P>Cornamona is in the Ballinrobe group and Maam is in the Galway group because their respective community of interest is with the exchanges in these groups.  It is not practicable to allow calls between Cornamona and Maam exceptionally at local call rate. The number of calls between these two exchanges is insufficient to warrant the provision of a direct route between them.</P>

      <P>The arrangement, as I understand it, takes about two weeks on average.  It is very seldom over that.  The first thing we do is to stop payment of the lost orders and get a certificate as to when the final payment was made on the particular book.

In fact a check has to be carried out to find out if the pension orders have come in.  Surely that is entirely unnecessary in view of the fact that they can be checked easily in the office of issue?

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leather footwear has been protected by import quota over the last ten years and this quota is still in operation.  No import duty is payable.  Rubber and plastic footwear was protected by import quota up to the 31st December, 1965.  Since then protection has been by way of import duty only, the current rates being 54 per cent or 9/- per pair (full) 36 per cent or 6/- per pair <Col N="1940" /> (special preferential UK and Northern Ireland).</P>
    <P>A change from quota to tariff protection for leather footwear from 1st July, 1968, is envisaged in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Certain proposals have been made by the Irish manufacturers of leather footwear with regard to the protection which should be afforded to that industry, in the period subsequent to 1st July next. These proposals are being examined but I should add that any departure from the arrangement provided for in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement would require the consent of the British authorities.</P>
    <P>Statistical information on the lines requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.  I have, however, had a tabular statement prepared, which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report, giving the figures from the annual reports to the Oireachtas, showing the quantities authorised to be imported under quota licences issued by my Department, in so far as these figures are still available. It should be pointed out, however, that the quantities licensed do not necessarily represent the quantities imported.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(1) The quota which applied to rubber footwear and footwear with rubber soles and textile uppers was, at the request of the principal manufacturers, terminated on 31st December, 1965 and replaced by tariff protection.  The tariff covers footwear which is made wholly of rubber or plastic.  Footwear with textile uppers was brought under the leather footwear quota.</P>
    <P>(2) Basic quota licences allow the importation of any footwear covered by the quota. Supplementary licences are granted for types for which adequate substitutes are not available from Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>(3) No duty has been payable on footwear imported under quota licences.</P>

Proposals have been submitted by the Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped Children for the provision of hostel accommodation for moderately handicapped children at the special day-school in Galway city.  Certain queries were raised by my Department on this proposal, mainly in regard to the fire standards of the proposed structure and responsibility for its operation.  Representatives of the Association visited my Department last month and said they hoped that a religious order would run the service and also that they were thinking in terms of a permanent building rather than a prefabricated structure as had earlier been proposed.  The Association's representatives were requested to submit their revised proposals for consideration and this submission is at present being awaited.</P>

    <P>The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap estimated that 1,000 beds would be required to meet the need for residential accommodation in respect of severely mentally handicapped <Col N="1942" /> children from all areas.  At the end of 1967 there were 625 such children in residential accommodation and existing proposals will provide accommodation for some further 470 children.  In addition, accommodation being provided for adult mentally handicapped persons should release further accommodation for children so that I do not anticipate that on the basis of current proposals the requirements of the severely mentally handicapped children as estimated by the Commission will fail to be met.</P>

      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 3º of section 2 of article 16 of the Constitution provides that the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.  The subsection thus affirms the principle of democratic representation&mdash;based, it should be noted, on population and not on voters&mdash;and at the same time recognises (by the use of the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;) that some divergence from strict mathematical parity is necessary if a rational system of constituencies is to be devised.  Difficulties have arisen, however, <Col N="1945" /> on two points&mdash;what factors have to be taken into account in determining what is practicable and how great a divergence from the national average is permissible.</P>
    <P>At every revision of constituencies, from 1932 to 1959, the most important factors taken into account, apart from population, were the desirability of respecting county boundaries, of having special regard for the needs of constituents in thinly-populated rural areas and of topographical features such as major rivers and lakes, peninsulas and mountain ranges.  This was done within the limits of a quite modest divergence from the national average.  At the periodic revisions of constituencies up to 1959 the maximum divergences were within the range 11 per cent to 19 per cent approximately of the national average. This was the type of approach that the framers of the Constitution had in mind, it was supported by all Parties in the Dáil in 1959 and it is the approach which appears to be common to democracies.  The revision of constituencies made in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959, in accordance with these principles which appeared to have been established by usage, was as Deputies know challenged in the High Court and that Court, in its judgment on the constitutionality of the Act, held that this type of approach was not permissible, that if the Constitution had intended that regard be had to such matters as the desirability of adhering to county boundaries it would have said so, and in effect that the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; should be given a purely statistical connotation.</P>
    <P>The object of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, is to make the original intention of the Constitution effective, to put beyond doubt the extent to which divergence from the strict mathematical ratio is permissible and to set out expressly the special factors to be taken into account.  It accordingly proposes to substitute for the existing provisions the new subsection 3º, set out in the Schedule to this Bill.  The new subsection has three main provisions. First, the maximum divergence is <Col N="1946" /> fixed at one-sixth of the national average.  Secondly, it is provided that regard be had to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and the need for securing convenient areas of representation.  Thirdly, it is provided that due regard be had to the desirability of avoiding overlapping of county boundaries.</P>
    <P>Taking the provision relating to county boundaries first, it will be noted that this is only set out as a desirable norm, not an absolute requirement.  If all county boundaries were to be preserved the tolerance limit would have to be put at too high a level&mdash;about 30 per cent.  With the level now proposed the county boundary will be observed in the case of the great majority of counties.  The reasons for having due regard to county boundaries may be summarised as follows.</P>
    <P>1.  It is generally recognised by authorities on electoral matters that constituencies should, as far as possible, be based on local communities and respect local sentiment.  It will scarcely be denied that, in the conditions of this country, this means that county boundaries must be respected as far as reasonably possible.  This applies irrespective of whether we have the present system or the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>2.  A considerable part of a Deputy's work on behalf of his constituency will relate to matters within the competence of the county council.  He can, therefore, serve his constituency more effectively if it is wholly within a particular county.</P>
    <P>3.  The whole process of registration of electors and of holding elections is geared to counties.  County councils and county borough councils are responsible for preparing the register of electors and devising polling schemes for their areas.  The returning officer is normally the county registrar.  From the point of view of electoral machinery many complications are caused by the breaching of county boundaries.</P>
    <P>4.  It is desirable that constituencies should be based on some form of existing administrative divisions and the authority responsible for devising <Col N="1947" /> these should be given a definite framework within which to operate.  This is standard practice abroad.  In our conditions, and having regard to the need to cater for two contingencies (single-seat and multi-seat constituencies), the most suitable divisions are counties. Incidentally, constituencies in Britain must normally be confined within counties or boroughs.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of County Boroughs are, in effect, excluded from the provision which aims at preserving county boundaries.  Housing and other community developments have extended the built-up areas across the boundaries of the four County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and it might not be practicable to determine satisfactory constituencies if the overlapping of these city boundaries had to be avoided within the context of the new subsection 3º.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the requirement related to the area of the constituency, the Government have always taken the view that the special difficulties of persons living in large constituencies in rural areas should be recognised.  These people do not have the same ease of access to their Deputies as persons living in the more compact urban constituencies.  Moreover, experience has shown that people living in rural areas are more likely to have to seek the help of their Deputies for quite legitimate reasons.  Any person who disagrees with a slight bias in favour of such areas can scarcely have any idea of the problems of representation for both electors and Deputies in these areas or of the importance of maintaining adequate rural representation in this House.  I might mention that there was broad agreement between all Parties on this point in 1959.</P>
    <P>If then it is accepted that regard must be had to the factors outlined above the question must be faced of how great a divergence from the national average of population per member should be permitted.  It is the view of the Government that the appropriate limit is one-sixth of the national average.  This figure, which it must be remembered is a maximum one, is in line with pre-1959 practice. It will be sufficiently high to obviate <Col N="1948" /> the need for breaches of county boundaries in the case of the great majority of counties and to keep the representation for rural areas at or near the present figure.  At the same time it is sufficiently modest not to involve any departure in principle from democratic representation.  I might say that the figure is low by international standards. In Britain, for example, a tolerance limit of plus or minus 25 per cent was fixed for some years but was abandoned as being too restrictive.  In Canada the figure is 25 per cent and in Australia 20 per cent.  In Germany a spread of 33? per cent is allowed. Some Deputies opposite, speaking under a misapprehension as to the present constitutional provision, have in recent weeks suggested that a tolerance of 10,000 population per Deputy should be sufficient.  We do not propose anything as large as this.</P>
    <P>To clear up any possible misunderstanding which may still exist, I should emphasise that this Bill will have no effect on the total number of Deputies. The tolerance limit proposed in this Bill relates to the national average population per member after the total number of Deputies is fixed.  For instance, if the total number of Deputies is fixed at 144, the national average population per member would be 20,028 and the population per member of each constituency could not deviate from this average by more or less than one-sixth of the average, that is, by more or less than 3,338.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. It proposes no more than that the people be given an opportunity to decide at a referendum whether the Constitution should be amended to enable the Oireachtas at the next and future revisions of constituencies to determine constituencies on the basis contemplated by the framers of the Constitution and at all times accepted by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Bill proposes to set before the people in due course, for their adjudication at a referendum, a number of changes in the present constitutional provisions relating to the method of Dáil elections and the determination of Dáil constituencies.  The principal changes proposed are those relating to the introduction of single-seat constituencies in lieu of the present multi-member constituencies and the replacement of proportional representation by the relative majority system using the single non-transferable vote. The present constitutional requirement that constituencies shall be revised at intervals not longer than 12 years is being retained.</P>
      <P>The present requirement that the membership of the Dáil shall not exceed one Deputy for every 20,000 of the population and may not be less than one Deputy for each 30,000 of population is being recast so that the total number of constituencies at any determination shall not be fixed at less than one constituency for each 30,000 or at more than one constituency for each 20,000 of the population, as ascertained at the census last preceding the determination.  This recasting is necessitated by the provision for the automatic return of the outgoing Ceann Comhairle at a dissolution of the Dáil and for the election of a Deputy to represent the single-seat constituency by which the Ceann Comhairle was returned.  The Bill visualises that the revision of the constituencies will be undertaken by an impartial commission appointed by the Dáil and presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like at the outset to draw a distinction between those elements of our electoral system which are basic to the democratic process and those elements which admit of variation according to circumstances.  To the <Col N="1950" /> former category belong such principles as universal franchise, the secret ballot, the right of individuals and groups to contest elections, the limit on the life of any Parliament, the prevention of electoral abuses and the provision of impartial machinery for the conduct of elections.  These principles are necessary to the democratic system and are put in practice by all democracies.</P>
    <P>To the second category belong such matters as the precise method of voting, whether constituencies should return one or a larger number of members, the machinery for determining constituencies and so on.  In these matters there is no unanimity of view or practice as between democratic countries.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill to provide for single-seat constituencies with voting on the relative majority system, instead of the present system of multi-member constituencies based on the system of proportional representation and the single transferable vote, comes within the second category.  This is not to say that the matter should be considered of no great importance; history shows that the system of voting can have immense influence on a country's political development and this Bill is certainly from this point of view the most important measure that has come before the present Dáil.</P>
    <P>While there is no uniformity of practice or unanimity of view on methods of voting, I must nevertheless point to the impressive array of old-established, stable democracies such as Britain, the United States and Canada, which have the straight vote.  I should also point to the movement of opinion &mdash;and practice&mdash;away from proportional representation, which is now regarded by many people as essentially a nineteenth century development.  The PR system was invented before the growth of modern party organisation in Europe by constitutional theorists who saw a grave danger that the coming of universal franchise would lead to the &ldquo;tyranny of the majority&rdquo;, as it was called.  Their aim was to encourage a fragmentation of parties and the representation of numerous minority interests.</P>
    <P>What marks out PR as so typically <Col N="1951" /> a product of the last century is the assumption it makes concerning the purpose of elections, which it sees as basically a means of producing a deliberative assembly to pass laws.  Its inventors could not, of course, have foreseen the modern extension of the State's role, the growing involvement of the Government in the direction of the economy, the introduction of long-term planning and with it the need to ensure stable government supported by an active Parliamentary majority and able to apply with consistency over a period of years a comprehensive policy of national development. In a modern, developed economy, where the Government play a key role, the electors will wish to choose their Government directly and will consider this as the primary aim of elections.</P>
    <P>At one time, there was quite a substantial volume of influential support in Britain for PR, or at least the alternative vote.  Nowadays, this support is, for all practical purposes, confined to the Liberal Party.  In Germany, where half the seats are filled by means of the straight vote and half by a system of proportional representation, the electorate&mdash;mindful, no doubt, of the disastrous multiplicity of parties which existed under the old Weimar Republic&mdash;have demonstrated in a practical manner their preference for the straight vote system.  Indeed, the major parties there have announced their intention of proposing a change to a system based completely on the straight vote.  In France, the multiplicity of parties which flourished under PR in the Fourth Republic made effective government difficult and eventually impossible.  The extraordinary resurgence of that country under the stable government provided by the Fifth Republic has been associated with a regrouping of political forces and the beginning of a movement away from a multiple-party system.  The present electoral system is similar to that which operated before the war, that is single-seat constituencies with two ballots, but with certain changes to discourage splinter parties.  Public discussion has begun on the desirability of introducing further adjustments in the electoral <Col N="1952" /> law to facilitate the further evolution of present trends.</P>
    <P>The logic of developments within the past decade in this country requires us to consider our own position.  Here, too, the assumption by the State of overall responsibility for the regulation of the economy and the adoption of long-term planning has thrust immense new responsibilities on the Government and increased the need for stable parliamentary majorities to enable policies to be developed over a period of years.  The virtual disappearance of small Parties and Independents from the Dáil and the increased interest shown by the voters in national parties with comprehensive policies has been paralleled by an evolution of thinking within the Parties to the point where each Party in the Dáil is committed to seeking a majority for the implementation of its own policy.  Thus, the Irish people and the Parties in the Dáil have implicitly repudiated any desire for coalition government.  I say &ldquo;implicitly&rdquo; because I doubt if all of us have faced the issue and reasoned the matter to its logical conclusion.  I therefore propose that we ask ourselves two questions.</P>
    <P>The first question is whether we want a multiplicity of Parties and a series of coalition Governments.  I do not propose to argue this question since the defects of coalition are well known and the people have in effect already given their verdict.  I should like, however, to reply to some objections to the system of a small number of Parties raised by supporters of the present system.</P>
    <P>A common objection is that the freedom of choice of the elector is narrowed as compared with the multi-party system.  In fact, the freedom of choice under the multi-party system is illusory.  The voter can vote for a particular Party but he has no means of voting for a Government and its policy since this will depend on post-election compromises.  These compromises may produce a Government and policy of which a majority of electors would not have approved if they had got the opportunity.  Under the system we propose, on the other hand, the elector is able to choose the Government and policy he favours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> Another objection is the contention that a majority of seats may be won by the Party which won not the largest but the second largest number of votes. This can happen only in cases where as in Britain, support for a particular Party is highly localised, involving huge majorities in so-called safe seats.  It has already been pointed out in another context by a Fine Gael Senator that the situation here is different&mdash;we are a homogeneous community and the margin of safety in any area will be smaller.  In fact, there are very few areas, which it is possible to say are definitely pro Fianna Fáil, pro Fine Gael or pro Labour and even in these cases, the volume of extra support for one particular Party is by no means so great as to make it unlikely that a comparatively small swing might produce a change.</P>
    <P>The second question we should ask ourselves is which system of election is more likely to keep the number of Parties to a reasonable figure and facilitate the election of majority Governments. If we are honest, there is only one possible answer.  The theorists who support PR generally admit that it produces a multi-party system&mdash;indeed some authorities claim this as a special virtue of PR.  On the other hand, all those eminent authorities in Western Europe and North America who have supported the straight vote have done so on the basis that it is the system most likely to produce stable government and to avoid a fragmentation of Parties.  So far as actual experience is a guide it is a well-known fact that countries with PR have a multiplicity of Parties and a permanent series of Coalition Governments while the only countries in which the people have the opportunity of making a clear choice have the straight vote.  The only exception is Tasmania.</P>
    <P>Tasmania is a member State of the Commonwealth of Australia and it is natural that the structure of Australian politics&mdash;which is basically two-Party &mdash;would be reproduced there.  Besides it has a small population and a legislative assembly of only 35.  This does <Col N="1954" /> not leave much room for a proliferation of Parties.  In our own case, it is well known that the deep division in the country caused by the Civil War had a strong influence on the development of our political system.  Now that the influence of that division is beginning to wane it would be extremely foolish to ignore the long term possibility inherent in all PR systems, of the emergence of a multi-party system.</P>
    <P>The logic of the position adopted by all Parties in the House and by the people requires that we change our system of voting to the straight vote. Probably because of this most of the opposition to the present proposal is based not on principles or long term considerations but on the supposed immediate effects of the changeover. For this purpose absurd comparisons are drawn between the recent local elections and the next general election. Because of the distribution of the population, there is no possible relationship between single seat constituencies and local electoral areas.  And no valid comparison can be drawn between local elections, contested by a multitude of candidates, and the confrontation to be expected in single seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have interpreted the result of the recent Presidential election as indicating a falling off of support for the Government.  It is peculiar then that they do not see this has an appropriate basis for speculation as to the possible outcome of elections under the system we are proposing. The issue at stake however, is not whether one Party or another secures some marginal advantage at the next election but which system of election is more suited to the country's needs.  At this point, the logic of our position favours the system we are proposing.</P>
    <P>If we consider the effects of the present system at constituency level, the arguments in favour of a change become even stronger.  Indeed a completely consistent form of PR would rule out constituencies altogether, but for practical reasons the system has been operated here on the basis of a number of multi-seat areas.  This, in itself, is an indication that the impracticability of the system was recognised <Col N="1955" /> from the outset.  The members elected in a constituency are primarily the representatives of particular groups, rather than of the whole community.</P>
    <P>This has many undesirable results. Instead of considering the interests of their constituency as a whole, Deputies tend to adopt partisan attitudes towards local problems.  The experience has been that competition between Deputies&mdash;often of the same Party&mdash; has forced some of them to curry favour with voters by pretending to gain favours for them even where benefits are available as of right thus tending to create a false impression in the public mind.  So much time has now to be spent by Deputies in dealing ostensibly on behalf of their constituents with day-to-day matters of administration which it is not necessary for them to deal with and in travelling around extensive and unwieldy constituencies, that they have not enough time left for their primary duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>The introduction of single seat constituencies would alter this situation radically.  In countries where this system operates, the member is regarded as the custodian and champion of the interests of his constituency.  He is the member for the area&mdash;the whole community looks to him as its member in Parliament to promote its interests and he in turn, if he wishes to retain his seat, will look after the interests of the whole community.  He will not be driven by competition of other Deputies into influence peddling.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed he will have a vested interest in avoiding situations where he can obtain a favour for one individual or group at the expense of alienating others within his constituency. This could gradually improve the whole tone of public life.  The member will concentrate more on the general well-being of the constituency and he will be able to do this all the more effectively since the area will be small and he will have an intimate knowledge of all its real problems.  He <Col N="1956" /> will also have much more time to give to his duties as a legislator.</P>
      <P>Under the single-seat system, the political Parties would have every incentive to put forward candidates of a high calibre.  The smaller the constituency the more important the personal factor becomes and single-seat constituencies would be much smaller than the present areas&mdash;a typical constituency would have only about 12,000 electors.  Moreover since each Party would put forward only one candidate he would have to be elected on his own merits and would have to stand comparison with opposition candidates. And since he would not present any danger to an established member on his own side, no Party would ever have reason to choose any but the strongest candidate.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be the position in the large constituencies in other countries, we can be certain that in the conditions which will obtain here there can be no question of Party machines forcing unsuitable candidates on the electorate. The contrary is true: each Party will tend to put forward as candidate the person most likely to command local support.  And under the majority system of voting the candidate obtaining the support of the greatest number of the voters is elected&mdash;which brings me to the actual method of voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defects of the present system have often been pointed out.  Two defects inherent in the system are that all preferences have the same value&mdash; a casually cast 10th or even a 25th preference can have the same value as a No. 1 vote&mdash;and that the preferences of only some candidates are counted. This latter defect, combined with the complicated and arbitrary method of counting and transferring votes, introduces a random element into the process and the ultimate result may be far from what the electorate really intended.  The choice between two effective candidates can depend on the relative position of weaker candidates and the chance transfer of sub parcels of votes.  We all know of candidates who have headed the poll and not been elected.  This random element is all the more serious when as happened in the last general <Col N="1957" /> election only a few votes decided the last seat in some constituencies and as happens in many elections, only a handful of votes decides eliminations. If the returning officer decided to include at an earlier stage a different bundle of an elected candidate's surplus votes, a different result could be achieved.  But this is not the returning officer's fault.  The system obliges him to take random selections from the votes of candidates who receive surpluses for subsequent distribution.</P>
    <P>A further defect of the present system is that, with large constituencies, and a large number of names on the ballot paper, the voter is not given the opportunity of giving a considered decision. Many voters know very little about most of the candidates.  Often they are not even familiar with the Party or the policy of the Party to which the candidates belong.  When the Electoral Act, 1963 was being enacted, there were demands from all sides of the House to have the political affiliation of candidates marked on the ballot paper. Again there is evidence that the later preferences are cast in a somewhat haphazard manner.  There have been demands from certain Deputies that the order of names on the ballot paper should be determined by lot rather than alphabetically on the grounds that candidates higher up on the ballot paper tend to receive more votes than those in a lower position.  If there is such a tendency, it is, of course, aggravated by the long lists of candidates inevitably involved in the present system.</P>
    <P>In short, the present system is confusing and uncertain and does not give the voter the opportunity of making an informed and effective choice between real alternatives.  For this we must look to the single seat constituency with majority voting.</P>
    <P>In single seat areas there would normally be three or four candidates not many more, all of whom would be fairly well known in the area.  Every voter would then have to make up his mind as between the candidates and in due course cast one vote for the <Col N="1958" /> candidate of his choice bearing in mind the likelihood of his being elected as well as his policy.  The candidate securing the most votes would be elected.  The informed choice of the electorate is thus made directly effective.</P>
    <P>My remarks so far have been confined to the principal provision of the Bill, namely, the establishment of single seat constituencies and majority voting.  Most of the remaining provisions deal with the Constituency Commission and can more suitably be discussed at Committee Stage.  There are, however, a few points I should like to make.</P>
    <P>We considered the suggestion, made by Deputy John A. Costello during the debates on the 1958 Bill, that only general principles should be set out in the Constitution, leaving details to be settled by law.  We could not find any completely satisfactory way of doing this and we have therefore adhered to the 1958 formula with some changes.  The proposal that the three Opposition members of the Commission be designated by the Ceann Comhairle has been dropped and instead the matter is to be regulated by law.  The intention is that the choice should be made by the Opposition. We would welcome the views of Deputies on how this might best be done.  There was criticism of the virtually absolute powers given to the Commission under the 1958 Bill.  The principles on which it was to proceed were stated in very general terms, any challenge in the courts was expressly barred, and the Dáil could upset its findings only by a resolution supported by a two-thirds majority, which would in practice be impossible to obtain.  The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968 now provides more definite guidelines and in the present Bill, the bar on resort to the courts has been removed and the Dáil may amend the Commission's report by a simple majority.  I need hardly say that this power of the Dáil which I would put on a par with its power to remove judges, would not normally be used.  However, all these matters can be discussed at Committee Stage and we will be open to consider any constructive <Col N="1959" /> suggestions which may be put forward.</P>
    <P>Approval of this Bill by the House is a necessary condition to placing the proposed amendment of the Constitution before the people.  The Government believe that the people should now have a further opportunity of deciding whether to retain the existing method of election or to adopt the system advocated in this Bill, which, we are convinced, is more suitable in present-day conditions.  The debates in this House will be an important means of placing before the people the arguments for and against the proposal.  In commending the Bill to the House, I would ask that we discuss the issues involved as constructively and as dispassionately as we can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put on the Order Paper in line with the decision taken by the Fine Gael Party that the proposals embraced in the two Bills at present before the House for discussion are in present circumstances unnecessary and that in the case of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, there is a definite attempt to alter the fundamental democratic principle <Col N="1960" /> of &ldquo;one man one vote&rdquo;.  We are opposed to any attempt to alter the Constitution which would in any sense affect the principle of &ldquo;one man one vote&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that principle is the fact that each vote must be of equal value.  Listening to the arguments which were advanced here by the Taoiseach in introducing the first Bill &mdash;that which has been described as the &ldquo;tolerance Bill&rdquo; but which in fact proposes to alter the democratic principle that one man's vote is as good as another's&mdash;one would get the impression that it is not people who elect Deputies but fields or rivers or mountains. Deputies are not elected by the geography of the country and nowadays the inaccessibility of particular parts of the country cannot be adduced as a valid reason for the inability of Deputies to travel to remote parts of the country.  In fact, even CIE will get a Deputy, within three or four hours, to the most remote part of the country and nobody would suggest that their methods of operation are always the most efficient.  If a Deputy or a Minister who has a State car wishes to get there, he can get there far more quickly.  Even on the odd occasions on which Ministers had accidents in State cars, they still reached their destinations.</P>
    <P>The position is, so far as we are concerned, that we believe that the essential democratic principle that must be adhered to is the equality of every individual to use as an individual his vote in electing a Deputy to represent him.  As I understand the principle put forward in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the tolerance which is provided for, or under which Deputies for the future, if this particular amendment is passed would be elected would in effect mean that the influence of the value to be attached to a vote in practice would result in rigging the constituencies in favour of particular areas.</P>
    <P>I am against that.  I am against denying to a constituent in my own constituency, or in Dublin, or in County Dublin, or in Cork city or in Limerick or anywhere else, the same weight in <Col N="1961" /> exercising his or her vote as we would give to a person in a remote rural area.</P>

      <P>A Deputy elected to this Parliament must represent people whose votes are of equal value. This proposal as made in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill means that the voters in some constituencies would have 40 per cent more Dáil representation than those in other areas.  If, say, people need houses in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin or any other part of the country and have been denied houses because of the failure of the Government to provide the necessary funds or necessary plans and to sanction them over the past ten or 11 years, surely they are entitled to assert through their votes their opinions of and their dissatisfaction with the inability and ineffectiveness of Government policy to provide them with what they need, just as a person living in a remote area, even a person living on an island off the coast?  I believe they are entitled to the same weight and their votes are entitled to the same value.  Under this Bill a population of approximately 16,067 in one area is entitled to a Deputy or, as it is apparently becoming fashionable to call them, to a Member, whereas in other areas 40 per cent more of the population, 22,233, may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ascertain from the Taoiseach or somebody else is the tolerance proposed in this Bill around the national average, as the papers have said, or is it different?  As I read this amendment, it would appear that if the Third Amendment goes through and the Fourth Amendment does not, <Col N="1962" /> then the tolerance will not be around the national average of 20.028 per Deputy but around a figure that will vary, depending on how the constituencies are distributed.  This proposal is fundamentally undemocratic. Whatever about the inability in other times when transport was less efficient, when telephonic and other communications were either non-existent or available only in certain areas, there is no justification in present circumstances for a proposal to rig the constituencies.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned here with the practical results of our experience since the State was set up.  As far as this country is concerned, we cannot assert that there has been any instability in government.  There are a number of theoretical defects in proportional representation, but as far as stable government is concerned, this country has had what a number of people have described as not stability but stagnation. Before I finish, I will have to pose certain questions to those who ultimately will have to decide this issue and those who will bring their influence to bear on these decisions.  The decision to introduce these amendments has been made by the present Government because of the trend as shown in a number of recent elections.  The trend would indicate that on the pattern of voting as shown in the local elections and in the by-elections, as well as the Presidential election of two years ago, the majority which Fianna Fáil has at present is unlikely to exist after the next general election.  That is not a sufficient justification for a decision to alter the present electoral system.  There are, as has been stated on a number of occasions, many more urgent and pressing problems about which the Government appear to be far less concerned. It is important in any matter of this sort&mdash;and this is a question which concerns all of us, no matter on what side of the House we sit&mdash;to remember that we have a duty and an obligation to act as trustees for the country and for those who come after us and to ensure that actions or decisions will not be taken merely for the Party or personal political advantage of individual Parties or individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> As far as one can judge from the statements that have been made and from any public discussion that has started on this matter, there is no demand for changes such as are proposed. This question was last decided less than nine years ago.  Prior to that, it was put into the 1937 Constitution and prior to that, it was included in the 1922 Constitution.  There were many general elections after the first Constitution; there have been many general elections since the 1937 Constitution was enacted; and there was a decision in 1959 to adhere to the existing system.  Therefore, so far as the people have expressed an opinion, so far as the opportunity has been given to the electorate to decide since the establishment of the State and more especially in the referendum of 1959 in which this issue, and this alone, was put before the electorate, a decision was taken on the proposal.</P>
    <P>Problems which affect this country such as the spiralling rise in the cost of living, the growing unemployment and redundancy, the disruption in industry because of the effect of the Free Trade Area Agreement, the virtual stagnation in agriculture&mdash;the present temporary rise in cattle prices is not due to the Trade Agreement but to foot and mouth disease in England; when the present Minister for Finance arrived back when he was Minister for Agriculture, he said there would be a rise in cattle prices of not less than £10 per head and the first thing was a drop, and cattle prices did not rise until foot and mouth disease intervened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I submit I am entitled to advert to more urgent problems than those before the House.  This proposal, according to the estimate of the Minister for Finance, is to cost £100,000.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Lemass was speaking here on 21st March, 1934, he said, as reported in volume 51, at columns 1288 and 1290:</P>
      <P>It is not possible to gerrymander in this country.  One reason is because proportional representation operates....</P>
      <P>... so long as you have the principle of proportional representation, it does not matter how you divide the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was Deputy Lemass's view.  Now this decision is being departed from <Col N="1965" /> and there is this proposal to alter the present system, a suggestion that there should be an alteration in the present Constitution which at one time was regarded as the Ten Commandments of the Fianna Fáil Party.  A change was advocated by Deputy Lemass after he had assumed responsibility for leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party and when he had &ldquo;parked&rdquo; his old Chief.  That decision was taken for political reasons.  I am convinced that if we have a sense of responsibility to the people, we cannot decide merely on what is good for a particular political Party.  Since the establishment of the State, we have had stable government. We have had the effect of the normal democratic process and when public opinion decided a particular way, that was effective in changing the Government.  The position has now been reached in which it is suggested that because of a change in the attitude of the people, because of the passage of time and because particular divisions which divided political Parties in the past no longer exist, there may be a justification or reason for altering the system.</P>
    <P>We are convinced that because of the stable conditions which have existed, because of the repeated opportunities and repeated decisions expressed by the electorate and because of the fact that this matter was last decided less than nine years ago, there is neither a public demand nor any apparent justification for proposals such as those which are now brought forward.  If we did not know what the public thought, if the system had not worked, if there had been instability, if the present electoral system provided particular advantages for one section or area, then there might be a case for reviewing it or examining it, but this is a proposal to alter the fundamental democratic principle of the equality of each individual elector, of the power and force which his or her vote has, irrespective of where he or she resides &mdash;a fundamental democratic right that should not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested as a reason for the proposal that the present system, <Col N="1966" /> because of a court decision some years ago, does not allow for consideration of practical local or county problems and I want to direct the attention of the House to a decision expressed on behalf of the Supreme Court by the then Chief Justice when he announced the decision of the court in regard to the matter of Article 16 of the Constitution and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill of 1961.  He referred to certain matters on the question of whether it was possible to take into account questions such as the ratio of Deputies between one area and another and the consideration of the basis on which that would be undertaken.  He went on to say, as reported in <i>Irish Reports,</i> 1961, Part II, page 182, that the basis of the clause&mdash;this is clause 2.3º of Article 16 of the Constitution&mdash;</P>
    <P>properly construed, means that the ratio specified must be the same throughout the country &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He then referred to the decision in the earlier case of <i>O'Donovan v. Attorney General</i> when a reference was made to an interpretation given by Lord Goddard, then Chief Justice, in the case of <i>Lee v. Nursery Furnishings, Ltd.</i> where it was accepted:</P>
    <P>the meaning of &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; contained in the Oxford Dictionary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and we know the regard the Fianna Fáil Party have for the dictionary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>i.e., &lsquo;capable of being... carried out in action... feasible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>and that was interpreted as applying to sub-clause 2.3º and the quotation goes on:</P>
    <P>I construe the sub-clause as meaning that a parity of ratio of members to population in the constituencies throughout the country is to be attained by the Oireachtas as far as that is capable of being carried into action in a practical way having regard to such practical difficulties as exist and may legitimately, having regard to the context and the provisions of the Constitution generally, be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> The Chief Justice went on to point out that:</P>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions.  The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.</P>
    <P>They are not to be precluded.</P>
    <P>The judgment goes on:</P>
    <P>The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have. Its decision should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article.  This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Under that decision, which is now a constitutional decision and a part of the law of the land, the court decided that the provisions of the Constitution allow departure in certain cases.  It means that a tolerance is permitted. There can be no justification, and it is well to point out that the informal Committee on the Constitution never suggested it, for a departure from the ratio between one constituency and another as wide as the 17 per cent suggested in the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill.  We believe that there is no justification for this proposal and any attempt to gerrymander or to discriminate unfairly against people in one particular locality as against another is not justified and cannot be supported or upheld.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> This is a matter which affects not merely the political Parties in the House and the people we represent but which affects everyone in the community.  It is a matter which must be voted upon and decided upon by all the people.  In so far as those who are opposed to Fianna Fáil profess by their speeches and express by their policies and actions the reasons for which they are opposed to Fianna Fáil, they now have the obligation to carry this opposition into effect. A number of Members and individuals from time to time have expressed, mainly in talk, their opposition to Fianna Fáil.  If we look at the result of recent elections, if we look at the results of the pattern of voting in the recent by-elections, there is a clear indication that a majority of the electors are opposed to Fianna Fáil and wish to see them out of office.  I say this because a number of people have been expressing views to the effect that they have an attitude of a particular kind.</P>

      <P>I could hardly fail to be impressed by the fiery enthusiasm and overwhelming applause by which the Taoiseach's speeches on these two measures were greeted by his own followers here today.  They are leaving now, I wonder why.  Running away!  Little over one-third of the Taoiseach's Party is present now in this House on this occasion described by him as an historic one and certainly the most important parliamentary occasion of this Dáil.  Where are they? Why are they not here to support those Bills?  Is there support in the Taoiseach's own Party for them?  I will tell you the answer: the support is not there and it is not in the country either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a new affinity of loyalty between Deputy Lemass and the Front Bench here? Such an affinity has not been apparent in the past few weeks.  The first Bill here, An Bille um an Triú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1968, is improperly titled.  It should be called a Bill for the creation of second-class citizens, being an enactment to destroy the principle of one man one vote and for the rivetting of minority rule on this nation for the foreseeable future.  It is a presumption, an impertinence which was essayed before, a very short time ago, by a noted electoral chessmaster. It is not to be tolerated and it will not be tolerated from a clique of ludo-players such as those we are confronted with in this House today.</P>
      <P>James Connolly said, and I know it galls you to hear the mention of his name: &ldquo;Ireland apart from its people means nothing to me&rdquo;.  We know, those of us who have spent any time studying the operations of the main political Parties in this House, operations not unduly unshared by my friends on the left, that the people of this country have been treated to a display of sunbustry and maudling sentimentality over the past 40 years and that they have been exploited under that head.  We know what are the intentions behind the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill. Regardless of what the Taoiseach may say, its purpose is to destroy the principle of the equality of voting rights.  Its purpose is to devalue the vote in the highly populated areas, highly populated areas such as Dublin where it is manifest that more, and more, and still more people are refusing to be exploited, as they were in the past, in the political sense and are moving into more rational forms of thought and action in so far as politics are concerned and moving towards the Labour Party in ever greater numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed to maintain what the Fianna Fáil Party consider to be their entrenched position, particularly in the west of Ireland and in the rural areas generally.  Of course, it has not a snowball's chance in Hell of <Col N="1970" /> succeeding and I would say that every one on those Government benches knows that, with the single exception of my distinguished colleague, who is responsible for the whole job.  I refer to Deputy Boland.  It is a remarkable commentary upon the absolute lack of democratic freedom in the Government Party that one man can impose his will upon all.  We know that that is what is happening.  Most of the members, indeed, of the Government Party find the second of these Bills as distasteful as the great majority in this House do and as the great majority of the people do.  But they express such a view at their peril.  If they dared to express such a view in the Party room, there is always the possibility they will not get the nomination when the time comes for nomination.</P>

      <P>However, to return to the essentials of this Bill; I want to put this thought to the House and to those Members of the House who have the honour to represent here any constituency which contains any kind of urban vote.  What does the Bill mean in its application to this thing called, if you do not mind, tolerance?  Tolerance, a soft, easy, insidious word whereby they move in to do&mdash;what? Whereby the pickpocket moves in to do&mdash;what?  To steal the vote.  This word &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; means that it will take more than three Dublin votes, or Cork votes, or Limerick votes, or large town votes to equal two rural votes, or west of Ireland votes, if you like. In other words, every third man casting his vote in a Dublin election, although he does not know it, will in effect be having his vote cancelled out.  One man one vote and votes of equal value: this is the principle which is attacked in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Exception was taken to some comment Deputy Cosgrave was making about cattle prices.  I think it is highly relevant because it would appear to me that the Government are going to substitute bullocks for people and give them instead of people votes.  And, if there are not animals they will find stones, and mountains, and bogs, and lakes and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The nonsense we have heard here talked about comparisons with other countries would be laughable, if it were not tragic.  This is an operation in the stealing of a principle. Canada is mentioned as a comparison&mdash;Canada, if you do not mind, where you can travel for days, and weeks, and months, and never meet a human being.  Australia is mentioned as a comparison, with its outback where there are countless thousands of acres uninhabited even by the disappearing natives.  And they say they can live anywhere.  They could even live in parts of this country from which the people are fleeing daily and nightly to jobs in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Let us have a look at the position. The average figures for Canada, Australia and Ireland in relation to acreage are as follows&mdash;remember, the acreage concept is one which dominates the thinking apparently of the framers of this Bill: in Canada, on the average, there is said to be one person for every 122 acres; in Australia, there is an average of one person for every 190 acres; in Ireland, there is one person for every 6.175 acres.  Yet Canada and Australia are leaned on heavily by the Taoiseach to justify the indefensible.</P>
      <P>A couple of weeks ago we had a very telling interjection in a debate on something or other from the Minister for Local Government.  I was referring to the principle of one man one vote, which he finds so distasteful, and he angrily said: &ldquo;There is no such principle in the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>At a later stage in the debate.  We will be interested to hear. It seems to me that it is an approximation&mdash;as near an approximation as, I suppose, one could ever hope to get from the complex thought processes of the framer of the original Constitution to a firm, comperhensible declaration of anything&mdash;to a declaration of the principle of one man one vote but, whether it is or not, the telling thing to which I was referring was the interjection of the Minister, indicative of the whole approach of the dominant element in the Government Party to matters which relate to the running of this country.  It is an approach based on the idea that they are the owners of Ireland, the owners of the people of Ireland, and that they can do what they like with the liberties of the people. This, seriously, is the notion that apparently they were brought up to and that was injected into them.  I want to say that ere many months pass, the Irish people will show them that there is no clique and no group in this country that will be allowed to impose <Col N="1974" /> their will in the manner in which they seek to do.  The very idea of having a difference of over 6,000 votes between what it would take to elect a Deputy in the west of Ireland and what it takes to elect a Deputy on the eastern sea-board is an insult to the intelligence of the people and nobody will tell me that those few who still live in the West, whose number you should be ashamed to admit is so few after your boasted 27 or 30 years in office, give a damn as to how many they send to this House because they have seen the futility of it all.  How much more realistic would it have been for the Government to say that they would give votes to the exiles in Britain, as the Americans give their exiles, that they would give votes to the people of the West who have to work for McAlpine and John Lang and the rest of them throughout the length and breadth of Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have the merit that it would be realistic.  That is the test of this Bill.  It is, purely and simply, to use a hackneyed word, an attempt at gerrymandering.  There are people who say that to them the existing Constitution is a simple document and is understood, that it is a document that people can buy and read and get an idea as to what is meant by the various Articles.  The people who say that are themselves simple because practically every word in the Constitution is loaded in such a fashion to mean, in the judicial way of the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, many things, not just one thing, and capable of many interpretations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this point has to be made: supposing this Bill were to pass and supposing the impossible happened&mdash;I believe that it is impossible that the referendum on the Bill would succeed &mdash;it is obvious that the wording of the Bill as it stands would become completely incomprehensible to the average citizen.  The skilled lawyer, I understand, has difficulty now in grasping what it means and we have had an example of it here today. <Col N="1975" /> This question of tolerance has been mentioned.  We are told that the national average is in the neighbourhood of 20,000 but that it will be possible to elect a TD for some 16,000 voters.  We are told that in one breath and in the next breath, the Minister trots out a statement that each Deputy will represent 20,000 to 30,000 people. There is a difference between 16,000 and 30,000 of 14,000.  How is it suggested that the average citizen&mdash;and I count myself an average citizen&mdash;will understand that kind of double talk which is there in the Bill and is incomprehensible?</P>
    <P>That is only by the way.  I am concerned with the principle, and the principle of this Bill attacks a fundament of democratic rights.  Mr. Justice Budd, when he gave his historic judgment in 1961 on the Bill which was brought before him for determination as to its legality, made the point amongst many other points&mdash;and a very fine judgment it was, looked at from any point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. I am afraid time is taking effect on Deputy MacEntee's memory.  This is not so.  Mr. Justice Budd's judgment stood and was not challenged in the Supreme Court.  As I say, in the course of a very fine statement of the legal position and a very illuminating outline of what the situation was, expressed in very simple terms which even I could understand, he adverted to the need for any and every action which <Col N="1976" /> might be taken under the Constitution to be democratic.  I contend that this Third Amendment is the very opposite to democratic procedure in as much as it reduces the value of the city or town vote, the vote in the built-up areas, and exaggerates the value of the vote of people living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>What is to be said in favour of that? I know there is a notion concerning the superiority of rural as against urban dwellers.  There is an American textbook written by Henry B. Mayo which is called <i>An Introduction to Democratic Theory</i> published by the Oxford University Press.  Mr. Mayo examines this question of the contention among some people that there is a reason why greater value should be given to a rural than to an urban vote.  Let me quote from page 132 of this book:</P>
      <P>The theory behind it is such that it is a form of interest representation, that somehow the rural population are the backbone of the country superior in some relevant way to urban dwellers, or that farming is a more basic industry, again in some relevant political way, and thus ought to be more than proportionally represented. One occasionally hears the argument for the &ldquo;equilibrium or balance of town and country&rdquo;, a phrase with as many misleading ambiguities as the &ldquo;balance of nature&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>All these arguments are extremely weak and specious and the inequalities between rural and urban districts for the most part must be regarded as an anachronism.  They are born as the product of historical accident and group pressures.  Some of the over-represented areas, for instance, American rural counties in Georgia or Florida, may fairly, I think, be regarded as the &ldquo;rotten boroughs&rdquo; of the 20th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to indicate that in his view, which is a completely independent, unpartisan view of electoral systems, any departure from the idea that every person shall have a vote of equal value to every other person is wrong and is not justifiable in any circumstances unless <Col N="1977" /> there are physical facts which make such a disparity inevitable, physical facts of a kind to which I have referred as existing in continents like Australia and huge countries like Canada.  Surely the Taoiseach was straining very hard and labouring when he had to make mention of these examples in justifying his efforts in the direction of gerrymandering as he proposes to do in this Bill?</P>
    <P>In the course of his opening statement, the Taoiseach referred to the securing of convenient areas of representation, and went on to discuss the need to preserve county boundaries.  He said it was the intention to preserve county boundaries in the great majority of counties except Dublin, because it may be necessary, in order to gerrymander effectively, to go over the city boundary into the county to get the balance wanted in the case of Dublin. The same arguments for the preservation of boundaries exist in regard to Dublin city&mdash;and perhaps stronger arguments, if they have any validity at all&mdash;as exist in regard to the preservation of rural boundaries.  &ldquo;Ease of access to Deputies&rdquo;&mdash;this is nonsense. When I look at some of the provincial papers.  I do not find it an uplifting exercise; on the contrary, since we see advertisements from Deputies saying that they will be available at this, that or the other town, at such a time.  There is almost a race between town and town.  That does not add to the dignity of the office, nor indeed does it add to the effective discharge of a Deputy's tasks.  It does not add to a Deputy's peace of mind, not that anyone consults the peace of mind of a Deputy of Dáil Éireann in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>I see this ease of access to a Deputy in every constituency in Ireland today. If a constituent wants to find a Deputy, he or she will do so, and without any great trouble.  Very often in rural Ireland, is it not more in the nature of a nice social outing to go and interview a Deputy?  Indeed, a man or woman going to see a Deputy will not be short of good company.  Others will go along for the trip.  That is as it should be. Rural Deputies are available to their people and the suggestion that there is <Col N="1978" /> now in this modern age, with a proliferation of traffic, with all kinds of vehicular transport&mdash;mopeds, motor bikes and cars of every description&mdash;a real difference between the problems of a rural citizen locating his or her Deputy, and the problems that face a city person, is a pretence, and nothing more than that, to bolster up the arguments for this Bill.</P>
    <P>In fact, I would draw this to the attention of the House.  Let us take Deputy Burke of the Fianna Fáil Party, for instance, a hardworking Deputy in a city area with a rural hinterland which he has in his constituency.  Even if he operated in a city area only, he would be inundated with work on a scale which I defy any Deputy in Ireland to compare with, and yet it is proposed to make it harder for someone similarly situated&mdash;Deputy Burke is not the only Deputy; I mention him because he is such a good friend, and an old friend, and I know he is hardworking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are other Deputies in the large urban areas, not necessarily the city areas, who are working all the hours God sends, and working hard, and who can never go to bed secure in the knowledge that they have answered every letter, dealt <Col N="1979" /> with every phone call, and that they can start in the morning with a completely fresh sheet.  No Deputy in Ireland in the history of Dáil Éireann ever arrived at that stage.  If he found himself in that situation, he found himself out of the Dáil at the next election, if he was not getting those demands.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that a Deputy representing a densely populated area can have much more work to do and the pressures on him can be far greater than a Deputy living in and representing a rural constituency.  So, all this talk about the need to ensure the service of the people by reducing the number of the people in the rural areas to be served by a Deputy has no solid arguments to support it.  One-sixth of the national average is mentioned as the tolerance figure, above or below.  I wonder why it is one-sixth? Is it not an odd coincidence that if you work it out, you will find that one-sixth of the national average brings down the minimum population figure which can elect a Deputy just barely to what is required in certain constituencies in the West which return, it would appear, mainly Fianna Fáil representatives.  Would it be unkind of me to suggest this influenced the Minister in arriving at the fraction of one-sixth rather than some tighter fraction?</P>

      <P>Harsh things are said in public.  Yesterday I heard myself described in terms I never thought would be used in this House.  Someone used the description &ldquo;big bluffer&rdquo;.  I distinctly heard the word and it was not &ldquo;bluffer&rdquo;.  It sounded like that and the delicacy of the Reporters returned it as &ldquo;bluffer&rdquo;.  So, as I say, at times one feels that the general standards in political life are not improving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made, as an argument, <Col N="1980" /> of the disparity which obtains in constituencies in Britain.  It has been pointed out that in Welsh and Scottish constituencies, there is a large difference between the numbers required to return an MP to Westminister.  Of course, it is now the fashion for us to do whatever they do in Britain.  It used not to be at one time.  If anyone suggested anything like that, he carried his life in his hands when he went outside the House but now it is all the fashion.  It is a kind of inverted patriotism. You can hardly say anything against Britain now or you insult the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>They cited the British example, but in fact, it will be found that whereas the Government are seeking a tolerance &mdash;and this tolerance means an imposition upon the Irish people's tolerance, of course&mdash;of 16 and a fraction per cent.  Anybody interested who looks at the situation will find that the average difference between the Scottish Highland and Welsh constituencies and some of the British constituencies is not greater than 8 per cent, or half that being sought for the gerrymander here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>And even that is complained about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  It might very well be argued in Britain that they are dealing with separate nations, the Scots who want regional autonomy and the Welsh who also want regional autonomy, that the British Government is under very strong pressure to make gestures in this direction. But the most they do is 8 per cent of the average so that there is no support here for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Second Bill before us, An Bille um an gCeathrú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, more attention has been paid by the Taoiseach, or rather, should I say, by his scriptwriters, to this than to the first measure, possibly under the mistaken impression that the first Bill will be a pushover while the second will need more buttressing.  We know what is proposed.  We know that it is proposed to abolish PR in this Bill.  It is proposed to establish a system whereby one person in each constituency elected by a minority of the <Col N="1981" /> votes in most cases, a probable minority of the votes in every constituency, will be returned to form the Government.  The interesting thing for the Fianna Fáil supporters through the country to observe is one of the remarks made by the Taoiseach in his efforts to persuade the Dáil on this proposal, when he says:</P>
    <P>Under the single seat system, the political Parties would have every incentive to put forward candidates of a high calibre.</P>
    <P>Is this a suggestion that the Taoiseach goes along with certain gentlemen in the other part of this Oireachtas who would have the populace believe that there is something wrong or unrepresentative in the calibre of the existing representatives of this House?  I contend that Dáil Éireann is as the Irish nation is, warts and all, with all its faults and, I hope, with some of its advantages.</P>
    <P>What is the inference in this gesture towards the part-time letter-writers who have not the faintest clue as to what it means in terms of hard labour to do the work of a Deputy?  This suggestion to me reads as if the Government Party, if they succeed in passing this Bill and abolishing PR and establishing a strong, as they say, Government&mdash;in other words, a Government who will have a majority unlikely to diminish substantially for the balance of the century&mdash;will retain to themselves the right, this hierarchy will retain the right, to send from Dublin to anywhere else&mdash;possibly from Donegal&mdash;to any part of Ireland candidates chosen in the centre and the local machinery will be told: &ldquo;This is your man; go out and put him in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This has a message for the activists of Fianna Fáil, those on whom the Party has leaned for so many years to return them here and who may have worked hard in spite of annually increasing personal unpopularity to maintain the impossible position in which the Government has placed them by their absolute lack of policy.  To these people I think there is an indication in this phrase that Fianna Fáil are prepared to turn upon them despite their <Col N="1982" /> loyalty, an indication that the party is prepared to turn away from them and to take from Dublin&mdash;who knows, perhaps from that fabled, almost legendary organisation, Taca&mdash;candidates who will fill this particular bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we not see them pounding the corridors, straining at the leash?  They cannot wait until an election comes after PR is abolished so that they can get seats for which they will not have to work and which they may forget about except at election times so that they can luxuriate as people of some importance in the capital.  I am sure that Government spokesmen will not over-emphasise that danger when they are talking to the faithful but it is there nonetheless.</P>
      <P>Reference is made in the Taoiseach's speech to the revision of the constituencies to be undertaken by an impartial Commission appointed by the Dáil.  May I be forgiven for saying so but I do not think it is possible for politicians or any group of Irish people honestly to come together on an issue of this kind and acting as politicians appoint an impartial Commission.  It cancels itself out.  The proposal has the saving clause that such a Commission will be presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court.  I understand that in the event, the proposal in regard to such a Commission would be that it would consist of six representatives. Say there are six Deputies or politicians and three of them are Government representatives and three are Opposition, will anybody tell me you can get unanimity there as to how constituencies will be determined?  It is completely unreal to suggest it.  If there is not unanimity, there would then devolve on the president of the Commission&mdash;on the judge&mdash;responsibility for doing the job himself and completing the task within a month.  It is a difficult task for any judge to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder by whom are judges appointed?  By the Government of the day.  With the best will in the world, could we be sure that the public will be satisfied that this operation is completely <Col N="1983" /> impartial, however satisfied we might be ourselves?</P>
    <P>In his statement concerning the proposal to abolish PR and the principle of one man, one vote, the Taoiseach referred to many such principles, universal franchise and the secret ballot. The secret ballot has been broken also, of course, in certain areas.  We know about that; it is not necessary to go into it here.  One could spend a constructive half-hour talking about how the secret ballot has been manipulated by the strong Party machine in certain areas.  Deputy Cunningham looks at me askance.  I know Donegal would not know anything about that.  How could they possibly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach refers to the existence in the Constitution of the right of individuals and groups to contest elections.  That right has been seriously abrogated by steps taken in this House some years ago requiring the registration of Parties.  I felt that was completely unconstitutional. Although it might appear a comforting thing for those Parties already in existence, it always struck me that that effort by the House to keep Parties off the ballot paper unless they were registered&mdash;and the House set up an organisation to decide who were or were not to be registered&mdash;is highly doubtful if one examines it from the point of view of democratic procedure.  However, it is there and we must deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention of electoral abuses and the provision of impartial machinery for the conduct of elections &mdash;these things appear so primitive that it surprises me the Taoiseach referred <Col N="1984" /> to them at all.  He suggests that there is something remarkable in the fact that we have achieved these simple things. If that is his view of the rights of the citizen, he is at least half a century behind the times.  Most of these things were gained by the Chartists over 100 years ago in Britain.  The universal franchise only came here long after it came to most other countries.  It only came here within the last quarter of a century.  But the other things are facts of life and it puzzles me why the Taoiseach brings them in at all except to fill out the page, which he was so obviously trying to do.</P>
    <P>He also makes the startling announcement that history shows the system of voting can have an immense influence on a country's political development. The book circulated by the Minister for Finance a couple of weeks ago should be given to whoever evolved that one.  These facts we hold to be self-evident, and repetition of them is tiresome.  The suggestion that Fianna Fáil have brought them into existence is too puerile to be worth controverting.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The tyranny of the majority&rdquo;&mdash; what a wonderful phrase to discover! The Taoiseach does not say who the originator of that extraordinary phrase is except to refer in a loose way to &ldquo;constitutional theorists.&rdquo;  Like whom? Like Deputy Corry perhaps?  &ldquo;The tyranny of the majority.&rdquo;  If words were ever twisted they are being twisted here.  Surely it is accepted that democracy means government by the majority&mdash;the greatest good for the greatest number?  Surely that is the essence of democracy?  Surely the mere mention of the word &ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; immediately connotes the usurpation of democratic rights by a minority? Again, it is one of those telling phrases which so clearly illumine the mental pathways down which this group now temporarily in power are proceeding.</P>
    <P>We have had here coalition Governments, called inter-Party Governments, in the past.  They represented the majority of the people.  While the Taoiseach avoided too much discussion of the history of that period, I would like to remind him that the first inter-Party Government went from office by <Col N="1985" /> a very narrow majority and at the subsequent election three years later, the people voted back in great strength the Parties which had previously supported the inter-Party Government.  I think it is true to say that if the people were given an opportunity, they would certainly vote out the present Government. The majority of the people have no confidence in them.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with what Deputy Cosgrave said.  I do not think he has any right to demand of any Party in this House that there should be combinations of any kind.  I want to make the Labour Party's position crystal clear.  The Labour Party are an independent Party.  It may seem, looking at our present strength, that we are remote from power.  Time, history, education and enlightenment are all on our side.  The Taoiseach referred to the waning influences of the Civil War.  He does not deny&mdash;nobody can&mdash;that the existence of the two main Parties in this House is predicated upon the Civil War and the personal differences which arose during that unhappy time.  They must be personal differences because what one side said was right the other side after a few years also said was right to do.  The differences must have been personal, not an unusual thing to find in any Irish situation.  It is something the people who examine voting patterns always leave out of account&mdash; the tendency of the Irish voter to follow individuals rather than policies and Parties.</P>
    <P>However, the Civil War situation has brought both of your Parties here&mdash;not rational thought or reasoned argument for definite policies upon which you disagreed, but differences which are basically unreal.  If there is to be a coming together, the logical coming together must surely be between the two Parties who broke 50 years ago. Everybody would be happy to see that occur.  Then we might start developing a natural form of political life in this country.  You may think this is asking too much.  The trend of events in the coming year will show that the people, particularly the younger people, are becoming absolutely disenchanted and disillusioned with talk of the past and they will create by their votes <Col N="1986" /> a situation which will drive together the two big Parties, which will drive elements of the two main Parties which have a lot in common to form, as they should be, a Party of the right.  Whether I am here to see it after the next election, or the election after that, is of no consequence and I do not say that in any partisan way but merely as an expression of opinion as to the political trend for the future in Ireland.  I will leave the Civil War alone at that.  There is an awful lot I could say about it but I will not.</P>

      <P>Well, it is worth a ball of malt.  The Taoiseach referred to the position of France, the great hobby-horse&mdash;France from which stem some of the greatest liberties we now cherish; France which first raised the flag of democracy in the cause of freedom many years ago, was it two centuries ago, before Napoleon?  Nowadays when we want to talk about why it is so necessary to dig ourselves in, to prepare the position from which we cannot be dislodged by enemy fire, we say: &ldquo;Look at France&rdquo;, as the Taoiseach has done.  However, the Taoiseach also compared present-day France with pre-war France and post-war France in regard to the question of stability of government.  General de Gaulle was so nice to the Taoiseach when he went there recently to see him and when the <Col N="1987" /> Taoiseach told him of his errand he said: &ldquo;But come in.  What is stopping you?  By all means come in&rdquo;, and then the Taoiseach had to find some excuse for not going in, which was that Britain would not let us.  We could not do without the British market.  However, leaving that aside, General de Gaulle with all his qualities, a most exceptional man who has brought such stability to France, is nonetheless not a democrat. I would imagine that his likes would not be too popular in modern Ireland. We did have, in the person of our revered President, somebody perhaps of the same temperament and who was attended with something of the same success in regard to elections, but that was a different time.  That was before O'Malley's free secondary education, to put it at its lowest.</P>

They say that he is notedly sensitive on these matters in regard to France because when you speak of La Belle France, he considers you are speaking of himself and he takes it as a personal insult, so it is not wise for the Taoiseach to be dragging his name into this debate.  I want to refer too, to the efforts which have been made to put this across the country.  We had the Minister for Local Government saying in Cork or Waterford recently that the Government have not even begun to fight in so far as the promotion of their plan to abolish PR is concerned.

      <P>On page 8 of his statement the Taoiseach embarks upon a rather puzzling performance in regard to what Deputies have to do.  I would ask the House to have another look at this.  He says that instead of considering the interest of their constituency <Col N="1991" /> as a whole, Deputies tend to adopt partisan attitudes towards local problems.  That attitude was born, suckled and weaned in the Fianna Fáil Party.  He says that the experience has been that competition between Deputies, often of the same Party, has forced some of them to curry favour with voters by pretending to gain favours for them, even where benefits are available as of right, thus tending to create a false impression in the public mind.  I am certain Deputy O'Connor would never be guilty of such skulduggery.  It must have reference to members of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>He and I are not of the same Party.  He used to fish for votes in a certain well-known area but I am afraid he has not been very successful in recent years.  The innuendo is that we must change the Constitution because Deputies are competing with one another.  We must put the country to the expense of £100,000, not to mention the incidental cost of refreshments, personation agents, cars, publicity, posters and all the rest of it, simply to ensure that Deputy O'Connor does not enter into a race around the Ring of Kerry with the new and active young man, Deputy O'Leary.  I take it they are from the same area.</P>
      <P>I know that this does not make for the most restful nights, this competition among Deputies, but it does not justify causing upset to the people and the cost that is entailed in taking up the time of this House which could be more profitably spent in discussing such things as the emergency housing situation, relief for our old people, relief for the poor and sick and similar problems. We should be discussing what we are going to do to prepare ourselves for the cold bath of entering into the Common Market.  Instead of that, the Government are forcing the Dáil to devote its time and intelligence to a discussion of competition between Deputies in their different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this shows us how poor the case <Col N="1992" /> of the Government is.  The fact is that the Government are seeking to abolish proportional representation because they are certain they will not get a majority in the next election and that they will probably be very far short of a majority.  They want to ensure that they can take time by the forelock and make a gambler's throw now because they will not get the chance again.  If they succeed in getting the Referendum passed, and they might very well do that if there is apathy and a small vote, if they are successful in getting the Referendum passed, it could possibly happen that an enraged people who saw that something had been put over on them in time would give the opposite result to that sought by the Government.  That is an unlikely contingency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with a matter raised by Deputy P. Belton yesterday in relation to the omission from the compulsory purchase order in the Kilbarrack area of portion of the land in respect of which a planning appeal had been decided a year previously and in respect of which private developers proposed to erect something in the region of 1,000 houses. As I pointed out, this land was in their possession for over a year before the planning appeal was decided and everything was practically ready to go ahead. <Col N="1993" /> Deputy Belton raised a question with regard to some other land, land he seemed to imply which was in the same position except that a different firm of builders were involved.  The fact is the position was not the same at all.  The firm to which Deputy Belton referred had an option and objected to the compulsory acquisition of this land on the ground that they had taken an option on the land.  The lands were still in the fee simple ownership of another party.  The lands comprised some 49 acres. Obviously the position was quite different and, in those circumstances, it was quite right for the Minister to decide to confirm the compulsory purchase order.  I detailed the considerations that applied in regard to the lands in respect of which he did not confirm the compulsory purchase order.  The main consideration was that it was possible to provide the houses straight away on these lands; the houses were similar in type to those provided by the corporation and it appeared to the Minister they would be provided more rapidly if the private firm were allowed to go ahead.  That has been borne out in fact.  These houses are almost all in course of construction and they will be completed by the end of the year, whereas the municipal housing on the other lands has not started yet.</P>
      <P>Last evening, at the special request of Members of both Opposition Parties, I was dealing with the organisation known as Taca.  That seemed to be required by the emphasis laid on this particular organisation by practically every speaker on the Opposition side of the House and certainly by every interrupter on the Opposition side.  Interrupters were numerous.  There were insistent demands that I should deal with this organisation.  Since it is apparently considered relevant by the two Opposition Parties, I should, I think, make the position clear.  It is an organisation of a comparatively small group of people who support this particular Party.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy Belton has actually subscribed to the national collection but never subscribed anything like that.  Our main source of finance is the national collection which consists of halfcrowns, shillings and six-pences collected, as Deputy L'Estrange knows, all over the country from the small people, the small farmers, the workers, and so on, and this is just a small supplement that these people provide.  We are quite proud of the fact that although it is known that our policy is completely concerned with the workers and the less well-off section of the community, these people can see that our wise guidance of the country's economy makes it possible for economic undertakings to enjoy the stability that was so markedly absent under the alternative type of government.</P>

      <P>As I have mentioned, planning appeals can be of various <Col N="1999" /> types.  There may be appeals from people who proposed carrying out some type of development which was rejected by the planning authority or there may be appeals by applicants against conditions imposed by the planning authority.  There could be other types of appeal such as third party appeals against permission granted by the planning authority to somebody else to carry out a plan.  So far we have been, in the main, discussing cases that were in the first category.  There are other categories. I said that I had no qualms of conscience whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about any decision that I made but, on thinking over it since, I think that when I made that statement I was thinking mainly of cases in the first category, mainly of cases in which the ultimate decision was that the permission was granted. Deputy Belton need not worry.  I have no qualms about the case that the Leader of his Party mentioned.  I think I was quite justified and when I come to it, I will substantiate that.  I have no qualms.  It is about the other type of case that I have some qualms.  I sometimes feel quite worried about some cases in which I have accepted the point of view of third parties, organisations, custodians of the public weal, who objected to permissions granted by local authorities in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two cases that I should like to refer to&mdash;two proposals to erect single houses in beauty's home, Killarney.  In both of these cases, there were appeals and in both cases I accepted the technical advice given to me.  I accepted the contentions of those people who, as I say, look after the public weal and I refused permission but I have serious qualms as to whether I did the right thing or not.  I have doubts as to whether I may not have been unconsciously influenced by the knowledge that in the case of any disputation with regard to a development in Killarney, of all places, the granting of permission is condemned from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;<Col N="2000" /> merely because of the fact that it is in Killarney.  In fact, in one of these cases not alone was the proposal in connection with a site in Killarney, but the proposer was a German and, therefore, it was doubly condemned. The fact that valuable employment was being provided by the individual would not be of any relevance.</P>
    <P>One case was an application for outline planning permission at Ballinlough, Killarney.  In this case the planning authority granted permission, the local planning authority whose decisions, according to a lot of the people who spoke here, should be sacrosanct. However, they granted permission and an appeal was submitted to me by a third party, by Bord Fáilte.  I was advised that outline permission should be refused for the reason that the proposed development would conflict with views and prospects and detract from the amenities of the area and that the change from agricultural to residential use would detract from the character and beauty of the area.</P>
    <P>After a lot of consideration I accepted that view, and I rejected the application.  I reversed the decision of the planning authority on the grounds that the proposed development of this site, which is located in an unspoiled and undeveloped area on the shores of Lough Leane, would seriously detract from the outstanding natural beauty of the area and would reduce the visual attractiveness of the views and prospects of Lough Leane which are to be obtained from its northern and eastern shores.  That roughly was the case made by Bord Fáilte Éireann, and I reversed the decision on appeal.</P>
    <P>One of the submissions that was made to me when I was dealing with this was that the site in this case was owned by a small farmer, and that the rejection of this permission that was granted by the planning authority, the upholding of the appeal, would mean a substantial financial loss to the small farmer who was struggling to earn a livelihood in the area.  I accepted the view to which I have already referred, and with considerable qualms.  I accepted it because I think the technical advice that is available to me is of the highest quality, and I appreciate that <Col N="2001" /> places like killarney are a national asset and that it is important in the national interest that they should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The second case was for the same area, the erection of a bungalow at Tomies East, Beaufort, County Kerry. In this case the appeal was by the proposer. Permission was refused on the grounds that the proposed development would be contrary to the objectives of the planning authority to preserve the views or the prospects of special amenity or special interest in the area since the prospect from the northern and eastern shores of Lough Leane would be impaired.  The proposal would be a departure from the rural character of the area and would set a precedent for similar development which would detract from the beauty of the area.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the appellants, it was suggested that this would not have this result, that the house would be located well back from the lake shore, would be well hidden by trees and shrubs.  It was also represented by the appellants that this house would be situated on their own land, that they would co-operate with the planning authority as regards siting the house, landscaping and planning.  It was also contended that the appellants intended to retire from farming, intended to hand over the farm to one of their sons and to use the proposed house for their impending retirement.</P>
    <P>Again I turned this down, and I have no doubt but that from the point of view of maintaining the national asset I was right.  However, I cannot help having considerable sympathy with the old couple who wished to hand over their farm and to build a house on what they considered the most attractive part of their own land.  However, that is what planning is about, and I decided in this way.  The fact that these decisions inflicted hardship on two individual landowners in this area seems to me to be justified, but it is in cases like that that I have some qualms with regard to any decisions that I have made.  In regard to one of these, as I said, this was a reversal of a decision made by a <Col N="2002" /> planning authority, and the peculiar thing is that some of those who campaigned against the decisions made on appeals are also those who support the idea that the decision of the planning authority should be the final one.</P>
    <P>The Association of Municipal Authorities passed a resolution to the effect that there should not be an appeal against a decision of the planning authority.  This was taken up by various newspapers and by television, and secured a great deal of support. One of these cases was one in which, if the principle embodied in that resolution was in operation, the decision could not have been reversed.  There is another such case which has not been mentioned on this Bill but no doubt will be, because it was brought up on my Estimate, and most of the cases that were mentioned on my Estimate have again been mentioned here.  It is of the same type as this.  It is a case in which a local planning authority granted permission for the development and a third party appealed against it.  There has not been a lot of comment about it, and I think that is because of the fact that I upheld the appeal and reversed the decision of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>This case involved the proposed erection of a hotel at Palmer's Hill, Cashel, County Tipperary, and the local planning authority, which was Cashel Urban District Council, granted permission for this.  There was an appeal by a third party, who and as Deputy Hogan rightly pointed out, could be described as having a competing interest.  It was a hotel owner, but Deputy Hogan forgot to mention that in addition to the other hotelier who lodged the appeal, there were also some bodies who interested themselves in this.  There was Bord Fáilte Éireann again; there was An Chomhairle Ealaíon and An Taisce.</P>
    <P>This was a proposal to erect a substantial hotel, a 60-bedroom hotel, in a position just opposite the Rock of Cashel.  The local planning authority, who we are told are in the best position to decide on these cases, decided that permission should be granted for this. The permission granted was appealed <Col N="2003" /> to me.  Some of the views expressed in the appeal were that a building on this site would be disastrous to the surroundings and amenities of the Rock of Cashel, one of the most famous monuments, if not the most famous, in Ireland.  Another view was in relation to the</P>
    <P>...adverse effect which a hotel here would have on the unique vision of the rock which presents itself when seen on the way in to Cashel on the Dublin Road.  The rock was one of the most important ancient monuments in the country.  It was singular in that it adjoined an arterial road and the town and its most aweinspiring view presented it as an isolated picture unchallenged by any other structure and in a beautiful rural setting.</P>
    <P>It was also said:</P>
    <P>The first sight of the Rock of Cashel from the Dublin approach, as one rounds the bend at about 1¼ miles distant, must be one of the most dramatic and exciting views in the world.  As one approaches nearer it is cut off from view for a short time because of the topography and then it suddenly bursts into view again in all its detailed splendour when one rounds the bend at the proposed site; the words &ldquo;fantastically beautiful&rdquo; fail to do it justice.  But its extreme importance architecturally is the extraordinary impact it makes because of its isolation.  To allow any building or structure, no matter how good its design, architecturally to change this vision as appears from the approach road would be disastrous, so extraordinary is the impact it makes because of its isolation.  It would be the same as putting a modern building on the Acropolis or beside San Michele or in close proximity to the Taj Mahal.</P>
    <P>But the local authority, who are in the best position to judge, decided that this was the place for a hotel and this desirable project should go ahead. Members of all political Parties expressed their opinions.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture gave evidence at the oral hearing in support of the permission <Col N="2004" /> granted.  Mr. P. O'Brien, chairman of Cashel Urban District Council, also supported it.  Mr. A. Murphy, another member of the council, supported it.  In a newspaper cutting about a protest meeting that was being organised to oppose the decision I made in refusing this permission, Mr. R. Wood, another member, is quoted.</P>
    <P>These were all from the different Parties so that the political pressure in this case came from all sides, in this House from a member of my own Party.  The chairman of the urban district council is a member of the Labour Party.  Another member is an Independent member of the urban district council and another is a member of Fine Gael.  I understand that the protest meeting was very fully attended and that they were very vociferous in their condemnation of the impertinence of the Minister in refusing the application.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm if I quoted what the chairman of the urban district council said:</P>
    <P>He welcomed the present proposal with open arms and if it is a battle between beauty and local employment we are more interested in the latter.  In cross examination Mr. O'Brien said that he would not object to development on any part of this road and in fact wouldn't mind if the Rock of Cashel were removed to make way for a suitable development project!</P>
    <P>He was a member of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>As I said, all the political pressure on me from every side of the House was to allow it, but I did not allow it. I accepted the advice and the contention put forward by Bord Fáilte Éireann, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and An Taisce and I disallowed it.  The decision I made was received with great disappointment by the professional protesters.  They were obviously waiting, knowing, as they did, the strong political pressure from all sides being exercised in favour of this.  They were waiting gleefully in anticipation of the result to pounce and represent this as a subordination of the national interest to the interest of a particular development.  I know that Opposition <Col N="2005" /> Deputies were also waiting and they were disappointed, not knowing by whom the corruption was supposed to be exercised in this case.</P>

      <P>In any case that was rejected.  I have dealt with planning appeals decided in regard to two of the squares in the city.  There is another one pending now.  Normally I think it would not be desirable to discuss it in view of the fact that it has not been fully processed yet, and has not actually come before me.  Although this case took five days at the oral hearing it has already been dealt with summarily on television in a matter of 20 minutes. It is an application for an office development at 39 to 45 Mountjoy Square.  The attempt made here was to make it appear that this permission had already been granted by the Minister. That was the first attempt made. In fact the permission was granted by the planning authority.  At the oral hearing the granting of that permission was defended by representatives of the local authority.  The false allegation that this was already dealt with by the Minister was promulgated mainly by Deputies who are themselves members of the planning authority which granted the permission.</P>
      <P>I propose to read the report of the Planning Committee of Dublin Corporation on this matter.  Apparently two sets of plans were lodged, one on 31st July, 1967, and one on 10th August, 1967.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans lodged on 31st July, 1967&mdash; This proposal envisages the demolition and clearance of all property extending from the corner of Mountjoy Place up to and including No. 45 Mountjoy Square South and including the properties at the rear, facing Gardiner Lane, and their replacement by a five-storey (over basement) concrete-framed building with brick facade.  It is proposed to use the accommodation for offices with car parking at basement level.  The elevational <Col N="2006" /> treatment consists of a brick-faced facade with windows of approximately equal height on the first four floors and of reduced height on the fourth floor.</P>
    <P>Plans lodged on 10th August, 1967 &mdash;This application relates to the same property as the application dated 31st July, 1967, and comprises a reinforced concrete frame structure with Portland stone mullions and transomes on the main facade.  The windows are of aluminium with tinted glass.  The height of the proposed building is approximately 57 feet (i.e. 5 storeys) on the main facade with a set-back penthouse floor adding an additional 11 feet.</P>
    <P>A recommendation was made that the application should be granted subject to certain conditions which I do not think it is necessary to read.  This was adopted and the permission was granted.  An appeal is now in course of being processed.  This area is zoned in the draft development plan of the planning authority for residential and office use.  The planning authority were represented at the oral hearing and defended this decision.  In view of the agitation that has been going on about it and which, no doubt, will be raised here later on this Bill, I should like to read some of the opinions that were expressed.  I am reading from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 13th February in which Professor Desmond Fitzgerald, architect for Leinster Estates Ltd, said that the company had gone to great lengths to try to make a modern building fit into the straitjacket of an obsolete form.</P>
    <P>Eleven years ago, he proposed to Dublin Corporation that the Town Planning Scheme should include one Georgian preservation zone of Merrion Square-Fitzwilliam Street-Leeson Street-Hume Street, etc.  The Corporation did not adopt it because, he understood, they believed at the time that the cost of preservation would be too great.</P>
    <P>Even in 1956, he could not recommend the preservation of Mountjoy Square.  In the intervening years this square and the other Georgian areas of Dublin had become more dilapidated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> Conservation of Georgian buildings would prove extremely expensive, and this country could afford only a limited expenditure.  To achieve the maximum effectiveness at the minimum cost, one must be extremely selective.  He suggested that zones which had been kept in best repair and were reasonably economically viable, should be selected for conservation, and that outside these, buildings which were of exceptional interest, in exceptionally good condition, and economically viable, should be chosen.</P>

      <P>The report went on to say:</P>
      <P>Play had been made of certain phrases in the Draft Development Plan that piecemeal development would not be allowed in Mountjoy Square, and that the Corporation were making further studies in relation to the Square.  This was contradicted by the fact that the buildings in the Square were scheduled in the list, which presupposed that there might be applications for development before the study had been completed. This had to be dealt with. It was not legally open to the Corporation to refuse the application on the ground that it was piecemeal development, or that it had further studies in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation had to deal with the application within a period of two months.  Going on the advice it received, the Corporation came to the conclusion that the proposal was <Col N="2010" /> within the zoning provisions of the Draft Development Plan as the area was zoned for office or residential development and that the buildings could not be preserved at a reasonable cost or expense or that it would not be justified in asking developers to restore the buildings as individual houses in the Georgian idiom.</P>
    <P>It had imposed conditions which were stringent and had the aim of making the proposed development fit in harmony with the character of the Square.  No one could deny that this was a genuine effort to salvage something of benefit to the Square.</P>
    <P>It went on:</P>
    <P>... however much they liked to retain the heritage of the past in dealing with statutory regulations they had to be realistic.  If this appeal was allowed, it was the Corporation's intention to build workers' flats in the square.  He was not instructed to say what type of flats they would be, but every effort would be made to fit them into the surroundings.</P>
    <P>The report continued:</P>
    <P>It was a pipe dream to suggest that the enormous amount of money required for restoring the square could be got by voluntary effort.</P>
    <P>Apparently, I am intended to insist that every piece of Georgian architecture in this city be preserved.  I am a native of the city and I think I appreciate its special character, perhaps not as much as these professional protesters do, but I should like to retain it if I could.  But I have no money to preserve these buildings.  If the Minister for Finance only allocates 25 per cent of the total State capital expenditure for Local Government purposes, I cannot afford to devote any of it to this purpose.  What I am asked to do then is to compel private individuals to maintain at their own expense all these Georgian buildings in Dublin and in the face of the evidence that the cost would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is some idea given here of the cost.  It says:</P>
      <P>The total cost of rebuilding seven houses and repairing seven houses would be £440,430.  In this rebuilding, seven of the houses would be new with a life of 200 years and seven would be repaired with a life of 40 years.</P>
      <P>The question is: who is going to live in them if they are provided or repaired?  I appreciate there are a number of people in this city and in this country who see these Georgian buildings as reminders of the days of gracious living&mdash;gracious living that was made possible by the fact that there were available to them as slaves the mere Irish who were living in insanitary and overcrowded hovels in the back-lanes or in the damp, concealed basements of these gracious houses.  It was possible to live graciously in them.  I can appreciate that these people have their nostalgic memories and would like to see these things retained.  But apparently they are only prepared to dream their nostalgic dreams from outside these buildings, not from inside.  If the only people available to inhabit these buildings now are people who are not able to provide themselves with more suitable accommodation at the rate generally of one family per room, I have not any great hopes of retaining them.</P>

I have no doubt it would be very pleasant if they could contemplate from outside the pleasant facades of these Georgian buildings and dream of the days when the lower orders knew their place and when it was possible to live graciously in these houses as a result of the financial resources supplied by the serfs on the land.</P>

I <Col N="2013" /> understand an offer has been made of these houses to anybody prepared to preserve them in their present state.  If it is taken up, the problem will be solved.  If it is not, there are three possibilities: first, that the owner be compelled to maintain them; or that permission granted by the planning authority be upheld or that it be rejected, in which case apparently there would be a possibility of municipal housing being carried out in this particular area.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Column 651, in which Deputy Cosgrave stated:</P>
      <P>I am aware of one case in my own constituency where at the junction of two roads there was a petrol filling station already established which had access to both roads.  Although the residents objected and the local authority refused permission, on appeal, permission was granted to build another petrol station.  Justification for decisions of that character is not obvious.</P>
      <P>I propose to explain to Deputy Cosgrave why I considered it was justified to give this permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This site has quite a long history.  It starts in 1953 when one Dr. R. Belton appealed against refusal by the planning authority of permission for four shop dwellings, a garage and a cinema. The Minister for Local Government at the time was the Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Smith.  He gave permission for the shop dwellings and refused permission for the remainder on 28th April, 1954.  A further appeal was submitted regarding the cinema and garage.  First of all, a further proposal was submitted to the planning authority. It was rejected in accordance with the previous decision of the planning authority and the decision of the Minister for Local Government on appeal. A further appeal was submitted. Refusal had been accorded to the submission by the planning authority and the then Minister at this stage, by <Col N="2014" /> order dated 6th January, 1955, granted permission.</P>

      <P>That was Deputy P. O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>Now, subsequent to that, in respect of the same site, a proposal was submitted for the erection of a bowling alley and service station instead of the cinema and service station in respect of which Deputy P. O'Donnell had granted outline permission. This was again rejected by the planning authority and an appeal was submitted by Glenageary Estates.  The decision in this case was made by me on 4th January, 1967. Deputy Cosgrave may not know who were the principals of Glenageary Estates Limited but he has only to look at his own front bench to find out. When he was making his allegations, there was on his Front Bench a member who could have refuted them but chose not to do so.  As I say, I dealt with this appeal on 4th January, 1967. It was a further submission made for a modified proposal by Glenageary Estates Limited, no member of which, to the best of my knowledge, is a member of Taca.</P>

      <P>I know that this man is a member of the Fine Gael Front Bench.  He may subscribe to our annual collection but I do not think he is a member of Taca.  My attention was drawn to the fact that the previous Minister, one Deputy P. O'Donnell, had given permission for this type of development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided in view of the fact that the previous Minister had granted this that I should honour the approval given and because of the case put to me.  It was largely because of <Col N="2015" /> the fact that, unlike Opposition Deputies, I can differentiate between a man and his brother.  I do not think they are one and the same person. When the case was made to me that they were not the same person and that certain hardship would be involved, I decided that as the actual proposal was now modified, the permission in principle granted by Deputy P. O'Donnell in 1955 should be honoured.  It is true, as Deputy Cosgrave says, that there were protests from the local residents and it may be true, as he implies, that they are always right, though not everybody would agree with that.  Not everybody would agree that they were right in the case I quoted in Cashel.</P>
      <P>I decided to grant the permission and my main reason was that permission had already been granted on appeal by a Coalition Minister, Deputy P. O'Donnell, who no doubt was not influenced by any wrong consideration, and at a time before the Taca organisation existed.  At the same time, I felt in view of the fact that it was represented that the property had been acquired on the basis of that, I should give this permission.  I do not think I did anything wrong, although Deputy Cosgrave does but that is a matter between himself and members of his own Party because the application was in effect from a member of the Front Bench of his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the cases raised by my own colleague for County Dublin, Deputy Clinton, and also some cases that he might have raised and did not raise.  I will deal with one of those first.  It is a case of an application for permission to build on a site at Keelogues, Newcastle, County Dublin, owned by a particular person. I do not think he is a member of Taca. Deputy Clinton knows this man better than I do and he will have a better idea.  This is a case in which permission was refused by the planning authority and an appeal was submitted to me.  I certainly did not receive any representations to try to persuade me to allow it.  But I decided to allow it.  Maybe I was wrong and maybe I was right, but I granted the permission and Deputy Clinton will know whether his implications <Col N="2016" /> that these things are done at the behest of members of Taca would apply in this case.</P>

      <P>Whether I do or not, this case was allowed.  Deputy Clinton raised the question of a factory at Knockmeanagh Road, Clondalkin.  This was a case in which permission was refused by the planning authority as the site was outside the development area for Clondalkin zoned for housing and the proposal would injure the amenities of a residential area.  That may or may not be.  The appeal claims that this was a large site that would allow for adequate fencing and screening to preserve the amenities of the area, that the traffic generated by the proposal would be one van per day and one heavy truck per month, that the business was expanding and necessitated more accommodation, that the capital resources available to the firm were small. It was also claimed that most of the workers in the factory lived in the Clondalkin area and it was necessary <Col N="2017" /> that it should be there.  The appeal was supported by Córas Tráchtála, by the Furniture Adaptation Council and by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
      <P>Now, it could be described as not being in a residential area but adjoining a residential area and maybe it could be more suitably situated, but I think that the question of a business like this being allowed to develop is something of some importance and the question of employment in the area is of some importance.  Perhaps it might suit Deputy Clinton better to hear that unemployment was being created in his constituency.  I do not think so.  I think it was desirable to facilitate these firms to deal with the expanding business which was available to them.  The appeal was supported by these bodies which were interested in the promotion of industry generally.</P>
      <P>I can remember similar cases like this where local residents objected to industrial developments in their vicinity.  If all these objections were upheld, it would be difficult to have industrial development anywhere.  I can remember another case in my own constituency where people on one side of the road objected to a light industry being established on the other side of the road.  I was not Minister for Local Government at the time but I refused to make any representations on their behalf because I considered that the establishment of the industry in the area was more important to the community in general than any inconvenience or grievance the people in the vicinity would experience.  That was Tallaght, and I considered that in this case permission should be given and I made an order in June, 1967, with the safeguard that the factory should be restricted to a light industry.  I believe the decision made in that case was the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton also made a statement about filling stations on the Naas road.  He alleged that in a short stretch of the Naas road in the county of Dublin there were about 16 petrol stations, that only four were permitted by the local authority and that the other 12 were allowed on appeal.  I <Col N="2018" /> had an investigation carried out into this allegation and it cannot be substantiated. As far as I can ascertain, there are 12 filling stations on the Naas road between the boundaries of Dublin city and the boundaries of County Kildare.  Of these, five were erected before permission was necessary, seven were given permission by the local authority and permission for four, not 12 as stated by Deputy Clinton, was granted on appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I assumed that he was dealing with his own constituency. There are 12 in the County Dublin area and permission for four of these was granted as a result of an appeal. One was granted by Deputy P. O'Donnell when he was Minister and three by other Ministers.  Even if we assume that they were all granted since the present Fianna Fáil Government took office, that comes to three in the space of 11 years and one by Deputy P. O'Donnell.  I cannot see, in the face of this, that this allegation of Deputy Clinton's that this allowing of appeals was more widespread under Fianna Fáil than under the Coalition stands up, particularly in view of the fact that there are many more appeals now. As a matter of fact, over the past ten years, appeals relating to ten proposed filling stations on this stretch of road were turned down by the Minister and I cannot see that there is any great case for the argument made by Deputy Clinton in this particular regard.</P>
      <P>Another point he made was with regard to housing development in Castleknock, County Dublin.  He referred to the development of farm lands for housing because where the local authority allowed one house to three acres, it was changed by the Minister on appeal to three houses to one acre.  I cannot trace any such case. I can find a case of 27 acres where the land was acquired by the county council for two houses per acre and that was changed on appeal to three houses on one acre.</P>

      <P>This is the only case approaching what Deputy Clinton was talking about.  The Minister decided to allow three houses per acre instead of two houses per acre in 1965.  There was a subsequent appeal on the question of density and it was rejected, and I understand there is a further appeal pending now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not identify the other one at all.  It was so deliberately vague that, in my view, he may have been making the whole thing up.  He gave no indication that would enable me to identify the situation he was talking about.  I did my best in this particular case and as far as I can see, this is the case he was talking about. If it is not, perhaps he might be more specific and then I might be able to help.</P>
      <P>There has been a case made here that there should not be any appeal, that the local authorities should have the last word in this matter.  At the same time, there have been a number of cases in which people who felt aggrieved did not get an opportunity of appealing and who were agitated in regard to this when it was too late.  It seems to me that the people who are agitated when the appeals are outside the statutory time limit are also the people who complain that there is an appeal at all in these cases.  One of these that comes to mind is Skiddy's Home in Cork.  Deputy Barrett tabled a Parliamentary Question in respect of this Home in the following terms:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will make a statement in respect of the intended demolition of Skiddy's Home in Cork which is some 300 years old, with particular reference to the possibility of preserving the Home, whilst at the same time providing a new nurses' quarters for the North Infirmary, Cork.</P>
      <P>The reply given was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter for Cork Corporation, as planning authority for the area, and I have no functions in relation <Col N="2020" /> to it.  An appeal was made to me against the planning authority's decision to grant outline permission for the erection of the Nurses' Home in accordance with plans which involved the demolition of Skiddy's Home but the appeal was not received within the statutory period and it was not, therefore, possible for me to consider it.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Corporation have power to include in their development plan objectives for the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  In the period prior to the making of the plan, they can declare by resolution that the preservation of such buildings is an objective which they propose to include in their plan and if such a resolution is passed such buildings may not be demolished or altered without their permission.</P>
    <P>This case aroused considerable public agitation.  There was a demand that the decision to allow this development to take place should be reversed. Simultaneously, we have the very same people making the case that there should not be appeals against the decisions of planning authorities at all.  I do not know what exactly Deputies want.  The suggestion here is that this should be taken away from the planning authorities and that boards, and so forth, should be appointed to deal with planning appeals.  At the same time, the same people support resolutions passed by municipal authorities demanding that there be no interference with their decisions or that, if there is to be an appeal, it should be from the decisions of the manager to the elected body of the local authorities. It is argued that they know best. I have given cases to show where public opinion, so far as it could make itself heard, seemed to be that the last people who should decide these matters were the elected representatives.  That was very obvious in the case of the proposal to build a hotel in close proximity to the Rock of Cashel.  It was the unanimous opinion of the urban district council and of the people of <Col N="2021" /> Cashel apparently that this development should take place because of the effect it would have on the economy of the town.  Simultaneously there was this appeal by Bord Fáilte, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and An Taisce and also, of course, by the prominent member of Taca who owned the other hotel in the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving my view on the two proposals before the House concerning the Constitution before I moved the adjournment.  I want to define that view by saying that I believe that these Bills were conceived in presumption and prepetrated in brazenness. They have set at nought every canon of individual rights and they are being forced upon the country despite the fact that there is absolutely no request of any kind by any body of opinion for their introduction.</P>
      <P>The first Bill which seeks to lay the groundwork of the gerrymander could be described as the Bill of the third man, in the interests of simplicity, because, as I have already indicated, if this Bill is passed, it can be accepted that in the Dublin area or in any other heavily populated area which will be required to measure up to the limits of the so-called tolerance prescribed in the Bill, every third person voting will, in effect, have his or her vote cancelled out.  That is what it means, that it will be possible in the west of Ireland, in the Fianna Fáil strongholds, for fewer and fewer people to return Deputies to Dáil Éireann, whereas in other districts such as the Dublin area or other heavily populated area where the Fianna Fáil Party are obviously losing ground, it will be made more difficult for them by this change in the Constitution. This strikes at the very essence of liberty so far as the electoral laws are concerned and, as I have said, I am satisfied that it will get short shrift, certainly, from the people who think about it, although every effort is being made to prevent them thinking about it and to keep from them information which it is necessary they should be provided with in order to make a judgment of what is being done.</P>

An effort was made to start a fifth column attack on Telefís Éireann which I have <Col N="2026" /> exposed here today but when the open fighting starts, to which he refers, I would suggest that he would cast an eye over his generals and corps commanders because I would think that he will find them as ferocious as he pretends in the interests of this proposal. It would seem to be reasonably certain that a considerable section of the Members of this House who now comprise the Government Party will no longer be honouring the House with their presence if these two pieces of legislation go through.  They will fall victims to the inordinate ambition which is the driving force of a clique, a batch, in the Cabinet with outside connections about which, I am ready to believe and willing to accept, ordinary members of the Fianna Fáil Party and many members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the House have little or no knowledge.  I am certain that the general plan which is to be founded upon these proposals embraces the elimination of many members of the Fianna Fáil Party now in the House and their replacement by other people, many of whom will not have given any service whatsoever to the Fianna Fáil Party, let alone to the Irish people but who will be feather-bedded in soft seats &mdash;they think&mdash;they expect&mdash;in soft seats literally purchased by their membership, their support, of these semi-secret organisations we hear about such as Taca, and by their financial support of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

They would not be allowed inside the foyer of the Gresham, which is, I understand, where this organisation assembles, or the other place up the road from here. This attempt which we are witnessing here is nothing more than a coup d'etat without gunfire, a seizure of power by a minority.  Do not let the Government Party pretend to me or any other politician <Col N="2027" /> of experience that the fact that they have been able to invade constituencies at by-election time with wealth and personnel, shows the country is behind them.  I would put to anybody who likes that argument the thought under consideration that, come general election time, you will not see the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, for instance, in Galway or in Kerry or in Dublin North-Central.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Mercenaries; well, a tank corps of the Fianna Fáil Party, essentially, will be dispersed through the length and breadth of the constituencies, each fighting for his own particular general to ensure in so far as the strength within him lies, that his own general will survive the holocaust, because if he does not survive, there is always the danger something else might go wrong and he might be more immediately affected himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will have that situation at a general election, but by-elections, for reasons which are well known to us practising politicians, have become over the past decade or more increasingly scenes of invasion by the political panzers, and in a remote village in one constituency I recall speaking to a local publican in a hostelry which did not have about it the appearance of lasting prosperity, to say the least of it.  He said to me that he thought there was <Col N="2028" /> nothing like a by-election and that every area in Ireland should have a by-election because it brought unprecedented wealth into every art and part of it&mdash;big spenders, particularly from the Government Party, expense no object, everybody treated, and it taken as an insult if everybody does not take a drink.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal in what that man said, and it would be interesting to measure, if it were possible to do so, how much money is poured into a constituency. All that money is spent for one object.  It comes from Government Party sources.  It comes, I would imagine, from wealthy supporters of the Government in the main, and its object is to keep the Government in power. That will not apply at a time of a general election, because they will be spread all over the country.  Therefore those of the Government Party who are facing the hangman, as it were, on this issue will find small solace in any reference to how well they have done in by-elections or will do in the future.  By-elections are a notoriously bad indication of how things are liable to go.</P>
    <P>As regards this moryah tolerance of 6,000 mentioned in the first Bill, this is disfranchisement; it is a stealing of votes from the Dublin people and the people in all built-up areas.  I want to say to the Fianna Fáil people here in this House that if they vote for this&mdash; and I suppose they will for fear of the consequences if they do not; if they do not, there is always a danger they will not get the nomination the next time&mdash; what they are doing is tantamount to stealing a liberty, an existing right, from the people of this city, of this county, from the people of every city and county, every town where the maximum of this tolerance will be applied, whatever constituency it may be.</P>
    <P>There is only one legislative comparison I can think of with this promotion of the Government, that is, the Act of Union.  The Act of Union was pushed through as we know by every kind of device that could be evolved by corrupt men.  The Act of Union was designed to settle in permanent power a minority and to leave in their hands the reins of government for all time.  I cannot think of any other comparison <Col N="2029" /> than that with this proposal.  The Government have the idea&mdash;and to my mind, the idea they have is false and is open to question&mdash;that if they can establish single-seat constituencies with the non-transferable vote, even though in most areas they will have a minority of the vote, they will still have a majority and a considerable majority of the Dáil seats.  That is the whole purpose of the exercise.</P>
    <P>Apart from the democratically undesirable development that a colossal majority such as we saw instanced on television would imply, apart form the fact, as has been remarked in the axiom of Lord Action, that all power corrupts, even the slightest bit of power has a corrupting influence, even on the strongest and best intentioned natures. It is not hard therefore to visualise what the effect would be on some of the inadequates who fill the Government seats here and the Cabinet posts in this House if that power were reinforced to the extent that their majority in the House was overwhelming.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Government could hope to win 90 of the seats&mdash;or something in that neighbourhood&mdash;out of the 144.  I do not know whether or not that is true.  I do not go along with people who set themselves up as psephologists in everything they say. Particularly I do not go along with everything they say about possibilities in Ireland, because there is an element which has to be dealt with in this country so far as votes are concerned which is intangible and immeasurable, that is, the Irish nature.  While it may be true that there are certain patterns at certain times, unaccountable reasons, whims or vagaries, or good solid reasons, may cause considerable shifts, or small shifts, in areas, which can result in a complete turn about in a situation that might have seemed solid five years before, and solidly faced in that direction.  You cannot measure that, and thank God, you cannot measure it.  That is one of the things that make us different from other people.  I suppose it is one of the attractions of the whole business of politics to those of us who engage in it, because it adds to the great uncertainty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> I am convinced that our people have an innate and natural ability to recognise the phoney, the phoney reasoning and insincerity, and that they will recognise, and have already recognised, that contrary to what has been publicly stated by the Fianna Fáil apologists on this matter, the simple fact is&mdash;and to them it is as plain as the noon day&mdash; that this is a power grab and nothing else, a power grab by a Party who fear their future if the present system is to continue.  I wonder what conception of the people have the Fianna Fáil propagandists? I refer particularly to the Minister for Justice who said on television, I think, that the anxiety of the Government was to provide the country with an Opposition.  What sort of people do you think we are?  Does anyone think that anyone believes the Government are doing this in order to provide an Opposition?</P>
    <P>That kind of statement by a Minister adds to the general cynicism we find abroad about politics.  I am afraid there is a growing cynicism which is encouraged by the know-alls outside the House who apparently know all the answers about politics, but do not have to provide them, and do not mention them.  It is the easiest thing in the world to outline what is wrong.  We have heard it on television.  There is the soft Saturday night question, but no hard Monday morning answers.  The impact of this kind of suggestion that politicians are being deliberately and maliciously remiss is added to by the cynical exercise we see here which everyone recognises, and which is nothing more than an effort to hold on to power at all costs.  The thinking is: &ldquo;Well, sure, we might never have the chance again to change the rules.  We cannot win the game under the rules. We will go out at the next election. We will not have a majority and we might never have the chance to change the rules again.  What can we lose? Let us try it anyway.&rdquo;  That is the thinking behind these two Bills.</P>
    <P>I referred to this before and I hope the House will bear with me if I refer to it again.  It has become something of a cliche but I think I was the first to refer in this House to the fact that in <Col N="2031" /> the hall the splendid literary document which is called the Proclamation of 1916 with its inspiring sentiments contains the phrase, &ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  Is it cherishing all the children of the nation equally when you cancel out every third vote in the built-up areas in order to make three votes in Dublin equal to two, we will say in Connemara?  Is that equality?  To my mind, it is the very opposite.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that it would never have occurred to the founding fathers of this State that we would even discuss such a thing as we are discussing here today.  PR has been with us since the State was founded. I understand it was first introduced in 1918 in the town of Sligo in a local election there.  It was operating in the local elections for the whole 32 counties of Ireland in 1920.  Mr. de Valera's Party supported PR then. If I do not make a mistake without going back to dig up the references, he spoke outrightly and plainly&mdash;as plainly as it was possible for him to speak on any subject&mdash;in its favour. So far as one can read, he seemed to be in favour of it.  Advisedly I will say no more than that.  PR has done us for 50 years.  It is not a perfect system.  Is anything perfect in the world, anything? I know there are some politicians who think they themselves are perfection, but that kind of trouble is curable with tablets nowadays, I believe, or at least it can be kept under some kind of restraint.  Humanity of its nature is imperfect.  Therefore any system we evolve will not be perfect. I have never seen very much wrong with PR although it grieved me, when John Mannion headed the poll in Galway, to see him being defeated.  On the other hand, in the same election, other people had reasons to be very thankful for PR because it elected them and that applied to the Fianna Fáil Party as much as any other.</P>
    <P>PR gives to the individual the right to express his or her view in the fullest possible manner because he or she can indicate under PR how he or she will distribute his or her favour down the <Col N="2032" /> full length of the panel.  It also has this, if you like, negative advantage, that if there is someone standing for election who the voter considers should be kept out at all cost&mdash;and this is an emotion that one can understand; there will be times and voters who will think that the election of any one of us is tantamount to a national disaster and we are bound to defend their right to hold that view so long as they do not act violently about it&mdash;he can only exercise his view to the full extent under PR by voting for everybody else on the ballot paper and in that way using his vote against the undesirable.  The single non-transferable vote can very easily mean that the vast majority of the electorate in a constituency are not represented at all.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful, to run over the arguments which are mentioned in the report of the Committee on the Constitution and which were adduced against making the change at the time this question was under discussion, the question of the single seat constituency.  Yesterday, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in dealing with some inquiry regarding electroal matters referred to the propriety&mdash;he described it as the somewhat questionable properiety&mdash;of a member of that Committee revealing in any way what the views of any other member had been, or commenting on those views. My recollection of the final meeting of the Committee which dealt with the particular matters contained in this report&mdash;but which was not to be the final meeting of the Committee <i>per se</i>&mdash;was that the matter was free for discussion in a political manner, once the report had been published.  That is not to say that I propose to discuss at all the views of any individuals on that Committee but I do not think the Minister need have taken such umbrage as he did when others might feel&mdash;and would be quite entitled to feel&mdash;that they would be entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is it not a most serious thing to approach the thought of altering that Constitution by one iota?  Must it not be a matter of the greatest possible consideration?  Surely a period of eight and a half or nine years since the previous referendum is only a moment in time so far as the history of this nation is concerned and does it not show indecent haste, to say the least of it, and great lack of responsibility on the part of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On page 25 of the report of the Committee on the Constitution, we find that paragraph 63 begins with a recital of the reasons which were adduced against making a change in the electoral procedures which now exist.  The first one is:</P>
      <P>The limited form of PR adopted by this country has not, in fact, led to a multiplicity of parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that not true?  A multiplicity of <Col N="2035" /> Parties means a great number of Parties.  Is it not true that since the State was founded, we have seen, perhaps under different names, the three main political divisions as the dominant ones all along?  Proportional representation has not produced a multiplicity of Parties.  It then says:</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that PR has had a disintegrating effect or a divisive influence either in Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Quite the contrary.  Proportional representation was first promoted here, if I do not make a mistake, because it afforded to our political leaders the opportunity of guaranteeing the right of representation for minorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, proportional representation was employed in Northern Ireland until 1927 instead of the present single-seat non-transferable vote system.  I am not going to try to excerbate feelings as between the people here and in the North by odious comparisons or by trying to divine reasons why they reverted to the more primitive idea of the single-seat non-transferable vote.  But I do say that in the very proud history of tolerance&mdash; that is the wrong word; it is a patronising word and I take it back&mdash;in the very proud history of co-equal partnership which we have shared with minorities in this country, willingly and with full heart in the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We brought them to Parliament rather than to the barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Proportional representation was their basic constitutional guarantee that this was not only from the mouth, as they say.  I know the argument was put that minorities of the kind to which I refer did not seem to seek representation as such in Parliament.  But this was because proportional representation was there, because they recognised they would get representation, have got representation and are represented in this House, and a céad míle fáilte to them. <Col N="2036" /> Long may they be in the House, no matter to what Party they belong.  They bring qualities which we appreciate and which are an addition to any Parliament.  Proportional representation was one of the guarantees which eased a very difficult situation.  I am sure, in the troublesome time when the foundations of this State were being laid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they might remember the time when they were prepared to go into coalition around about 1927?  The eminent politician proposed at that time for President of the Executive Council&mdash;that was what he was called: many of you who have no recollection of those days may think he was always called Taoiseach but he was not&mdash;strange to say, was not the old gentleman at all.  The old gentleman was prepared to support <Col N="2037" /> somebody else in a coalition.  How the demands of vote-wheedling change what are apparently principles!</P>
      <P>To proceed with the consideration of the arguments which were adduced in the report of the Commission against making a change, it was pointed out that the criticism made of PR that it does not provide stable government is completely and utterly irrelevant in this country.  Proportional representation has never been responsible for unstable government.  For quite considerable periods there have been Governments with very slender majorities who continued normally in occupation of the seats of power without any disturbance or civil disorder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there is no body in this argument that PR made for instability.  All Deputies, all practitioners of this much abused art, trade or occupation of ours, will have contemplated the vagaries of the voters when looking over the barriers as we all do in those anxious moments when the papers have been taken from the ballot boxes and are in the process of being straightened out.  We have seen that even yet there is quite a considerable number of people who use the old X system.  Of course, they are old people and are dying out.  There is also the large number of people who for one reason or another spoil their ballot papers inadvertently, not maliciously. I am not referring to the people who unburden themselves with character references in relation to our own persons.  I am talking about those who accidentally spoil their papers.  Yet, with all that, it is true to say that, while the number of those is considerable, by far the greater majority of our people are now very well accustomed to the transferable vote system.  They have a good idea of the transfer of votes.  I have often marvelled, particularly in the last three or four elections, at the change that has come over the pattern of voting.</P>

      <P>I had the opportunity of a post-graduate study of the Irish language in Tintown, with the pleasure of a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice.  I should like to tell Deputies about the educational standards in Tintown, but let me proceed. There is a very determined effort here, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;you have just resumed the chair&mdash;to throw me off my stroke.  The cacophony compels me to start again at the beginning of this paragraph (f) on page 26:</P>
      <P>If single seat constituencies are introduced, the electors who would normally support a Party other than that of which the successful candidate is a member may find themselves in a difficult position.  Rather than approach the Deputy to whose Party they are opposed, they may feel obliged to seek redress for their grievances from some person outside their own electoral area or, alternatively, remain without adequate parliamentary representation.  In a multi-member constituency every elector has a better chance of putting his case to a Deputy of his own choice and representing his own area.</P>
      <P>Now I know that there are electors who will back every horse in the race and will write to the Deputies of all Parties, but they are very, very few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a person who has a grievance in relation to any one of a thousand things.  It may be a grant&mdash;if it is a rural area, it is bound to be a grant, particularly the West&mdash;a subsidy of some kind anyway.  You can bet your life on that.  If he has a grievance of any kind and he feels that he must see a Deputy, he may very well have what he believes to be a good reason for not going to see the elected Deputy in a single seat constituency.  It may be because he has always supported the opposite Party.  He may be a man in a village who is known always to have supported the opposite Party.  He may have the natural and justifiable pride of such a man who does not want to do what he would consider to be belittling himself by going to a TD representing the opposite Party to get his grievance adjusted.  You are going to take away that dignity from that man, that right which he now has you are going to take from him and say: &ldquo;We are going to force you into line.  It does not matter what Party you support, we are going to force you.&rdquo;  We can see his opponents living in the village, town or wherever rubbing their hands with glee at the manner in which this man has been belittled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the considerations that should have crossed the minds of these people, but of course how would it cross the minds of these gentlemen? They would not know about it, anyway not all of them.  Some of them came here by too soft a road to know about these little features of humanity which are common, I think, among most of the Deputies.  It is a very serious thing.  I am sure many Members of the House have had the experience of a person saying to them: &ldquo;Of course I do not support you.  I have come to you with this grievance but I vote for somebody else.&rdquo;  Many Deputies have met a person in an area where there is not a representative of their Party who has come to them with <Col N="2044" /> a grievance and said: &ldquo;I did not go to see so-and-so because he is of the opposite Party and I would not go to him if I was dying on the road with the hunger.&rdquo;  You get that kind of thing.  It is a legacy possibly of our history, and it is part&mdash;it may not be the most admirable part&mdash;of our nature but it is a fact, and it is there and you must recognise it.  The Fianna Fáil Party do not want to recognise it.  They say: &ldquo;Stamp this out,&rdquo; and they stamp it out and are prepared to stamp it out with all the callour ruthlessness that was a feature of life in Nazi Europe or in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph which is paragraph (g) of page 26 of this report and which I think has not had the due consideration to which it is entitled reads:</P>
    <P>Proportional representation with multi-member constituencies provides for the supporters of a particular party a choice of candidates from their own party, whereas under the Alternative Vote no such choice may be available.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the single non-transferable vote.  You will observe there was no observation at all about the single non-transferable vote.  It was regarded as being a non-runner by the Committee.  The point made here is that proportional representation with multi-member constituencies provides for the supporters of a particular Party a choice of candidate.  Is that not a good thing? Surely it is not right that the supporters of a particular Party should be told: &ldquo;This is our man and you must vote for him.  It does not matter whether you like him or not.  Perhaps he has let you down in the past.  That is none of our business; you are going to vote for him.  Perhaps you think you would rather vote for somebody else but it does not matter.  You must vote for him.&rdquo;  Under the proportional representation system, I think in Deputy O'Connor's constituency, there are two Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Voters have a choice of deciding as between him and Deputy O'Leary.  In my constituency of County Dublin, they have an even wider choice in Fianna Fáil.  They <Col N="2045" /> can vote for that sunny-natured colleague of mine, Deputy Boland, my gracious and charitable friend, Deputy Burke, or that young man of great integrity, Deputy Foley.  They have three to vote for.  If this goes through, some of those gentlemen will, as they say, go the road.  I have a strong feeling that it will not be my gracious and charitable friend.</P>

      <P>The point is it is a good thing that there should be a system whereby people have a choice and it has been shown that people like to have a choice of candidate within a Party.  They should not be told: &ldquo;This is our man and you must vote for him and you will not get the choice of voting for anybody else.&rdquo;  There should be a freedom of choice within a Party and that is one of the advantages of the PR system.</P>

There was not even a sibilant &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; but sad faces on the handful of Deputies who came in to give him their moral support.  The Taoiseach, it was obvious, was doing something which he obviously does not believe in himself.  This operation has been machined through Fianna Fáil.  I know you had a meeting about it but it was the usual Fianna Fáil meeting.  There was only one purpose to this and as the result of that, all you can decide to do now is to abstain from speaking.</P>

This is Ash Wednesday, and I ask the Government to make a penitential act of renunciation, to renounce those two Bills, and to admit that they are no more than a couple of foolish fantasies forced on them by Deputy Boland, Minister for Local Government, and possibly by Deputy Blaney, to express sorrow and regret for ever having brought them here, because if they do not do this and avail of this opportunity, I am absolutely certain that when they go before the people, they will be not just defeated but defeated ignominiously, by an overwhelming majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle: I beg your pardon.  I should like to deal at length with the many points raised by Deputy Dunne but I have no intention of following him into Europe and to the many parts of the world through which he travelled during the past few hours.  He made <Col N="2050" /> various references to having one Deputy for 20,000 people and made a very eloquent case for the reason why that should be maintained, to give the people of Dublin and the city the representation to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I think he made a case for quite the opposite in his address because under the existing areas of 20,000 population, the normal ratio of voters to 20,000 is round about 12,000. However, in the West, we would have many elderly people in houses and many unmarried, so that the ratio would go to 14,000 voters per 20,000. That is more than a good reason that the necessity for changing is very obvious.  We have not as many married people in those western areas as elsewhere and the result is that we have a lot more voters to the 20,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne also made the statement that he believed that the people of the West were not concerned or interested as to whether it should be 20,000 or any given number, and that they had no interest.  It is quite the contrary.  The fact remains that throughout the West in election after election you have 70-80 per cent of the people casting their votes, whereas in many cases in the city of Dublin and other densely populated areas, you had voting as low as 40 per cent. That means the position in the West is quite the opposite to that in populated areas.  The latter are not interested in exercising the rights they have.  Still, Deputy Dunne would make an effort to try to illustrate that the people of the West hesitate to show a personal interest in exercising their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give my own case in County Kerry to show what we have to do there.  Again, Deputy Dunne commented that there was no necessity for travelling around one's constituency, that all a Deputy needed was to sit inside at home and that people would come to him.  I think Deputy Dunne's party in County Kerry and my own people would agree that that would not bring a Deputy very far in that county.  The fact is that we are dealing with mountainous areas and many people are old and helpless. <Col N="2051" /> This makes it necessary for the Deputy to get to them.  We have to get out into the mountainous areas to meet those people to find out what is wrong with many of them and to try to find out what their problems are.  This means that in County Kerry we have to travel around our constituency continuously.  We have to do approximately 20,000 miles per year which amounts to 80 miles a day.  I in my constituency have to write 500 letters per week which takes five hours of the four days I am in the constituency.</P>
    <P>I have to spend another five hours making myself available to people who call on me.  This leaves me with four hours of any day to travel to those various areas in my constituency to meet the people.  Including Sunday, I have to work an average of 14 hours per day.</P>

I am convinced that that is the position that exists, and when I have given the figures of what I have to do, I am only covering one-half of the constituency I represent; the other half is covered by my colleague.  We have divided the constituency to try to give a reasonable service to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to travel to Ballydavid which is 45 miles away and 35 miles on the other side of the bay to Ballinskelligs and the Glen which is 40 miles away.  Those are the distances we have to travel to meet the people and do the job we have to do. Deputy Dunne and other city Deputies have to cover two miles on each side of them and claim the right to represent 20,000 nevertheless.  This is what Deputy S. Dunne tries to base his case on.</P>
      <P>He tried to decry the people of the West by stating they were not interested. We will have to convey that to the people of the West concerned because it is important to them.  I definitely think, and I know, that the bulk of the people I represent will support this measure of tolerance in the Bill and vote for the single vote as well.  I have much more confidence in view of the concern expressed throughout his whole speech by Deputy Dunne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said this whole thing would go, and once that comes from Deputy Dunne, there must be great reason for believing that this is his only chance of succeeding, contrary to what Deputy Dillon stated.  Deputy Dillon stated that proportional representation was a fraud and a cod and there was every reason to think it should be abolished.  I am subject to correction, but I think I can get that in the records of the House.  I think it is correct to say it happened in 1957 or thereabouts.  I will get it for Deputy Dillon.  I am glad to know that at one stage he held <Col N="2053" /> the point of view that PR should be abolished, because Deputy Dillon's point of view must carry weight with his Party.  It suggests there must be divided opinions within the Party and, contrary to what Deputy Dunne has said, there must be divided opinions among both Parties over there.  We will be out pushing throughout the length and breadth of our constituencies for the abolition of PR and many of the Deputies opposite will be doing the same thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak at greater length but cannot do so because I have a slight infection of the throat. Deputy Dunne made one salient point about representation for Dublin.  In Dublin, electors are easy to contact by telephone and half of the people there do not need representatives because they are business executives and so forth who can look after themselves very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the general business people.  Deputy Dunne referred to Taca and I should like to say that some of the funds which drifted into those over there to fight elections were from dubious sources, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen money going to fight elections down my way which none of us would attempt to touch.  Therefore, references in this respect made during the debate were uncalled for.  The necessity is obvious for adjusting the constituencies which Deputies like me in the West represent. It is next to impossible for us to give the people we represent the service they need.  Many of them are in mountainous areas from which there is little or no transport and we must try to get out to them occasionally&mdash;very occasionally indeed&mdash;to render them some little service.  By and large throughout the country, the people are well aware of the necessity for this change.  I think we will put it over <Col N="2054" /> and I think Deputy Dillon will be helping us in view of what he said in other days and in respect of which I will get the appropriate quotation before the debate ends.  I can assure the House we will put it over in Kerry, north and south, with a majority, maybe a big majority.  A lot of the country will follow in the same way.</P>

      <P>This is the second effort within a decade and I do not think the people will prove so forgiving after the last Fianna Fáil effort to scrap the Irish electoral system and replace it with the British one. It is appropriate also that we should discuss these measures in an atmosphere of gloom, when half the lights have to be turned off.  It is significant that the last occasion when Fianna Fáil endeavoured to scrap the Irish system of election was the last occasion they got an overall majority in a general election and until they had secured another overall majority, they did not dare to raise their voices to make a further assault on the Irish electoral system.</P>

I wish to treat this very seriously&mdash;the fact that on the last occasion Fianna Fáil secured an overall majority, they endeavoured to assault the PR system and now, having secured another overall majority, they are making that effort again. The first thing we are entitled to ask Fianna Fáil Deputies, and the Government in particular, is which new factors have emerged since this was voted on in 1959&mdash;which new arguments have been advanced to justify their behaviour on a matter which the people decided eight and a half years ago?  What new situation has arisen to justify the expense and the turmoil of another referendum on the selfsame question as the people voted on eight and a half years ago?</P>
      <P>I have done my best to follow the arguments that have been advanced and the justifications made for suggesting going to the people again on this question.  I have succeeded in finding only two new arguments which have been advanced by the Government. One which was apparently uppermost in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party, because it was expressed by the Taoiseach in a television appearance following the Fianna Fáil Party decision to introduce these Bills, was the long and arduous counts of the last general election.</P>
      <P>I wonder is it going to be seriously suggested to an adult Legislature that we should dismantle our entire election system for the sake of getting the results a few hours earlier?  Are there so many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party hopping around like hens on a hot griddle to get the results a couple of hours earlier?  Is Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Carty or any of the rest of them so anxious to have the results a few minutes earlier that they would complacently dismantle our entire election system in order to give them the satisfaction of knowing whether they were in or out three or four hours earlier?  Yet, as I say, that is one of the few arguments advanced as to why the people should again vote on the question of our electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose examining in some detail <Col N="2057" /> the speech made by the Taoiseach when introducing these Bills, and I propose examining in some detail other arguments advanced as to why this referendum should be held and why the people should be asked to decide in favour of the so-called straight vote as against the Irish system of proportional representation. First of all, I want to say that so far as I am concerned, I would prefer to have this discussion in an atmosphere of calm and deliberation; I would prefer to have the system or systems of election, one compared with another, discussed on their merits.  In dealing with the an election system, we are dealing with a matter which is of the utmost gravity.  We are dealing with a matter which may have very grave consequences for the people in the immediate future and in the remote future, and it is on that basis that all of us should examine the proposals that are put forward, examine the arguments, such as they are, advanced in favour of these proposals, examine the working and the merits of the existing system and see if there is any justification, any substantial justification, for finding fault with its operation since it was initiated some 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>I support the system of proportional representation because I believe it is a fair and a just and a democratic system.  It is a system under which the elector is in every sense of the word truly an elector, a real elector, and not merely a voter, not merely someone who is required to rubber-stamp the decisions made by the Party candidates in a particular election. A person who votes under our system of PR&mdash;and I deliberately use the phrase &ldquo;our system of PR&rdquo; because there are other systems and there may be other systems with flaws that are not to be found in our system&mdash; has a job to do.  He is required to act as an elector; he is not required merely to endorse the choice of candidate made by any political Party because he is given a choice not only as between political Parties and the policies of political Parties but even as between candidates of the same <Col N="2058" /> Party.  If he does not like one, he can vote for the other.  This is an important right which should be recognised in particular by Deputy MacEntee, because in the election, I think it was of 1957, or prior to that, he had as his running mate in his constituency of Dublin South-East, Dr. Noel Browne.</P>

      <P>I said prior to 1957.  But in the general election of 1957, Fianna Fáil decided that they were going to drop Dr. Noel Browne. If we had been operating under the single seat constituency with the so-called straight vote, what remedy would any unfortunate supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party in Deputy Mac-Entee's constituency have had?  Willynilly, whether the supporters liked it or not, they would only have had one man to vote for and that would have been Deputy Seán MacEntee.  However, there were sufficient people&mdash;I am sure a number of them were former supporters of Deputy MacEntee&mdash;in the constituency of an independent frame of mind who decided that no matter what the political bosses of the Fianna Fáil Party decided, they would like to have another representative than Deputy Seán MacEntee in the Dáil and that they would like to see Dr. Noel Browne as candidate for Dublin South-East, even though he had been dropped by the Fianna Fáil Party.  What happened? Because instead of having only one single seat, it was a multiple seat constituency, they were able to invite Dr. Noel Browne to stand as a candidate and despite the decision of the political bosses in Fianna Fáil to drop him, Dr. Noel Browne was elected to a seat in that constituency.</P>
      <P>Could that have happened if there had been only one seat to be filled? Of course it could not.  Surely I am right then, in pointing out that the right to choose between candidates, even candidates of the same political Party, is a valuable right, an effective right, a right that can be exercised effectively and was exercised effectively on the occasion I talk about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I make, and I want to summarise it for the benefit of any Deputy who may have missed it, is that under the Irish system of proportional representation, the elector is a genuine elector.  He has a job to do.  He has freedom of choice not only between Parties but between candidates of the same Party.  Secondly, so far as our system of proportional representation is concerned, it is manifest that the result is achieved by a full and fair sifting of the views of the entire constituency, a full and fair sifting of the preferences of the voters in the constituencies before the result is obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an election is over, it can be said that as far as this Dáil is concerned, and as far as previous Dála are concerned, this House fairly represents the views of the voters throughout the various constituencies.  Is it not perfectly fair and reasonable for a <Col N="2060" /> person to adopt the attitude that he would prefer to be represented by A but that if he cannot have A as his representative, he would prefer to be represented by B?  That is what happens here.  Even in trying to conduct a fair election for the committee of a club, we try to find out what the majority of the members want.  It is only after you succeed in electing a committee of a club or, as in this case, a Dáil which reflects the views of the majority that you are going to get a properly representative assembly.</P>

      <P>Reducing it to its lowest level, in a club committee election, the aim is to get a committee that will be representative.  Most clubs adopt the system of having a number of candidates submitted to the members. When the lowest one or two go out, there will be another vote between the reminder to elect the committee. That is the main idea.  You are seeking the opinion of the voters. Instead of going through that cumbersome type of machinery on a national or constituency level, it is all rolled into one under the Irish system of proportional representation because the voter already has on the ballot paper expressed his second, third and fourth preferences.  It is not necessary to conduct a second, third or fourth election.  The preferences are already expressed and marked on the ballot paper.</P>

      <P>Take the case where the quota is fixed at 100 and a particular candidate gets 120 votes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacEntee is not careful, I will come back to Dublin South-East.  The reason that is fair is that the aspirations of these voters have already been fulfilled by the election of a Deputy. Take the case of a candidate with 20 votes who goes out.  In that case the voters have not had their aspirations fulfilled.  The candidate for whom they cast their No. 1 preference has been eliminated and accordingly No. 2, which is their second choice, should receive the full value of their votes. I think that is fairly reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a <Col N="2062" /> matter for the electorate.  Deputy MacEntee brings me back to 1957.  In the year 1957, in the Party votes cast, there was a gap of 25 per cent between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  What was the position after the last local elections? That gap was reduced to seven per cent or thereabouts.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to get back to the races, he will find that we are galloping up and that the gap has been reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacEntee checks the results, he will find that there were few losses in the local elections in County Dublin or Dublin City as far as Fine Gael is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third point arises out of the ones I have already been speaking of: PR gives fair representation to minorities. It gives fair representation to all sections of the people in accordance with the volume of support accorded to them at the election.  Now, is that something we want or is it not? As far as I am concerned, it is something I want.  It may not suit me; it may not suit my Party if some other group obtains sufficient votes either to take a seat from my Party or prevent my Party getting a seat.  But that does not, in my view, give me the right to say that, if I get into a position to do so, I will legislate to make it impossible for another minority Party to secure votes at my expense. It is either fair, or it is unfair, that representation should be accorded in this House according to the volume of support given to Parties at elections. In my view, it is fair and, because I believe it is fair, I believe the system which produces that result should be preserved.  Are Deputies opposite challenging on that?  Do they say that it is not fair, that it is not right that representation should be allowed according to the volume of support <Col N="2063" /> secured at an election by any Party or group, either in a particular constituency or throughout the country?</P>
    <P>My fourth ground in favour of the present system of proportional representation follows again from the last two.  It is that, when we secure a Dáil which is produced as a result of taking the general consensus of opinion, sifting the views and the preferences of the electors in the various constituencies, when we have by that means secured fair representation for various groups according to the volume of support obtained in the country, that, in turn, secures that the Dáil will fairly reflect the views of the voters.  Deputy MacEntee may taunt me as to why Fine Gael, if that is so, have not obtained a majority of the votes.  I do not mind that kind of pin pricking.  I believe that people were wrong in deciding to elect and re-elect Fianna Fáil Governments.  I believe they have the right to do wrong.  That was their decision and that is accepted by us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not prepared to concede them the right to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; as to whether they will or will not change their system of election.  The Deputy is not prepared to do that.  The whole purpose of his speech is to prevent the people giving a decision.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of my speech is to protect our present system of proportional representation and to do what I can to prevent the people being badgered by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fifth ground again follows logically from the other grounds I have given.  It is that the system operated in this country since the State was established does have the effect&mdash; indeed, I think it can be fairly argued that it was at least partly designed to produce the effect&mdash;of protecting minorities.  Again, I want to ask Deputies opposite, the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy MacEntee, do they think it is right and proper that minorities should be protected? Do they think that is fair or do they think it unfair? As far as I am concerned, I think it is right and proper <Col N="2064" /> and fair that the position of minorities should be protected by our electoral system.  It is protected under our present electoral system.</P>

      <P>The five points I have mentioned here amount to saying that our system of proportional representation is essentially a democratic one, giving fair representation to all sections of the people and <Col N="2065" /> producing a Dáil, a parliament, which clearly reflects the views of the people. These, in brief, are the reasons why I think the Irish system of proportional representation is worth preserving.</P>
      <P>I want now to examine some of the arguments that have been advanced against our system of proportional representation and in favour of the so-called straight vote.  As I pointed out, I have been able to discern only one or two new arguments since this matter was decided by the people eight and a half years ago, and, consequently, in order to seek to understand what justifications and what arguments are produced in favour of the suggestion for a change, it is necessary to some extent to consider the arguments used on the occasion of the last referendum.</P>
      <P>One of the arguments used then was used recently again by no less a person than the Tánaiste.  The argument was that our system of proportional representation was imposed on us by the British.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of Monday last, 26th February, the Tánaiste is reported, addressing after-Mass meetings at Kilkee and Doonaha, as saying, I will give the actual quotation:</P>
      <P>He said that although Fianna Fáil had won ten out of 12 general elections under PR, the party believed it should get rid of the system which was imposed by a British Government to break it into a series of small parties.</P>

Was Deputy MacEntee, who was a member of the Government in those days, meekly baring his neck to the British?  Was he baring his back to the British lash? Was he allowing himself to be imposed upon by the British when he and his colleagues drafted the 1937 Constitution, processed it through this House, submitted it to the people and urged the people to support it?  Was that a free act of a Fianna Fáil Government when they enshrined proportional representation in the 1937 Constitution or was it not? I believe it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite apart from the fact that proportional representation was written into the Constitution of 1937 by the Fianna Fáil Party, if the Tánaiste and any others who want to make an argument that proportional representation was imposed on us by the British, will just study the report of the Committee on the Constitution which was issued a short while ago and if they turn to page 97 of that report, they will find this paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1911 a Proportional Representation Society was set up in this country and Arthur Griffith was a founder member.  The publicity activities of this body succeeded in winning substantial support for the idea of Proportional Representation in Ireland and it appears to have been generally accepted that it would be the most suitable electoral system for a country suffering from the religious and other divisions existing at that time.  Provision for election <Col N="2067" /> by PR to a number of the seats in the Irish House of Commons was made in the Home Rule Bill of 1914; this Bill did not, however, become law.  Proportional Representation was first put into effect in Ireland for the election of Sligo Corporation in 1918.  For some time prior to this there had been considerable uneasiness on the part of rate-payers and other interests about the way in which the affairs of this body were conducted, and ultimately it was agreed that minority elements should be given some chance of securing representation on the Corporation.  A Private Bill to provide for the introduction of PR was passed and considerable publicity attended the subsequent election.  The result was generally regarded as being satisfactory all round and the most was made of this success by the PR societies.  Shortly afterwards, legislation providing for the use of PR in all local elections in Ireland was passed and there was general acceptance of this change.  PR was also provided for under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which set up separate parliaments for the Six Counties and the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>In face of that, in face of their own drafting of the Constitution of 1937 and the inclusion of PR in it, can it be seriously urged that proportional representation was imposed on us by the British and that for that reason we should get rid of it? That is one of the arguments put forward now, as it was eight and a half or nine years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy permit me to modify that statement made by the Tánaiste and to say that it was first imposed on us by the British?  He has demonstrated that in this House, that it was first imposed in this country by a British Act of Parliament, an Act of Parliament which partitioned this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacEntee wants to sub-edit the Tánaiste's words, let him take that up with the Tánaiste or the Tánaiste's speech writer, not with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2068" /> That is one of the arguments used the last time.  That is one of the arguments that have been advanced this time.  Another of the arguments that were used last time and which seems to be used, although I am not quite sure whether I would be taking it out of context if I say it was used in the same way by the Taoiseach in his introductory speech here this evening, so I will leave that until I come to the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;but another argument that was used before was that our system of proportional representation was complicated and confusing, was difficult for the people to understand, that the various complexities of the system were difficult from the point of view of the Irish voter who did not know what he was doing when he went to the polls and all this kind of thing, the basic argument being that the system was complicated and confusing.</P>
    <P>In relation to that, I want to say that I believe that the Irish electorate is an intelligent electorate.  I believe that our system of proportional representation is an intelligent system of voting and that it is well suited to an intelligent electorate.  If Deputies will look at the Report of the Committee on the Constitution, at page 102, Annexe 13, they will see that, taking the general elections from 1948 onwards, 1948, 1951, 1954, 1957, 1961 and 1965, the votes which were invalid never reached even one per cent in any of those elections.  Again, I ask, can we really think that this system which does not produce even one per cent of spoiled or invalid votes is confusing or complicated, that it is not understood by the people, that the people have any difficulty about operating it?</P>
    <P>I do not ask the House&mdash;in particular, I do not ask Deputy MacEntee &mdash;to accept my judgment on this.  You have the records there.  You have the fact that even going back to the early days of the State, in 1922, when the system was new, when it might have been more difficult to understand, when as far as the voter was concerned, it could have been regarded as in its experimental stages, even in those days the maximum percentage of invalid votes in any election was in 1923 when there was a total of 3.16 invalid votes. <Col N="2069" /> Therefore, the whole record of elections in this State from 1922 to date shows that so far as the people are concerned, this House need not treat them as simpletons and legislate for them as simpletons.  It shows that the people understand the system, that they have operated the system with understanding, and in the recent elections, the elections over the past 20 years, there has not even been one per cent of invalid votes.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not ask Deputies to take my word for it.  Look at the record, and if Deputies do not feel like accepting the suggestions set out there in Annexe 13 of the report of the Committee on the Constitution, and if they want to seek any further verification that our system of proportional representation is one that is not confusing, is one that is easy to understand and easy to operate, I would refer them to the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper which had some words to say on this subject some years ago.  I quoted this on the occasion of a previous discussion on this subject in this House, and I am referring now to the Dáil Debates of 29th April, 1959, at columns 1360 and 1361, where I quoted from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 24th January, 1933, as follows:</P>
    <P>The English press correspondents sympathise with us on having to work so complicated a system as proportional representation.  It is wasted sympathy, for the system is simple to understand and easy to carry out.  It is based on the excellent idea that we have a greater preference for some candidates than others.  Under proportional representation the voter not only has the pleasure of voting first for the candidates he likes most of all, but he also can vote for all the others in the order in which he likes them.</P>
    <P>That was 35 years ago; the <i>Irish Press</i> were proclaiming to the world that our system of proportional representation was simple to understand and easy to carry out.  Do the authors of these Bills so underrate the intelligence of the Irish electorate?  Do they think that 35 years after the <i>Irish Press</i> was able so <Col N="2070" /> to declare to the world the simplicity and ease of operation of our system of PR, we have become so dimwitted and dullwitted that the system suddenly becomes complicated and complex and difficult to understand? If it was easy to understand, if it was easy to carry out 35 years ago, it is far easier to understand, far easier to carry out, in this year of 1968 with our additional experience of and expertise in operating the system.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to say very much more about that argument. I do not think it is necessary, as I have indicated, that an Irish Parliament should find itself called upon when dealing with an intelligent Irish electorate to legislate for simpletons or mould a system fit for simpletons. In any event, it seems to me, and again I put this as a challenge to the Deputies opposite, that the test of an election system should not be: how simple is it? But it should be: how fair is it? It may be that the British system, the system of the so-called straight vote, is a simple one, that it presents little difficulty to the voter, but does any Deputy think that that is the end of the story? Does any Deputy think that our prime aim and object when we are dealing with such a grave matter as the system of election of our Parliament that the test should be merely one of simplicity?</P>
    <P>I am sure simplicity has its virtues, even in election systems, but when you have a system which 35 years ago the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper could proclaim as being simple and easy to carry out, and if at the same time that system, which even 35 years ago was simple and easy to carry out, also gives us the advantage of being a fair system, giving fair representation, surely then there is little virtue in changing to the British system merely on the grounds of simplicity.</P>
    <P>Another argument which was used previously and ran through the Taoiseach's speech here today was this argument about the need for strong, stable and effective government. Here again the record in this country is completely against that argument.  Can anyone seriously suggest that there has <Col N="2071" /> been instability of government? Do we want the kind of stability where it might be impossible to change a Government in this State? Deputy Molloy may not know it, but Deputy MacEntee, I am sure, does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Put up your hand.  As I say, the record is entirely against that argument.  I want to put this seriously to Deputies opposite. Quite apart from academic arguments about the size of a particular Government's majority, and whether it is necessary that a Government should have an overall majority in order to give stable government, I want to put this question to them quite seriously. Is it possible to have an effective Government and a strong Government&mdash; and as I see it, it means the same thing&mdash;if you do not have fair representation? Is it possible for any Government to govern effectively if they have not with them the backing of a representative Parliament, a Parliament that has been elected fairly as a representative Parliament of the people?  I doubt very much if it is.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies are misleading themselves if they think the test of the efficacy of a Government is merely the size of their majority in this House.  I said this before and I say it again. There were many better men than I am on both sides of this House in the past who shed their blood, and some gave their lives, to establish in this country a Government and Parliament that would be fairly representative of the views of the people. Before we obtained our own representative Parliament, there was a strong Government in this country, but could it be claimed that it was a representative Government, and can you have an effective Government that is not representative?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say this.  So far as I am concerned, I in my generation of politicians am prepared to give all honour and all credit to those grand soldiers who fought for Irish freedom and Irish independence in the past, irrespective of what side they took later on.  The Minister's family so far as I am concerned will get credit for their efforts.  Their efforts were directed towards establishing in this country a representative Irish Parliament, fairly elected and freely elected, to govern our own affairs in our own way.  That is why I put quite seriously this question to Deputies who may be misleading themselves into thinking that the size of their majority is the true test of the stability or strength of a Government.  I do not think it is.  I think you need far more than that.  If you arrive at a situation in this country where you have a massive Government majority in this House, not properly representative of the people, no matter what other claims you may make for that Government, you cannot claim it is truly effective.  So I do not think very much of the argument that you need to get rid of PR in order to provide strength and stability in our Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told also&mdash;and again this was one of the arguments used before and it runs through the Taoiseach's speech here today and, as I say, I intend to deal with it in some detail later&mdash;that one of the arguments against PR is the danger of splinter Parties.  Here again, surely all the records in this country are completely against that argument.  You have, for practical purposes, three Parties in this House now.  Two of those Parties, I think, can claim to be broadly-based national Parties.  The other Party certainly has a right to be in this House. It may have&mdash;I am quite sure it does have&mdash;particular concern for particular sections of the people and they are important sections.  They are entitled to representation in this House.  Is there any splinter Party about that? Look over the records since the formation of the State.  You have the three Parties here that for practical purposes were there all along from 1923 onwards. Not all of them took their seats <Col N="2076" /> in the House in the early days but they were elected at free elections held under a system of PR.</P>
    <P>In 1923, according to annexe II of the report of the Committee on the Constitution at pages 100 and 101 of the report, you had four Parties in the House; in 1927, in the first election of that year, you had, I think, six Parties. I am omitting Independents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Possibly, but in 1927 you had these and in the second election of that year, you had five, or possibly six, Parties.  I am not quite sure what one of these abbreviations stands for.

      <P>We have the record there.  It is entirely against this argument about splinter Parties.  We shall see when we come to deal with the Taoiseach's speech that that is in fact conceded by the Taoiseach and, as I understand it, the argument has now been turned topsy-turvy, and instead <Col N="2077" /> of arguing that PR leads to splinter Parties, we are to be told that because PR has not led to splinter Parties, the Parties in this House and the people outside have decided that we should get away from PR and go over to the so-called straight vote. However, we shall come to that in somewhat more detail later.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make now is that the argument that has been advanced before is discounted by the record which is there against it, that no great fragmentation or splintering has taken place here.  I want to make this point quite seriously: even if there were to be a multiplicity of splinter Parties, even if there were to be the greatest imaginable fragmentation, is that not a matter for the people to decide?  If the people want more Parties than three, if they want four, five or six, or more, are they not entitled to have them?  What right have we in this House to legislate in such a way as to prevent the people's wishes being fulfilled?</P>

      <P>Another reason has been advanced before, and I think that possibly this is the really substantial argument that Fianna Fáil have rested their case on, at least when they were talking to their own organisation, their various cumainn throughout the country, that is, their dislike of what they choose to refer to as coalitions. I am not surprised that Fianna Fáil should dislike coalitions.  There were two inter-Party Governments in this country and each of them replaced a Fianna Fáil Government.  I do not think it is necessary to argue on the merits or demerits of inter-Party Governments or coalition governments, but if Fianna Fáil Deputies want to argue about the record and achievements of those two inter-Party Governments, so far as I and my colleagues are concerned, we are quite prepared to meet them on those arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary in connection with this discussion.  I do not think I am wronging Deputies opposite in saying that from their point of view, one of their substantial arguments against PR is their dislike of coalitions. I think Deputies opposite should examine that argument very closely and very deeply and see where it leads to. I dislike Fianna Fáil Governments and I shall do whatever I can in the next general election to persuade any voters I can influence to vote against the formation of another Fianna Fáil Government. But would it not be arrogant and intolerant and entirely undemocratic if I were to adopt the attitude that if I were put in a position to do so, as a result of the next general election, because I dislike Fianna Fáil Governments, I would endeavour to <Col N="2079" /> legislate so as to make the formation of any future Fianna Fáil Governments impossible?  Is that not what the Fianna Fáil Party are doing, whether they realise it or not, when they urge as one of their arguments against PR that they do not want coalition Governments?</P>
    <P>Are they not in fact trying by this legislation to bring about a situation where they believe that coalition Government or inter-Party Governments will no longer be possible of formation in this country?  If the boot were on the other foot, what would they be saying about legislation of this type?  If legislation were being proposed in this House and if people were being asked to take off their coats and work at a referendum to carry that legislation for the purpose of ensuring that there could not be another Fianna Fáil Government formed in this country, would we not hear plenty then about the lack of democracy and all the rest of it?  Yet is not that, in reverse, exactly what Fianna Fáil are trying to do now? Is that not what they tried to do in 1959?</P>

      <P>Those were some of the arguments, as I understand them, that were advanced previously and some of which are being advanced again in relation to PR.  I saw what I regarded as a very brave effort in one of the Fianna Fáil newspaper strings to get down on paper the arguments in favour of this proposal to a change to the so-called straight system of voting.  I am referring to the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 4th February where there is an article by the political correspondent of that paper under the heading &ldquo;Results of Proposed Change Uncertain&rdquo;.  I have read this reasonably closely and reasonably attentively and I have tried to extract from it the arguments in favour of the proposed change, arguments which, to my mind, are at least as valid as the kind of argument I have been referring to, as the kind of argument put forward by the Taoiseach today and the kind of argument put forward on the occasion of the last referendum on this topic. The first argument, as I see it, in this article is as follows.  I had better give it as a quotation in case I might inadvertently misrepresent the argument being presented.  This paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>Under the present multi-seat system many candidates go forward in the hope of getting elected from the surplus votes of a strong party colleague who is certain to head the poll.  But under the single-seat &ldquo;first-past-the-post&rdquo; system that will be impossible.  Each candidate will be elected entirely on his own merits-a more honest system.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had been in the House earlier, I dealt in some detail with the present system of proportional representation, how it is operated and the results which flow from it.  At the moment I want to deal with the criticisms, as I see them, made in this article.  It will not be possible to get in on preference votes if candidates will be elected entirely on their own merit.  The comment on that is it is a more honest system.  That is a matter of opinion.  People are entitled to hold different opinions as to whether or not it is a more honest system to have a Deputy elected on this so-called straight vote system or to have a Deputy elected after the consensus of opinion in the constituency has been sifted and taken into account under our present PR system, as I described earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fallacious to argue that under the so-called straight vote system, a <Col N="2082" /> candidate will be elected entirely on his own merits.  In my judgment, under the so-called straight vote system, all the electors are required to do, in fact all they are permitted to do, is to rubber-stamp the decision already taken by the bosses of the political Parties in the various constituencies. It does not matter what candidate is put up; it does not matter what the merits of a particular candidate are. If that candidate is put up by a political Party, no other candidate is going to be in the field from that particular Party.  The supporters of that Party have no option whatever but to rubber-stamp a decision of the Party bosses.</P>
