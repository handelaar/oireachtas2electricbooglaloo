      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he has received an appeal concerning Irish efforts to bring peace and stability to the people of Vietnam; and if he will give details of the nature of this appeal, its support and the action which the Government intend to take regarding this major conflict in South-East Asia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if Ireland will support General de Gaulle's appeal for a reconvention of the Geneva Conference on Vietnam as a step towards the establishment of peace and security for the Vietnamese people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I have received an Appeal for Peace in Vietnam stated to have been signed by 38,500 persons.  The text of the Appeal is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Irish Appeal for Peace in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The continuation of the war in Vietnam is causing great hardship and human suffering, and constitutes a grave threat to world peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we support the pleas for peace made by Pope Paul VI, the World Council of Churches, and the Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant; and we call on the Irish Government to declare itself <Col N="436" /> in support of U Thant in his appeal for unconditional cessation of the bombing, in order to create a climate for peace discussions.</P>
    <P>On 10th January, 1967, U Thant said: &lsquo;It is absolutely necessary that the bombing of North Vietnam must cease without conditions ... there will be no move towards peace so long as the bombing is going on.&rsquo; And he added on 16th September, 1967, that he was &lsquo;convinced that, after the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, meaningful talks would take place within a matter of three to four weeks.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>We request the Irish Government to give full support to the Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant, in his initiatives for peace in Vietnam.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's query as to what action the Government intend to take regarding the conflict in Vietnam, I may say that we shall continue to do everything within the competence of a small State to promote firm and lasting peace in Vietnam and South-East Asia.  To this end, we shall continue to appeal for a complete cessation of hostilities on land, sea and air in order to create the climate favourable to negotiations for a peace settlement in Vietnam and if possible the establishment of an &ldquo;Area of Peace&rdquo; covering as many South-East Asian States as are willing to become members.</P>
    <P>It is proposed also, on all appropriate occasions to urge France, Great Britain, the Peoples Republic of China, the Soviet Union and the United States to declare their readiness to guarantee a treaty of peace negotiated by the parties involved in the Vietnam war.  We shall also urge these Great Powers to declare their readiness to extend this guarantee to an &ldquo;Area of Peace&rdquo; in South-East Asia including such countries in that region as are prepared to bind themselves to restrict their arms to police level, to settle their differences peacefully, to declare their neutrality and exclude all foreign forces and bases from their territories.</P>
    <P>As for reconvening the Geneva Conference on Vietnam, I do not think <Col N="437" /> it would be wise for us to seek to lay down in advance where the negotiations should take place or who should participate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it appears to be the case that the Secretary General considers a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam an essential step towards bringing peace to Vietnam, would the Minister consider it and ask the Government to issue a public pronouncement of support for the stand of the Secretary General in regard to the bombing of Vietnam?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that question fully in reply to the Deputy's leader last week or the week before. I refer the Deputy to the answer then given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point of Deputy Corish's question is whether the Minister will now support the Secretary General in his call for the ending of the bombing since the Secretary General appears to think this is a first step towards peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in reply to the Deputy's leader, if the Deputy consults the reply and the supplementary answers I gave, exactly what our attitude is on Vietnam and how we hope peace might be achieved in that distressed country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will initiate discussions towards the establishment of diplomatic relations with Zambia in view of the considerable number of Irish in that country, the presence of Zambian trainees in Ireland, and the fact that an Irishman holds ministerial office in the Zambian government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are a considerable number of Irish citizens in Zambia who are participating in its administration and its cultural and economic development.  It is for this reason that in February, 1966, we appointed an Honorary Consul in Lusaka who is in constant contact with the Zambian Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> We also maintain contact with the Zambian Government by direct correspondence and through the Zambian representatives in the United Nations and in London.  I feel that in present circumstances this is sufficient to maintain the warm and friendly relations which exist between our two Governments.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions   Oral Answers. - Cattle Trade with South Africa.</Title>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention has been drawn to a report of an intention to develop a trade in cattle from this country to South Africa; and if he will take steps to ensure that this country's commitment to an economic embargo against South Africa is maintained in the agricultural field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>There is no embargo on Irish agricultural exports to South Africa.  The only ban on trade with that country is on the export of arms.  We banned the export of arms when the Security Council of the United Nations called upon all States to impose such an embargo.  As the Security Council has not yet acted upon the General Assembly's call for the imposition of universal mandatory economic sanctions on South Africa and the vast majority of States are continuing to trade with her, an Irish embargo on exports of cattle to South Africa would not prevent them reaching her through a third State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states we have agreed with an embargo on arms being exported, but could the Minister indicate what arms we were exporting to South Africa before the embargo?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know which firms were exporting arms in this country?  I did not know we had any arms manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

I may add, however, that the average gross prices of five-roomed new houses for which purchase loans were approved by Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council were about £2,050 and £2,000 respectively in 1956-57; the corresponding prices in 1966-67 were £3,472 and £3,600 respectively.

While particulars of the interest payable in respect of that borrowing are not available separately in my Department, the amount of interest paid on all outstanding debt increased from £5.6 million in respect of the year ended the 31st March, 1957, to £10.8 million in respect of the year ended the 31st March, 1967.</P>

      <P>Of a total of some 152 acres acquired by the Land Commission on this estate, 90 acres were allotted recently&mdash;leaving a residue of 62 acres for disposal later.  The other information requested is contained in a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated <Col N="452" /> with the Official Report.  As I have often mentioned before there is, of course, no secrecy regarding the identity of allottees, but I feel very strongly that there should be the least possible invasion of the affairs of private individuals even when they are the recipients of allotments of land.  For this reason I reluctantly give the particulars sought but only to such extent as will not disclose personal or family information obtained by the Land Commission on a confidential basis from the persons concerned.</P>

I do not consider that there is any action that I could usefully take in the matter by way of public inquiry or otherwise.  The wide publicity given to this tragic accident should, however, bring home to parents and others the potential danger of these toys.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that for economic reasons connected with intense competition, the building of new ships has been discontinued for some time in Dublin.  The reduction, in recent years, in the number of Irish-owned ships using the Port of Dublin has, in turn, seriously reduced the volume of ship-repair work available.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the feasibility of reorganising and modernising the main Dublin shipyard to the extent necessary to enable it to compete successfully for new orders, is under active examination by its owners.  They are fully aware that I share their concern for the rehabilitation of the shipyard and they are assured of my full support for any workable proposals that can be formulated.</P>
      <P>Recent short-term measures to safeguard employment in the yard include the successful diversification of the yard's activities into industrial engineering work.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the House last met we have lost, through tragically <Col N="467" /> sudden death, Deputy Donogh O'Malley, Minister for Education&mdash; solas na bhflaitheas dá anam.  I wish to thank the leaders of the Parties opposite and Members generally for agreeing to the cancellation of yesterday's Sitting in order that we might all fittingly pay our last respects in Limerick yesterday to our late colleague.</P>
      <P>Donogh O'Malley was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1954.  That he headed the poll at each election was a measure of his great popularity in his native city and county.  But his popularity extended far beyond the confines of Limerick.  In every county, in every walk of life, he was known and esteemed.  An outstanding athlete in his youth, he maintained his interest in sport and, at his death, was President of the Football Association of Ireland.</P>
      <P>From his student days it was evident that political life had a special appeal for him and that he, in turn, had, in the highest degree, the talents and personal qualities which public life demands.  As a member of Limerick Corporation, as a member of Dáil Éireann, as Mayor of his native city, as Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works and, later, as Minister for Health, he proved to be a most able administrator with a capacity for speedy decision and a unique flair for dealing, efficiently and effectively, with complex problems, whether at local or national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But nowhere was his great ability, crusading zeal and boundless energy and enthusiasm more apparent than when the responsibilities of the Department of Education were entrusted to him.  In his short period in that office, his achievements were a tribute to his conviction that no task was impossible, no problem&mdash;no matter how complex&mdash;incapable of solution.  The needs of the less well-off sections of the community were always of special concern to him and he was ever tireless on their behalf.  That no child, because of inadequate financial means, should be denied the educational opportunities which he sought was the <Col N="468" /> cause dearest to his heart.  Not alone the present generation of students but the generations to come will have cause to remember with gratitude his unremitting efforts on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Donogh O'Malley gave generously of himself to the last, in the constant advancement of the causes and ideals to which he was dedicated.  What he accomplished in public life will remain a fitting monument to his memory.</P>
    <P>Through his death, this House has lost one of its most popular and respected members.  His constituency of East Limerick has lost a devoted representative and powerful advocate.  To me and to his other colleagues in the Government, the void left by his untimely death is all the greater in that his constancy of purpose and keenness of mind were ever graced with charm and humour.  It will be our resolve that the many projects initiated during his brief term as Minister for Education will be developed and sustained to the best advantage of the nation.</P>
    <P>In this, their time of most grievous loss, our thoughts go out to his widow and children and to his mother.  To them and to the other members of his family I would ask you, A Cheann Comhairle, to extend the profound and heartfelt sympathy of the House. Is danaid ghéar linn a mbris agus déanaimíd comhbhrón croí leo sa mhéala mór a bhain dóibh.</P>

At the present rate of demand for payments, the balance available would be insufficient to discharge claims arising before 31st March next. It is estimated that a total of £3,300,000 will be required to meet payments for the full year, and a supplementary sum of £300,000 is now being sought.</P>
    <P>New house grants account for the bulk of the excess expenditure.  Allocations of these grants totalled 6,571 in the ten months from 1st April, 1967 to 31st January, 1968, compared with 4,691 in the corresponding period of last year.  Allocations for the full financial year will reach about 8,000 as compared with 5,695 for 1966-67. There has also been a sharp increase in reconstruction grants, allocations for which totalled 10,483 in the ten months ended 31st January, 1968, compared with 8,037 in the corresponding period last year.  This increase is due largely to the scheme of grants for essential repairs to houses in rural areas.  This scheme first came into operation in 1963-64, when 37 grants were allocated. In 1966-67, the figure had grown to 1,040 and in the ten months to 31st January, 1968, a record total of 1,950 such grants was approved.</P>
    <P>Additional moneys are also required to meet payments due on foot of grants for the provision of private water supplies and sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> The amount voted for the payments of these grants and the making of contributions to local authorities in the current year was £500,000.  Of this, £94,000 was apportioned for the recoupment to local authorities of supplementary grants for water supply installations paid by them to farmers who would have been eligible for the scheme of domestic grants formerly operated by the Department of Agriculture. The balance, £406,000, was apportioned to the payment of grants and it is with this sum that we are concerned here.  Expenditure on the grants up to 31st January, 1968, amounted to over £400,000 out of the £406,000 earmarked for the purpose. An extra £60,000 is now required to meet commitments to the 31st March next.  The demands for grants for private water supply and sewerage facilities is unprecedented and the total of allocations is expected to reach 10,000 this year.  This is more than double the rate which obtained only five years ago.</P>
    <P>The amount voted for the payment of contributions towards loan charges on public water supply and sewerage schemes, swimming pools, etc. was £985,000.  Payments of contributions are made in two instalments, the first in May, being a payment on account, and the second after 31st October as final claims are received and checked. The amount paid in May was £449,890. It is estimated that the total amount required for the full year will be about £1,010,000.  An additional sum of £25,000 is therefore required under this heading.</P>

      <P>I want to say that we on this side of the House approve of this expenditure because we believe that money spent on housing, on sewerage, on swimming pools and so on, is money reasonably well spent. We believe, indeed, that at the present time a crash housing programme is necessary if we want to house the number of people in our cities&mdash;I think there are 5,000 to 6,000 people looking for houses at the present time&mdash;and the numbers in our towns and also in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I want to say that as far as grants for private housing are concerned, we know that the dead hand of Fianna Fáil descended on house building in 1957 and 1958 and that for many years during and immediately after that time it was impossible to get money to pay the grants.  There was a long delay in every county in Ireland.  We also know of course that there is very little encouragement given to people to build their own private houses.  Encouragement was given away back 20 years ago when the Government at that time, the inter-Party Government, allowed the local authorities to give a second grant of £300.  At that time there was the Government grant of £300 plus the local authority grant of £300.  On figures I got today from the Minister, the cost of building a five-roomed house in 1957 was £2,050; at the present time, it is £3,472.  In 1957 if a private builder received a grant of £600, he was getting roughly 35 per cent of the total cost of building his house.  That is quite true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the figures given to the Minister.  If we like to get more favourable figures for my argument, we can go back to 1948 or to 1951 when this grant was given by the Government in power at the time, the inter-Party Government, to encourage house building.  They gave the second grant of £300.  That left it at £600 and at that time one would build a five-roomed house for, I suppose, £1,400 or £1,500, with the result that the grants at that time were 40 per cent to 45 per cent of the total cost of building a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, due to Government policy, high taxation and one thing and <Col N="473" /> another, the cost of building a five-roomed house, according to the Minister's figures today in answer to a question, is £3,472.  That means that the person building a house today is getting the same grant as he was getting 20 years ago and, whereas at that time he was receiving over 40 per cent in grants of the total cost of building a private house, today he is only receiving 17 to 19 or 20 per cent.  That is very little encouragement for those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also referred to the increase under the heading of essential repair grants for essential repairs to houses in rural areas.  I believe this is a good scheme.  It is being worked by the majority of county councils at present. As far as we are concerned, we welcome that scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards sewerage and water schemes, Miss Nancy O'Neill, who is the Fianna Fáil candidate in Wicklow, speaking on television on Friday night in the presence of the Taoiseach referred to the fact that they had plans on paper for water and sewerage schemes.</P>

      <P>Those were the words she used.  She said: &ldquo;We have plans on paper...&rdquo; I want to say that &ldquo;plans on paper&rdquo; are the operative words.  We in the local authorities are being asked to keep preparing plans, to have them published in the paper. As a matter of fact, Westmeath County Council have plans to spend £5 million and we can hardly get £5,000 from the Department of Local Government.  We tried to get loans for repairing cottages and the Minister refused to sanction them.  Even when we got a bank that would give it, the Minister refused to sanction it.  I remember a few years ago when Deputy Blaney was Minister for Local Government, at the annual general meeting of county councils, he attacked us all the time on the ground that the county councils were not moving fast enough.  They were not preparing enough schemes or submitting enough schemes to the Department.  They submitted <Col N="474" /> them.  They got architects and engineers and they prepared schemes five or six years ago.  They were submitted to the Minister, but instead of getting the go-ahead, the dead hand of Fianna Fáil has again descended on the water and sewerage installations and we are being told by the Department now to go back to the group schemes which they believe can be a cheaper way of doing the work and that they can be as suitable.  We believe they are not.  We think is it completely wrong for the Department of Local Government to do as they did a few years ago&mdash;encourage the various county councils to employ architects, engineers and consulting engineers to prepare those elaborate schemes and then to find that the papers have been put away in their cubby-holes to gather dust because the Minister has no money to give local authorities to go ahead with those schemes.</P>
      <P>In my own county plans have been prepared for the past four or five years for Tyrellspass and Ballinacarriga water schemes.  What did the Minister do this year?  He asked us to prepare new priority lists.  When they were prepared, we found that where we had plans ready and where the Tyrellspass and Ballinacarriga schemes were No. 2 or No. 3 on the list, they were now No. 17 or No. 19.  There is no other convenient alternative for the Minister, when he has not got money to sanction existing schemes, when plans are prepared, than to pretend to local authorities and others that he is doing something by ordering the moving of the list of priorities which automatically shows that the schemes which are ready to go into operation are put back at the tailend of the list.  This may be clever politics but it does not satisfy the needs of the people and we are not advancing as we should in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also remember that there were grants for swimming pools and that the Minister for Local Government, when speaking a year or one and a half years ago at the opening of a swimming pool, congratulated the people of Longford for going ahead with providing a swimming pool.  He pointed out, as did all the members of the local <Col N="475" /> authority, the advantage of having many swimming pools in the different counties; they were of advantage to the health of our young boys and girls who could be taught how to swim and save lives.  He spoke about their utility from a recreational point of view.</P>
    <P>We are told in practically every county council that they prepared plans, that they were sent up and that they are now in the Minister's office.  I think plans were sent up for well over 100 swimming pools but the latest figure given by the Minister indicates that there is only money to go ahead with five or six, or even three, as I have been told recently, in the whole country. The Minister is smiling.  I want to ask him if there is any money to go ahead with the swimming pools for which the previous Minister for Local Government asked the local authorities very vigorously a couple of years ago to prepare plans and submit them.  However, as Miss Nancy O'Neill said on television the other night, the plans for sewerage and water schemes are all prepared but that is no use to the people. We want to know from the Minister when they will be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Plans are in the Minister's Department for sewerage and water schemes in respect of the whole of County Westmeath and, indeed, in respect of every county in Ireland.  This could give work which we believe would keep the people in rural Ireland.  Sewerage and water schemes for County Westmeath must be undertaken if we are to provide the people of rural Ireland with such amenities.  God knows, they are paying long enough through rates and taxes for those amenities for other people.  We do not want to see the people of rural Ireland relegated to the role of second-class citizens.  I should like to challenge the Minister, before I sit down, to give the percentage of the plans for swimming pools which he is prepared to sanction and give the go-ahead to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this Supplementary Estimate. The first priority is for better housing grants.  A Deputy from my own county mentioned some time ago <Col N="476" /> the number of foreigners who come in here.  In West Cork we see those people coming along, buying a piece of land and erecting a house but we also have this other affluent section of the people who find it is not terribly difficult to provide the money to build a house.</P>
      <P>We all know that building costs are escalating very much.  They could be termed skyhigh at the present time. Deputy L'Estrange mentioned £3,400 as the figure given by the Department for the erection of a five-roomed house.  In many places in West Cork, where they have not the same facilities as nearer Dublin, the price is much higher.  I believe there should be some inquiry into house building costs.  I know they vary very much throughout the country but there is no question that so far as private building is concerned at the present time, due to the scarcity of skilled operatives&mdash;many of them had to go out of the country some years past when the work was not here for them&mdash;house building is a very costly job.  There are possibly other factors such as the cost of land, which might also need to be taken into account.  I consider that there is an obligation on the Department to inquire into the cost of house building and to find out whether those costs are justified or not.</P>
      <P>We all know it is very difficult to get capital for house building at present.  This is particularly so so far as private house building, and to a lesser extent public house building is concerned.  The grants given at present are quite inadequate.  I know they were increased to £150 some three or four years ago and there was also an extra £150 given for a certain class of applicant, but we must take into account that costs in the meantime have soared far beyond that.  A house that could be built for £3,000 in 1964 today costs about £4,200 or £4,300 and the increase would be around 35 per cent.  I am basing those figures on my own part of the country with which I am conversant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister again, if private house building costs are not reduced, and it seems unlikely they will be, should address himself to the question of increasing the grants.  I should like in particular <Col N="477" /> to see an increase in so far as applicants who would qualify for local authority houses are concerned.  I believe he should encourage people to provide their own houses if at all possible. It is much better to expend money by way of giving grants to people to provide their own houses rather than have local authorities providing houses for them.  I am convinced of that.  From every aspect it is much better to encourage people to provide their own houses.  I know that much cannot be done without the aid of loans and grants.  Loans are prohibitive at the present time, as 8 per cent per annum is a big price to pay for money and many people find it difficult to avail of local authority loans, and insurance company loans which are at a higher rate than local authority loans.</P>
    <P>I have always admired the scheme in relation to reconstruction grants and I have admired the local authorities who have adopted the supplementary grants schemes because, undoubtedly, were it not for the grants available from the State and local authorities many of our houses would not be in the condition they are.  A substantial number of our people have availed of, or are availing of, these reconstruction grants and trying to keep their houses habitable and up to reasonable standards.  But, here again, at the present time there is this money problem. Costs are increasing and combined grants for reconstruction, irrespective of the work done, are at the figure of £280&mdash;£140 from the State and £140 from the county council.  It is some years now since the reconstruction grants were increased by £20&mdash;from £120 to £140 by the State and I think the time is ripe now for another increase.</P>
    <P>While I am inclined to agree that the percentage rate is reasonable at 66?, I think the maximum State grant payable should be moved up at least into the £200 bracket.  In view of the fall in the value of money and the increased cost of reconstruction work, that is not an unreasonable figure.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, reconstruction <Col N="478" /> grant applications are dealt with speedily, and, to a large extent, efficiently.  There are very few complaints. I agree with the Department's adherence to ensuring that the work is carried out to a certain standard.  There is no justification for payment of grants for sub-standard work and it is essential to have the work up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>You will, of course, meet some difficult cases.  Every Deputy will have come across them and the Department's attitude is not very helpful.  I am referring to the case where a person through lack of knowledge of the rules will commence work before the 15 years limit of the last grant has expired and the Department are not helpful here. That is a mean attitude.  Where activities have been carried out in good faith and where the work has commenced mainly due to a lack of knowledge in so far as the regulations are concerned, the Department could be a little more broadminded than they are, particularly having regard to the limited number of cases that arise.</P>
    <P>A broadminded attitude might be adopted in this regard but I must confess that there is little use in approaching the Minister to review cases like that.  I have in mind the case of a widow in West Cork who lost £80&mdash;£40 from the State and £40 from the county council&mdash;because she commenced work a few months earlier than the 15 years limit.  I am not making a case that there is no obligation on people to be conversant with the regulations.  It is essential that people who apply for grants should get particulars and investigate the regulations in relation to grants.  In view of the limited number of cases arising and the circumstances of the people concerned, it is amazing that the Department adopt the attitude they adopted in a number of these cases without any justification.  I believe the regulations should be applied in a more flexible manner.</P>
    <P>We in this Party would like to see, when the annual review of the Department comes before us, an increase in the rate of reconstruction grants.  I think it is desirable that such an increase should come about without delay.</P>
    <P>In so far as private water schemes <Col N="479" /> and private sewerage schemes are concerned, like the reconstruction grants the work here is moving along smoothly.  There is no great delay in dealing with the applications for grants approved and paid by the State and local authorities.  But, here again, the question of an increase in the rate of grants arises.  The present rate of £75 for water and sewerage in the case of individual applicants is inadequate and I think it should be increased in proportion to the rate of increases generally in costs in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is the question of section 30 grants where the Department limits itself to the payment of £80 and in some cases a council will have to pay up to £400-£500.  That is unfair on the part of the Department.  Under section 30 of the Act, the State grant is £80 and I think that figure should be increased.  We can get very little reconstruction work carried out for £80 and the type of people who benefit from such grants are those who are incapable of making any contribution towards the cost.  The grants are available only to those whose financial circumstances prevent them from keeping their houses habitable through their own resources. The Department should help the local authorities who are implementing this scheme and relieve them of some of the burden.  I have said already that there are sums of up to £400-£500 involved from the local authorities in some cases.</P>
    <P>In so far as private work is concerned &mdash;reconstruction work, water and sewerage schemes&mdash;generally speaking, there is not much to complain about, but in the matter of public schemes, the Minister and everyone associated with the Department are at a dead stop. I could go over again the picture painted by Deputy L'Estrange.  I do not know how many circulars the Department have sent out to housing and sanitary authorities.  Had I known this debate was to take place I should have brought in, Sir, for your viewing, a circular showing a woman with two buckets.  That was a special circular sent out by the Department to housing and sanitary authorities telling us that the day was gone when we had women <Col N="480" /> bringing buckets of water from wells, that piped water supplies would be made available to all and sundry and that local authorities should go ahead and make their plans and set about them, particularly in the case of regional schemes.</P>
    <P>We were being whipped in Cork, and I suppose the same circulars went out to all local authorities.  What happened? Unfortunately, the story is a rather sad one.  I will confine myself to portions of the West Cork area, to the electoral divisions of Cork county where the Western Committee of Cork County Council function as a housing and sanitary authority.  What picture do we find?  In response to these circulars, particularly those with the drawings, setting out the Department's recommendations in regard to the planning of schemes, we had the Clonakilty scheme. The Minister knows all about our schemes&mdash;he has received deputations on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Clonakilty scheme was planned entirely in accordance with circulars or demands made by the Department.  We embarked on sizeable expenditure to get it off the ground.  The total cost to the county council from local revenue was £20,000.  I had occasion to mention the scheme in the House on previous occasions but I wish to refer to it now once more because we may not have an opportunity again for some time.  The council, in accordance with Departmental approval, sought tenders for the implementation of the scheme and we got competitive tenders from a wide range of leading contractors.  It was the opinion of the council's technical advisers that the tenders were most competitive.</P>
    <P>I have no idea what the cost would be to an individual contractor to submit a tender for a scheme whose cost would be in the region of half a million pounds.  I am sure it would be a sizeable figure.  However, we were quite satisfied with the pricing of the tenders. Then last February, the Department told us there was no money, that the tender would not be approved if we sent it alone.  Without in actual words telling us that there was a lack of money, they confronted us with technical hitches of one kind or another <Col N="481" /> and the whole scheme went by the board.  That is the position up to date.</P>
    <P>Either by way of question or on the Estimate, I indicated what the position was and told the House it arose because of the Department's negligence and asked that the £20,000 lost to the ratepayers of West Cork should be recouped by the Department.  There has been evidence of gross neglect by the Department and I suggest now that the Minister gives us the green light for the implementation of this scheme without further delay.</P>
    <P>Still driven by the Minister's circulars, we embarked on a second scheme, the Baltimore and Skibbereen regional scheme in which the cost has been estimated at £247,000.  This is a most desirable scheme but there is no possibility of getting it off the ground because there is no money available. That scheme is at the tender stage.  I realise that the Minister's problem is that he has to deal with the country as a whole, that schemes are flowing in to the Department from different parts of the country, sizeable schemes that will cost a great deal of money. The reason I am going into this is to show it is due to the neglect and lack of foresight of the Minister and the Department.  They asked the local authorities to prepare the schemes. When we were preparing the Clonakilty regional scheme I happened to be chairman of the local committee and I anticipated that a scheme of that size would not be approved because the money would not be available.  I appreciated that we should try to complete smaller schemes, piecemeal, and that submitting regional schemes in respect of which there was little likelihood of getting money was not the best way of setting about the provision of water supplies in the West Cork district.  Unfortunately I have been proved correct. At that time the Department thought otherwise and asked us to send up regional schemes saying that was the most effective manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to have regional schemes executed.  I would have agreed if money had been available. <Col N="482" /> The result now is that in those areas people are without water supplies purely because of false impressions created by the Department.  If that had not been the case, people in those areas would have embarked on private schemes for which private grants were available.  To be quite candid, the Department made a major blunder in advocating the preparation of regional schemes at a time when money was not available.  If that had not been done, many people waiting for water supplies would have carried out private schemes to supply their houses with water.  In that way not only would they now have water but they would be able to avail of bonus grants for milk production available from the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Local Government should have been straightforward with the people and told them money was not available for larger schemes.</P>
      <P>We have other schemes in West Cork.  There is one scheme which will cost £80,000; there is a scheme for the Berehaven Peninsula which the Department are not inclined to approve; and there is a scheme for Crookhaven and Goleen which will come up in the not too distant future. I realise that West Cork is a relatively small part of the country but it is an important part and to carry out all the necessary schemes there would cost £1 million.  I appreciate also that it is difficult for the Department to provide that kind of money.  On the other hand, such schemes could be spread through a period of three or four years.  In the meantime, the Department's blunder on the question of regional schemes prevented farmers from looking for private grants to satisfy their private water needs.  The Minister has no one to blame but himself for the amount of criticism he has received.  Is it not time to stop?  Having made blunders, why continue to make them?  Would it not be advisable for the Department to announce that there are £X available for such and such a county and to say that that is all there is available, all the Department can give?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told in the Dáil that the Government are spending a lot of money, that we have a lot of money, <Col N="483" /> that the economy was never better and that we can provide all these amenities in a short period.  We have Departmental technicians writing to local authorities saying: &ldquo;We want your schemes now in order of priority.&rdquo; Then follows some technical hitch.  If a private business firm were to carry on their business in that blundering manner, I am sure bankruptcy would not be far from its doors.  The Department of Local Government are playing with public money.  Unfortunately, local authorities have to pay, out of local revenue, out of rates, for a number of the Department's blunders.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that I make these statements.  What is happening in County Cork is, I think, happening all over the country.  Errors have been made.  We should learn by our mistakes and turn over a new leaf so far as pronouncements by the Department are concerned.  For heaven's sake, do not send any more foolish circulars telling local authorities what they should do about housing, water supply services, sanitary services, and so on.  Local authorities would be only too anxious to go ahead, if they had the money.  I think I am correct in blaming the Department for the many blunders they have made up to the present.  It is a major problem to meet the financial demands by the different local authorities so far as housing, water, and sanitary services are concerned.</P>
    <P>Some time back, we heard a lot about group schemes, but they are dying slowly.  In the not too distant future, these group schemes will be a thing of the past.  We have some of them down in West Cork.  For one reason or another, they are delayed from month to month and from year to year.  We have one out in the Goleen district, one at Ballydehob and one in the Berehaven Peninsula as well as some small ones.  The money was collected some three or four years ago, but nothing has happened except the exchange of letters.  Some people are fed up with these group schemes, but I shall not labour that point now because I think they are dying.  I would make a special plea to the Minister and to the Department to try to implement <Col N="484" /> the ones where the applications have been made and the money has been collected, or else to make a public announcement that the group schemes have been abandoned and to let the people avail of the private grants.</P>
    <P>I think it is no harm to say that any person anxious about a water supply would be well advised to avail of the private grants, where the application is dealt with quite efficiently and without delay.  There is a vast difference between the Department's dealing with public and private schemes: public schemes are completely hopeless.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some indication of what the position will be for next year.  Local authorities should be given more latitude in the expenditure of money on housing and sanitary schemes.  Instead of all the delays involved in protracted correspondence with the Department, it would be a better day for the country if, instead of the present position, whereby every scheme has to be sent to the Department for sanction, more confidence were reposed in the local authority and a certain amount of money were given to the local authority for expenditure on schemes which they consider the more meritorious, they having the job of selecting the schemes and carrying out the work. The men on the spot, the local men, are better judges of the position in so far as the selection of schemes is concerned than people far from the scene in Dublin.  Of course, the Department is entitled to examine a scheme to ensure that everything is in order, but at present they are not giving sufficient authority and power to the local authorities in regard to housing and sanitary services.  If more authority were given to them in relation to such schemes, I think it would be to the general benefit of all.</P>
    <P>This is just a Supplementary Estimate to tide things over for the few remaining weeks of this financial year. I shall conclude by expressing the hope that the Minister and the Department will do me the courtesy of taking heed of the advice I have given so that the Department will work more swiftly than it has worked in the past.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate for the provision of additional moneys for housing and water supplies.  I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate.  It is a favourable pointer to the ever-increasing standard of living of our people that the allocation for new house grants has increased by approximately 50 per cent over a ten-month period.  It is surely a fair barometer of the progress being made and of the amount of development being carried out in the country when 6,571 persons are in a position to commence work on the construction of private dwellings during a period of ten months.</P>
      <P>I am secretary of a public utility society.  I must say that I have found the Housing Grants Section of the Department of Local Government to be one of the most co-operative sections in any Department.  It apears, from the present trend, that the number of private houses which will be built next year will definitely create an all-time record.</P>
      <P>It is also gratifying to note that there is an increase in the allocations for housing reconstruction grants.  In a ten-month period, there is an increase of approximately 25 per cent in the number of reconstruction grants being allocated. I sincerely hope&mdash;and it is evident. I think&mdash;that these grants are providing a good incentive to preserve existing housing accommodation, thus cutting out the need for the replacement of these houses in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the scheme of essential repair grants for houses in rural areas. We all know only too well that many of these houses which were occupied by elderly persons were allowed to fall into disrepair which resulted in local authorities being forced to build cottages for the occupants.  By availing of these grants, the local authorities can now improve and preserve these houses to the extent necessary to maintain them for the lifetime of the occupants and thus save the ratepayer and taxpayer from having to provide a considerable sum of money for houses in remote rural areas which, undoubtedly, <Col N="486" /> in time, would become unoccupied. When the scheme came into operation in 1963-64, only 37 grants were allocated. It is good to note that there were 1,040 grants allocated for the ten months to 31st January last.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give very special consideration to applications for reconstruction grants in respect of houses roofed with corrugated iron.  I understand that at the moment it is not the policy to make reconstruction grants in such cases.  I have come across a few cases where the owners have found it impossible to use any other type of roofing material by reason of the fact that the structure was not sufficiently strong or sound to carry any other type of roof.  I have come across one or two cases where applications for grants for extensions to dwellings were refused because of the fact that the plan provided for a corrugated iron roof, even though the roof of the existing dwelling consisted of corrugated iron.  Very special consideration should be given to such applications, bearing in mind the age of the structure, the type of material in the existing structure and the probable length of time the dwelling will be used for human habitation.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in group water schemes.  It would be most unfair to the taxpayer and the ratepayer to proceed with the regional schemes as originally planned.  I understand that there are schemes under consideration the cost of which would be approximately £24 million or £25 million. Imagine the impact that would have on the rates and on taxation.  Deputy L'Estrange stated earlier in the debate that Westmeath County Council had proposals for £5 million worth of regional schemes.</P>

      <P>I would strongly advise any local authority to proceed with group water schemes.  I have seen cases in Kerry where local farmers and others were very enthusiastic about regional schemes but on learning the cost and the impact on rates and taxation, they began to favour the group, co-operative, scheme.  There is a great deal of talk about the need for co-operation among farmers, various organisations and various sections of the community.  It is a grand thing to see ten, 20, 30 or 40 householders meeting in a local hall working out with the departmental inspector the proposals for a group scheme, estimating the cost and working out the practical details, such as how the necessary machinery can be hired at the cheapest possible cost, and making arrangements for the carrying out of the work at a time when most voluntary labour can be provided.</P>

      <P>The money spent to date in designing regional schemes was money well spent.  Our experience in Kerry is that when a group decide to carry out a scheme, they need only consult with the senior engineers in the county council who can consult the plans for the regional scheme and they can learn from that plan the source of supply and can work out to £1 what it will cost.  The money that has been <Col N="488" /> spent in planning regional schemes is money well spent.  That is my experience.</P>

      <P>Good progress is being made with group schemes in Kerry.  A few schemes are going ahead and major schemes are being planned. The Local Government inspector in Kerry is so busy at the moment working with various groups who intend to carry out these schemes that I am asking the Minister to provide a second officer for Kerry.  Probably, there should be an additional allocation of money in certain circumstances, where necessary, when a group run into difficulty as a result of having to remove rock or meet with other difficulty in the terrain through which the pipeline must be extended.  I would strongly recommend that special consideration be given to applications for additional money in such cases.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is considering applications for sanction for loans for water schemes and when priorities are being decided, he should give very special consideration to proposals submitted by a county council for the extension of existing county council schemes to a point from which a group could take over and also to proposals from a county council for the extension of an existing scheme and the building of a reservoir from which a group could take supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude by reiterating my firm belief in group schemes.  It is a grand thing to see the co-operation that is involved and to see private <Col N="489" /> enterprise working out the details for the most economical execution of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposal to provide additional money for swimming pools, I would urge the Minister to be very careful when considering applications for grants for swimming pools in towns where the local authorities have not lived up to their obligations in regard to houses.  I know at least one urban district council which has not lived up to its obligations in this regard.  I would also ask the Minister to ensure, before providing a grant, that adequate provision will be made for the maintenance of the pool after its erection.</P>

      <P>I hardly thought that in this debate again we would have to deal with such a ridiculous remark as that made by Deputy L'Estrange, that the dead hand of Fianna Fáil descended on housebuilding in 1957-58.  I did not think that Deputy L'Estrange, even now that it is 11 years since the Coalition Government brought this country's economy to such a state of disaster, would have the effrontery to expect the people to forget that and to expect to be able to get away with the suggestion that what happened in 1957-58 was that the dead hand of Fianna Fáil descended on housebuilding.  Nobody knows better than Deputy L'Estrange what happened at that time.

That is a record of this Government's achievements.  It is because they have taken good care of the country's economy, unlike the Coalition Government, and what is annoying Deputy L'Estrange is that the people know this.</P>

      <P>I well remember the time to which Deputy L'Estrange referred when my predecessor, Deputy Blaney, was exhorting the county councils to make a move in this respect, Deputy L'Estrange described it as attacking them for slowness.  Maybe it was, but the fact is that one of the difficulties which had to be surmounted was to get the local authorities to regain momentum in regard to housing activities generally.  That has always been a difficult thing to do when local authorities lose confidence, as they did in 1956-57.  It is always difficult to get them going again because their whole machinery goes out of operation and they are thinking on different lines completely.  However, that has been changed and the target of 12,000 to 14,000 houses a year has been reached this year when we will have over 12,000 houses completed. Deputy L'Estrange showed his contempt for facts when he represented that the normal grants available in 1948 were £300 from the State and £300 supplementary grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to that, Deputy Murphy did represent that the grants were inadequate and advocated that they should be increased.  I do not say that there is not a case for some increase in these grants but it is a fact that the level of grants at present is obviously not inhibiting private housebuilding in any way.  On the contrary, we have reached a very high level of private housebuilding, as I have already pointed out, and although each year we are able to provide a record amount of money for this purpose, there is never any difficulty in getting it all taken up.  As Deputies can see, this year we have had to come back for a Supplementary Estimate in order to provide all the money needed for this purpose, so that, whatever case may be made for increasing the grants, it certainly cannot be said that the present level is inhibiting private housebuilding. <Col N="493" /> It is obviously desirable to try to ensure as far as possible that these grants go for the provision of low-cost housing and we should not, therefore, do anything that might conceivably have the effect of inducing a further rise in housing costs.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Murphy returned, rather surprisingly, I think, to this charge that there was no money available for water and sewerage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Plans have been submitted to my Department for regional water schemes, the total cost of which would be something in the region of £42 million.  There is not sufficient money available naturally to carry out all these schemes at once.  Neither is there sufficient capacity in the industry. I do not think any reasonable person would expect money of that order to be made available all at once. Every year the Government assesses how much it will be possible for the community to provide for the State's capital purposes and designs the State's capital programme for the utilisation of that money.  This year, over 25 per cent of the total amount was allocated to the different purposes of my Department.  The major portion of that was for housing.  A substantial portion was for regional water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Murphy have been trying to represent that there is no activity in this regard and that the scheme was a failure and should never have been brought in.  The fact is, as I mentioned in replying to the debate on my Estimate, regional water schemes in progress or constructed represent a total value of £9 million and, this year, I have been able to authorise the commencement of further schemes to the value of £3.7 million.  That is not &ldquo;no money&rdquo;. It is a considerable amount of money allocated in any one year.  If Deputies would cast their minds back they might remember that I detailed the schemes authorised to start this year in my reply to the debate on my Estimate.  It so <Col N="494" /> happens I have that list here and, in view of the fact that neither Deputy L'Estrange nor Deputy Murphy is apparently aware of these schemes and have practically invited me to give them this information all over again, I must admit I am tempted to put it on the record again.  However, it is available in volume 232, columns 203 to 217 of the Official Report.  There Deputies will find a list of the works authorised to proceed this year.  That controverts the case made by both Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Murphy.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatsoever of me or my predecessor pretending that money for this, or any other purpose, is available or could possibly be available in unlimited supply.  What I do say is, and this I can substantiate, that it is available in ever-increasing amounts and that is because of the successful and prudent handling of the country's economy by the present Government. The fact that already £9 million has been spent and a further £3.7 million is due to be spent is evidence of substantial progress.  It is progress of which I, as Minister for Local Government, and the Government are proud.  It represents substantial improvements in living conditions over a large part of the country.  This is one of the ways in which the present Government demonstrate their appreciation of the fact that it is a fundamental duty of the Government not only to increase the capacity of the community to provide sufficient finance to increase production but also to ensure that that increasing prosperity is utilised for the improvement of conditions in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>With regard to the circular from my Department requesting local authorities to place regional water schemes in order of priority and to identify the most urgent sections of particular schemes.  I want to point out that it is the local authority and not my Department who decide the order of priority. The local authorities were requested to do this themselves.</P>

      <P>As I said, these priorities will be decided by the local authorities, and my opinion is that this was a more sensible approach for me to adopt.  In view of the fact that we had schemes totalling £42 million submitted, it was better to try to find out from the local authorities which schemes or which parts of schemes were most important so that we could allocate money in a sensible way.  As I said, not alone would it not be possible financially to embark on all these things together but it would not be realistic from the point of view of the capacity of the industry either.  I do not know whether or not I should deal with Deputy L'Estrange's comments on the by-election broadcast of the future Deputy O'Neill or whether I should leave it for Miss O'Neill to deal with herself next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>She should be able to deal with this next week, but I should like to point out to Deputy L'Estrange that before embarking on any water or sewerage schemes, it is, first of all, necessary to put the plans on paper, and any plans that have been put on paper are not wasted.  They are available there to be started and to be carried out according as the capacity of the economy to provide the money increases, and as Deputy L'Estrange knows to his chagrin, that is something that is increasing every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy at least let us know his real opinion of this, that is, that we should not have started these regional schemes at all, that instead we should have concentrated on group schemes.  I made it clear before that in so far as this question of water supply is concerned that it is a three-pronged effort and that none of the three aspects is exclusive of the others, that work to make piped water available to every home in the land is being carried out in three separate ways; one is, and only one is, the regional scheme; another is the group water scheme; and then there is the scheme <Col N="498" /> of grants for the provision of private water supplies.  Deputy Murphy says that the group schemes are dying out. Nothing could be further from the truth.  There was never more activity in regard to group water schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In February last there was a general review of schemes in Cork County which resulted in 155 grants being allocated and 181 being certified for payment.  In Cork 34 schemes for 462 houses have been completed; 32 schemes for 484 houses have been designed; and 44 schemes for 700 houses are in various stages of completion.  Group grants for the whole country are the biggest ever this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain the delay from the time a scheme is designed and all the difficulties are overcome to the actual commencement of the work?  Why does it take years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, he says he was advising people to go ahead with private schemes.  I do not know if Deputy Murphy knows what he is talking about at all.  The Department is actively promoting group water supply schemes and with some considerable success.  The engineering staff engaged on the work has been considerably augmented and, as I said, with the co-operation of the county councils significant progress has been made.  In the calendar year ended 31st December, 1967, grants for the installation of water in 2,328 houses were approved; grants were paid in respect of 1,747 houses; and designs for group schemes for 2,641 houses were received.  Therefore, there is considerable activity with regard to group schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> The only other point I want to deal with is the one raised by Deputy J. O'Leary with regard to reconstruction grants, the allowing of corrugated iron roofs.  I thought that the case he made seemed to be mainly concerned with the type of structure which is more appropriately dealt with under the essential repair grant schemes rather than reconstruction grant schemes, and, of course, in those cases corrugated iron can be allowed in suitable cases. Deputy L'Estrange referred to the question of swimming pools and he picked some figure out of his head or out of the air in saying that proposals had been submitted for 100 swimming pools.</P>

      <P>I do not know when they have a chance.  The amount of <Col N="500" /> money that can be provided for this purpose is not unlimited.  I never said it was, and neither did my predecessor. These pools cannot be built without proposals being submitted and without local committees being organised.  It is quite a desirable and commendable feature of the whole scheme that some local finance is required.  The raising of the local finance for this purpose is an indication of the depth and extent of the desire of the local people for this amenity.  We will provide money for these amenities on an increasing scale, according as time goes on and as our economic policy develops the capacity of the community to provide the money.</P>
      <P>Apart from these little points Deputies have raised, I want to thank the House for being so co-operative in agreeing to make this extra money available for the essential purposes of my Department.  Indeed, I may say the House is generally co-operative in voting money.  It is only when it is a question of raising it that we find the attitude is completely and diametrically opposed.</P>

      <P>Under this section you can repair roads and drains but can anything be done as regards the maintenance of them?  Will the local authority be empowered to maintain them in a reasonable state of repair afterwards?  In the past there was criticism made of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, particularly by Fianna Fáil members, because no provision was made for maintenance.  We all agree this was a good Act which gave good employment.  But the argument that there was no provision for maintenance was made on numerous occasions, particularly at the General Council of County Councils.  It was the one fault they had to find with it.  Is there any provision in this Bill to maintain these roads and drains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have had the experience in parts of Wicklow of going up boreens a mile or two long.  The people at the end of those roads have to pay taxes and to pay for such amenities as tarred roads, perhaps autobahns and speedways, as well as for sewerage and other services. These people have been neglected. Would the Minister not think the time has come when provision should be made for these people, that when the roads are made and put into proper repair at the expense of the taxpayers and the ratepayers, they should not be allowed to deteriorate again, but <Col N="502" /> should be taken over by the local authorities and maintained?  These people have been relegated to the position of second-class citizens for long enough.  It is no wonder they are leaving rural Ireland.  In the past few days in parts of County Wicklow, I have had to travel up roads where you could not get a donkey and cart. You had to leave the car and walk a mile or so and sometimes even take to the fields.</P>

I am quite certain we will get a sufficient number of votes there to have Godfrey Timmons here next week to help us make a case that something be done for these neglected areas.  Does the Minister think it right to spend the money of the ratepayers and the taxpayers improving these roads and then not making provision to have them properly maintained?  It is spending money unwisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This road improvement scheme has been in existence already for a number of years under the Special Employments Schemes Office and in many areas, therefore, the greater part of the roads are already improved and, in most cases, down in Cork anyway, taken over by the county council.  I want to find out the position about overcoming objections.  Most of the cases left in my district are cases where objections arose due to difficulty between parties, due to the fact that the beneficiaries of the households on the roads are not on the best of terms. Where you have five farmers on a road and for some reason or other, one objects to the improvement of the road, what happens then?  If the council find that the objection is based on spiteful motives&mdash;that is what I am talking about&mdash;can they overrule it? Unfortunately, that is the difficulty that exists and I am sure it has arisen in cases all over the country where you have objections submitted and no good grounds given, arising out of spiteful <Col N="503" /> motives, where bad relations exist between neighbours.  I do not think it is fair that one person should hold up a scheme.  I believe that where an objection is made by an interested party, an obligation should be thrown on that party to sustain the objection, and give reason for it.  I am not as conversant as I should be with the terms of the previous Act under which a person can apply for an order to enter on land.  That makes for bad feelings.  I should like an explanation from the Minister and I should like him to put this matter of objections in a nutshell.</P>
      <P>So far as the taking over of roads by local authorities is concerned, Cork County Council have a reasonably good scheme.  Where a roadway is improved up to council standards and where there are two dwelling houses or more on the road, it is taken over by the council.  I think you cannot go beyond that.  It is a matter for individual councils to deal with the taking over of roadways, once they are improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to endorse the appeal Deputy Murphy has made to the Minister on this question of objectors when such schemes are proposed. Deputy Murphy has said practically everything I had intended to say.  It is about time something was done about those people, particularly the people who, for spite, refuse to co-operate with others who wish to improve the conditions surrounding their homes. This was also dealt with pretty adequately by some speakers on Second Stage.  Obviously it must be a very widespread and frequent occurrence since so many people advert to it.  In almost every area one can think of, schemes have been rejected just because someone, through spite, would not co-operate with the majority.  In some cases the money was put up and still there was the odd man out who failed to co-operate.  I should like to add my voice to the voices of other Deputies in this appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister does not want to be kept much longer but I have one comment to make.  Section 2 refers simply to <Col N="504" /> land and does not refer to dwelling houses.  The Minister may or may not be aware of the fact that quite a number of local authorities have been taking over roads and, where there are two or more dwelling houses, declaring them public roads.  There are a number of these roads which cannot be repaired by the county councils under the present legislation&mdash;which we refer to as the McQuillan Act&mdash; because of the fact that they are not properly fenced or because there are gates on the roads.  I want to make it clear that this is not a question of the money involved.  It is a question of the power to do this that stops the county councils at present.  The councils are precluded from doing repairs to these roads because they are not properly fenced or because there are gates.  Will the Minister say if he considers they should be done under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of maintenance, unless the roads or laneways are declared a public utility and taken over by the county councils, maintenance is a matter for those who are served by them. That is the basis on which these schemes have always operated.  If they deteriorate, they can always be dealt with in the same way again.  If the councils were to maintain them, it would be equivalent to taking them over.  If they are a public utility, this can be done.  Generally speaking, I think councils are not inclined to take over all these lanes because of the responsibility which would devolve on them.  This scheme is, I think, reasonably satisfactory.  Probably it can be expanded to cover a sufficient number of these lanes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of overcoming objections, in general I do not think it desirable to give county councils the power to use compulsory rights in relation to one of these schemes.  Where the consent of an interested party appears to have been withheld unreasonably it would be more desirable to try to use persuasion. Officers of the Special Employment Schemes Office have been fairly successful in dealing with such cases in the past.  I do not think compulsory powers are desirable.</P>

Generally speaking, where there are objections like this, they are not insoluble, with a certain amount of local leadership and persuasion on the part of the county council officials.  These objections are not always without cause and they are, in some cases, the outcome of long-standing disputes between neighbours.  For the county council to come in and appear to side with one party to the dispute would be likely to involve an increase in bitterness rather than solving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of roads, while it will be a matter for the council to decide what they can do, the Special Employment Schemes Office has in the past proceeded without the consent of an individual objector, provided certain conditions are fulfilled; if the road is clearly defined, preferably between fences, and provided the applicants for the grant have definitely got a right of way over it; provided also that the work on the section of the road through the objecting landholder's land is necessary for the continued enjoyment of the right of way and is confined to the width of the existing road surface and <Col N="506" /> that there is no trespass on or interference of any sort with his land; provided also that the user of the road is not extended so that persons not entitled to use it shall have a right of passage after the work has been carried out, and provided that while repairs are in progress, the objecting landholder is not deprived of the use of the road in a reasonable way on his ordinary business.</P>
    <P>The experience is that there are very few of these cases and generally speaking they can be got over.  I do not think it is desirable, or has been shown to be so, to give compulsory rights to the councils in this respect.  In regard to the question raised by Deputy Tully, land in this section includes a dwellinghouse and it can be used where dwelling-houses are concerned.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not prepared to make any concession or give any power to county councils to take over and maintain those roads in proper repair?  Westmeath County Council, for example, puts 4d on the rates each year and we take over something like 24 roads.</P>

      <P>Yes, but there are people living at the end of roads like these paying taxes and rates and helping to give all other sections of the community proper amenities, such as tarred roads, footpaths and so on. These people are paying full rates and taxes and nobody will come to their aid.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Get it out of the rates,&rdquo; but I think there is hardly a county council in Ireland that is not facing an increase of from 5/-to 10/- in the £ in rates this year.  That is a heavy burden on the poor people in labourers' cottages, on the small businessman striving to make ends meet and on the small farmers, many <Col N="507" /> of whom are inclined to leave the land. Why would the Minister not agree to put up even a fifty-fifty grant to keep these roads in proper repair?  If the county council put up some of the money, should the Department not pay part of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is designed to do the work more efficiently and more effectively.  Everything cannot be done at once but these schemes are very desirable and necessary in the interests of the rural community generally. The proposal is to have the three different schemes operated as a single scheme and operated by the local authorities thereby making a bigger percentage of the total money available for actual work.  This will improve the position and enable more work to be done with the same amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that the scheme is designed to operate more effectively and more efficiently, does he imply that it has not done so in the past 40 years?  Is it not true that the idea of shifting the scheme to the local authorities is to shift the burden over to the local authorities? Why do not the taxpayers meet their full and fair share of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is fully financed by the Exchequer.  The main idea of this change is to reduce the amount of the total money that will be spent on overheads.  I should say that because of some of the conditions that were attached to this scheme in the past, efficiency was not the only thing that had to be taken into consideration.  For instance, as I explained when introducing the Second Reading, prior to this the money had to be spent in the area where the unemployment existed but now, although the recruitment of workers will still be done through the employment exchanges, the work can be carried out where it is most needed. That is one of the improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the overheads would be reduced.  While we understand that, as there would no longer be separate offices for the different schemes, does he think it would be possible for the local authority, particularly those who have a big number of schemes and a big allocation, to carry out the work without employing extra staff?  In that way, will the cure be worse than the disease?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  The big trouble will be the extra engineering staff, the cost of which will have to be borne by the local authority in the area.  Extra staff will be needed for supervising and payments and so on.  In my opinion&mdash;and I have got the advice of people who seem to know a great deal about this&mdash;the cost of this cannot be borne on the margin allowed by the Minister.  If that is so, in order to continue the schemes, the council will have to put on to the rates the money required in order to operate the schemes.  I am not quarrelling with the Minister about it but I think he should have this investigated because while the amount of money it will cost will be much less than it is at present, I still believe, no matter how small the amount being spent in an area, certain extra technical and clerical assistance will have to be provided and paid for, and I think the Minister will find that no local authority will be able to carry out the scheme on the margin he is allowing, which, I think, is ten per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to Deputies that they should not be too ready to accept the contention of some people that the amount being allowed will be too small.  Of course, we have not had any actual experience of it being operated by local authorities yet but the Special Employment Schemes Office have had considerable experience of the schemes that are now being amalgamated and it is believed that the allocation for administrative expenses is adequate.  I feel that everybody should co-operate to try to ensure that administrative expenses will be kept within that allocation.  As I have said, the scheme as operated by local authorities has not started yet and, of course, we will keep this whole thing under review but I am quite hopeful that it will not be necessary to allocate any more than ten per cent to administrative expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that those who have been operating local authority schemes of various types over the years have <Col N="510" /> experience and figures to prove what it has actually cost to run them and on the basis of those figures they have supplied what they think would be required to run the extra schemes?  If the amount allocated by the Department for this purpose is only about two-thirds of that which it takes to run the ordinary council schemes, surely the Minister must agree there is something wrong?  I would not accept for a moment that we should not be too quick to take the point of view of the people who advise us.  After all, we, as local authority members, are agreed to pay those people to advise us on this and other matters and if we take their advice on other matters, we should take it on this.  If they come back next year and say: &ldquo;We have lost money because the amount for supervision and planning was not sufficient or the amount for office work was not sufficient and we require an extra amount from the rates next year&rdquo;, I think that would be a mistake.  The Minister, of course, says it may be reviewed and I suppose that is as far as we can get him to go but I feel he should review it pretty quickly.  Alternatively, he should compare the rates of the various county councils which will be sent to him and find out if they differ very much or if there is one council which has said he has given enough money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in order on this section in referring to people such as gangers who worked on those schemes in the past?  Those people seem to be semi-permanent employees of the Board of Works at this time. When those schemes were run down because of the financial situation, we had a number of meetings in the west <Col N="511" /> of Ireland by people interested.  As far as I remember, we sent a deputation to the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works and they more or less got a promise that when those schemes would expand and when they would be handed over to the county councils, they would get an option on employment.  I do not suppose the Minister will be in a position to compel the councils to employ those people but I should like him to request the councils to give consideration to those people who are employed as employment arises.</P>
      <P>There may be the danger that the county engineer or the district engineer may say: &ldquo;We have more confidence in the staff whom we have had running our affairs for the past number of years and the position is that we do not need to employ any extra people.&rdquo; If this happened, I suppose it would be good from an administration point of view, but, at the same time, the people who were employed on those schemes in the past as supervisors, gangers, <i>et cetera</i> are looking forward to being employed on them again as far as possible and I should not like them to be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what happened in the west of Ireland to the extent that Deputy Gibbons is but I am aware of what happened in other parts of the country. It is true that while occasionally men are taken from the labour exchange to do a job, very often people are employed who are employed by the county council at that particular time of the year and sometimes there is continuation of employment from one to the other.  Rather than sending them to the labour exchange the local engineer makes an arrangement whereby they go straight on from one job to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could clear for me this question of superannuation? At the present time the superannuation of a ganger on the scheme or a special man who has been put on because of the fact that he can do a special type of work&mdash;building bridges, for instance&mdash;and who is seconded by the county council to the special employment schemes for the purpose <Col N="512" /> of doing a job is safe but those who are not so transferred have had extreme difficulty in proving that they had the necessary number of days to qualify for superannuation, although as far as they were concerned, since the scheme has been operated in most counties under the county engineer, they have been continuously employed over the whole year by the county council. Perhaps the Minister might explain.  Is it not true that in this scheme those people will, as direct employees of the county council, have their superannuation contributions safeguarded and what is the position up to now with regard to these people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully is, of course, talking about counties like Meath where the county engineer has, in fact, been acting as agent in charge of the schemes and where county council gangers have been carrying out the work and have, in fact, been in continuous employment.  That is the position there but in other places the work has been done directly by the Special Employment Schemes Office and in those cases the county councils have been requested to give priority on the new scheme to gangers or other supervisory workers who have been employed by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  For this purpose, the councils concerned will be provided with a list of those people and I have every reason to believe that they will be employed.  As Deputy Gibbons said, of course, I cannot actually direct the local authorities to employ them but I am reasonably certain that in every case they will employ them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the employment that was available to them, of course, always depended on the amount of work that was carried out in the particular area in any year and I am reasonably certain that this will be the position in future; that they will, in fact, continue to be employed just as they were in the past.  When the schemes are transferred from the Special Employment Schemes Office to the councils, any gangers who have the requisite service will be paid whatever gratuity or other payment they may be eligible for under the Superannuation Acts or the Redundancy Payments Act <Col N="513" /> but that would be without prejudice to their continuing employment.  As I have said, I am still confident that the local authorities will, generally speaking, employ the same people.</P>

      <P>This is a belated attempt by the Government to reintroduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but I am sorry it took them 11 years to appreciate the enormous value that Act had in that local authorities were enabled to give money during the slack period of the year.  It helped people in that time of unemployment, but I am sorry the Minister could not see his way to do something tangible and worthwhile for the small farmers who will still be left living at the end of the boreen and whose wives and children will still have to struggle through water to get to Mass, do their shopping and so on.  I am also sorry to say that at this stage we do not cherish all our people equally and that those people are still being asked to remain as second-class citizens.  This should not be when they pay so much in taxes and rates.  It is a pity the Minister did not do something worthwhile for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that the Local Authorities (Works) Act bears a certain resemblance to this scheme.  The only difference in my constituency is that this year we are getting £3,500 under this <Col N="514" /> scheme and under the Local Authorities (Works) Act we got £93,500.  A sum of £90,000 may be a small matter to the Minister because that is exactly the amount he took away from us through the Road Fund a few years ago because of the fact that we had all our roads black-topped.</P>
      <P>Perhaps when the Minister is piloting this Bill through the Seanad, he would give consideration to a certain type of lane which at the present time cannot be done under existing legislation.  The type I refer to is what we call spurs. There may be six houses on a lane, five of them on the straight part and one on the part leading off, and because of the fact that it is the only one on that side lane, the local authority rules that it does not qualify.  It is not an avenue.  If it is an avenue, I believe that the people who own the house should be able and willing to carry out their own repairs.  The people on this side lane or spur are people with moderate means and for that reason they should get some consideration.  I do not think the Bill as it is at the present can do anything for those people.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware that those cases exist.  Perhaps he would look at it to see if those people, of which there are a number in each area, could be included where the main lane is included but the spurs off it are not included.  The Minister should see if those spurs off the lane can be included because it would be very much appreciated by the people concerned.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last week, I had given an example from Dublin North-East constituency in the last general election where there were seven out of a total of 12 candidates who were not elected and where in the case of six of those, the votes cast for them were subsequently treated as votes for other people, and in many cases not just for second preferences but third, fourth, fifth and possibly sixth preferences were similarly dealt with.  In the case of one out of the seven candidates, through the operation of the unfair and illogical rule of this system, the voters who voted for him were excluded from this special consideration.</P>

As far as I can see, the only thing which differentiates between them and the others is that they found more people to agree with their viewpoint than others.</P>

This system takes into consideration the votes of those who can find a number of people in the constituency to agree with them.  This system seems to be specifically designed to ensure that the final decision will in fact be made by that group of voters in the constituency who in accordance with the normal principle of democracy would be considered to be the least responsible in the particular constituency.</P>

      <P>We have introduced this Bill because of the abuses and corruption that exist under the present scheme and the present method whereby the Minister for Local Government, a political head in the Government, has the final say as regards town planning.  We believe it is wrong.  It lends itself to abuse; it lends itself to corruption; and there is abuse and corruption under it at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Minister in a dictatorial, arrogant manner spent something like seven and a half hours in speaking on this Bill.  In all that time he tried to blame Deputy P. O'Donnell for his decisions as Minister for Local Government, and of the thousands of cases dealt with during that period he was able to cast any blame on Deputy P. O'Donnell in respect of three, and even on those three he had a very poor case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When you were finished, it was plain to be seen that as far as Deputy P. O'Donnell was concerned, when he was Minister for Local Government he did not use his position to dispense favours to members of his own Party, to close friends, to card carriers.  Members of that Party were not in an organisation that might be subscribed to to keep that political Party in office at that time.  Credit is due to the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent part of his time criticising the press, criticising solicitors, and others, who in their capacity as solicitors make representations, as they are entitled to do, on behalf of their clients.  He mentioned their names here and tried to throw certain blame on to them.  They were doing their duty and nothing else and they did it in a sensible way and, indeed, they can hold their heads high.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provision is made for appealing decisions of planning authorities to the Minister for Local Government.  When that Bill was going through the Dáil in 1963, Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;I think it was Deputy Jones who was our spokesman for Local Government at that time&mdash;spoke on numerous amendments in an effort to have the power taken out of the hands of the political head of the Department and vested in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, and the Party to which I belong, believe that it is wrong that any one individual should have such powers vested in him, power vested in a political individual that can make or break any person or firm.  I know from political experience that the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I think it can be truthfully stated&mdash;have never hesitated at any time in the history of the State to use their power and their influence to further the interest of their own followers and supporters and, indeed, very many of them make no secret about that.  Fianna Fáil also have never hesitated to use the tax-payers' money to keep the Party in office, to help to further the interests <Col N="519" /> of those, such as the members of Taca, whom the Minister spent a long time trying to defend, who support them financially.</P>
    <P>We know that Deputy Colley spoke about low standards in high places and many of us believe he was speaking about those closely associated with the Fianna Fáil Party, who largely subscribe to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Members of Taca subscribe £100 to sit down to dinner and sign bankers' orders for £100 a year and to many of those Deputy Colley was referring.  He knows that many of those used their contacts with previous Ministers for Local Government to get concessions to which they were not entitled.</P>
    <P>The present system, unfortunately, is being abused.  It lends itself to political abuse and I think it is wrong that people should have to crawl on their bended knees to Fianna Fáil Deputies, Fianna Fáil Senators, Fianna Fáil contact men or members of Taca or any other organisation so that they can make approaches as regards planning and planning appeals.</P>
    <P>At column 643 of the Official Report of 7th February, 1968, in discussing this Bill, Deputy Molloy had this to say and I quote:</P>
    <P>More and more people in my constituency are opening their eyes at last.  They come to me in their hundreds and they are in order in coming to me.</P>
    <P>Why are they in order?  Why do they come in their hundreds?  What does he mean by stating they &ldquo;are opening their eyes&rdquo;?  I know he knows that some of those people know at the present time that unless they come to a Fianna Fáil Deputy, or contact man, or to a member of Taca, with a planning appeal, they will not get justice or what they are entitled to.  The people who come to Deputy Molloy and other Fianna Fáil Deputies know that the Minister for Local Government is a politician and that he is the political head of the Department of Local Government.  They know he is also the political secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party, that he is in trust and that the present system gives him judicial status <Col N="520" /> in planning appeals decisions that can enormously add to the value of property.</P>
    <P>As a politician, the Minister is aware, as indeed we are all quite well aware, as indeed are the hundreds who flock to Deputy Molloy, that he is subject to political pressure from many angles. Indeed, it would be asking too much of human nature to expect the Minister not to be influenced by such pressure because we know that in this regard the Fianna Fáil Ministers never lacked the human touch.  In my opinion, it is asking too much to ask the present Minister, who has acted as the director of elections from one end of the country to the other, not to be unfairly influenced by political pressures, whether it be from Fianna Fáil TDs, from county councillors, members of Taca or, indeed, any other contact men in or of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Minister spent days in the House trying to defend Taca, especially in regard to town planning, we know that members of Taca are bragging that they can get favours in relation to planning and so on.  When I suggested that some members of Taca had given £1,000 to Fianna Fáil, the Minister said such sums were not as large as the thousands we get.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael depend solely on the small subscriptions of the decent respectable people of the country who, in the words of President Kennedy, think of what they can do for their country, not what they can get out of it.  Many of those people brag that the thousands they are giving are well spent because they can get favours they know they are not entitled to.  They look on it as an insurance policy. Many of them can be seen in the rooms of Leinster House.  Many of them have not to go to a TD or Senator to get immediate access, perhaps with the grace of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with one of the most blatant cases of admitted political corruption that has come to light in relation to planning.  I will give the reference.  It is 1967, No. 94-OP, Kelly, national teacher, a Donegal man, <Col N="521" /> against Dundrum Enterprises.  This case has not been before a court and therefore it is not <i>sub judice</i>.  I will give the full facts.  Kelly stated that he was a friend of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;not the present Minister for Local Government&mdash;that he would get planning permission for a consideration.  Shades of Taca!</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>He was prepared to go between.  The consideration he wanted was £3,000.  He said he could get the planning permission if he were paid £3,000.  A sum of £500 was paid to this gentleman and post-dated cheques were given for the remainder. The post-dated cheques given were for amounts of £1,000, £1,000 and £500. It was in January, 1966, and the post-dated cheques were dated March, 1966.  The defendant got his planning permission through the intercession of Kelly, but we know gratitude can be a heavy burden.  The cheques were stopped.  Remember, the deal was for £3,000 and he had been paid £500 cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy be good enough to particularise?  I heard the name Kelly.  If the Deputy is making charges, very serious charges, he should be specific about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy MacEntee's interest, I have given the reference number of the case and the Deputy can get it and the Attorney General can get it for investigation. That is why I am giving it.  It is 1967, No. 94-OP.  The cheques were stopped. The plaintiff, Kelly sued for £2,500, representing the stopped cheques and the court case was to be heard on Thursday, 7th March last.  The first defence entered was a denial that planning permission has been obtained through the good offices of Kelly or that the site had been sold at an enhanced price.  Kelly replied that he did <Col N="522" /> get the planning permission, that he was responsible for getting it.  A second defence entered was that it was contrary to public policy.  Here was an admission of corruption.  As I have said, the case was to have been heard on Thursday, 7th March, but when both the defendant and plaintiff came to the court and saw that the court was littered with journalists and photographers, neither could afford to fight it and wash their dirty linen in open court.  A settlement was reached.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a point of order.  The Deputy must be precise on this matter.  He said the case is not <i>sub judice</i>, that it has already been decided.  He now tells us the case did not proceed.  That means that it has not been decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When it came to court, they found that the court was littered with photographers and journalists and neither could afford to fight and wash their dirty linen in open court.  Therefore, a settlement was reached for a considerable part of the sum claimed&mdash;£1,500.  Deputy MacEntee can get that in the files of the court if he cares to go down there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy how does he relate this to the Bill before the House and to the conduct of the Minister for Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been arguing that corruption exists under the present system and that it should be taken from the political head of the Department and transferred to a committee presided over by a judge, with two assessors, a system in which you cannot have this type of corruption.  I am basing my case on that and on a case of corruption that has taken place which I wish to see investigated.  Kelly has received £2,000.  For what, we are entitled to know?  We want to know also who is to get the money, where it has to be distributed.  The people of the country are entitled to know and I hope the Taoiseach gets to the bottom of this six-mark question because it is quite obvious that if justice is to be <Col N="523" /> seen to be done, the papers in this case should be forwarded to the Attorney General to form the basis of a prosecution for what in effect is an attempted criminal conspiracy.  It is all the more sordid because it indicates the presence of low standards in high places.  Indeed, I should like to know would it be possible if Deputy Colley was also thinking of this when he made his now famous speech in Galway on low standards in high places.</P>
      <P>I want to tell Deputy MacEntee that all the information can be got from the court records.  Indeed, I shall be surprised if a judge of the High Court has not already sent on the papers to the Attorney General.  If he has not, he should have.  The Minister for Local Government has been most vehement in the House in his denials that the Planning Act, brought in by Fianna Fáil, in any way lends itself to corruption. I submit without fear of contradiction that the case I have mentioned pins the hands of the Government and of the Minister, and I challenge them to disentangle themselves and to bring the people guilty of this conduct to justice immediately.  That one case alone, in my humble opinion, justifies an immediate change from the present method in which the political head of the Department can dispense such favours.  We believe a Bill of the type we have introduced is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say and has said that he can see no reason for this, that there has been no demand for it.  It is significant that even the Association of Municipal Authorities, at its annual congress, unanimously&mdash;unanimously&mdash; called for the transfer of appeals from the political head of the Department&mdash; the Minister&mdash;to an appeals board, just as this Bill envisages.  The majority of the members of the municipal authorities are Fianna Fáil but we have to admit that the Fianna Fáil councillors seem to be sick and tired of jobbery and corruption as is evidenced by the fact that they themselves unanimously agreed at the annual congress that this power should be taken out of the hands of the Minister, who is the political head of the Department, and transferred to an independent board such as we envisage in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> In 1963, we tried very hard to have those powers taken from the political head of the Department and vested either in the courts or in the type of appeals board we now suggest.  That view was not accepted by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government or by the Government at that time. Indeed, we were content to wait and to see how the Act would work out in practice.  I think it is now quite clear, beyond any shadow of doubt, that the appeals provisions of the Act are not working satisfactorily.  On the contrary, the appeals procedure is the object of widespread criticism, suspicion and distrust and, as I have shown here tonight &mdash;and I intend to mention further cases &mdash;of corruption.  Indeed, it is very difficult to see how it could be otherwise.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced to put an end, once and for all, to this widespread criticism, this widespread suspicion, this distrust and, above all, to put an end to the corruption which exists at the present time.  Not alone is it important that justice should be done but it is important that justice should be seen to be done.  We heard about the young people and about what Deputy Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, said in his speech. He said that young people should not be dispirited if, at some time, people in high places seemed to have low standards.  He went on to say that people of low standards would never lead our country if young people were active and vigilant.  We are inclined to ask what Deputy Colley was talking about, bearing in mind that apparently he knows better than most people the public image of Fianna Fáil.  Many people know about the low standards in high places.  Many people know what Fianna Fáil will, at times, stoop to, in order to bring grist to the mills of their own supporters.  I hope and trust the case I have mentioned here tonight will be investigated immediately.</P>
    <P>There are many other cases&mdash;recent cases &mdash; of the abuse of the power vested in the Minister, especially the petrol station in Mount Pleasant.  We know that there were&mdash;I want to say this to the Minister &mdash; criticisms in newspapers.  I want to give full credit <Col N="525" /> to any newspaper that exposes corruption in any Party or section of the political life of this country be it here in Dáil Éireann, in Seanad Éireann or in any local authority.  I think full credit should be given, no matter what paper it is, and it is wrong that any Minister or any Member of this House should criticise either newspaper editors or reporters for doing their duty &mdash;and more luck to them as long as they continue to do it in that direction.</P>
    <P>As regards this particular case of Mount Pleasant, we know that there were a number of applications to Dublin Corporation from individuals who were anxious to buy this plot of land for a petrol station.  The people concerned, who owned the land, and who wanted to sell it, also made application. They were all refused.  The corporation gave good and valid reasons why they refused permission to erect petrol pumps at this particular spot. But, then, along comes another gentleman who buys it or takes an option on it.  Because he has good contacts, he knows &mdash; beforehand &mdash; that, with the contacts he has, he can get permission. He takes the option on it and he submits the plans, and so on, to Dublin Corporation.  He is refused but he appeals to the Minister.  The Minister upheld the appeal and over-rode the corporation and a petrol station can now be built at Mount Pleasant.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister has enhanced the value of the property by between £50,000 and £60,000.  If people cry &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; in this particular case, there seems to be very good reason for it.  If the owners of the property&mdash;who needed the money&mdash;had got the enhanced value for it we could not make these allegations.  The Minister tried to tell us in this House that it was the owners of the property that got the planning permission&mdash;and he knew well, at the particular time, that that was not so.  It was a man called Lahart. Indeed, his architect, the man who submitted the plans, was one of the men who appeared in the photograph the evening the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;at the time of the succession race&mdash;was coming home at the airport.  The architect for Mr. Lahart appeared in the photograph <Col N="526" /> holding a placard with the words &ldquo;Charlie is the Greatest&rdquo;.</P>

They made application that they wanted to sell it to Dublin Corporation.  They were refused. Another individual or two took an option on it.  They were refused.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, yes,.  But there was another gentleman very closely associated with the Fianna Fáil Party, Mr. Lahart, and whose architect, as I have told you earlier, was in the photograph carrying the banner with the welcome home for the then Minister for Agriculture at the time of the succession race here, and had the placards &ldquo;Charlie is the Greatest&rdquo;.  He was helping to hold up one of these placards.  This particular gentleman knew that he had the proper contact.  He knew, in the words of Deputy Molloy who, speaking from those benches, said that the people are now opening their eyes and coming to him in their hundreds as regards planning permission and planning appeals. He took an option on the site.  He knew what was going to happen.  He used his influence and it came before the Minister and he got planning permission. The Minister over-ruled Dublin Corporation despite the fact that Dublin Corporation had refused both the owners of the property and one or two other individuals.  The Minister tried to convey to us last week that it was the owners of the property who had obtained the planning permission.  He knew that it was not the owners.  He since knows that that piece of ground is worth £50,000 to £60,000 for a petrol station and it is not the unfortunate owners of the property who needed the money and who wanted the money who got the planning permission but the speculator who is closely associated with and attached to the Fianna Fáil Party who got it.  I will quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 28th February, when the Minister was speaking on this.  The Minister, of course, stated in this particular case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never allege that he made any statement.  I want to quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 28th February:</P>
      <P>Taking everything into account, the Minister said he was satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>I have to say that because it is in the quotation.</P>
      <P>Taking everything into account, the Minister said he was satisfied there would be an over-all improvement of that area with this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what he had to say about <Col N="535" /> other areas on which Deputy P. O'Donnell was supposed to have ruled. When the Minister gives permission to erect a petrol pump in this area which is over-supplied with petrol pumps and a residential area, it is an asset.</P>
    <P>Mr. L'Estrange asked was it the original owners or the speculator who bought the land who was to get the profit.</P>
    <P>I asked that question because the Minister had left us under the impression that it was the original owners and he refused to answer the question but went on to make an attack on me.  He had left us under the impression, when dealing with that particular case, that it was the original owners who he said, needed the money, who got the planning permission and that they would get the money.  We know that is not so, that it is the speculator who bought the property from them at a very low price.  This means that it is worth 30 to 40 times what he paid for it.  If that is Fianna Fáil justice, then God help us all.</P>
    <P>There is another case quoted here, the case of Raheny village, involving 90 to 100 acres at Kilbarrack.  A man named Forkin had 70 acres and I think he had a compulsory purchase order clamped down on him.  There were no corporation houses near Forkin's but Mr. Gallagher appealed to the Minister and the appeal was allowed for, approximately&mdash;I am not certain of the acreage&mdash;100 acres.  In any event, that enhanced the value of the land three-fold. At a conservative estimate, it increased the value of the land from £1,000 to £3,000 or, we might take it, enhanced the value of the whole area by anything from £100,000 to £200,000 or £300,000 because the political head of a Department removed the compulsory purchase order on roughly 129 acres of this land.</P>
    <P>It is completely wrong that that should be done for a particular individual while another individual has to remain out in the cold.  I for one am not prepared to believe the very lame excuse given to us by the Minister when he was speaking in this House. <Col N="536" /> The same man who got that is at present building houses in Dundrum. Let the Minister investigate this.  He is getting away with putting down a 20-foot wide road where he should have put down a 24-foot wide road. He is bragging about getting away with it and saying that he is paying damn good funds to the particular Party and that it is an investment and that he does not see why he should not.  Let the Minister see the width of the road which he is leaving there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan left to get his tea.  He will be back in a few minutes and he will speak again.  I want to raise another case now, the <Col N="537" /> case of two houses which were bought for about £7,000.  There was a very colourful supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, very colourful when he was on television recently; he had great praise for the Fianna Fáil Government. When he was asked how he became so wealthy, he said it was by using his head, his brains and initiative, and there was no luck and chance attached to it.  This particular gentleman bought these two houses for about £7,000.  The people who had them could not get planning permission. They were refused planning permission and the two houses were sold to this very colourful supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party for £22,000. Now these houses were situated at the corner of Lansdowne Road and Northumberland Road.  The purchaser appealed to the Minister for Local Government for permission to build offices.  He got permission immediately and he then sold the site to a property group for between £90,000 and £100,000.  There was the speculator succeeding where others had failed, the speculator closely associated with the Government; he does not deny it. He admits he subscribes largely to the funds and it is admitted, I think, that he subscribed as much as £10,000 in 1961 and he brags that all the State cars were bought from that firm since.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>He claimed he subscribed £10,000 and he said it was the best investment he ever made because the Government have bought all the State cars from him since.  In any case, planning permission was given contrary to the wishes of the local residents. It should be remembered, too, that these premises are situated at a very busy and dangerous junction. <Col N="538" /> This man, through his contacts, through abuse of power and privilege by certain people, was able to rake off over £70,000 in one deal.  It is wrong that any Minister, that the political head of any Department, should have such powers vested in him that any exploiter or speculator, knowing the facts beforehand, can buy from an unfortunate individual, an individual who is refused planning permission, and, immediately after buying, get planning permission and make £70,000 to £75,000 profit.  That is blatant corruption. It should end.  The system that encourages it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is time there was a change.  It is no wonder the Minister has fought for seven days to hold on to the powers he has.  If there were not some reason for it, the Minister would not have made such a fight against the proposed change.  The Minister himself admits he had to stay up until 11 o'clock on Christmas Eve, burning the candle at both ends.  If there were no particular reason for the Minister holding on to this power, why should he not be delighted now to avail of this Bill, to tell himself that here is a golden opportunity of passing this work over to an appeal board consisting of a judge and two assessors, a board which would deal fairly with all cases coming before it because, no matter what may be said about the judges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the respect the Minister and his Party had for them at one particular period in the history of this country.  We believe that with the type of board we suggest justice would be dispensed and those who appealed to the board would get a fair crack of the whip.  There would be no Tammany Hall methods then; those are the methods in existence at the moment.  Fine Gael propose the establishment of an independent board devoted full-time to dealing with planning appeals.  The board will be provided with such staff as are necessary to enable the board to function properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us about the large number of appeals that he has to deal with every year.  He spoke at length of the amount of time he and other Ministers have had to devote to these appeals.  He told us the number <Col N="541" /> is growing every year.  The total number of appeals dealt with in the year ending 30th September, 1967, was twice the number dealt with in the year ending 30th September, 1965. Power is given to the Minister in the Bill to increase the number of members of the board so that a second board would be available, if necessary, to deal with appeals.  The second board would have the same powers and would act in all respects in the same way as the permanent board to be appointed under the Bill, but we believe that one board would be sufficient to deal with the number of appeals.</P>
    <P>In the modern society in which we live it is obviously necessary that the State should play an ever-increasing role in public affairs; at the same time, the stage has been reached where, by steadily increasing autonomy, the Government and the Civil Service have quite literally become a law unto themselves.  Most ministerial decisions made in exercise of discretionary powers vested in Ministers by various statutes are not subject to the authority of the court.  There can be no appeal against them and they cannot be effectively made the subject of an inquiry even in this House by Parliamentary Question, by debate on the Adjournment or in the course of debates on the Estimate for a Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the decisions of Ministers are too numerous to permit of any scrutiny in order to avoid the injustices which may arise and, indeed, do arise in many cases, as I have already pointed out.  It is utterly impossible for any Minister to cope with all these appeals.  Deputy P. O'Donnell was fair enough to state that he, as Minister for Local Government, could not possibly go through all the documents, through all the recommendations, objections, etc., involved in appeals. The Minister misquoted him here and tried to tell us that when Deputy P. O'Donnell was Minister for Local Government he only signed on the dotted line.  Of course he said no such thing.  He stated that, with all the different documents, all the different <Col N="542" /> files and all the objections attached to each case, it would be impossible for any Minister to deal with each and every one, but that he would read the recommendations of his advisers and then make up his own mind.  However, I think it is admitted that, except when certain political contacts are made, more frequently this authority is exercised through the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In most European countries they have provided some form of protection against arbitrary decisions by the Executive Government.  In France they have an appeals council of their own. In Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and even in New Zealand there is an officer corresponding, perhaps, to an ombudsman about which we hear so frequently in modern times.  Recently in Britain parliamentary commissioners were established in recognition of the growing public concern that individual citizens might be subjected to unfair treatment by Ministers in the exercise of their statutory powers.  When in France, Sweden, Finland, Denmark. Norway and New Zealand power has been taken out of the hands of the Minister of Local Government, or whatever they call him in these different countries, and is being exercised by an independent board, I cannot see what is wrong in asking our Minister to shed the responsibility he has in this regard and set up the board that we have envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A feature of cardinal importance in the case of the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission is the fact that they are quite independent of the Government and of the Minister in the terms of their appointment and in their operations.  This is probably why they have always been able to exercise their powers judicially irrespective of the wishes of a particular Minister or of the pressures sometimes sought to be exercised by groups organised in relation to a particular holding of land.  I am a long time in this House and I have never heard any Member, irrespective of the political Party to which he belonged, making any criticism of the Lay Commissioners.  The type of board we envisage is similar to the Lay Commissioners who exercise their judicial function as regards the acquisition <Col N="543" /> of land and who, I must say, do it very well.  Justice seems to be done and justice is done in this case.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts, a form of appeal to an appeals officer is provided.  This is a satisfactory arrangement where the authority of the appeals officer is exercised independently while he is a member of the permanent staff of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is not the Minister who makes the decisions; it is these deciding officers, and I think there is very little fault to be found with them.</P>
    <P>More important still, however, is the decision of the Government to accept the principle of an independent tribunal in the Redundancy Payments Act of 1967.  That Act provides for the establishment of a Redundancy Appeals Tribunal to determine appeals. The tribunal has all the powers necessary to enable it to exercise its power independently, independent of the Minister and independent of the Department of Labour.  It might be no harm to mention that under the Bill as introduced by the Minister for Labour no such tribunal was provided for.  Appeals were to be taken to an appeals officer under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is very much to the credit of the Minister for Labour that he accepted an amendment by Deputy Jones to establish an independent appeals tribunal.  It is also perhaps an interesting coincidence to recall that it was Deputy Jones, Fine Gael spokesman for local government when the Planning Bill was being debated in the House, who so strongly, so persistently and so rightly advocated the necessity of making provision for appeals to be decided by an independent authority and not by the political head of the Department.  As far as we are concerned, it may be a Fianna Fáil Minister today or a Fine Gael Minister tomorrow, but we believe it is wrong to leave this power in the hands of any Minister, whoever he may be.</P>
    <P>In this Bill Fine Gael propose that the new board shall consist of an independent chairman who shall be a judge of the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court and two other <Col N="544" /> members, one to be drawn from a panel of members nominated by the Minister for Local Government and the other to be drawn from a panel constituted by the Local Appointments Commission.  The person drawn from the panel must be a qualified civil engineer, qualified architect or qualified town planner.  The idea behind it is a good one.  It takes the power away from the political head of the Department and places it in the hands of a judge&mdash;a man who would not be intimidated by the bullying and arrogant tactics we had here tonight from the Minister for Local Government, a man who would be independent of that type of conduct, a man who would hear the appeals and come to a fair decision having listened to all the evidence and assisted, as we said, by two assessors.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was going through this House the Minister for Local Government spoke with his usual sneering, slanderous and mud-throwing statements, the kind at which Fianna Fáil are so good, having been character assassins for a long number of years now.  Of course, they were throwing the dirt that the lawyers wanted this to bring grist to their own mills.  I want to refute that statement.  As far as the lawyers and solicitors in Fine Gael are concerned, they are not briefless barristers but barristers who are in the higher income brackets.  They are men who have made a success of their own careers and they do not want grist to be brought to their mills by Fianna Fáil or anybody else.  We refute the allegations and sneers and jibes that were made in this House by the Minister for Local Government when he was speaking on this Bill&mdash;the sneers he made about judges, about solicitors and about barristers.  You would expect a little more from him.  But, indeed, seeing his behaviour here tonight, I am surprised that he was not worse and did not go even further in his remarks. I want to refute his allegations.  If Fianna Fáil Ministers want to judge other persons by their own low standards certainly, as far as I am concerned, the Minister for Local Government is not going to get away with it in this House.  If we have lawyers and <Col N="545" /> solicitors in our Party, we are proud of them.  They are earning their living honestly through hard work.  They have not to stoop to the corruption and low tactics to which members of the Fianna Fáil Party have to stoop.  I would ask you not to judge the people on this side of the House as perhaps you know some of your own friends.</P>
    <P>The purpose of appointing a judge to act as chairman of this tribunal was to provide something I believe is really necessary&mdash;new public confidence in planning appeals.  There is no use preaching about cherishing all the nation's children equally if we are not prepared to see that it comes to pass. In our present society no better system for ensuring fair play for all concerned has been devised than the machinery for the appointment of judges, men who are absolutely independent in the exercise of their judicial powers.  Down through the years the system of judicial appointments here has worked very well and has given general satisfaction to the community. After the cases I have exposed here tonight, indeed the fact that the Minister lost his temper and referred to me as &ldquo;a cur, a liar and a swine&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

I am glad that the fact I mentioned this case here this evening has brought this response from the Minister, but I am doubly glad to hear that at long last it has been referred to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that the system of judicial appointments has given general satisfaction.  No doubt individuals will harbour a sense of grievance because a particular judge has not seen things their way.  There must be a loser in <Col N="546" /> every contest, even before a judicial person.  What we want more than anything else today is to restore confidence. The public in Ireland have an unshakeable belief in the impartiality and incorruptibility&mdash;and I stress those words&mdash;of our judges.  It is for that reason that we in Fine Gael propose that a judge should be the chairman of the board, and that the decision of the board will be the decision of the judge who will have the benefit of the assistance of two highly qualified persons, one appointed by the Minister and another from the panel of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It has been said here by members of the Fianna Fáil Party that a judge is not a properly qualified person to hear and determine appeals under the Planning Act.  Some of those people made different charges against judges. I think the same can be said of Ministers of State.  Many people could say that they have not the experience to deal with these appeals.  The charges which were made here against this type of board by members of the Fianna Fáil Party could equally be made against many of our Ministers for Local Government.  In any event, I think it is wrong even to say that they are not qualified, because judges have the capacity and training, and in sitting and acting judicially, they have given considerable satisfaction to people appearing before them with wage claims and as regards the acquisition of land.  The people appointed were not farmers; they were judges.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any member of this House who can find fault with them.  No one can come in here and make any charges of corruption against any of those individuals or make any charges of corruption in any way as regards their decisions.  That is a grand thing.  We would like it if we could get the same confidence instilled into our people in respect of town planning. That is why we want to get away as quickly as possible from the present system where any Minister of State&mdash;I do not mind whether he is a Fianna Fáil Minister, a Labour Minister or a Fine Gael Minister&mdash;has the authority to make or break an individual or a firm.  That is what they can do with <Col N="547" /> the powers vested in them under the 1963 Act.  I pointed out how a decision of a Minister enabled a particular gentleman to buy a piece of ground for £22,500, get planning permission, and then sell that piece of ground for £95,000, making a profit of £75,000 thereby.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to provide an additional sum of £308,000 in the present financial year to cover expenditure by Bord Fáilte Éireann as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  £52,000 to compensate for the effects of devaluation on the cost of the Board's committed marketing budgets in North America and the continent of Europe;</P>
    <P>(b)  £206,000 to exploit the opportunity presented by devaluation to attract more visitors; and</P>
    <P>(c)  £50,000 to supplement the funds of the regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide these additional funds under Subhead F.1 of the Vote for the Department of Transport and Power from which the Board's general activities are financed.  It has been found possible to set off against the amount required, savings of £307,990 on other subheads of the Vote with the result that the net amount now required is a token provision of £10.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the Estimate arises mainly from the circumstances created by devaluation.  As Deputies are aware, the £ sterling was devalued last November.  A considerable portion of the promotional activities of Bord Fáilte is carried out in countries such as the United States, Canada, France and Germany which have not devalued. As a result of devaluation the cost in sterling of activities in these areas has increased by more than 16 per cent and Bord Fáilte have calculated that the cost of maintaining expenditure at the level provided for before devaluation took place will require an additional amount of £52,000 in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> In addition, it is proposed to launch a more intensive publicity and promotional campaign abroad for the purpose of exploiting the opportunity which devaluation presents of attracting more visitors to this country. Devaluation will mean lower prices here for visitors from countries which have not devalued.  There is the further consideration that costs in most European countries have increased for British holidaymakers.  It is proposed accordingly, to intensify marketing activities in North America, continental Europe and Britain to secure maximum benefit in terms of extra tourist revenue from these areas.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally appreciated that because of the improvement in the rate of exchange for visitors from North America and Europe it will be necessary to attract more visitors from those areas if we are to maintain our earnings in terms of the currencies of those countries at the level which obtained prior to devaluation.  Bord Fáilte have calculated that before our tourist revenue begins to benefit from devaluation, it will be necessary to attract about nine per cent more visitors from North America and continental Europe than we would have had to do without devaluation.  There is the possibility of course, that the more favourable rate of exchange which is now available here will induce visitors from non-devalued countries to spend more here than they would otherwise have done.  It would be unrealistic however, to place undue reliance on this possibility and it is clear that the only certain way of increasing foreign currency revenue is to attract more visitors.</P>
    <P>I think it is important that we should not exaggerate the benefits which devaluation will confer on tourist earnings or assume that we can obtain these benefits without effort on our part. While it is true that the better exchange rates will result in lower prices in this country for visitors from North America, France and Germany it should be remembered that transport costs to this country have not been reduced by devaluation; in fact in some cases these costs have gone up.  Fares <Col N="552" /> for travel constitute a large part of the cost of a holiday and in the case of United States visitors to Europe amount to about one-third of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Most American tourists include a number of European countries in their itineraries and since prices in such countries as France and Germany have not been affected by devaluation, the response from United States visitors may not be as positive as the fall in the cost of holidays in Ireland would lead one to expect.  However, devaluation does provide an opportunity to persuade more North American visitors to Europe to include Ireland in their itineraries.</P>
    <P>The fact that France and West Germany are among the countries which have not devalued their currencies, coupled with the introduction of the new car ferry service between Le Harve and Rosslare next May, should provide a favourable opportunity to increase traffic from these areas.  The Supplementary Estimate, accordingly, makes provision for additional expenditure on promotional activities on the Continent, mainly in France and West Germany.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that devaluation will also result in increased tourist traffic from Britain to this country.  The higher cost of holidays in most European countries for visitors from Britain together with the restriction on currency allowance for expenditure in non-sterling areas should help to influence British tourists who would otherwise have gone to Europe to visit Ireland instead.  It is proposed to exploit this favourable situation as much as possible and the Supplementary Estimate includes a provision for additional expenditure on advertising and promotional activities in Britain.</P>
    <P>Our prospects for increased tourist traffic from the United States must, of course, be viewed in the context of the proposals now under consideration in that country for the imposition of new taxes and restrictions designed to reduce expenditure abroad by American residents.  As I have already informed the Dáil, we have made representations to the US authorities about the detrimental effects of these measures on our <Col N="553" /> tourist industry.  Bord Fáilte are convinced that there is a need for a carefully planned and judicious programme in the United States to present a constructive and positive message to the travelling public, travel agents and other members of the industry, and which would place a particular emphasis on student travel and other categories which are likely to be excluded from the restrictions.</P>
    <P>Because of the present fluid situation about the American proposals, Bord Fáilte are proposing to embark on a publicity and promotional campaign which will permit the change or modification of their approach in the light of what may be the final outcome of the legislative proposals.  In the implementation of the campaign the Board are aiming at the fullest possible co-operation with other interested organisations such as Aer Lingus, the British Travel Association and the European Travel Commission.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amount of £258,000 which I am proposing to provide for marketing activities abroad, the Supplementary Estimate also includes an amount of £50,000 for issue to Bord Fáilte for the purpose of easing the financial difficulties of the regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware of the activities in their areas of the regional tourism organisations.  I am glad to say that these organisations, which are representative of the local authorities as well as tourism and general business interests, have gone about their task in a most vigorous way.  In their few years of existence they have established a network of 100 tourist information offices providing a standard national service of information and general customer facilitation as well as a special room reservation service free to all visitors.  In 1967, these offices serviced 1½ million inquiries and made reservations totalling 343,000 bed-nights.</P>
    <P>The room reservation service is especially significant as it justifies our claim that it is easy for a tourist to be mobile in Ireland.  The service has earned numerous commendations from motoring tourists and it is the most important means of marketing the <Col N="554" /> supplementary accommodation being developed under the farmhouse and the special development area holiday accommodation schemes.  In addition, the regional organisations have undertaken a wide variety of tasks including the expansion of supplementary accommodation and the provision of information literature.  In 1967 they produced 88 items of literature comprising 3.75 million pieces.</P>
    <P>The finances of the regional organisations to date have come mainly from the local authorities and Bord Fáilte. Local authorities' contributions amount to £62,000 in the current year.  Bord Fáilte undertook to provide an amount of not less than £143,000.  Notwithstanding these provisions, it has been clear that the programme of activity being pursued by the regional organisations requires a much greater income. The organisations have accordingly instituted a programme for securing finances through membership in the private sector, mainly from the business community and it is expected that income from this source will amount to a sum of the order of £60,000/ £70,000 in the coming year.  In the meantime it is essential to supplement support for the organisations in the current financial year to the extent of £50,000.  This contribution will not be sufficient to relieve the regional organisations of all their commitments, a substantial part of which represents capital expenditure incurred in the provision of information and company offices which was financed from income and overdraft in anticipation of a rise in financial support from local authorities and the business community.  I have no doubt that Deputies who are aware of the valuable services being provided by the regional organisations in the interest of the tourist industry will agree that these bodies are worthy of adequate support for their activities.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the greater part of the money to meet this Supplementary Estimate has been found from a saving on the provision for resort development.  I wish to make it clear that this does not indicate any change of policy in the Bord Fáilte scheme for the development of major tourist resorts.  The amount provided in the <Col N="555" /> original Estimate for this purpose in the present year was £500,000 but it is now clear that actual expenditure will not exceed £250,000.  As Deputies are aware, the scheme is carried out by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the local authorities and other local interests and it is a condition of the scheme that there should be a substantial local contribution towards the works.  In the current year, local authorities found difficulty in contributing their share of the costs because of other commitments. The Board have been conducting detailed negotiations with the local authorities concerned and it is expected that progress in the coming year will show an increase in this important work.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the general purpose of the supplementary estimate is to re-allocate available funds with a view to ensuring the most effective use of these moneys in the light of current circumstances.  In view of the importance of the tourist industry to the national economy, I strongly recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate instances quite clearly just how valuable Parliament is as a check on the activities of Ministers and of Government Departments.  If it were not for the fact that the Minister had the need to come back here and seek a Supplementary Estimate of £10 because of the change of policy and because of the change of expenditure, we would never have an opportunity of expressing ourselves publicly on it. In fact many of us, speaking as an ordinary citizen, would not know anything about it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the first thing I want to refer to is the question of the reduction in expenditure on resorts.  In so addressing myself, I would like to say first that of course this Supplementary Estimate is, like the curate's egg, good and bad in spots.  One of the spots where it is bad is in the fact that the Minister has had to come and tell Parliament:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that the greater part of the money to meet this Supplementary Estimate has been <Col N="556" /> found from a saving on the provision for resort development.  I wish to make it clear that this does not indicate any change of policy in the Bord Fáilte scheme for the development of major tourist resorts.</P>
    <P>The savings on Subheads E and F amount to a figure of £307,990; the saving on resort development amounts to approximately £250,000.  One of the ways in which one could hope that private enterprise would build its hotels, would expend its own money for profit and therefore pay its rates and pay its taxes and increase the slice of the national cake which would be available for all is by the development of their resorts.</P>
    <P>I speak now as Chairman of Louth County Council as well as a Member of this House.  My experience has been that the development of the small tourist resorts we have in Louth, and they are small, being principally Carlingford, Omeath and Blackrock, has resulted always in the building of more hotels, more guest houses, the improvement of existing hotels and in one case&mdash;I refer to Blackrock&mdash;the stopping of the situation whereby the resort as such would have died in the past five years if we had not put a swimming pool there.  These are things that it is necessary to expend money on because they result in expenditure by the private interest concerned.</P>
    <P>If we are doing the right thing, as we are, in providing car ferries through another section of the Government's responsibility and if we are at the same time expending large sums on the encouragement of tourists from North America and Europe, then we must have somewhere for them to go.  It is putting the cart before the horse not to have provided this money for resorts. I know that the Minister will say to me that the framework is there, that the local authorities did not co-operate, that this was wrong and that that was wrong.  He must remember that local authorities are pressed by a rapidly increasing rate burden and that these local authorities are placed in the situation where new developments have, willy-nilly, to be postponed from year to year.  Yet I can say that in my constituency, which is not a major <Col N="557" /> tourist area, there are two places certainly where major expenditure is absolutely impossible.  One of them is Omeath where there is necessity for a car-park costing £3,000.</P>
    <P>When I came&mdash;and I want to make no bones about this&mdash;to fix the rate with my Fine Gael majority before we went to the meeting, just the same as the Minister for Finance sits with the Cabinet to fix a Budget before he comes down here, we looked at the question of the provision of a car-park at £3,000 for the village of Omeath and we looked at a further proposal from a councillor who is the Director of the North Eastern Regional Tourist Organisation to which the Minister referred&mdash;Councillor Tommy Elmore, Fine Gael &mdash; that there should be a removal of sides on the road and the widening of those sides to provide car parking for a few hundred cars.  We could not face up to the £3,000 but we have spent £550 with the declared intention of spending a further £550 next year.  As far as I know, we are getting no subvention in respect of this and this is a breakdown in communication, a breakdown in the arrangement through which Bord Fáilte disburses its money for the improvement of seaside resorts, and it is something quite wrong.</P>
    <P>If there was available to us on that evening a fair share of the £3,000 for that car park and if the machinery was there to do it, we would have done it. We would have taken our grant from Bord Fáilte and produced a very valuable contribution towards tourist trade in that particular area.  That is one example of a breakdown in negotiations. There is a need for that car park. At Blackrock five or six years ago we provided a swimming pool at a cost of £48,000.  We got a grant of 50 per cent.  As a result Blackrock has moved up.  However, we have not got to the stage on Louth County Council at which we are in a position to say: &ldquo;A car park will cost £X thousand: Bord Fáilte will provide £Y thousand.  Therefore falling on the rates shall be £X thousand minus £Y thousand.</P>
    <P>We are not in a position to make our decision in this matter.  I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to <Col N="558" /> say: &ldquo;Well, your officials have not done their job.  You have not set up the framework and the machinery whereby this should happen.&rdquo;  That is not sufficient because the whole idea of the regional tourist organisations is that this correlation should exist.  Our experience over the last few years is that there has been a complete stop on the kind of amenity grants which were available from Bord Fáilte for small tourist resorts and small areas.  The only grant which I can point to in my own constituency was for the provision of certain tennis courts in the small seaside resort of Carlingford.  I think there is nobody who gets to that resort more often than I do in the summer time.</P>
    <P>Carlingford has benefited greatly by the amenity grant that provided those tennis courts.  It is quite amazing the number of people who come with their children at the week-ends to Carlingford. The grown-ups probably go to the bar and young children play tennis. The same thing can be said with regard to the swimming pool I mentioned earlier.  I have been to the swimming pool and I have seen carloads of people coming there from County Meath.  The nearest point in County Meath would be 20 miles away.  Those people bring their children so that they can receive swimming instruction. Therefore, the question of not spending £250,000 because of the credit squeeze is a slow up.  It is very bad policy in a year in which, I submit, very soon we shall be told that there is surplus revenue in this year's account.  When the Minister for Finance produces his Budget there will be a surplus on revenue account.  It is a dreadful thing that while we are providing means to bring tourists here we are still not doing our job for those small resorts. There is no doubt that those small resorts benefit from the sort of amenity grant to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is quite ambiguous, to say the least of it, and to put it as kindly as possible, for the Minister to say:</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that this does not indicate any change of policy in the Bord Fáilte scheme for the development of major tourist resorts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> That referred to the saving on the particular subhead in relation to the provision of amenities at resorts.  One of the good things about tourism over recent years is the emphasis on farm guesthouses, as mentioned by the Minister, and small guesthouses of all kinds.  Those places need this very badly and this is one of the areas in which regional tourist organisations can do very good work.  They can tell people where those places are.  They can describe them, indicate the sort of accommodation offered, the cost and any other information required.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of development which has pleased everybody.  There is no doubt that if you want the most comfortable place to sleep and the best breakfast, the Irish housewife is probably the best person to give it. People will be as comfortable in the farm guesthouses mentioned by the Minister as they would be in any large establishment from the Intercontinental down.  This is the kind of development I want to laud.  I hope it will progress much further in the future.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Minister's speech there was no mention of the great tourist potential from Britain.  It seems to me that because of the expense involved in continental holidays at the moment&mdash;the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I who have been at the Council of Europe know how often we put our hands in our pockets&mdash;we can attract a very much larger number of visitors from Britain than we have ever attracted before.</P>
    <P>The provision of the car ferry is, of course, the key to this whole matter because if two married couples share the cost of the car it is the cheapest holiday you can get.  The same thing can be said about Irish people who go to England or the Continent.  I remember going with Deputy John O'Donovan, his wife, and my wife to Larne, crossing over to Stranraer, driving up to John O'Groats and it was probably as cheap a holiday as we ever had. Therefore, I say the movement will be both ways.</P>
    <P>We have done a good job in providing <Col N="560" /> this service.  We have been really ambitious in creating the Le Havre-Rosslare ferry.  People do not realise how near we are to France.  If I remember rightly, it is about 280 miles from Rosslare to Le Havre and steaming at about 10 knots an hour you would spend one day and one night on the ferry.  Perhaps, I may be wrong; it may be a little longer.  However, one arrives on the Continent, or alternatively Continental people arrive here, after a journey on this ferry.  This is something which should balance out in our favour, although I do not go the whole way with the Minister in what he said, because of the expense of holidays on the Continent in relation to holidays here.</P>
    <P>Even on the Continent you can go to certain hotels in large cities such as Paris where you will find that the cost is prohibitive.  At the same time, if you go to some of the small places you will discover that they are not prohibitive and you will find the change of food, the change of climate and the change of habit very pleasant.  It is probably no dearer, and perhaps cheaper, than at home.  Therefore, the car ferry can be of advantage both ways.</P>
    <P>I am a bit unhappy that touristwise we have not got the advantage of Italy or Spain because in those countries if you stay in small places, eat the food and, perhaps, drink the wine, if you are so inclined, you will find that you can have a very inexpensive holiday.  You could also spend as much money, if you stay in the larger hotels, as you would if you stayed in the Intercontinental Hotel in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The good point about the ferry to Le Havre is that people who have a fortnight's holidays to spend on a fixed amount of money probably will not go as far as Italy or Spain.  They will probably spend their holidays in Brittany, Normandy, or some other place in the North of France.  They may, perhaps, venture further afield to Germany or Switzerland but it is unlikely that they will take a trip down south.</P>
    <P>While the regional tourist organisation have done an extremely good job in co-operation with the farm guesthouses, the Minister must accept criticism <Col N="561" /> because of the saving on resort development, because of the crying need for this expenditure and because of the state of revenue, and, indeed, the state of capital funds in this country at the moment as far as Government resources are concerned. When the Minister is replying, instead of defending himself, he should resolve to do better next year and see to it that if there is a breakdown in negotiations and in profitable contact between the tourist organisations, the local authorities, Bord Fáilte and his Department, this breakdown in contact should be mended, and it should become more easy to do these things that are so necessary for the resorts.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister's line has also been to spend money on major resorts. I do not think this is wise either.  I know there are major schemes that must definitely be approached, started and completed, but, at the same time, the small seaside resorts and hotels of our country are something that can be developed.  In relation to the small hotel, reasonable prices and excellent food are things that people can dream about and come back to for years and years to come.  I remember going into an hotel in Ballycotton where two ladies who had returned from abroad had begun business.  The painters had not gone out and I was awakened in the morning by the sound of a large load of blocks arriving, but I have never been more comfortable or so well fed so cheaply.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see recently that the Bord Fáilte emphasis was on the price of food.  This is a change for the better. There was too much accent on big development seven or eight years ago. Nobody now, even the very rich, has the sort of money that allows them to spend £6, £7, £8 or £9 for bed and breakfast.  That is something that is quite obvious, because of the facilities, taxes and so on.  Even those who have money do not want to pay for this type of service because they can get something more homely, more comfortable and less pretentious to which they would be happy to return again. Therefore, I am disappointed that the saving announced by the Minister is <Col N="562" /> there.  I am glad there are expenses over and above that voted on other heads and I would be glad if the Minister would accept my criticism in relation to the saving.</P>

      <P>In so far as development of tourism and expenditure of public funds towards that end is concerned, it is essential that the money voted by this House, year in year out is utilised to the best advantage. This Supplementary Estimate raises the old matter I have heard raised here again and again and which I intend repeating, that is, the desirability of some information on the expenditure of this money being available to this House.  We have discussed the role of State-sponsored bodies on various occasions and I have maintained, Sir, that in dealing with this Supplementary Estimate and in dealing with the general Estimates for State-sponsored bodies, the only information available to the Members of this House are the broad headlines: that we propose to give a grant-in-aid <Col N="563" /> of £2,250,000 under section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, that we propose to expend in 1967-68 £500,000 on resort development and that we propose to expend £700,000 on the development of holiday accommodation. Then you have in the leaflet submitted with this Estimate an indication that there is an additional sum under the Tourist Traffic Act.</P>
      <P>We have a statement from the Minister which does not give any detailed information.  I am a firm believer in the Members of this House, the elected representatives of the people, being fully conversant with the details of the expenditure of Bord Fáilte or any other public body.  We cannot pass judgment, because of the lack of information, on whether we are getting value for this money or not.  I am quite in order, I am sure, Sir, in maintaining that we should have a sub-committee of this House, something akin to the Committee of Public Accounts, in so far as these State-sponsored bodies are concerned, where more detailed information could be made available to the Committee.</P>
      <P>I do not think there would be any breach of confidence in doing that.  I have in mind getting information on a reasonably comprehensive basis.  I have in mind that the disbursement of the money referred to in the Minister's statement here and the grant-in-aid for development of holiday accommodation should be disclosed.  The Minister may say that would be most undesirable, that it would be a breach of confidence in relation to applications for such loans, but I think that where substantial grants are given from public funds, the representatives of the people, that is, the Members of this House, are entitled to know about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that I have expressed a general opinion, which I thought appropriate as a preamble to observations on the Supplementary Estimate, I am agreeable. We have been told that £52,000 of the £308,000 needed is required to compensate for commitments in America and the continent of Europe. We should like to know, therefore, some more about the results of our missions in North America particularly&mdash;how many additional tourists from the US and Canada have visited this country as a result of our expenditure.  People who possibly have not got the knowledge have made certain assertions and the Minister, his Department and officials of Bord Fáilte might let us know, for instance, if a sizeable percentage of those visitors are of Irish extraction, of Irish origin or descent.  We should like to know if they would be coming along in any case to visit the motherland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a question which is difficult to answer, but it is no harm to put it because, possibly with the information available to him, the Minister might <Col N="565" /> be able to enlighten the people throughout the country who are in doubt.  I agree we should do everything possible to attract as many visitors from the US as we can.  We have close ties with the US; we have many friends and relatives there who have, I am sure, an interest in this country. Possibly, due to their ties with this country, they would give us preference during their holidays if they thought reasonable value would be forthcoming from visits here.  It is accepted that they are getting reasonable value. Devaluation will help this year and our accommodation is improving.  If the Minister believes such results will flow from this expenditure, I agree with it.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful, however, if in recent times we have been too favourably disposed to that country and I do not think that will help our drive to expand tourism.  I regret that American representatives when they visited Cork city&mdash;certainly the American Ambassador's representative who visited the city recently&mdash;did not get the reception they should have got.  I do not think that type of action on the part of any of our people will help tourism in so far as the US is concerned.  There are few countries with which we have such close association.  We get money back from friends and relatives in our difficult periods.  There are so many people of Irish descent in the US that we should be favourably disposed to their representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to a reduction of £250,000 which is referred to in the Minister's statement.  It is peculiar that there should be such a reduction, that it is not possible to utilise the money on major resort development. It would not confront Bord Fáilte with any great difficulty to transfer the money to other activities running short of funds.  In the part of the country I have the honour to represent, the south-west Cork coast in particular, we expected much more from Bord Fáilte than we have got. Maybe our expectations were set too high; maybe we expected more than our just slice of the loaf that was being divided.  In that area, the local authority and the voluntary organisations <Col N="566" /> have been endeavouring to develop tourism.  They are anxious to get as much help as possible from the Minister's Department and Bord Fáilte.  We had a visit from a Bord Fáilte representative recently.  He attended one of our meetings and we hope to have him soon again.  We hope that as a result we will be getting a slice of the money being provided in this Supplementary Estimate for what could be termed minor development in particular.</P>
    <P>Major development is necessary in large tourist centres, but on the Cork coast there are several small villages with big tourist potential.  On a number of occasions we were pleased to welcome the Minister to that part of the country.  He is particularly conversant with the Berehaven Peninsula which he has kindly commended to the public as a place worth visiting.  We are thankful to him for having given the district favourable publicity and we are satisfied that he will be helpful in having provided the grants necessary for development there.</P>
    <P>I will not take up more time on this Supplementary Estimate by going over the many demands being made on Bord Fáilte for funds for various essential works in so far as tourism is concerned. Let us hope that Bord Fáilte representatives will be down with us next month and will give us information on the grants that are likely to be available. I am reasonably conversant with the position in the Allihies region: I know they have to be attended to also.  I think my part of the country is quite pleased and will be satisfied if they get their fair share.  They are not looking for anything more than what is justly due to them.</P>
    <P>The farm guesthouse scheme has been a magnificent success.  Farmers down my way, who did the minimum of advertising, had guests from Germany, France, Britain and America. From discussions I have had with the proprietors of these farm guesthouses, I gather that the visitors were very pleased.  Some of the guesthouses were eight, nine, ten or 11 miles from the sea&mdash;inland places.  I am quite satisfied that what such visitors require is a nice clean house&mdash;cleanliness is the first item&mdash;and good food, which is to be <Col N="567" /> had in farmhouses, food of possibly a higher standard than would be available in hotels, which is only natural, seeing that the farmers have fresh vegetables, and so on.  I understand that the limited number of farm guesthouses which are available, and which are up to a reasonable standard, are booked out again for this year and that the proprietors have no problem other than the problem of sufficient space to meet bookings.</P>
    <P>The scheme has now gone beyond the experimental stage so far as West Cork is concerned and possibly the same applies to other districts.  I should like the Minister, in any discussions with Bord Fáilte, to try to develop that scheme as much as possible.  It has great potential in the 12 western counties.  The Cork development team is very anxious about this scheme.  I was a member of that team for two years.  We discussed the great potential of this scheme and I know the discussions are continuing.</P>
    <P>I do not want a reduction in standards but I should like a reduction in the number, where required, of additional rooms under the farm guesthouse scheme.  It could be a difficult matter for some people, perhaps, because of the layout of their house. Take a house with five rooms, as an example: there could be difficulty in adding, say, five rooms to such a house.  If applications were accepted even for an additional two rooms, it would be a great help.  Of course, applications would be scrutinised by an inspector from the board to see what kind of people were making application.  That would be a factor in determining the availability of grants if this regulation is made.  Furthermore, it would be necessary to make sure that the house is clean and well looked after.  Is the present accommodation up to Bord Fáilte standard?  Is the house well located?  If it passes that examination, if the inspector or supervisor reports that the family seems to be one that could cater for visitors, that their present housing is up to the standard one would expect for visitors and that the premises could be included in Bord Fáilte's list, I <Col N="568" /> believe that such a family should get help for the building of two or three additional rooms.</P>
    <P>In that way, the scheme could expand and more farmers and more rural dwellers would be likely to avail of this source of additional income. Everybody now appreciates the problem of the small farmers and the rural dwellers.  They deplore emigration. Here is a hope for farmers in areas where land is poor, where productivity is low and where the potential is not very promising of developing a sideline which will help to supplement their incomes from arable pursuits.  I recommend that as strongly as possible to the Minister.  I do so as a result of reports I have received from a number of people who at present are catering for such visitors in their farmhouses.</P>
    <P>I shall not take up the time of the House now with the subject of the regional organisations.  I am reasonably conversant with the Cork-Kerry one.  I am sure they are doing the best they possibly can in endeavouring to expand tourism.  The members of the regional boards are all men of the highest integrity and most of them are well qualified to deal with tourist development.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is in order to mention hotel service as the matter is not mentioned in the Minister's opening speech on the Supplementary Estimate.  We have hotels as fine as any in the world.  However, sometimes one hears complaints.  Seeing that we expend roughly £3½ million under this particular heading, we should ensure that people who get grants, and so on, provide a service of which we can be proud.  Bookings are plentiful in the months of July and August and, when there is no trouble in getting guests, some hotel-keepers are not as courteous as they might be: the same remarks apply to some of the staff also. I do not like to refer to the bleak side or to the black side but it is important that these factors be taken into account.  We should try to ensure that our visitors will receive courteous and reasonable attention and will return home as advertisers for tourism in <Col N="569" /> Ireland.  Such satisfied visitors could do better work, possibly, than our office in their country from the point of view of attracting more visitors.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Donegan's suggestion that the erection, if necessary, of additional hotels with State aid is desirable, particularly if we can contain the prices.  I believe that when we ask for more than £2 per night for bed and breakfast, we are going outside the pockets of many people.  We should keep the cost of bed and breakfast as near as possible to the 30/- mark.</P>
    <P>I realise that these are items more appropriate to the main Estimate and, therefore, I will conclude by voicing the support of the Labour Party for the token Supplementary Estimate, in the hope that when the time for the general review comes at a later stage, the Minister will have something to say about the point I have raised here again and again, that is, the desirability of giving more detailed information to the Members of this House as to the activities of Bord Fáilte because, as I have said, it is very difficult, on the kind of information made available to Deputies, to assess the value or worth of Bord Fáilte.  The information is too limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of the additional sum of £308,000 for the items specified by the Minister is fully justified.  We realise, of course, that savings of £307,990 on other subheads of the Vote will be set off against it.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be said about the provision of £206,000 to exploit the opportunity presented by devaluation to attract more visitors, in my view, the time has come when as much as possible of our resources must be put into marketing.  We can no longer depend on tourists coming to spend holidays here just because they have read stories about leprechauns and other fairy tales of Ireland.  We must go out and sell our country abroad.  We must inform potential tourists of the type of holiday available here.  We must spend money in publicising the accommodation available, the climate, the tranquillity, the good roads, the beautiful scenery and all the other tourist attractions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the <Col N="570" /> sum of £52,000 is necessary to compensate for the effects of devaluation on the cost of the Board's committed marketing budgets in North America and the continent of Europe.  This expenditure is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the provision of the sum of £75,000 to supplement the funds of the regional tourism organisations.  It has been obvious to me for some time past that these organisations, having such worthy aims and objects, have been in serious difficulties because of lack of financial assistance.  The local contributions amount to only £62,000 per annum. Bord Fáilte undertook to provide not less than £143,000.  Having regard to the useful work which these organisations are doing, they should not be deprived of the necessary provision, even capital provision, for adequate office accommodation and for printing, publishing and other expenses.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have criticised Bord Fáilte for not spending a sum of approximately £300,000 in respect of the development of major tourist resorts. I know from my experience as an official of a local authority how difficult it is to get many of these projects off the ground.  For instance, difficulty is experienced in the acquisition of land and rights of way, in making adequate provision for maintenance and for water and sewerage schemes to serve the resorts.  The fact that local authorities in particular and local development associations will now know that a certain amount of money made available this year for these purposes was not expended will make them more active and they will ensure that schemes are properly documented, prepared and presented for the information of Bord Fáilte so that grants can be allocated early in the financial year.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Donegan who stated that very few amenity grants were being paid.  In this respect the experience of Kerry has been fair enough.  Again, I think that too many organisations and individuals have been waiting for the State to do something for them.  Too many development associations have been waiting for Bord Fáilte to pay out money and to tell them how to develop their <Col N="571" /> areas.  Personally, I think development associations should prepare schemes and submit applications for amenity grants well in advance of the close of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I should like Bord Fáilte to direct more money towards the repair and improvement of quiet by-roads leading to little piers and harbours in scenic rural areas.  Money could be spent on the provision of small car parks in these areas.  Within the next few years, our main roads and even county roads, particularly in the principal tourist areas, will become choked with traffic, and if we are to maintain the attractiveness of our country to tourists the small piers, harbours and quiet coves should be developed, access roads improved and car parks provided.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the provision of a telephone service in one particular tourist area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I rise to say a few words on this Estimate not because I disagree with the general policy of Bord Fáilte but because it has seemed to me for a long time that Bord Fáilte have lost sight of a particular facet of the tourist industry.  They have spent a great deal of money in helping to provide accommodation, and the Minister and Bord Fáilte always stress the necessity for providing accommodation, but accommodation, as we understand it, means more rooms, more <Col N="572" /> hotels and more guesthouses.  It is pitiful to see the facet upon which I have remarked being neglected, that is, in regard to the middle income tourist, or the lesser income tourist.  He is not provided for to the extent he should be and he would bring money into the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that money is provided by Bord Fáilte for the provision of accommodation for that type of tourist but that is not so.  The same facilities are not given for this type of tourist as are provided for the millionaire tourist.  All you need do if you are an American millionaire with the name McNamara or Finucane, or something like that, is buy a castle and immediately you will get a grant from Bord Fáilte.  However, let us take an employee of a hotel, a chef, a porter, or anybody like that who has been saving up for four or five years in order to set up business for the small income tourist.  There is a grant of £5,000 given for five years free of interest, but if he saves £6,000 or £7,000 and buys a house, then he has no money to continue and he cannot get that loan of £5,000 because he is not registered as a guesthouse or as an hotel.  He has not got the money to do that.</P>
      <P>Therefore you are catering for the millionaire who can come here and buy a castle and you are forgetting the chef or the porter or anyone of that kind who desires to contribute his quota to the accommodation which is necessary. If the employee of the tourist industry did get the £5,000 free of interest for five years, he would have paid it back in that time and interest would not be accruing.  I would ask the Minister to get Bord Fáilte to consider that point. It has been staring Bord Fáilte in the face for the past ten or twenty years. Practically nothing has been done for the person who is endeavouring to cater for the middle income class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister says that £52,000 is required to compensate for the effects of devaluation and that it is proposed to intensify marketing activities in North America and on the continent of Europe.  This is something which has <Col N="573" /> been referred to again and again in this House &mdash; the expenditure on tourism in North America.  I feel, as do others, that a great mistake is being made and that we are over-rating the value of American tourists to this country.  Many tourists do come from America because they have Irish connections and most of them would come, whether or not a shilling was spent on promotional activities.  Many more of them who come, come on package deals and spend the smallest amount of money they possibly can in this country.  In addition, we have been spending far too much money on the luxury type of accommodation which these people demand, whether or not they are used to it on the other side. We should be concentrating on a different type of tourist.</P>
      <P>However, apparently the amount has been committed and as it is about the end of this financial year that we are talking, it must be spent before the end of March.  I suppose the money has already gone so that there is no point in talking about effecting a saving.  I have expressed a view on more than one occasion that we seem to have, particularly from this Government, a crop of Supplementary Estimates for large amounts of money being presented just before the end of the financial year.  This is an exception. In this case there is only a token sum of £10 required.  Perhaps it is an extraordinary coincidence, or maybe it is more than a coincidence, but the money which is being spent saves the taxpayers; the finding of this money is saved on the resort development grants.  For 1967-68 the amount provided was £500,000 and the amount spent in the previous year was £260,000. There was an increase of £240,000.  It is extraordinary that the saving is £250,000.  We are spending almost exactly the same amount as we appear to have spent last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point about this is that if there were a better system whereby money could be spent, not entirely on the larger resorts&mdash;and this again is something on which the Minister and I have crossed swords previously&mdash;there would be more than a possibility of having a considerable amount of this <Col N="574" /> money spent during the year.  There is no point in putting a sum of money in the Book of Estimates and saying that we are giving this amount under a particular heading and then, when the year is over, finding that it has not been spent and that later on it is put back under another heading.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the smaller resorts in Louth, and in the adjoining county, in Meath, we also have small resorts.  We find that it is not easy to get money.  I was interested in Deputy O'Leary's comment about what local development associations should do.  I am chairman of a development association and we are doing everything possible to raise money to try to improve the resorts.  We cannot raise money on the required scale and therefore we must depend on grants and on rates.  The county council have spent as much as we could possibly expect them to spend in the area and Bord Fáilte have occasionally given us a few hundred pounds&mdash;as much as £690 on one occasion.  Is it any wonder that we are angry with Bord Fáilte when we get £690 and a large over-developed area which has got almost everything gets £30,000 or £40,000 free grant?  We believe that we could develop the area: we have the scenery, the sea and everything else except the money, but Bord Fáilte give us the pennies while other areas already more than provided for receive substantial amounts of money.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had more ability to spread around the money he has, he could have spent it well with very good results during the year.  Instead of that, it is tied down because it is listed under a specific heading; and, because local authorities were not able to find the money to back the big money he was giving for the big resorts, this amount comes back again into the kitty.  I am not blaming the Minister: I am blaming the system. The system is wrong.  There may be some way by which this money could be more evenly spread.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters in the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer.  While he has set out as well as can be expected the headings under which the money is to <Col N="575" /> be found and spent, he might, I think, have given us a little more information. I am a director of a regional tourism organisation and, like every other tourist organisation, we are short of money.  A few years ago, some misguided individual sold to the tourist organisations an idea that there was such a thing as picking up substantial sums of money under what was termed &ldquo;Planned Giving&rdquo;.  The result was that a non-national organisation was hired by practically all the regional tourism organisations which went around and asked business people, hoteliers, publicans and others for money to help tourism.  Since this was helping out these people themselves, there was no reason, I suppose, why they should not be asked to give something.  But I think the whole thing was a mistake.</P>
    <P>To give people the idea that the only way in which you can raise money for tourism is by going and asking those to give now and give again, while a great many people who would possibly be in a much better position to give give nothing&mdash;if they do not want to give it cannot be got from them&mdash;are allowed off scot-free is a bad thing.  It is a mistake.  The whole business, in my opinion, lowered the tone.  Eventually the organisation was dispensed with and I believe it is now attempting on a limited scale to raise this money. I think Bord Fáilte were trying their hand at it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates what I am saying.  Again, I am not blaming those who believe money must be got if we are to develop tourism, but I am blaming the people who recommended that the organisation I have referred to should be allowed to do this.  I am sure the Minister is aware that very substantial sums were collected by these people from the tourism organisations, not from the people who were supposed to give the money, and the result was, to put it bluntly, they were a dead loss.  That net loss to the whole tourist organisation as a result of the activities of these people was very high.  Fortunately, some saner mind eventually decided that this had to be stopped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> Two things have gone wrong.  First, the idea was not a good one at the start but, having been started, it is really too bad that the tourism organisations have now put themselves in the position that they have to send someone around to mend a situation which was very badly handled.  A great many people are pretty sceptical about the whole thing and are not too inclined now to dig into their pockets to find money for this purpose.  An effort should be made to raise money which can be given to the regional tourism organisations.  It is unfair that they should be asked to do a job and then not given the wherewithal to pay for what they are doing.  People like myself act on the committee.  We do not claim expenses of any kind.  We often travel pretty long journeys at personal inconvenience to ensure the business of the organisation is carried out properly.  We might as well face up to the situation: if we are really serious in asking the regional tourist organisations to do their job properly, then this House and Bord Fáilte must be responsible for seeing they have the money to do it.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a big money-spinner.  It has raised a colossal amount of money over the past few years.  I do not agree with the system by which the money spent is assessed.  Giving people a sample card to mark is not a good method.  The results could not be expected to be accurate.  At the same time, there is a great deal of money spent and I believe the encouragement those interested in tourism are getting is not anything like sufficient.  Our development association have gone to a great deal of trouble and not a little expense in getting out brochures to assist tourists.  That sort of thing should be encouraged.  When we find that the amount of money available is not sufficient and the tourist organisations find themselves in the red&mdash;they should not be in the red&mdash;it is a little disheartening.  They do not spend money lavishly.  They count every penny.  That is only as it should be. They should be treated better and I appeal to the Minister now to make an effort when next year's Budget is being prepared to ensure that adequate <Col N="577" /> money is available to the regional tourism organisations to enable them to carry out their job and save them from having to go hat in hand to ask for the money which is going to be spent in the area.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the people who will benefit are the people who should help, but, while there are generous people and people who appreciate that one must pay for everything one gets, at the same time, there are a great many people who want to get everything they possibly can without paying.  The present system is not a fair one.  Perhaps the perfect system is impossible to find.  I am sure the Minister&mdash;he has a deep interest in tourism, I know, and knows a great deal more about it than most people&mdash; knows that what I am saying is correct and I trust he will try to remedy the defects when the Budget is being prepared.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am sorry that the £250,000 was not made available to the minor resorts.  Had it been made available, a tremendous amount of work could have been done during the year.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their constructive and helpful criticism. The first point I should like to emphasise is a point raised by Deputy Hogan from Co. Clare.  We have been developing, or helping to develop, accommodation in the medium price and lower price range and I must make it quite clear to the House that the idea that a millionaire gets a grant automatically simply is not true.  There is no preference for any particular level or category of accommodation.  Grants and loans are available for all grades. These are the facts.  The B, C and D grades of hotels and guesthouses and supplementary accommodation increased from 16,690 in 1963 to 24,392 in 1967, or approximately 46 per cent.</P>

      <P>All I am saying is that we have been able to secure a lot of this moderate priced accommodation. I think I made it clear in the general Estimate last year that I am still worried about the development of a certain grade of hotel.  I am glad the Deputies have approved of the farmhouse grants and I hope this grade of accommodation will continue to expand in the future.  However, there is a definite lack of 35/- to 45/-accommodation in hotels of about 100 bedrooms for package tour holidays. We are making a tremendous effort to see what we can do about that particular grades whose development seems to be lacking at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are perfectly right to ask for some proof at regular intervals that Bord Fáilte expenditure is justified.  I dealt with it before and I will deal with it very briefly.  One can judge the effect of this Bord Fáilte expenditure by the number of inquiries that they receive at the numerous offices they have in Great Britain, in Europe and in America.  One can judge their effectiveness by the replies to couponed advertisements in the newspapers. There are independent marketing organisations who have been asked by Bord Fáilte, without disclosing from whom they come, about the effectiveness of all national tourist offices, and they have approached, in the case of Great Britain, some thousand travel agents.  I am satisfied myself that this organisation is an extremely tough one and if it wants to <Col N="579" /> give an unpleasant report do just that, and Bord Fáilte tourist offices were at the top of the list among 927 travel agents whom they asked: which do you think is the most effective national tourist office in Great Britain.  Then in relation to specialised campaigns where you had to see the actual results to know whether or not the Bord Fáilte promotion was successful, there was the angling campaign which was more than successful, and some others which were also worthwhile.  We can also judge Bord Fáilte by the number of travel agents in each country who set up package tours which are directly derived from and originated in the assistance given by Bord Fáilte to enable them to develop a package tour. I am satisfied, therefore, that the expenditure by Bord Fáilte is effective and that it is justifiable as far as this House is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to a number of resort works.  Unfortunately, under the rules of this House, it is not possible to transfer a grant-in-aid from a subhead to minor resort expenditure.  The major resort development expenditure was not reached for reasons I have already indicated. Deputies will be interested to hear that because, as I indicated when the last Tourist Traffic Bill was passing through the House, the major resort scheme as such and in its present form is ending, and because tourists are becoming more mobile and spreading over the country Bórd Fáilte is now developing, under the heading major resort development, a general plan for infra-structure development and preparing new schemes that will not be concentrated only in specific resorts, and the failure to spend money under the heading in question would mean the money would be related to what was being spent in certain classified areas, in areas such as West Cork, Killarney, Galway and a number of other centres.  In some cases a whole county was included and in other cases simply a particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the Minister could not transfer expenditure, he could come in here for a Supplementary <Col N="580" /> Estimate, as he has done tonight? He came in here for a token sum of £10, having over-expended £308,000 on one subhead.  Could he not have come in here for a Supplementary Estimate if he wanted to?</P>

      <P>The expenditure of Bord Fáilte under all these heads is substantial and I did not want to embarrass the Minister for Finance by making too many excessive demands. There has been a tremendous increase in Bord Fáilte expenditure from £500,000 in 1958 to £3,500,000 in the passing year under capital and current account, and I think that shows progress.</P>

If he reads the first paragraph on page four he will see that we are spending some of this money in Great Britain in order to encourage English people to come here because of the position of other countries in having devalued and the necessity of attracting British people here in the prevailing circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the regional tourist organisations and the difficulty they had experienced in raising funds through the services of a special organisation.  I agree with Deputy Tully that there was quite obviously a mistake in the manner of so doing.  Regional tourist boards inevitably have their teething problems. I think they are going to raise funds in a new way, but I hope I have not misunderstood Deputy Tully; it is <Col N="581" /> absolutely essential that garage owners, hoteliers, guesthouse keepers, hotel proprietors, souvenir shopkeepers, publicans, who really do benefit from tourism should be asked to make a voluntary contribution to the regional tourist boards, however cynical Deputy Tully may be about the attitude of some of them.  I think if they are approached in the right way, not in the wrong way as undoubtedly they were in some instances, they will contribute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will have to be re-examined and is being re-examined at the moment.  In countries like Italy where there are provinces, where the people are no better off than they are here and where in many cases the people are poorer in certain regions, they do regard the collection of local funds equivalent to two per cent of the tourist expenditure in the area as an absolutely sound investment.  On that basis Deputy O'Leary who spoke about the regional tourist organisation and Deputy Michael Pat Murphy who also spoke about it would like to know that the local people interested in tourism in Cork and Kerry would between them have raised about £150,000 a year on the Italian precedent. I hope we will be able to reach that position.  We are very far off it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. P. Murphy referred to the farmhouse grants.  I should say the grants are given in the 12 western and north-eastern counties, including West Cork, to assist raising standards where necessary.  The grant is at the rate of 66? per cent, subject to a maximum of £500, and is available for additional rooms, bathrooms, toilets and improvement of appearance, etc. They will actually be given if only one bedroom is made available to tourists. On the other hand, for the registered guesthouse, to reach a satisfactory standard and to ensure no abuse of the grant facilities, to insist on a minimum of five rooms is, I think, reasonable.  We have reduced it from <Col N="582" /> ten, as it was.  We may take another step in the future.  At the moment I think we are getting a reasonable enough response so we can leave the registered guesthouse minimum at five rooms.</P>
    <P>The Deputy complained of some cases where there was failure to provide polite service to tourists.  Of course, Bord Fáilte and I and everybody else interested in tourism emphasise the necessity for friendliness and what I might describe as the natural Irish interest we have in human beings.  Politeness and interest in human beings as such are almost more important than all the money the Government give to tourism if we want to be successful.  It is one of the most successful factors in stimulating tourists to come here.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the difficulty local authorities have experienced in regard to their rates.  I quite understand their position.  Nevertheless, I think the capital invested in tourism in an area, although it may seem to be a burden&mdash;and I know there are many other important social priorities&mdash; results in making it easier to carry out rate collection from the people who live there.  As a result of tourism and the widespread expenditure of money by tourists the collection and paying of rates is made easier.  I think some of these investments that could be carried out would be found actually to help to bring in more rates.  I hope county councils will take the most liberal view they can of the grants towards infra-structural improvements of an area.  I think I have answered all the points made.</P>

      <P>I admit I find the temptation very strong to go in greater detail into the defects, the absurdities and the pretences of the proportional representation system, since the more closely the system is studied in detail the clearer it becomes that Deputy Dillon was accurate for once when he described it in volume 108, column 1716, of the Dáil Debates of 12th November, 1947, on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1947, in the following terms:</P>
      <P>Proportional representation is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation....</P>
      <P>And he went on to say:</P>
      <P>It was foisted on us by a collection of half lunatics....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I do not think it is necessary to go in full detail into it.  I think the people are beginning to see through the system, to see that it is not what it pretends to be.  In any event, I am primarily concerned with the advantages for the country from the proposed system of single-seat constituencies and with getting rid of the disadvantages and the general undesirability of multi-member constituencies. My main concern is that the people should be able to make a clear choice, that we should get rid of a system designed to make this impossible <Col N="584" /> and to promote the formation of small sectional Parties, that Deputies should have reasonable areas to cover and therefore have more time available for their more important duties as legislators, and that the undesirable effect on public morale of the present competition between Deputies for the same constituency, pretending that their influence is more effective than their colleagues, should be eliminated.  This, in my opinion, is the fundamental change desirable.</P>
    <P>I have already explained why we decided to put forward as the system of voting the straight vote or the relative majority system.  First of all, there was the fact that there has been no indication, either from our own Ard Fheis or from the informal committee which studied the Constitution, that another system is generally desirable. This being so, the Government naturally decided to suggest the only logical and straight vote system there is, that is, at election time to ask the people to indicate whom they want to represent them, to count their votes and to accept the result as they express it instead of trying by the use of arbitrary and unjustifiable rules to arrive at an artificial result.</P>
    <P>For instance, at the time of the last referendum, I showed that the theory on which the proportional representation system was based is absurd.  I think I should again invite the House to consider an example where three candidates are contesting one seat. This could occur either in a by-election under the proportional representation system or in the concluding stages of the count in a multi-member constituency in a general election or under the system known as the alternative vote in a single-seat constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

It could happen here, it has happened here, and it does happen regularly.  What I want <Col N="585" /> to show is that it can be demonstrated beyond all doubt that this system does not in such circumstances, where there are three candidates contesting one seat either in the concluding stages of the count in a multi-member constituency, in a by-election or in the system known as the alternative vote in a single-seat constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not establish that a majority of the voters favour the candidate who was declared elected in accordance with the rules of this system described as proportional representation.  I want to ask the Deputies to consider a situation in which there are three candidates. Candidate A has 4,000 votes, B 3,500 and C 3,000.  That is a total of 10,500 votes.  Under this system if it were a single-seat contest, the quota would be declared to be 5,251.  In any case none of these candidates has sufficient votes to be elected in accordance with the rules of this system.  In accordance with the peculiar logic of the system what happens at this stage is that the candidate C with 3,000 votes is eliminated, and his votes could go, 2,000 to candidate B, and 1,000 to candidate A.  This would leave a position that candidate A would now be credited with 5,000 votes and candidate B with 5,500 votes.  The people who sponsor this system, or who defend it, maintain that this means that a majority of those 10,500 voters wanted candidate B to be elected but this has not in fact been established, even in accordance with the ridiculous practice of regarding preference votes as having the same value as actual votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this means is that 4,000 of the electorate prefer candidate A to candidates B or C, 3,500 prefer candidate B to candidates A or C, and 3,000 prefer candidate C to candidates A or B, and that of those latter 3,000, 2,000 prefer candidate B to candidate A and 1,000 prefer candidate A to candidate B. That does not mean that an absolute <Col N="586" /> majority prefer candidate B.  Because no candidate has reached the quota, it was decided, in accordance with the rules of this system, to take the lowest candidate's second preferences into account in the same way as first preference votes.  If the ensuing so-called result is accepted as final, is it not the position that 3,000 people who voted for candidate C have been given a second choice merely because their first choice was favoured by fewer of the electorate than either of the others?</P>
    <P>Acceptance of this so-called result means in the example I have quoted that the candidate who was selected by most people as a first choice is defeated. What I want to know is: is there any good reason why the people who voted for this candidate should not have the same entitlement to have their second preferences considered as were the second preferences of the smaller number of voters who favoured candidate C?</P>

That is wrong and it is demonstrably wrong, because the whole electorate, even in accordance with the ridiculous assumptions in this system that a preference vote of any degree is equivalent to the expression of support of a first preference, have not had the opportunity of deciding between candidates B and C.  They have only had the opportunity of deciding between candidates A and B.</P>
      <P>If it were decided&mdash;and I do not see why it should not be in view of the fact that the whole principle of democracy is that each person's vote is of equal importance&mdash;to give the largest group in the constituency the same voting rights as the smaller groups it is possible that the second preferences of those who voted for candidate A would go, 1,500 to candidate B and 2,500 to candidate C.  This would give another equally justifiable &ldquo;result&rdquo; of 5,000 for candidate B and 5,500 for candidate C.</P>

      <P>What offence against democracy did they commit?  What greater rights have a minority of 3,000 got that their second preferences should be considered when the second preference votes of those who were in the majority should not be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that this second so-called <Col N="588" /> result is the correct one on the grounds that it has been established that more people wanted candidate B than candidate A, and now it has been established that more people wanted candidate C than candidate B, but that is not the fact because all the voters have not yet been given equality of treatment.  We now have the 3,500 who voted for candidate B who have not had their second preferences considered. Out of 10,500, 7,500 have been given a second choice.  If the 3,500 who voted for candidate B were treated in the same way&mdash;treated without the discrimination that is inherent in the system of so-called proportional representation which we have in this country&mdash;the second preferences could possibly have gone, 1,500 to candidate A and 2,000 to candidate C which would give a third result of 5,500 for candidate A and 5,000 in favour of candidate C, so it is obviously possible that taking into account the second preferences in the same way as the first preferences on a non-discriminatory basis rather than in the discriminatory manner in the present system, this could show a majority favouring each of the three.  This is nonsensical, of course, and the nonsensical result arises because the basic assumption equating a second, third or twentieth choice with a first choice is nonsense.  If you start with a nonsensical assumption, you will get a nonsensical result.</P>
    <P>It may be that if the only candidates happened to be A and B, the first result might have arisen, but that was not the position.  There were three candidates.  Candidate C was entitled to stand and the electorate were entitled to make their choice between the three.  This system prevents them from doing so.  Similarly, if the only candidates were B and C, the second result might have ensued.  If the only candidates were A and C, we might have had the third result.  As I said, the voters were asked in fact to choose between candidates A, B and C and the only thing that can possibly be established from their votes is that a majority clearly favoured candidate A. I suppose it would be more equitable to allot a notional value to preference votes, take them all into account, and <Col N="589" /> allocate the seat to the candidate obtaining the highest gross total but any such notional value would have to be purely arbitrary and the voters would soon see that the most effective way of supporting their real choice would be to vote for him only.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear that where there are two or more candidates, it is not possible to establish that an absolute majority favours any one unless more than 50 per cent of the voters say so themselves by voting for a particular candidate.  If more than 50 per cent do not vote for one, then there is not an absolute majority in favour of any one of the candidates.  The only question that it is feasible to ask at elections is: which of the candidates on the ballot paper do you prefer?  We know what a No. 1 vote means.  It means that this candidate is my choice as a Deputy but no one can interpret the meaning of a tenth or eleventh preference vote. In fact, such a vote is really meaningless. Certainly, to equate it to a No. 1 vote is making a mockery of elections.</P>
    <P>In the example I have quoted, more people favour A than either B or C; they have said so themselves, and while it is possible to devise any number of methods of manipulating the votes after they have been cast so as to change that result it is not possible to disprove it.  The more different systems of manipulating the votes after the actual elections that are considered the clearer it becomes that the only feasible and equitable thing to do is to ask the people whom they want as their Deputy and accept the answer as they give it and abandon any effort to change the result they express in the ballot boxes by mathematical trickery in accordance with a set of purely arbitrary and illogical rules.  In the immortal words of Deputy Dillon, the system that is described here as proportional representation is &ldquo;a fraud and a cod&rdquo;.  It does not do what it pretends to do.  Examination of the distribution of votes will show clearly that the idea of distributing them proportionately had to be abandoned at a very early stage in the post-election manipulation of the votes.  The claim that it ensures effective participation in <Col N="590" /> the result of all the electorate is also clearly, as I have shown, a shameless pretence.</P>
    <P>The example that I have quoted clearly shows that this system is solely concerned with those voters who are most out of touch with the general views of the people as a whole.  The system is devised to ensure that in a close situation, it is those voters who will make the actual decision and not those who share the views of a reasonable number of the electorate. Democracy is based on the idea that the majority is right, and if this is so, then the next most important views are surely those nearest to the majority and the least worthy of consideration are those in the smallest minority?  But the present system works in exactly the reverse way.  It is fundamentally opposed to the whole theory of democracy.</P>
    <P>I have shown that even in a single seat constituency the taking into consideration of the votes cast for the candidate in the smallest minority as full votes for other candidates until there are only two left, does not, in fact, establish that one particular candidate is favoured by a majority of the voters.  I have shown that this is so, even if we accept the ridiculous assumption that a second, third, tenth or twentieth preference should be equated to a full vote.  In view of the fact that there is not, as I said, any indication that another system is generally desired, the Government have naturally put forward what we regard as the only sensible and justifiable method of obtaining public opinion at an election. Our reasons for proposing these two amendments of the Constitution are, however, first to enable constituencies to be defined in a reasonable way, that is taking reasonable account of practical considerations and of the convenience of the people and their representatives and secondly, to obtain for the country the advantages of single-seat constituencies.  As I see it, the actual system of voting is incidental but since the responsibility is ours we have put forward what is clearly the best and fairest system.</P>
    <P>There is just one comparatively <Col N="591" /> minor point that I might mention in view of the fact that this debate is taking place at a time when two by-elections are being contested and in view of the fact that the conduct of these two campaigns in the two large and difficult counties of Clare and Wicklow makes such demands on the time and energy of Deputies that we have had, I think, an unusual number of quorum bells.  Under the system of single-seat constituencies, this disproportionate effort and expense by all Parties and by Deputies and Senators would not be necessary.  By-elections in a reasonably-sized constituency would not have to disrupt Deputies' normal activities and tax their stamina to the same extent as they do now. Instead of having to arouse the interest of people in a large area in order to replace one-third, one-fourth or one-fifth of the representation of the area, the task at by-elections would be to ask the smaller number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was interrupted, I was just concluding by pointing out that there was this point, which I considered a comparatively minor one, that if we had single-seat constituencies, by-election campaigns would make smaller demands on the time and energies of Deputies and that we might have less need for quorum bells and there would be less of a tax on the stamina of the Members, that the task of the political Parties and the candidates at by-elections would be of a smaller proportion than it is at present, that instead of having to arouse the interest of the people of a large area in an election which is being held to replace one-third, one-fourth or one-fifth of the representation of the constituency, the task would be to ask the smaller number of people that would be involved in the smaller constituencies to come out to replace the single representative for the area, to elect a new Deputy for the area; in other words, to replace their total representation. There would obviously be less expense attached to by-elections, both <Col N="592" /> for the State and for political Parties.</P>
      <P>The cost of this referendum has been mentioned but obviously the cost of the referendum would be quickly recovered through less expensive by-elections and as I have said, the demands on all our time and energies would be less.  I may say, while I have described this as a comparatively minor point, it was looked on by the 1910 British Royal Commission on Electoral Systems as being much the gravest defect of the system of proportional representation which operates here. Obviously the larger the constituency and the more Deputies they elect&mdash;in other words, the nearer the system comes to what was intended by its inventors&mdash;the more disproportionate becomes the effort and the expense necessary to replace the smaller fraction of representation of the constituency involved.</P>
      <P>If Deputies opposite could get over their highly developed inferiority complex and develop instead some degree of confidence in their own Party and their own policy, which apparently Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy O. J. Flanagan and a minority of Deputies of Fine Gael have, they would see the advantage of single-seat constituencies and would abandon their really craven complaints that in the clearer circumstances of a single-seat constituency, there must be inevitably a perpetuation of Fianna Fáil in office. That is the case the Opposition have been making, that if we get this clear confrontation in single-seat constituencies of the different Parties, there is no prospect either now or at any time in the future of anything but a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>In the Army in which the Minister for Local Government and I had the honour to serve, there was an expression which was used and which was the correct one which applies to what the Minister for Local Government has been saying over the past couple of days, and the word was &ldquo;bull&rdquo;.  If I ever listened to bulling in my life, I listened to it coming from the mouth of the Minister for Local Gevernment because it appears as if he and nobody else in his Party believed in the things which he put before this House.</P>
      <P>The memory of the Fianna Fáil Party appears to be short.  They do not seem to remember that they were beaten in their attempt to change to the straight vote system in 1959.  They do not seem to realise that the people are not going to forgive them for the needless expenditure of money which they propose to indulge in some time this year, for no other reason except that they themselves, and as Deputy Boland, Minister for Local Government, seems to suggest, are afraid of what will happen.  They cannot, if they do not get a change, have a chance of lording it over everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach opening this debate and I was very surprised by some of the statements he made. To pick one out of its context, it amazed me that the Taoiseach of this House, the Leader of the Parliament, the Leader of the Government, did not know how proportional representation works.  It astonished me to find that somebody in his position should make the statement he made here.  If this is the well-informed opinion which we are told the Fianna Fáil Government have on the electoral system of this country&mdash;and they have quoted most countries to us here&mdash;it is rather a pity that they did not inform themselves of what actually happens here. <Col N="594" /> What the Taoiseach described as the proportional representation system which elects people to this House was, in fact, the system which is used to elect people to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I quote from what he said in case anybody believes that I am misinter-preting what he meant.</P>
    <P>In volume 232 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 28th February, 1968, the Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>The choice between two effective candidates can depend on the relative position of weaker candidates and the chance transfer of sub-parcels of votes.  We all know of candidates who have headed the poll and not been elected.  This random element is all the more serious when as happened in the last general election only a few votes decided the last seat in some constituencies and as happens in many elections, only a handful of votes decides eliminations.  If the returning officer decided to include at an earlier stage a different bundle of an elected candidate's surplus votes, a different result could be achieved.</P>
    <P>Did the Taoiseach ever take part in a count?  Did he ever take the trouble of watching his votes being counted as most of us have done?  If he did, he would know that that statement is incorrect. There is no question of bundles of votes.  When a Dáil election takes place the elected candidate has his surplus and that is divided in proportion to the second preferences, for every candidate, for every paper.  It is astonishing that the Taoiseach should put forward a case like this.  If the rest of his arguments are like this one, they are very weak.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made of the fact that some people, not in our Party but in the Fine Gael Party, have expressed views contrary to what their Party stands for now.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  But I will say that there are in the Fianna Fáil Party people who dread the prospect of the straight vote being carried through.  They will not hear me say this because they are not here, but they will read it in the Official Report.  I <Col N="595" /> should like to hear them say: &ldquo;We do not mind; we are sure of our seats.&rdquo; That is not what they tell me and that is not what they say around the country.</P>
    <P>If we are going to say what other Parties stand for, let us say what our own Party stands for.  We stand for PR.  We stand for it not because of the fact that we feel the straight vote would wipe us out but because we feel that the PR system is the fairest and only system that should be allowed. That is the reason and that is the only reason.  To go further as this Party must, be it long or short, we stand for the system which we have now.  PR was grand and I have records to show how it worked.  It was grand as long as it favoured Fianna Fáil, as long as it guaranteed them a majority.  But, when it began to appear that the public, as they are entitled to do, decided to change their mind the Fianna Fáil felt, as they always have felt, that the people of Ireland have no right to change their mind.  They must support Fianna Fáil and if they do not do it one way they must be forced to do it another.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's opening address is very revealing because it shows that he has doubts not about the system of election but the type of people elected to the House.  One of the first things he said was that the straight vote will give a better type of Member.  He was careful not to say &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo;, but that will come later.  Was he, in fact, looking at his benches and saying: &ldquo;Look at them; would you blame me for changing the system of election with those fellows?&rdquo;  Did he mean that the people sitting in the front bench and back benches were not the type he would like to see in Dáil Éireann? Does he want to change the system because it will give a better type of Member?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach studied his speech.  Perhaps it was written out and handed to him and he did not read it.  He is an intelligent man and possibly if he had read it he would have been as surprised as I have been.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> He also referred to the fact that he thought Deputies were getting too much to do at local level.  In the same volume of the Official Report he says:</P>
    <P>The experience has been that competition between Deputies&mdash;often of the same Party&mdash;has forced some of them to curry favour with voters by pretending to gain favours for them even where benefits are available as of right thus tending to create a false impression in the public mind. So much time has now to be spent by Deputies in dealing ostensibly on behalf of their constituents with day-to-day matters of administration which it is not necessary for them to deal with and in travelling around extensive and unwieldy constituencies, that they have not enough time left for their primary duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>Is that why so many of his Party find it so difficult to come to this House?  Is that why so many members of his Party take no part in the debates?  I suggest it is not.  I suggest that this whole story of Deputies pretending they are doing things for others is cod and that the Taoiseach is trying to put a skin on the barefaced attempt he is making to change the whole pattern of political life in this country.</P>
    <P>I claim to spend more time in this House than any other Deputy and I have plenty of time to look after the needs of my constituents.  Very few of them come to me with complaints to get things done that they themselves could do, and in every case when they come to me it is because they have not got something which, as the Taoiseach says, they are by right entitled to.  And it is only when they have tried every avenue that they eventually call on the Deputy who they expect will be able to make representations for them.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  As a matter of fact, I believe that a Deputy is a buffer between the ordinary people and bureaucracy and the situation, if PR is ever changed will leave the ordinary people worse off.  The loss will be theirs.</P>
    <P>This whole idea of changing the <Col N="597" /> system, because as the Minister for Local Government seems to think the people want a change, arose many years ago.  In 1937 when the Constitution was being voted on, the leader of Fianna Fáil would not agree that any attempt should be made to change the voting system.  In 1959 the change was attempted and beaten and last year, over 18 months ago, a constitution committee was set up.  I would be slow to give details of what happened in this committee but for the fact that the Minister for Local Government here in the House, as well as other members of his Party outside the House, have been attempting to use the name of that committee for the purpose of boosting the argument in favour of a change.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government said that the committee did not suggest any other change except to the straight vote, or any argument in favour of retaining PR.  Of course nothing could be further from the truth because in fact this matter was mentioned at a committee meeting on only one occasion and on that occasion the former Taoiseach said&mdash;I want to make this very clear because if he wants an opportunity or if any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party on the committee wants an opportunity, he can come into the House and take it&mdash;that we should not discuss the suggestion of election by the straight vote system, because, since it had been defeated by the country nine years ago, the Government could not again put it to the country.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be more definite than that and because of that the matter of a change to the straight vote was not further discussed.  If Deputy Seán Lemass had not been on the committee at that time, there would have been written into the committee's report plenty of arguments against the proposed change; but we were given the impression by Deputy Seán Lemass &mdash;I have great respect for him and I believe he honestly meant what he said &mdash;that the change was not contemplated. The statement he made completely disarmed the members of the committee.  We were in a position at <Col N="598" /> that time to make a case against the suggested change&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley, in the chair, agreed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley was in the chair.  There were other Fianna Fáil members and nobody suggested that we were to have a change or that we must agree to make some recommendation on it.  The only discussion was on the question of the single transferable vote and on PR. There were arguments in favour of both.  If Deputy Seán Lemass were not the type of man I think he is, I should accuse him of deliberately introducing that statement for the purpose of disarming the people on the Committee who were opposed to the change.  I should accuse him of attempting to and of succeeding in stifling any argument against the straight vote system.  He made the statement and, as I have said, all of us there had respect for him and agreed that he must have been speaking with full knowledge of what the Government intended to do, particularly in view of the fact that he had been so recently Taoiseach and had set up the Committee&mdash;that he himself only came on it when Deputy Davern was promoted to the position of Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, why those of us on that Committee are angry when we find people like the Minister for Local Government attempting to use the report of the Committee to bolster up the weak arguments in favour of the change to the straight vote system?  The Committee, having met during a considerable period, were requested just before last Christmas by the Chairman, Deputy Colley, to bring in a report. He was very anxious the report should be brought in quickly.  I knew Deputy Colley before he came into the House and I believed he was dealing with this in an honourable manner.  He said it was necessary to bring in the report immediately because the Government were considering certain changes of the Constitution.  He impressed on us the urgency there was to have the report brought in.  We sat hours after this Dáil had concluded its business, <Col N="599" /> for the purpose of considering fully the report on questions which the Government had no intention of considering at all.  Deputy Colley was a member of the Government; Deputy Lemass was not, and Deputy Colley as Chairman of the Committee requested us to bring in the report quickly because the Government wanted to consider it.</P>
    <P>At that time it must have been known that the Government intended to try to change the system of election and at that time we had long passed the portion of the report which dealt with the system of election.  I feel very strongly that an attempt was made by the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government of this country to make fools of Members of the House by getting them to sit on a Committee, acting as stooges, as fools, preparing a report which they knew they would not use, or any part of it, unless it was favourable. When it was not favourable, they knew they would ignore it completely and bring in these two changes in the Constitution contrary to what was recommended.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which strikes at the roots of Committee work in this House. If Members of the Dáil who genuinely believe they are doing work for the House are to be used in this way, I want to make it very clear that as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we will not be involved in this kind of thing again.  We attempted to get the Committee together again when the real evidence had come out.  Could we get it?  No.  There was no danger of the chairman calling the Committee together because there were hard things to be said and it was decided it would be better to leave the saying of the hard things until this matter before the House was being dealt with.  It does not matter whether it is all over.  We have got a lesson in duplicity that we will not forget for many a day.</P>
    <P>All sorts of weird statements have been made by Government spokesmen. It started with the Minister for Justice, in a television discussion with Fine Gael Senator, Garret FitzGerald, and me.  He made the statement that it was quite a simple thing, that all we had <Col N="600" /> to do was to produce one paper dealing with the whole lot.  It was dead simple, just like that.  The Government had made up their minds.  Either the Minister for Justice was flying a kite or was badly caught out.  It would be difficult to find out and it does not really matter now.  The fact is that public opinion became so strong against the Government proposal to have a package deal&mdash;two entirely different things tied up in one, salt and sugar&mdash;that the Taoiseach announced he had decided to change.  I do not know if the Taoiseach was sure about whether a decision had ever been made to have the two together.  It is just an example of what would be tried if the public were not alert.</P>
    <P>On that occasion on television I produced quotations, which I propose to produce again later in the debate, in which the present President of Ireland, Mr. de Valera, then Leader of Fianna Fáil, and the man who followed him as Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, both stated that PR was not alone the best system of election but that it was the only safeguard of democracy in the country and that anybody who suggested it should be changed would only be doing so for sectional purposes, for Party political purposes. They said they were not proposing it in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>What a change.  That was pooh-poohed by the Minister for Justice on that occasion who said it was a long time ago.  It is a long time since Moses was given the tablets of stone but they are things that should not be forgotten. There are people in this country and in every country who believed that what was written then is still the law, that what was said then is still the law.  What Deputies de Valera and Lemass said then is still true.  We echo it here tonight.  Those who want to change from proportional representation want to do so only for Party interests and thus, in fact, preventing&mdash; if they get away with it&mdash;a system which will protect democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1957 of Volume 232, No. 13, of the Official Report, the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>There have been demands from certain <Col N="601" /> Deputies that the order of names on the ballot paper should be determined by lot rather than alphabetically on the grounds that candidates higher up on the ballot paper tend to receive more votes than those in a lower position.  If there is such a tendency, it is, of course, aggravated by the long lists of candidates inevitably involved in the present system.</P>
    <P>Let me point out that my name has consistently been at the bottom of the ballot paper, but, thank God, equally consistently, at the top of the poll.  That answers that argument pretty neatly.  In addition, the long list of candidates described by the Taoiseach simply does not exist in most cases.</P>
    <P>At this stage of our development, we should be able to count up to nine or ten.  The ballot paper which contains the names of more than nine or ten candidates in a Dáil election is rare indeed.  In most three-seat constituencies, there are the names of five, six, seven and, on rare occasions, eight candidates on the ballot paper. The Taoiseach is suggesting that we get mixed up because of the long list of candidates.  That might possibly be an argument in relation to the lists of candidates at local elections but, to judge by some of the speeches made here over the past couple of weeks, it is not the intention of the Government to alter the system of election of local authority members.  Therefore, this proposal is simply something which is introduced for Dáil Members.</P>
    <P>I assert that it does not matter where the name of the candidate appears on a ballot paper and I have proved it in my own case.  Secondly, I assert that the long list of candidates the Taoiseach talks about does not exist.</P>
    <P>I have an interesting table here of the percentages of the electorate who voted at each election and of the invalid votes cast.  To those who claim that proportional representation confuses people, that they do not know how to vote, that the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;, as they call it, would be so much easier to understand, I would ask them to <Col N="602" /> bear the following particulars from that table in mind.</P>
    <P>In the 1922 election, 62 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was 3.08; in the 1923 election, 61 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was 3.66; in 1927, there were two elections, in the first of which 68 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was 2.6; at the second election in 1927, 69 per cent of the electorate voted and 1.86 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1932, 77 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes dropped to 1.6; in 1933, 81 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was 1.05; in 1937, 76 per cent of the electorate voted and 2.1 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1938, 79 per cent of the electorate voted and 1.2 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1943, 74 per cent of the electorate voted and 1.2 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1944, 68 per cent of the electorate voted and 1.04 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1948, 74 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was .98; in 1951, 75.3 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was .89; in 1954, 76.4 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was .94; in 1957, 71.3 per cent of the electorate voted and .93 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1961 70.6 per cent of the electorate voted and .96 per cent of the votes was invalid; in 1965&mdash;the last election&mdash; 75.1 per cent of the electorate voted and the percentage of invalid votes was .91.</P>
    <P>Where, then, do we get the idea that the system of proportional representation is confusing, that people spoil their votes, that people do not vote properly, that they do not know how to vote?  I have read out the figures for the House.  They answer the Taoiseach's argument pretty well.</P>
    <P>We have also heard arguments about the number of elections which were held.  One must be sure of one's facts. One of the arguments by Fianna Fáil on this issue is that the straight vote system will create a more stable government <Col N="603" /> and, in fact, that the Government will remain longer in power&mdash; for very obvious reasons.  Since proportional representation was introduced in this country in 1923, the number of elections which occurred here, as compared with the number which occurred in Great Britain, where the straight vote system is in operation, shows that there was one election more in Great Britain in that period than there was here.  So much for the argument that proportional representation produces an unstable government.</P>
    <P>For anybody who is interested in the figures, the life of the 1923 Dáil was three years and eight months.  Cumann na nGaedheal, the then ruling Party, got 39.2 per cent of the votes and 14 per cent of the seats.</P>
    <P>In June, 1927, Cumann na nGaedheal received 27.4 per cent of the votes and won 30 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted two months.</P>
    <P>In September, 1927, Cumann na nGaedheal got 38.4 per cent of the votes and 40 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted four years and three months.</P>
    <P>In 1932, Fianna Fáil got 44.6 per cent of the votes and 48 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted ten months.</P>
    <P>In 1933, Fianna Fáil got 49.7 per cent of the votes and 50 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted four years and four months.</P>
    <P>In 1937, Fianna Fáil got 45.3 per cent of the votes and 49 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted ten months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> In 1938, Fianna Fáil got 52 per cent of the votes and 55 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted five years.</P>
    <P>In 1943, Fianna Fáil got 41.9 per cent of the votes and 48 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted 11 months.</P>
    <P>In 1944, Fianna Fáil got 48.9 per cent of the votes and 54 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted three years and seven months.</P>
    <P>In 1948, Fianna Fáil got 41.9 per cent of the votes and 46 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted three years and three months.</P>
    <P>In 1951, Fianna Fáil got 46.3 per cent of the votes and 47 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted two years and ten months.</P>
    <P>In 1954, Fianna Fáil got 43.4 per cent of the votes and 45 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted two years and eight months.</P>
    <P>In 1957, Fianna Fáil got 48.3 per cent of the votes and 53 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted four years and six months.</P>
    <P>In 1961, Fianna Fáil got 43.8 per cent of the votes and 49 per cent of the seats.  That Dáil lasted three years and five months.</P>
    <P>In the last election, Fianna Fáil got 47.7 per cent of the votes and 50 per cent of the seats.  There is a question mark as to the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14th March, 1968.</P>
