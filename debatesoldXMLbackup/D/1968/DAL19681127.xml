      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léafar an Bille don Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sé an cuspóir atá leis an mBille seo ná na Dáilcheantair a athmheas ag féacaint do na hathraithe ar dháileadh an daonra a léiríodh sa daonáirimh a rinneadh i 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi réir an Acht Toghcháin (Leasú), 1961, 144 chomhalta an líon comhaltaí atá i nDáil Éireann faoi láthair.  Nuair a bhí an tAcht sin faoi bhráid an Oireachtais, glacadh go foirleathan leis an líon sin agus ní beartaítear é a athrú anois.  Os rud é, ámh, go bhfuil Acht na bliana 1961 á athghairm anois <Col N="1220" /> beartaítear an fhoráil sin a athachtú in alt 2 den Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Forálaíonn alt 3 gurb iad na Dáilcheantair a shonráitear san Sceideal a ghabhann leis an mBille seo a bheidh ina Dháilcheantair tar éis an céad lánscor eile ar Dháil Éireann agus forálaíonn alt 4 gurb é an líon comhaltaí a shonraítear sa tríú cholún den Sceideal a thoghfar do gach Dáilcheantar ar leith díobh.  Sna haltanna eile, leagtar amach na forálacha is iondúil i mBille dá leithéid seo.</P>
    <P>Sa mheamram mínithe a cuireadh amach leis an mBille, tugadh achomair de fhorálacha an Sceidil agus tá léarscáileanna curtha ar fáil i leabharlann an Oireachtais a thaispeánann na Dáilcheantair mar atá siad faoi láthair agus mar atá molta sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Ag féacaint don bhreith a thug an Árd-Chúirt ar an Acht Toghcháin (Leasú), 1959, agus don bhreith a thug an Chúirt Uachtarach ar an mBille Toghcháin (Leasú), 1961, bhí iachall orainn ag socrú na Dáilcheantair nua dúinn, deimhin a dhéanamh de nach mbeadh an líon daoine os coinne an Teachta, os cionn ná faoi bhun, an meánlíon náisiúnta méid is mó ná míle duine i gcás ar bith.  Lena chois sin, thugamar aird ar an gcoibhneas atá idir an daonra agus líon na dtoghthóirí sna codanna éagsúla den tír sa dóigh nach mbeadh difríocht ró-mhór idir fiúntas an vóta in áit amháin seachas áit eile.  Thugamar aird, freisin, ar theoranta na gcontaethe, ach ag féachaint do na forálacha Bunreachta agus do bhreitheanna na gcúirteanna ina dtaobh, níor éirigh linn na teoranta san a choinneáil slán ach i gcor-chás.</P>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, tá an-chuid slite ann ina bhféadfaí na Dáilcheantair a athmheas agus, cé go bhfuil an Rialtas den tuairim nach inmholta daoine a scaireadh ón a gcontae féin i gcás ar bith, táthar sásta gurb iad na tairiscintí atá sa Bhille na tairiscintí is lú locht.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to revise the Dáil constituencies in the light of changes in the distribution of the population recorded in the 1966 census returns.</P>
    <P>The present total membership of the Dáil was fixed by the Electoral <Col N="1221" /> (Amendment) Act, 1961, at one hundred and forty-four.  There was general acceptance of this figure when that Act was before the Oireachtas and no change is now being proposed.  Since, however, the 1961 Act is being repealed, this particular provision is being re-enacted in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that, after the next dissolution of Dáil Éireann, the constituencies will be those specified in the Schedule to the Bill and the number of members for each constituency will, under section 4, be as set out in the third column of the Schedule.  The remaining sections contain the consequential and other provisions usual in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>A summary of the provisions of the Schedule has been included in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill and maps indicating the effects of these provisions have been provided in the Oireachtas Library.  In deference to views expressed some time ago by Members opposite I will be as brief as possible and confine myself at this stage to certain general considerations which are essential for a proper understanding of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is necessary in the first place to be quite clear about the relevant provisions of the Constitution.  Subsection 3º of section 2 of Article 16 lays down that:</P>
    <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would draw particular attention to the reference to the number of Members &ldquo;to be elected at any time&rdquo;. From this it appears that equality of population at the time of the revision itself is not enough and that having regard to the 1966 Census returns, which show substantial departures from parity in the case of many constituencies, a further revision of constituencies as requested in Parliamentary Questions by a number of opposition Deputies must now be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The requirement of equality in the ratio of Members to population is <Col N="1222" /> qualified by the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;.  What this means has to be determined in the light of two court decisions.  The High Court held in 1961 that the relevant provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959, were unconstitutional because they had produced some substantial departures from the average population ratio per Deputy and that there were no relevant circumstances to justify these departures. In other words the Court ruled that deviations of up to 17 per cent from the national average were excessive and could not be justified on the grounds of the desirability of adhering to county boundaries, having due regard to geographical features and so on.  The judgment did suggest, however, that a deviation of up to 1,000 would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The 1961 Bill provided for a scheme of constituencies in which the maximum deviation was of this order.  That Bill was referred by the President to the Supreme Court who advised that it was not repugnant to the Constitution. The following extract from the Supreme Court judgment setting out their attitude towards the provisions of subsection 3º of section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution has particular relevance here.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions. The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.  The problem of what is practicable is primarily for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have.  Its decision should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article.  This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above <Col N="1223" /> or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted.  This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To justify the Court in holding that the sub-section has been infringed it must, however, be shown that the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the sub-clause.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Court the divergencies shown in the Bill are within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>We thus have the position that the Oireachtas may have regard to a variety of factors unless there is &ldquo;a manifest infringement of the Article&rdquo;. The Supreme Court refused to lay down a figure above or below which a variation from the national average would be permitted but it did hold that the divergencies shown in the 1961 Bill were within reasonable limits.  The Supreme Court stated that the problem was primarily one for the Oireachtas but it also made it clear that the Courts could pronounce as to whether the Constitution has been violated and since the only figure mentioned as an acceptable divergence is the 1,000 indicated by the High Court, it is clear that this is the only figure that can be utilised with impunity.  In the recent referendum a proposal to allow a greater divergence from the national average in order to take account of the factors mentioned above was decisively rejected.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it is clear that in no case should the population ratio diverge from the national average by more than 1,000 and the present proposed revision has been prepared on this basis.</P>
    <P>On the basis that a deviation from the national average of 1,000 persons per Deputy is tolerable, only 14 of the <Col N="1224" /> 38 constituencies determined by the 1961 Act are now within the constitutional limits.  Eighteen constituencies have a population per Deputy of more than 1,000 below the national average while in another six the population per Deputy ratio is more than 1,000 above the average.  If the existing constituencies are disregarded entirely and if, instead, we look at the existing counties, we find that, even if each county could be considered in isolation from its neighbours, 20 of the twenty-seven administrative counties could not, within the tolerance permitted, be dealt with within the confines of the county boundary, that is, without either grouping the county with another, adding part of its population to another or adding to it part of the population of another county. The only counties which, if considered in isolation, could be dealt with within the confines of the county boundary are: Cork (including the city), Dublin (including the city), Kilkenny, Limerick (including the city), Mayo, Wexford and Wicklow.  However, even in the case of some of these seven counties, breaching of the boundaries or grouping with another county is unavoidable because of the position in neighbouring counties.</P>
    <P>A consideration which it appears to be reasonable to bear in mind is the desirability of ensuring within the permissible limits of population per Deputy that there should not be too great a disparity in the value of the votes to be cast in different areas.  A revision based solely on population is bound to produce such a disparity because the proportion of voters to population varies throughout the country. In the Dublin area, for example, voters on the 1966-67 Register of electors represent 55.4 per cent of the population enumerated on 17th April, 1966, while in the area west of the Shannon the proportion is 63 per cent.</P>
    <P>As will be apparent from the tabular statement circulated in reply to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy G. Collins on 26th November, 1968, the allocation of seats on the basis of population within the limits of a divergence of 1,000 results in the vote in the Dublin area being more valuable than the rural vote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> For example in 1966-67 which is the registration year closest to the date of the census the estimated electorate per member for the proposed constituency of Dublin North-West is 10,520.  The corresponding estimated figure for the proposed constituency of South-West Donegal is 13,240.  The vote in Dublin North-West will, therefore, be over 25 per cent more valuable than the vote in South-West Donegal, although in the case of Dublin North-West the population per Deputy is 21,002 while in South-West Donegal the population per Deputy is only 19,449.  In other words the result of adhering to the Courts' interpretation of the Constitution is that the number of voters per Deputy is highest in a constituency with one of the lowest populations per Deputy while the number of voters per Deputy is lowest in a constituency with one of the highest populations per Deputy.  If in each of these two constituencies the population per Deputy were fixed at the national average there would be 13,560 voters per Deputy in South-West Donegal and only 10,210 voters per Deputy in North-West Dublin so that if seats were allocated on the basis of strict parity of population per Deputy a vote in North-West Dublin would be 33 per cent more valuable than a vote in South-West Donegal.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the question of how many Deputies should represent a constituency.  In the present Bill, we propose an increase in the number of three-seat constituencies from 17 to 26 and in the number of four-seat constituencies from 12 to 14 while the number of five seat constituencies is being reduced from nine to two.  Five-seat constituencies have proved unwieldy in practice, particularly in rural areas, and are being retained only in the case of two constituencies which do not have to be disturbed to comply with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the only way of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries is by aggregating a number of counties together but as this would result in constituencies returning as many as 13 Deputies most people would not regard it as an <Col N="1226" /> acceptable solution.  If the constituencies based on individual counties are to retain their identity as far as possible and if the maximum divergence from the national average is not to exceed 1,000, then the boundaries of more than half of the counties must be breached.  We have kept these transfers at an absolute minimum and indeed if county boroughs are taken into account, the total population of transferred areas under the proposed revision will in fact be less than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable to deal with the area comprising the province of Connaught, the County Donegal and the County Clare as a unit.  This area at present returns 33 Deputies.  The population according to the 1966 census is 584,096.  If 30 Deputies are allocated to the area the average population per Deputy will be 19,470, for 29 Deputies the average will be 20,141 and for 28 Deputies the average will be 20,860.  The area can therefore be dealt with within the constitutional provision by allocating it 28, 29 or 30 seats.  The 1966/67 register of electors which is the register most nearly corresponding to the date of the 1966 census provides the figures for voters which most nearly correspond to the population figures in the 1966 census and on the basis of these figures the number of votes per Deputy for 30 seats would be 12,295, for 29 seats the number is 12,718 and for 28 seats 13,173, while the national average is 11,869.  In other words, although at 30 seats the population per Deputy will be near the minimum allowed, the number of voters per Deputy will be above the national average.  If 31 seats were allocated the population per Deputy would be below the minimum permissible but even at this figure the number of voters per Deputy would be above the national average.  It is clear then that to allocate anything less than 30 seats would result in an excessive devaluation of the actual votes in this area as compared with other areas and the Government accordingly decided that there should be 30 seats in this region.</P>
    <P>In this area west of the Shannon then, a loss of three seats is necessary <Col N="1227" /> and most county boundaries must be breached.  The population of County Clare is too small for four seats and too large for three and there must, therefore, be a breach in the boundary between Clare and Galway.  The population of Galway is too high for seven seats and too low for eight seats.  At the northern end of the area, the population of County Donegal is too large for five seats and too small for six and, accordingly, the boundary between Donegal and Leitrim must be breached. The population of County Roscommon is too small for three seats and there must, therefore, be a boundary adjustment between that the county and county Leitrim, as at present.  The population of Sligo is too small to support three seats and&mdash;again, as at present&mdash;portion of Leitrim must be joined with it to form a constituency.  The only county in the area which can preserve its boundary is County Mayo.</P>
    <P>In the general area of South Leinster no change is necessary.  To the north of this area, however, we find that the population of the constituencies of Longford-Westmeath, Cavan and Monaghan have fallen below the required minimum ratio.  The most obvious change to make here is to restore to Longford-Westmeath the portion of County Westmeath ceded to the Kildare constituency in 1961, to transfer portions of Meath to the Cavan and Monaghan constituencies and to recoup Meath from Kildare, the population of which would be too low for four seats and too high for three seats.</P>
    <P>In Munster, other than Clare, the only change of importance is in the Cork-Kerry area.  The population of Kerry is too small to support six seats and much too large for five seats in accordance with the Constitutional provision. It is accordingly proposed to cede part of South-West Cork to South Kerry, and to make further adjustments as between the present North and South Kerry constituencies.  At present, Cork borough constituency does not extend over the whole of the county borough area, and it includes part of Cork county.  It has been decided to form two constituencies within the county borough boundary and to increase <Col N="1228" /> the number of Deputies for the city from five to six.  There will be a reduction of one in the representation for North-East Cork and a consequential rearrangement of the three county constituencies.  I should mention that the population figures quoted in the memorandum for the two Cork city constituencies are still tentative and because of certain practical difficulties it may not be possible to arrive immediately at definitive figures.</P>
    <P>Having allocated seats in this way there are 38 seats left for the Dublin area and this gives an average population of 20,922 per Deputy which is within the permissible limits.  The average number of voters per Deputy in accordance with the 1966/67 register of electors is 11,589 compared with the national average of 11,869.  In other words in this area while the population per Deputy is close to the upper limit allowed, the number of voters per Deputy is below the national average whereas the opposite is the case in the western area.  If the city and county are to be kept separate there must be 11 seats in the county.  This leaves 27 for the city but this would give a slightly too high average.  There must therefore be a slight adjustment between the city and county and it is proposed to add the Baldoyle ward, which with a population of 2,097 is one of the least populous wards in the city, to the county.  The population of the city north of the river Liffey is 287,846 and the population of the south side is 280,926.  With 27 seats therefore it is clear that one constituency must cross the river.  The population figures for Dublin city constituencies as indicated in the Explanatory Memorandum are provisional.  In order to keep within the limits of ±1,000, a number of wards in the city had to be divided and the population of each of the divided portions is being checked by the Census Office.</P>
    <P>The revision of constituencies must be based on the figures in the 1966 Census.  Consequently, it is not permissible to take account of population changes that are known to have taken place since then and that are known to be imminent.  For instance none of the dwellings in the National Building <Col N="1229" /> Agency housing scheme at Ballymun were occupied on 17th April, 1966, but before the next Census 3,600 families will be living in the locality.  Similarly the continuing large scale local authority and private housing developments in places like Kilbarrack, Coolock/Kilmore, and Ballyboden or the developments planned in Tallaght, Ballybrack, Rathfarnham, Blanchardstown and Swords cannot be taken into consideration.  It seems certain, therefore, that at least as far as the Dublin area is concerned it will be possible to make demands for a further revision of constituencies as soon as the next census to be taken in 1971 is published.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would like to make.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959, which was supported by all Parties in this House, effected a virtually agreed revision of constituencies which involved no breach of county boundaries.  This revision was challenged in the High Court by the then Fine Gael Senator, Dr. John O'Donovan.  When the High Court held that the Act was unconstitutional, a new electoral Bill was prepared which involved widespread breaching of county boundaries.  This was bitterly criticised in the Dáil, mainly on the grounds that the Government should have introduced an amendment of the Constitution to eliminate this defect. When the 1966 Census returns were published it was evident that an even less acceptable revision would have to be undertaken.  The Government decided that the people should be given an opportunity of deciding whether the Constitution should be amended to remove the difficulty.  The people have decided against an amendment and we must all accept their decision.  The necessary revision could, of course, be made in very many different ways and while the Government believe that all adjustments between one county and another are undesirable it is considered that the proposals in the Bill are the least objectionable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I notice that the Minister for Local Government, in concluding his Second Reading speech, departed from the usual formula, in that he has not <Col N="1230" /> recommended the Bill to the House.  I can indeed well understand his reluctance to do so.  I presume he will rely on his majority to steamroll it through the House and for that reason he has departed from what appears to be the usual formula of strongly recommending the measure to the House.</P>
      <P>Indeed, Sir, the introduction of this Bill by the present Minister for Local Government must be an exercise unique in democracy.  I say that because we have had a long experience throughout the present year of the Minister's attitude towards our electoral laws and in particular his attitude towards the system of proportional representation which it now proposes to operate.</P>

I respectfully submit to the Chair that a discussion on PR and the referendum and on the decision of the people is relevant.  I find it very difficult to understand how the present Minister for Local Government should have the courage or the cheek to come here and introduce this Bill to reform the electoral laws.  I say that because <Col N="1231" /> on the 21st of February&mdash;I want to put this on record&mdash;the Minister for Local Government introduced the Third and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution. Those measures got a Second Reading from 28th February to 3rd April.  They were taken in Committee from 15th May to 19th June and we had the Report Stage from 19th June to 26th June and the final Stages from 20th June to 3rd July.  This House was engaged in discussing proposals by the present Minister for Local Government to change the entire electoral system here from the 28th February to 3rd July, 1968 and, indeed, from that date until 16th October we had a debate in the country on the selfsame proposals.</P>
      <P>We know from the Minister's contributions here and in the Seanad that he does not believe in the system of proportional representation under which Members are elected to Dáil Éireann, that he believes it is an unworkable system.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I submit that it is quite in order to criticise the Minister for Local Government, to criticise his attitude to electoral reform and his attitude to PR which he is now trying to operate and that it is also quite in order for me to say&mdash;and I want to go on record as saying&mdash;that it is manifestly absurd for the Minister for Local Government, who is on record as saying that PR is unworkable, to introduce a measure to operate it.  That is the case I want to make.  I submit that, unless I am permitted to make that case, I am being unfairly treated.  When interrupted I was saying that throughout this year both in the House and in the country the Minister has made the case that the system of PR laid down in the Constitution here is unworkable.  He put that case to the people and it was rejected.  Any self-respecting Minister for Local Government whose proposals had been rejected by a majority of practically 250,000 electors would resign from the position and would not come to the House with proposals further to amend the electoral laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> I believe this is not a <i>bona fide</i> effort by the Minister to amend the electoral laws but is an attempt by him to vindicate himself and prove that the proposals that he put to the House from 28th February last to 3rd July are correct and to substantiate the case he made.  That is why I say it is unreasonable and quite unjustified for the Government to send in here the present Minister for Local Government with these proposals.  It is hard to understand why the Government, who are accepting collective responsibility with the Taoiseach at their head, have not seen fit to change the present Minister for Local Government and send in another Minister with these electoral reforms.  In saying that, I am not making any personal attack on the Minister for Local Government but I am saying that a man who campaigned, as he campaigned, and who holds the beliefs which he apparently holds on our system of election could not be expected to be unbiased in his proposals. It would be asking too much from him.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that he has insisted on coming in here with this measure in order to vindicate himself and in order to punish, in so far as he can, the people of this country for rejecting his proposals in the referendum. Recent events have demonstrated beyond doubt that the present Minister for Local Government is a bad judge; that his opinions on electoral reform cannot be accepted as being sound and that his views on constituencies and on the system of election which we have here are simply not sound and cannot be accepted as a good opinion.  The fact that the referendum was rejected by approximately a quarter of a million votes is ample evidence that the advice given by the Minister for Local Government to this House and to the country was not sound.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Government's attitude in entrusting the present Minister for Local Government with the duty of revising the constituencies. According to his way of thinking, he has taken on an impossible task.  He has committed himself to the proposition that it is impossible to revise the constituencies in a reasonable way within <Col N="1234" /> the law as it stands, within the Constitution as confirmed by the people. As I said yesterday, he is committed, as a result of his attitude here, to reducing Article 16 of the Constitution to absurdity and that, in my respectful opinion, is what he has set out to do in the measure we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has fallen down in his duty; he has not faced up to his responsibilities and obligations because I believe that the least that the country and the House are entitled to on this measure is a fresh and unprejudiced mind rather than the prejudiced mind of the Minister for Local Government &mdash;the committed mind and the known mind of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Local Government believes that it would be a blow to his prestige if he were to hand over his portfolio of Local Government to another Minister and it may well be that the Taoiseach, on that ground, has decided to stand over the Minister and authorise him to introduce this Bill.  That is a point of view but it is a point of view with which I do not agree.  However, if the Minister for Local Government was brave enough to accept this task and if the Taoiseach is foolish enough to entrust him with the introduction of this Bill, the House and the country are entitled to expect that the very least they would have done would be to have introduced into this Bill the elementary safeguard of a constituency commission.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We can discuss the type of Minister and we can say that because of his known committed views on this subject he should not have been entrusted with the introduction of this Bill.  One would have thought he would have sought some impartial advice, that he would have ensured that what he was doing not only was fair but would be seen to be fair.  One would have thought that a man who suffered such a rebuff at the hands of the electorate as recently as the 16th October of this year would have taken great precautions to ensure that his proposals to the House were equitable, <i>bona fide</i> and in the interests of the proper representation of the people rather than of the consolidation of his Party in office. With that end in view, I consider that he might have sought the opportunity of establishing an informal committee of Dáil Éireann consisting of Members of both sides of the House and be guided by them.  Did he do that?  He did not.  As a matter of fact, he sought, and apparently accepted, the views of one side of the House and one side of the House only &mdash; those of his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill we are dealing with now was introduced into this House on 23rd October of this year.  On that day I think I asked the Taoiseach or the Minister for Local Government when the Bill was expected to be circulated. I was told then it would be circulated on 6th November and that we would have the Second Stage debate on 12th November.  The 6th November came and there was no Bill.  We know that on that day Deputy Corish, the Leader of the Labour Party, asked the Minister for Local Government the date on which the Bill was promised to be circulated or when it would be circulated.  In a very offhand and uninformative way the Minister said: <Col N="1240" />&ldquo;Next week some time, I hope&rdquo; whereupon the Taoiseach intervened to say that the Bill would be circulated on the 12th of this month, the date on which the Second Reading debate was supposed to take place.  We also know that it only got into the post in pursuance of the Taoiseach's promise some time about two O'clock on the morning of the 12th of this month.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Local Government what was going on in the meantime and who was he consulting in the meantime.  The fact of the matter is that he was consulting every Fianna Fáil TD, one by one, in a systematic manner.  He was asking each TD how this change and how the other change would suit him.  I believe the Minister made himself available to those Fianna Fáil TDs, that they were consulted and asked to advise on how best to arrange constituencies to suit themselves. That is not the end of them. One afternoon I saw in the restaurant of this House the entire Fianna Fáil group of county councillors from one county in Ireland, every one of them, and I did not know what was going on because I happen to know the county.  Then I thought and thought again and it struck me that every one of those Fianna Fáil county councillors was brought up because it happens to be the only county in Ireland in which there is not a Fianna Fáil TD, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that delayed the publication of this Bill from the 6th to the 12th November.  This is the sort of impartial consultation the Minister was having.  The Minister would have been much better advised to accept the commission he rejected yesterday than to avail of this sort of consultation and this sort of advice.  The electoral laws of this country, as enshrined in the Constitution, were not put into it to keep any one particular political Party in office or to try to do so because it is trying the Minister will be.  The electoral provisions of the Constitution are supposed to serve all the people of this country and to serve all the Parties in this House.  Is it not, therefore, manifestly unjust, unfair and unreasonable that in an atmosphere such as prevails in this country at the <Col N="1241" /> present time, following the long controversial and acrimonious debate on electoral reform in this House from 28th February to 3rd July and in the country virtually from 3rd July to 16th October, that the constituencies should be revised by the chief operator in that debate and in that controversy, the Minister for Local Government, aided and abetted by each and every Oireachtas Member of his own Party? Where the constituency does not happen to have at that time either a Member of the Dáil or a Member of the Seanad the entire Fianna Fáil county council bloc is brought up here to advise the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>That offends seriously against the Irishman's sense of fair play and against the Irishman's sense of decency. Mind you, that is why the Minister and his Party took such a hammering at the polls on the 16th October.  It was because the Irish people believe in fair play and because the Irish people did not trust the Minister for Local Government and the Government in their attempt to gerrymander and rig the constituencies.  That is the principal reason the Minister took such a hammering. It was because the people regarded it as an insult to their sense of fair play, because the Irish people believe that in electoral reform justice should be done and justice should be seen to be done.  That is why I suggest the Minister for Local Government should have sought and even welcomed some form of impartial advice on the drawing up of those constituencies. Whether that advice was to come from a statutory committee, which I am not permitted to recommend or even to discuss, or whether it should come from an informal but fairminded all-Party committee of this House, is immaterial to my argument.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can draw from the refusal of the Minister for Local Government to accept a commission or to seek the advice of all Parties in this House and to insist on doing the job himself, with the assistance of his own henchmen, is that he is not interested in arranging constituencies in a fair manner but rather is he interested in arranging them or <Col N="1242" /> rigging them in a manner which he considers best calculated to give an advantage to the Fianna Fáil Party.  It would not be possible for me to make these allegations or to make this type of speech if the Minister had sought the advice of an all-Party commission of this House.  If there is any sort of a measure which goes through this House and which affects every Party and every individual Member of the House in a particular way, it is the revision of constituencies.  Surely, Sir, this is something which should be raised above politics and above Party politics and above Party advantage?  Surely it is something which should be treated in a <i>bona fide</i> and a fair manner?</P>
    <P>It is simply revolting to have the sort of talk going on here that has gone on since 16th October, 1968&mdash;back-stairs and back-room discussions between the Minister and his own Party, with other Parties and other Members being ignored; maps being scrutinised, considered, studied and altered by the Minister and the Members of his own Party, without these maps being made available to anybody else until the job has been done, until the Bill has been introduced, until the Minister has committed himself.  I say that that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The result, of course, is gerrymandering. The result is a Bill&mdash;I shall deal later on with the way in which it is gerrymandered&mdash;that is introduced and that is calculated deliberately to gerrymander the constituencies in regard to areas and numbers in a way that it is believed&mdash;but it will not work&mdash;will suit the Minister and his Party.  As I said last night, the Fine Gael Party is not the only Party which believes that gerrymandering can take place and does take place but should be avoided and prevented.</P>
    <P>Before the referendum, the Taoiseach warned the electorate that, unless they took steps to prevent it, gerrymandering could take place.  Let me quote what he said in this expensive document entitled &ldquo;Referendum &mdash;The Reasons Why&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>What is proposed is that new constituencies will be drawn up by an independent commission presided <Col N="1243" /> over by a judge so that gerrymandering will be impossible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach anticipated gerrymandering. The Taoiseach saw the danger of gerrymandering.  He saw that only some form of independent body which operated in the light of day, and before the public rather than behind closed doors, could prevent gerrymandering.</P>
    <P>Now, let us consider for a moment the meaning of the word &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo;. It is a word that we hear bandied about very often.  Maybe not many people go to the bother of finding out what it means or how it came into existence.  Well, the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; derives its name from the Governor of the State of Massachusetts in the United States of America whose name was &ldquo;Gerry&rdquo; and who devised the scheme.  Here is the meaning of the word according to the Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, New Edition, Volume II:</P>
    <P>To arrange the political divisions of a State so that, in an election, one Party may obtain an advantage over its opponent even though the latter may possess a majority of votes in the State.</P>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach was afraid of.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill, both in regard to the geographical situation of constituencies and in regard to the number of Deputies provided for in one part of the country as against another, has outdone the proposal of Governor Gerry of the State of Massachusetts in the United States of America.  As a matter of fact, this Bill could be described as &ldquo;Bolandering&rdquo;.  I think it will probably go down in history as the attempt to &ldquo;Bolander&rdquo; the constituencies of this country.  However, I am convinced that the Irish people, just as they violently and in the most decisive manner reacted against the other attempt on 16th October, 1968, to change the electoral system, will react at the next general election here and that whether the Minister amends these proposals or whether he does not amend them, he and his Party will be <Col N="1244" /> swept out of power because the Irish people are now in the mood to do that.</P>
    <P>On 16th October, 1968, the Irish people demonstrated that they were in no mood whatever to tolerate the attempt then made by the Minister for Local Government to change the electoral system for his own benefit.  I think he will find that, just as he completely misjudged the people then, just as he was as far out as a lighthouse in his summing-up of the views of the Irish people on 16th October, 1968, he is very far out when he comes to the next general election.</P>
    <P>This Bill is really a disgraceful effort by the Minister for Local Government to say to the people of this country, in effect: &ldquo;I told you so. You would not take my advice.  I told you what would happen.  Now you are going to get it.&rdquo;  That is why I believe the Minister for Local Government is a very foolish man indeed. He has done no service either to himself or to his Party in introducing this Bill in its present form.  He has set out to undo the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>The people decided that they wanted proportional representation.  They decided twice, in 1959 and again this year when they were asked if they wanted to abolish proportional representation. They were so indignant at being asked the question again that they told the Minister in no uncertain manner that they wanted to continue the electoral laws as contained in Article 16 of the Constitution.  They said: &ldquo;We want you and your Government as long as you are there to go and operate them.&rdquo; One would have thought that the Minister would have accepted that advice and would have said: &ldquo;Well, the people are supreme.  I have given them every opportunity to change the system. They do not want to change the system and it is now my business to accept their decision and carry out their orders.&rdquo;  However, instead of that the Minister has used every possible device to undo the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>We know that proportional representation works best in larger constituencies, in four- and five-seat constituencies. The Minister in his attempt to get advantage for himself and his Party <Col N="1245" /> created a great number of three-seat constituencies where he thought it would suit him, where he thought he had up to 50 per cent of the votes in the constituency.  Remember that I say &ldquo;where he thought&rdquo; because as the Minister will get to know, what was the case in relation to Government support 12 months ago, or in 1965, is not necessarily the case now.  Where he thought he had up to 50 per cent of the votes in constituencies in the west of Ireland he created three-seat constituencies all over the place.  He knows that with something in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent of the votes in those areas he would get two out of three seats.</P>
    <P>Well, the Minister may think that it is good politics but is it fair play?  He may think it is good politics to abolish four-and five-seat constituencies where they do not suit him and substitute three-member constituencies where he would get two out of three seats.  I ask the Minister again whether he thinks it is fair or if he thinks it is what the people want.  It would be bad enough if he were to continue that all over the country.  He could put up the case for it and say that he believed that three-member constituencies gave you a more decisive result but, of course, he is not consistent because when he comes to places where he thinks the barometer would seem to indicate that his popularity is falling, in or around the city of Dublin, there is a different argument. The argument about decisive results holds good when you are in the west of Ireland but it ceases to hold water when you come to Dublin.  He proceeds to scrap completely three- and five-seat constituencies and to substitute eight four-member constituencies. Of course, he knows that with well below 50 per cent of the votes he can hold two out of four of these seats. If he gets that vote he can hold two of these seats in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Again, I say that that may appear to him to be slick business, to be good politics but is it fair play?  Is it accepting the decision of the people in the referendum?  In 1947 after the revision of the constituencies by Fianna Fáil there were no four-seat constituencies in Dublin; after the 1961 revision there <Col N="1246" /> were two four-seat constituencies and under the Bill which we are discussing the Minister proposes eight four-seat constituencies.  He could not have any more even if he tried because that is the very maximum.  We go from no four-seat constituencies in 1947 to two in 1961 and to eight in 1968 because the Minister knows that his vote is dropping and dropping dangerously and with much less than 50 per cent of of the votes he can get 50 per cent of the seats in or around the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is a totally different argument and a different approach when you go to the west.  The Minister still thinks that the people are gullible and with three-seat constituencies that he can get two out of three seats.  I do not think it will work.  I think the people will be disgusted, that they will see through it and that they will react in the same violent manner to this proposal as they reacted to the proposals on 16th October.  It is my business, however, to point out to the people what is being attempted and what the Minister has in mind.  In both the 1947 and the 1959 revisions 60 per cent of the constituencies outside Dublin were four- and five-seaters, now that percentage has been reduced to something around 30 per cent and you have two-thirds of the constituencies outside Dublin three-seaters.</P>
    <P>There was no evidence from the voting in the referendum that the people thought that the constituencies were too big.  That case was made by the Minister and by his Party to the best of their ability all over the country, that the constituencies were unwieldy and would have to become bigger.  I think the Minister told the people that there would be 11- and 12-member constituencies if they did not accept the electoral reform proposals last October.  He certainly said that there would be five-and six-seater constituencies and referred to one in which there would be 11 seats.  However, that did not terrify the people.  As a matter of fact, if the result of the referendum is to be accepted by the Minister the people want bigger constituencies instead of smaller ones, if they paid any attention <Col N="1247" /> at all to what the Minister and his colleagues said.  Yet we have these proposals to gerrymander or &ldquo;Bolander&rdquo; the constituencies by creating four-member constituencies where it suits him and three-member constituencies where he also thinks it suits him.  As I said, I think the people will not fall for that.  They will deal with it in their own wise way and win again just as they won before.</P>
    <P>If there was one principle that the Minister seemed to regard as sacred throughout the long drawn-out debate on the Third and Fourth Amendments here in this House and subsequently throughout the country it was the sanctity of county boundaries.  We were told by the Minister that county boundaries would have to be preserved at all costs and that we, on this side of the House, were doing violence to county boundaries and he was the champion of county boundaries.  That is why I say now that this Bill is an &ldquo;I-told-you-so&rdquo; act.  The Minister was, of course, committed to butchering county boundaries. He had told the people that.  He had told the House that.  He had broadcast that on every medium of communication in the country.  He was committed to it and, in drafting this measure, he set out to out-do himself.</P>
    <P>He has divided up nine counties into 17 areas, quite unnecessarily chucking parts of them into other counties.  That is nowhere more apparent than in the west of Ireland.  At all costs Donegal had to be preserved as two three-seaters. Donegal was one of the three counties in the Republic where the Minister saved his face in the referendum by the merest of whiskers.  The two constituencies in Donegal brought in a miserable surplus in favour of the Minister's proposal but, miserable as the surplus was, it was followed only by Clare and part of Galway.  Donegal had to be preserved at all costs, not in the interests of Donegal, mark you, but in the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party; and Leitrim, in pursuance of the terrible warning by the Taoiseach in Drumshanbo and the Minister here in this House, had to be driven off the political map, with the consent of <Col N="1248" /> every Fianna Fáil member of the Leitrim County Council.  Let it be known that they were up here in this House, sitting in the Gallery presiding at the wake of Leitrim, presiding at the obliteration of Leitrim from the political map in order to preserve the two constituencies in Donegal for the Minister for Local Government and his Party.  Could anything be more disgraceful? The worst feature of it is the fact that this was acquiesced in by every Fianna Fáil member of Leitrim County Council, including the newly nominated Senator, councillor, now Senator, Michael Gunn.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister can deny it, if he wishes. The Minister for Local Government dragged them in here and involved them in this butchery.  I may not be strictly in order in referring to them, but I at least have the excuse that I did not drag them into it.  It was the Minister for Local Government who involved them in this sordid, disgusting business.  So much for Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere is this butchery more apparent than in the west of Ireland. Donegal had to be saved because it stood by the Minister in the referendum.  Galway had to be saved, but Galway could not be relied on entirely because only West Galway came up trumps, with a majority of 62, I think, in the referendum.  East Galway could not be relied upon and so the Minister had to go into Clare to get an injection of Fianna Fáil blood, as he thought, to make East Galway safe.  These two examples will not deceive anybody.  These counties stood by the referendum proposals&mdash;Donegal, West Galway and Clare.  They had to be preserved in different ways to the <Col N="1249" /> best advantage of the Minister.  Leitrim was destroyed to preserve two constituencies in Donegal.  A bit of Clare was taken in to preserve three three-seaters in Galway.  The question then was how would they get another seat in Clare in which they had two out of four, notwithstanding the strength at any one time of their candidates in that constituency. The solution: reduce it to three in the hope that they will get two out of three.  I will leave it to any fairminded and impartial thinker to say whether that is electoral reform.  Is that fair revision?  Is it gerrymandering or &ldquo;Bolandering&rdquo;, in the best tradition of Senator Gerry of Massachusetts or of the Minister for Local Government? I will leave that to the House and the people to discern.</P>
    <P>I am dealing only with those things that stick out like a sore thumb.  Other speakers will go into more detail, but the most interesting little operation of all is the transfer of a piece of Westmeath in and around Athlone into Roscommon.  Again, this is quite unnecessary unless it is to try to injure a Fine Gael TD and consolidate the Minister for Education, and to insulate him against some of the dangerous statements he makes on national policy.  That is the sort of thing that has been happening.</P>
    <P>There were all sorts of threats.  The campaign on the referendum in Cavan was perfectly gentlemanly even if it was not too honest.  The Taoiseach did us the honour of opening the Fianna Fáil campaign in the courthouse, and he said what the boys had been saying, that Monaghan and Cavan would be linked together because it would suit Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  I think the Taoiseach got into a bit of trouble for referring to me in Cavan as Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  They thought it was a little bit familiar. Although it appeared that way in the national papers it was a little more formal in the local papers.</P>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach warned that Monaghan and Cavan would be linked together and that campaign was continued until the director of elections for the Minister's Party came <Col N="1250" /> from Cootehill to Cavan town and pulled up his motor car within 50 yards or so of the principal polling station on the day of the referendum and blared: &ldquo;Do not be driven into Monaghan.&rdquo;  That was the whole campaign from the Taoiseach down, but Monaghan and Cavan are still intact as counties.  I have nothing very serious to say about the shape of my constituency. I told the Minister during the campaign that he could do what he liked about it and that I would still be able to deal with him and it.</P>
    <P>They decided to have a proper &ldquo;go&rdquo; at Meath and they put about 5,500 people from Meath into Cavan.  The Minister talked about the sanctity of the county boundaries but he put 5,500 people from Meath into Cavan and he put another 5,000, including Deputy Denis Farrelly, into Monaghan. Instead of making one cut or one division in Meath he divided it between Monaghan and Cavan.  He put a bit of Louth into Monaghan and a bit of Meath into Monaghan and he put a hunk of Leitrim into Meath. I cannot call that anything but gross hypocrisy.  I do not think Deputy Cunningham was here when I was saying a few words about Donegal, the only county which had a majority in support of the referendum proposals and which had to be preserved at all costs.</P>

Something in the neighbourhood of 100,000 people were transferred from their native counties into other counties, and to a large extent unnecessarily, because Senator Garret FitzGerald, without the assistance of the individual members of the Fine Gael Party as the Minister had the assistance of the Fianna Fáil Party, and without the assistance of the Civil Service, was able to revise the constituencies in accordance with the Minister's interpretation of the Constitution by changing only six pieces of six counties and moving 40,000 people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back now to Constitutional issues, I must say I am very glad that the Minister for Local Government in his brief, for the first time since this marathon debate began in the spring of this year, made reference to the existence of the decision of the Supreme Court on the 1961 Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I have been trying for months past both in the House and outside it to get the Minister to see the importance of that decision, and to get him to accept that the decision of the Chief Justice, Mr. Conor Maguire, as quoted in the Minister's brief, is the law on constituency revision rather than the decision of Mr. Justice Budd. Mr. Justice Budd held that the 17 per cent tolerance as it was called was too much.  The Government did not appeal against that.  There was another Bill introduced when Mr. Budd decided that the tolerance was too much.  That is all he decided.  This Government did not appeal to the Supreme Court against that decision. They introduced another Bill with this 1,000 either way tolerance&mdash;five per cent&mdash;and they went back to the Supreme Court with that as they very wisely should and the Supreme Court of five judges, presided over by the Chief Justice, delivered their judgment on that measure.  I am very glad that the Minister for Local Government has put it on record <i>in toto</i> in his speech.  Members of this Party and <Col N="1254" /> of the Opposition generally are very often accused of misquoting.  I have quoted this several times and I was delighted this morning when the Minister began at the very same sentence of the Chief Justice's judgment as I have begun it time and time again.  If I may be permitted I will quote this judgment because in my opinion it is the law.  There are all sorts of scaremongering rumours going around the country that if the Minister for Local Government were to bring in a Bill here which went slightly above the five per cent tolerance of Mr. Justice Budd's judgment it could be held to be unconstitutional.  If in the interests of fair play the Minister wanted to have a six, seven, or eight per cent tolerance or even a 10 per cent tolerance why could he not, if it was fair, introduce a Bill on that basis and refer it to the Supreme Court the next day? What is wrong with that?  The Minister would at one time have said he would be making money for the Fine Gael lawyers but there are as many lawyers in the Minister's own Party now as there are in Fine Gael.  What would be wrong with that operation?</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice said:</P>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions.  The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.  The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have.  Its decision should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article.  This court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from <Col N="1255" /> what is called the national average is not permitted.  This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To justify the Court in holding that the subsection has been infringed it must, however, be shown that the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of Members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the sub-clause.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Court the divergencies shown in the Bill are within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>That, in my opinion, means that the five per cent tolerance contained in the Bill being dealt with by the Supreme Court was reasonable.  It also means that any other reasonable tolerance would be acceptable to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court would only interfere where the Oireachtas had manifestly, and presumably for ulterior and improper motives, set out to give an unfair tolerance.  I believe that would be the law rather than the decision of Mr. Justice Budd.  I have so argued since this debate began.  I am glad even at this stage that the Minister has put it on the record of this House.  I believe that a reasonable tolerance would be acceptable by the Supreme Court.  As the law stands, the tolerance of one-sixth or approximately 17 per cent proposed in the Third Amendment would not be accepted.  It was not accepted by Mr. Justice Budd. His decision was not appealed.  That could be changed by the Supreme Court.  Even as the law stands, we know five per cent would be accepted.  Mr. Justice Budd would not accept 17 per cent.  We know that something in between would be accepted.  The Minister, if his intention was to find a reasonable solution in deference to the wishes of the people as expressed in the referendum, should have proceeded on that basis, trying a slightly different tolerance if that was necessary and <Col N="1256" /> then submitting it to the Supreme Court and then there could be no question about it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this measure in a Second Reading way, I hope.  I have done my best to demonstrate to the House and to the country that the measure should never have been introduced by the Minister for Local Government, that he is not fit to introduce it.  I do not say &ldquo;not fit&rdquo; in an offensive way.  I say he is not fit because of his known commitment to another system, not fit because he has said in this House and elsewhere that the system which he is now trying to work is unworkable.  How could a man make a good job of something which he believed could not be done?  That is the task which Deputy Boland has taken on here as Minister for Local Government.  That is one of the reasons and the only honest reason, why it will fail.</P>
    <P>This is not a serious or an honest effort to revise constituencies in a fair or in an honest way.  It is the second attempt in 1968 to consolidate in power, by unfair electoral means, the Fianna Fáil Party.  As I have said to Deputy Cunningham, I do not believe the Minister will succeed in his objectives. He has succeeded in gerrymandering but he will not succeed in attaining the objects of his gerrymandering because, as I have said, the people will react in the next general election just as they reacted in the referendum. They will give their answer to the Minister and to Fianna Fáil.  They will demonstrate again that we are a fairminded people, that we believe in fair play, that we have no time for manipulation either of the Constitution or of the electoral law in a manner calculated, not to give fair representation, but to gerrymander and &ldquo;Bolander&rdquo; in order to confer unfair Party advantage on the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I have enough faith in the Irish people to know that they will not fall for that.  I have faith in the fairmindedness of the Irish people.  It was one theme that I suggested in the very beginning of the referendum campaign. I was convinced in my own mind and I said it on many occasions that if you could get one message across to the <Col N="1257" /> people the proposals would take an unmeciful hammering and that simple message was, &ldquo;It is not fair&rdquo;.  It was not used as a theme in any publicity but I believe it got over to the people and that is the reason why the scheme rejected the Government's proposal and that is the reason why the scheme of the Minister, geographically and numerically, to &ldquo;Bolander&rdquo; the constituencies of this country will fail at the next election, whenever it comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there was widespread astonishment and dismay throughout the country when, a few days after the outcome of the referendum, the Minister announced his intention of revising the constituencies by means of this electoral measure. The people felt that they had given the answer to this question in the referendum. &ldquo;Gerrymander&rdquo; was the word widely used in that campaign and the people gave back the answer by an overwhelming majority that they could not and would not entrust to this Minister the task of revising our constituencies. By rushing in hastily with this measure the Minister has flaunted the decision of the people in the referendum. The provisions in this Bill have been drawn up with such speed as gave rise in this House and in the country to the feeling that a general election must be imminent, so indecent was the haste, or, otherwise, that the proposals had already been drawn up in the knowledge and belief that the Government could not or would not win in the referendum issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pertinent to point out that the Minister, time and time again, warned us and warned the people that if they did not accept his proposals for the imposition of the Orange system of election here, the so-called straight vote, single-seat constituency and the gerrymander which went with it, the country, to use his own words, would be butchered.  Many times he said that the country would be butchered.  He also said that the country would be fragmented if his proposals were not accepted.  True to form, true to his word, he has done just that.  He has, of set purpose and deliberately, in a flagrant act of vindictiveness and revenge, butchered and carved up the constituencies <Col N="1258" /> in order to bring the greatest possible advantage to his own Party and do the greatest damage to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Anyone who doubts the veracity of these statements as to the <i>modus operandi</i> involved, which was designed to buttress the fading hopes of Fianna Fáil, need only look at the Government's proposals on the maps that have been produced where he will see the new constituencies outlined and the ingenious manner in which the Minister and his Party have carved up the west of Ireland, the city of Dublin, the city and county of Cork, Meath, Louth and, most of all, the annihilation of the County Leitrim.  In the process, the County Leitrim was raped and ceases to exist for electoral purposes.  This was a flagrant and despicable act of gerrymandering, the worst of its type ever to have happened south of the Border.  The entire population of that county has been thrown into three different counties.  The county ceases to exist as an entity.  Some 11,000 men and women is Leitrim are now thrown in with Roscommon, 11,000 more with Sligo and approximately 8,000 with South-West Donegal, and thus ends the existence of Leitrim as we know it.</P>
    <P>All this was done to buttress Fianna Fáil in respect of the falling off of population in the west of Ireland.  In the overall situation there is little radical change in respect of the loss of seats.  The numerical strength of this House is the same.  The West lost three seats in the process.  North Leinster, taking Cavan and Monaghan into account, lost a seat, whereas Dublin city and Dublin county both gained two seats.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the actual change in representation is relatively small, yet constituency boundaries have been altered considerably and to a shocking extent.  The lip service paid by the Minister to adhering to county boundaries has been ignored and violated flagrantly and whole counties have been fragmented, traditional county boundaries completely and utterly ignored.  We wish to prove that this was quite unnecessary.  The whole exercise was, as we anticipated, <Col N="1259" /> to extend the life of Fianna Fáil in this House.  Having failed in the referendum, immediately the results were known and seeing the devastating manner in which he had been defeated by the people of Ireland, the Minister decided in a fit of pique and revenge to go to town on them in this way.  This is his <i>modus operandi</i>, his last desperate effort to entrench his Party in power for a few more years.</P>
    <P>The Irish people already have demonstrated that they detest unfairness and injustice.  They detest anyone trying to slip it across them in an unfair way, and I believe they will react as violently to this proposal as they have reacted to the issues in the referendum, and the Minister and his party will find it will have the same disastrous result as they had on 16th October.</P>
    <P>There is no semblance whatever of fair play and justice involved in these proposals.  The matter of a commission to sit on electoral reforms, on the drawing up of county and constituency boundaries, is not adverted to in this measure.  We are entitled to ask why. There is no intention of allowing anyone to have a say in drawing up these new county boundaries except the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Deputies. They have been consulted individually and collectively and they have given their blessing and approval to these proposals for revising the constituencies. It has been done in the selfish political attitude of seeking first to consolidate themselves as individual Deputies in their areas and secondly, if possible, to secure additional seats.</P>
    <P>We have said there are other ways and means of dealing with the problem of revising the constituencies without adopting the ruthless manner of the Minister.  It has been demonstrated by other people who have taken an interest in this matter, apart altogether from politicians, that the job could have been done by the transfer of a much lesser territory.  It could have been done by affecting fewer counties and without involving so many thousands of people.  In fact, it has been demonstrated that the revision could take place and conform to <Col N="1260" /> the regulations under our Constitution by affecting merely 1 per cent of our population, whereas the Minister's proposition involves the transfer of some 17 portions of territory, affecting nine counties and involving 100,000 people.</P>
    <P>It is indiscriminate, injudicious, purely political.  The Minister for Local Government in this Bill demonstrated to the whole country the effect of his threat that, if they did not accept his proposals to abolish PR and give him the single-seat and the so-called straight vote, he would set himself up in this House as the head butcher and hatchet man.  He is the man who tried to put across the big lie in respect of the referendum issues.  The big lie failed and we now have a proposal which is essentially his but has the backing and approval of the backroom boys of Fianna Fáil, and this is their proposal in order to save their own necks and try to hang on to power in this House.</P>
    <P>There are so many aspects of this matter that one could speak on it for a very long time.  I feel certain that all Deputies in this House, especially those on the Opposition side, are only too anxious to come in here and express their views on what has happened nationally, and particularly on what is happening in respect of their own constituencies. That which is most significant about this carving up process is the utter disregard which the Minister has displayed for the preservation of the county boundaries, which he has purported in many statements here to regard as virtually sacrosanct.  This was made a big issue of in the referendum debate.</P>
    <P>I have said that Leitrim has been wiped out altogether.  Meath has been mutilated &mdash; divided into three or four parts.  Kildare has been carved up and reduced to a three-seat constituency. Clare has lost a very large slice of its territory to County Galway.  Roscommon and Cork have been affected and Louth has also been affected.</P>
    <P>It is evident to us, Sir, that the area about which the Fianna Fáil Party are primarily concerned and worried is the west of Ireland.  In order to maintain the number of seats in the west they have violated the boundaries of <Col N="1261" /> the western counties.  They have done violence to Leitrim, Galway and Roscommon.  There has been a breach of county boundaries here on a massive and unnecessary scale.  Over one-half of the population of Clare and one-sixth of the population of Roscommon have been added to Galway in order to bolster up the population of the west which is traditionally pro-Government. This mutilation has taken place.  By this despicable device the dying population of the west of Ireland in Galway, Mayo and Sligo has been increased, a population which was forced out under a Fianna Fáil Government.  They have manipulated the population trend so as to increase 148,000 to 173,000, and they have raised the number of seats in that area from seven to nine.</P>
    <P>It is important to note here that nine is a number which is divisible by three. Consequently, we get so many three-seat constituencies in this area.  All the constituencies on the west coast from North Donegal to South-West Cork are now distinctively three-seat constituencies. The <i>modus operandi</i> here, of course, is well known.  It has been demonstrated that, where the Government Party secure as little as 46 per cent, and in some instances as little as 43 per cent of the poll in a three-seat constituency, they can secure two out of the three seats.  This is the reason for the departure from the traditionally larger constituency, the four- or five-seat constituency.  By this manipulation and by the movement of the vote from one area to another they can bring off two seats out of three in each instance. Three-quarters of the constituencies in the country at large are now three-seat constituencies.  This is a substantial increase on the position that has obtained. The existing situation is that we have nine five-seaters.  Under this Bill those nine five-seaters will be reduced to two. In existing circumstances we have 12 four-seat constituencies.  That figure is now being increased to 14, an increase of two.  We have 17 three-seat constituencies and we know that in the new proposals that number is being increased out of all proportion to 26.</P>
    <P>This is being done primarily along the west coast in the areas where Fianna Fáil support has been traditionally strong.  The larger constituency <Col N="1262" /> with four and five seats has always been favoured, Sir, by adherents to proportional representation.  The larger constituency always gave the fairest results and tended in particular to favour minority representation where you had, say, five seats.  This is a movement away from true democracy, from proportional representation as it should be administered.  This is deliberate flouting of the wishes of our people as expressed in the referendum and a gradual movement towards curtailment of the five-seat constituencies existing in Dublin where Fianna Fáil know their support is waning rapidly.  Here, significantly enough, we have seen the reintroduction of four-seat constituencies because Deputy Boland knows that the best he can hope for in this city and its environs is to break even and get three seats out of the four&mdash; three seats would suit him, five seats would be out of the question.  They purposely chose four seats as the best means of securing the greatest possible number of Deputies in the Dublin area. These four-seat constituencies in Dublin then are designed to neutralise in very large measure the losses expected by the Government Party in Dublin in the next general election.</P>
    <P>The gerrymandering technique is written all over this proposal.  I have tried to demonstrate it in a factual way. But there is something more sinister behind it altogether.  Not only has this been done with a view to securing seats, not only has it regard to population at large and territory as such, but it has come down to personalities in large measure.  We all, as politicians, know the art of gerrymander, the cutting away of an area from which a Deputy draws most of his support and the transfer of that part of his constituency to another area where he or his Party is traditionally weak.  Boundaries, we know, can be drawn so as to eliminate competition between Parties, between personalities and between Deputies of the same Party and Ministers of the same Party.  It is clear from these proposals that that has been done, especially in the west of Ireland and in Dublin.</P>
    <P>These proposals, Sir, are so personal <Col N="1263" /> and so vindictively thought up that when certain constituencies were carved up it was done in the knowledge that the Deputy who represented that constituency was being deliberately set outside it.  It has been drawn up in other areas in such a way as to try, if at all possible, to throw two Deputies of the same Party together in the same constituency.  This has been deliberately done in Dublin.  A straight line has been drawn through the constituency of one of my Labour colleagues quite obviously for the purpose of forcing him to go to one side or the other.  In either case he would find himself fighting for his seat against one of his own colleagues in a three-seat constituency.  We can well appreciate the unlikelihood of any one Party securing two seats out of three.  It has been done in Mid-Cork and in North-East Cork.  It has been done in Longford-Westmeath and in Cavan&mdash; setting out deliberately to put certain members of the Opposition in serious difficulty and in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite correct when he said the country would be butchered.  He has certainly made a magnificent job of this proposal.  It is done clearly to gain the maximum advancement for his Party, to bolster them up individually and collectively in every county and in every constituency and to do the greatest possible amount of harm in the most unfair, unjust, despicable and personal way to the Members of the Opposition.  There is no question here of a commission, no question here of consultation with the Opposition, no question here of any semblance of fair play whatsoever. This is the prerogative of the Minister for Local Government and he is going to pay back the Irish people for not accepting his proposals in the referendum. Despite all our pleadings here for justice or fair play, I know we are wasting our sweetness on the desert air because we know that at the culmination of this debate the bells will ring, the vote will be held, the Fianna Fáil Deputies will march into that Lobby and they will vote &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; and by their existing numerical strength this Government plan for the revision of our constituencies will be put into <Col N="1264" /> operation.  There is nothing that we in this House or in this country can do about it but the Irish people have already demonstrated that they are a commonsense people.  Mere commonsense prevailed in the referendum. They are a people who hate untruth. injustice or unfairness of any kind and I believe that they will give back the answer to Fianna Fáil in all these constituencies.</P>
    <P>Imagine, Sir, the sense of outrage which the people of Leitrim must feel at the rape of their county.  Is there any one of them, however ardent a supporter of Fianna Fáil he may be, who could vote Fianna Fáil after this despicable trick?  They have been wiped off the electoral map.  They have been used as voting fodder to buttress the fading hopes of Fianna Fáil in South-East Donegal, in Sligo and in Roscommon. The Leitrim people are the fodder through whom Fianna Fáil votes are to be secured to maintain their stranglehold on the west of Ireland.  I prophesy that the people of Leitrim from their sense of indignation and natural outrage will give back the answer to the Minister and give him another &ldquo;No&rdquo; in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>What they have tried to do in Louth and Meath also cries out to high heaven for justice.  In an obvious attempt to put one of my colleagues in trouble &mdash; a vain hope &mdash; and also a respected member of the Fine Gael Party, you butchered Meath and Louth at five different points and moved not one section of the population but five. It was quite unnecessary.  It is quite obvious that the purpose here is to get down to personalities, to try to eliminate certain personalities in the Opposition. Again, it will fail.</P>
    <P>I pity the people of Clare, the county of &ldquo;The Chief&rdquo; himself, ardent supporters of the Party.  Their population is being reduced by nearly half, because of their loyalty to the Party, to bolster up portion of Galway.  The people in these counties are very wise, intelligent and knowing.  Some people thought it could be &ldquo;put across&rdquo; them on the 16th October, that the big lie would succeed.  It did not succeed and it will not succeed now.  The men that Fianna Fáil deliberately set out to get out of this House will, I prophesy, be put in <Col N="1265" /> with more support than ever by the people in their respective areas because it is traditional with our people through their ingrained love of fair play that they will not do the thing you want them to do and will not see a man so flagrantly unfairly treated.  They will put back the men the Government want to put out.</P>
    <P>This happened in my own constituency of South Tipperary in 1961. At that time constituencies were carved up with the approval of sitting members of Fianna Fáil and it was recounted to me afterwards by a Member of this House how the gerrymander was set about in South Tipperary and West Waterford.  The specific intention was to make it impossible for the return of Deputy Kyne in County Waterford by reducing Waterford County from a four-seater to a three-seat constituency and to nail down my chances as an up-and-coming representative in South Tipperary, one who had contested the previous general election and was narrowly defeated for a seat in 1957.  The dual purpose was to fill three out of four seats for Fianna Fáil, as they then were, in South Tipperary and fill two seats out of three for them in County Waterford.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Look at the returns. In the general election of 1961 you will see what happened in respect of the men that Fianna Fáil sought to put out in that gerrymander at that time.  You will see that Deputy Kyne was returned at the head of the poll to represent County Waterford and I, a comparatively young man at the time, came into this House for the first time at the head of the poll in my constituency of South Tipperary.  So, the Minister should consult some of the old diehards of his Party and he will find that, like himself, however arrogant and ruthless they may have been in their time, they found that you cannot do these things to the Irish people and get away with it.  I prophesy that in every instance the men Fianna Fáil try to put out will be put in by the people, and that the Labour Party will grow in strength and influence until they can form a Government.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the people of my constituency to return me time and <Col N="1266" /> time again irrespective of the devices which the Minister or his Party may use against me and irrespective of the obstacles that will be put in the way. In every area where it is tried, gerrymandering will fail and inevitably in the natural evolution, Labour will make progress until they become the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the position in Westmeath. I submit that the operation of detaching Athlone district from Westmeath is utterly unjustified since 59,000 people are affected who need not be so affected.  In normal circumstances it is quite unnecessary to cede this portion of Westmeath.  There are some 59,000 people affected in eight sections who need not be affected and it is contended that the whole process could be carried out with fairness and justice without affecting more than 20,000 people.  That has been demonstrated not by one, but by a number of personalities in this country.</P>
    <P>There has been three times as much disturbance as was actually necessary in order to achieve the aims of Fianna Fáil in Meath and Louth.  My colleague, Deputy Tully, will have a lot to say about that at a later stage.  It is contended that only 8,500 people will be affected so as to bring County Louth and County Meath up to the required standard laid down in the Constitution in respect of Members. Instead of that, there are six separate areas affected.  Six areas have been butchered in Counties Louth and Meath affecting more than 22,000 people.  A large portion of North Cork has been detached and is now being added to mid-Cork.  This proposal, too, is quite unnecessary and is designed solely on a selfish political basis to try to weaken Fine Gael and Labour in these two constituencies.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the actual revision of constituencies which I have referred to at some length this Bill in its Short Title states that it is &ldquo;An Act to fix the number of members of Dáil Éireann and to revise their constituencies and to amend the law relating to the election of such members.&rdquo; I do not know, a Cheann Comhairle, if I am entitled to comment <Col N="1267" /> on that aspect of the Bill &mdash; the law relating to the election of such Members.  The Chair, most probably, will be aware that amendments have been tabled for the Committee Stage in the names of my colleagues Deputies Dunne, Tully, Corish and myself and I am not certain as to whether I may, at this stage, advert to these changes which we desire except perhaps to comment briefly on them.</P>

      <P>Very good, Sir.  I have said as much as I wish to say on the Bill.  My colleagues and indeed all Opposition Members are naturally waiting an opportunity to ventilate their views on the Bill.  A certain amount of deep anxiety has been caused in the country among our people by the fact that, irrespective of their will so clearly demonstrated in the recent referendum, anyone, any Minister or indeed the Government, can still continue to flaunt their wishes and to disregard their views by doing the very thing they deliberately set out to vote against.  The matter of conceding to this Minister in particular the right to gerrymander or to interfere in any way with our constituencies&mdash; and I do not wish to be disrespectful in any way&mdash;has caused great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister by his own actions in this House and outside it has won for himself the reputation of being a man of arrogance.  He demonstrated during his leadership of the campaign here for <Col N="1269" /> the abolition of PR that he was a man who lusted after political power and who would stop at nothing to secure it.  He has demonstrated his intentions once again in this Electoral Bill.  It contains nothing just or fair or right and, therefore, it is condemned by the Labour Party.  In the next general election, by which time it will be implemented, it will be condemned by the mass of the Irish people and the very men whom this Minister and his Party are seeking to put out of this House will come back in greater numbers than ever before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed one accepts the necessity for the introduction of this Electoral Bill to revise the constituencies in order to conform to the requirements of the Constitution.  I do not envy the Minister for Local Government his job, nor do I expect the Members of the Opposition or, indeed, any Member of the House to be entirely satisfied with what he will do.  Deputies in this House have a natural regard for their own wellbeing, and this always appears to be their first consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitutional requirements are clearly set down.  One of the requirements is that there shall not be less than three seats per constituency, and you can have your pick after that as to what size your constituency can be. In some people's minds it is largely a matter of opinion as to what is convenient, but the Minister has to make his recommendations and introduce legislation.  The Minister had a great opportunity of knowing the wishes of the people and their regard for multi-seat constituencies, county boundaries and natural geographical barriers.  By and large, it can be said that none of those things greatly worried the people at all, and they decided to retain proportional representation.  But PR is a difficult thing to understand in electing a Government.  I believe you could have a constituency of 144 Deputies, but this would be rather cumbersome with probably 300 names on a ballot paper.  Again you could have a constituency for each of the four provinces but this would also mean a lot of names on the ballot paper.  You could have constituencies with lesser numbers, <Col N="1270" /> but the minimum is three for each constituency.</P>
    <P>On the 9th October this year, just about a week before the referendum, Deputy P.A. O'Donnell was in Sligo debating the issues involved in the referendum.  He said it was his considered opinion that the wishes of the people could be met and fairly met by three-seat constituencies.  He felt that four-seaters would not be acceptable. In considering this matter the Minister naturally has borne all these things in mind as to what would be reasonable, workable and administratively feasible. I know he did not expect, nor do I expect, Members of the Opposition to say they are happy.  However, it is nice to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick saying he is happy with Cavan as a three-seater and to hear Deputy Treacy, as a spokesman for the Labour Party, saying he was happy, but they go on to say that nearly everybody else is unhappy.</P>
    <P>I know the west of Ireland reasonably well, and the creation of ten three-seat constituencies strikes me as being fair and reasonable.  There has been no more breaching of boundaries than need have been adopted and the least of the evils has been accepted.  In the 1966 Census Donegal had a population of 108,000, but this certainly does not give it sufficient population for six Deputies, and there are too many for five.  Something had to be done with part of the population there.  It was the same with Sligo, with a population of 51,000, which is not sufficient for three seats but too many for anything else to be done with it, three being the minimum.</P>
    <P>Leitrim, beside it, has a population of 30,500.  It is true you could put Sligo and Leitrim together and come up with four seats for the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, but then what could we do with this little bit in Donegal where there is a surplus population of 12,000 or 13,000?  Under the ruling of Mr. Justice Budd something has to be done for these people; they cannot be left without representation.  This is a most difficult problem; we have to start thinking whether to make a five-seat or a four-seat constituency or what to do with it.  You could take a part of Sligo and a part of Leitrim, add them to <Col N="1271" /> Donegal and make two three-seaters out of them.  What have you left then? Taking a bit of Roscommon, we have Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim in the one constituency, and Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  Alternatively, we could consider the possibility of Roscommon and Leitrim being combined and Sligo being added to Mayo.</P>
    <P>Mayo has a population of 115,000 or 116,000 and why not preserve it if we can?  We can reasonably accommodate six Deputies there, and it has two constituencies.  Now, there are as many approaches to this problem as opinions. Somebody had to make a decision and the Minister has done so.</P>
    <P>In Sligo-Leitrim we did not have sufficient population for four Deputies and consequently we were reduced to three.  It is regrettable in some cases that Leitrim appears to have been butchered but its geographical location and, indeed, the desire of the Minister to leave as many counties intact as possible left Leitrim in a fairly bad position.  Leitrim with a population of 30,000 in order to make it a constituency would have to have 26,000 to 30,000 more added to it.  This population would have to come from Sligo, Donegal or possibly from Cavan. Mountain and other barriers which intervene would make this unworkable.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the matter of the creation of three-seat constituencies. Arguments are advanced that Clare has been butchered and also that Galway has been butchered or, if you like, has been kept intact by the creation of a three-seat constituency.  Galway is intact as two constituencies.  There are two three-seat constituencies.  Clare is intact as two constituencies, one a three-seat constituency.  There are surplus areas in both counties and about the only way you can deal with that is to make those areas into another three-seat constituency.  Therefore, we have this other constituency comprised of part of Clare and part of Galway.</P>
    <P>In Sligo we have been part of the Leitrim constituency for many years but with the decline in population boundaries are changing.  They have to be changed this year but I can see in another four or five years time there <Col N="1272" /> will have to be a revision again in many constituencies.  The tragedy, as I see it, is the loss of three seats in the west of Ireland and a gain of four seats in the city of Dublin.  This is the real tragedy.  The Constitution is there to ensure that this form of representation is maintained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the tolerance of five per cent on which Mr. Justice Budd ruled some time ago. I do not know to what the Deputy was referring when he spoke about this or whether he meant that in the west of Ireland we could have a Deputy for 18,000 rather than 19,000 or 20,000.  Some authorities say that five per cent is reasonable and other authorities say that 17 per cent is too much.  The Deputy thought that 10 per cent as an in-between figure would be reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is always an argument about what is reasonable.  I want to say this much.  Where there is a large area of territory heavily populated, and the tolerance reasonable and fair, that area, having regard to its size, would not be too wide of the margin even at 17 per cent, 18 per cent or 20 per cent.  However, that decision was put to the people and they rejected it out of hand.  This position will keep recurring over the years and we will get nobody who is ever prepared to agree on it.  After every election you have the Deputy who lost his seat blaming the changing of constituencies for that loss, irrespective of how they are drawn.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Treacy say that Deputy Kyne came in here in the teeth of a deliberate attempt to exclude him.  It is nice to hear of somebody who came in, as Deputy Kyne did, where there was some kind of deliberate attempt to exclude him because he probably is the type of candidate who got the support of his constituents. Any Deputy standing for Dáil Éireann is prepared to accept the judgement of the people.  Frankly, I do not know, or never knew, how you know what area is particularly good or what area is particularly bad.  I am not a wizard in this particular field but apparently there are people who profess to know what is in the mind of the <Col N="1273" /> voter or how he will vote.  I have never been able to employ the great knowledge they seem to possess so that in relation to any townland or any street in a town or area in a city you can draw the line this way or that and improve or disimprove your vote.  I have never been able to figure that out, especially in a multi-seat constituency embracing a wide area.</P>
    <P>I expect it is reasonable for a man in his own area who has the regard of his people to feel that he would get a large personal vote.  This will always be the case irrespective of what political Party the person belongs to but how you can divide areas to reduce the opportunity of anybody getting in is something I cannot see.  If a Deputy is a Member of this House and goes before the people he will be returned if the people want him.</P>
    <P>It is true that there must be changes under our electoral system.  Under the Constitution there are bound to be changes.  You cannot have it otherwise. I know it is a disappointment to a Member of this House who sees he has lost an area he may have looked after fairly well and finds that 10,000 or 15,000 of the population are suddenly gone from him.  This is one of the points which were advanced in the argument to bring about single-seat constituencies but all of those things were set at nought.  People said quite clearly they liked their particular TD and they liked to have their own TD and if they liked him they did not want to get rid of him.  People also told me they liked an alternative TD to keep their own particular TD in order.  In this redrawing of the constituencies in particular areas of the west of Ireland complicated arguments have been advanced by the Opposition about the breaching of the constituencies.  There has not been as much breaching as the Opposition alleged.  They referred to Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway and said they were attacked.  A portion of Roscommon has gone to make up a seat in Galway-Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he take 12,000 or 14,000 out of Donegal?  The base of Leitrim, at 30,000, was very small on which to try to build a constituency without carving into the surrounding counties to an extraordinary degree&mdash;a very difficult exercise for anybody.</P>
      <P>The creation of additional constituencies, bringing the total of 42, goes a long way towards bringing about neater constituencies.  I think that, ultimately, we shall get down to all three-seat constituencies in this part of the country.  I think the best that could be done was done in the city of Dublin.  Under our Constitution, the minimum is a three-seat constituency. That makes for somewhat closer contact between the representatives and the electorate.</P>
      <P>It would be delightful if the Minister had been able to bring in a layout of constituencies that would suit everybody but I doubt very much if he could do so.  The late Deputy Norton, when discussing the last measure of this kind to come before this House, referred to the crazy system that led to the butchering of constituencies.  I think he used the word &ldquo;butchering&rdquo;.  So long as we have proportional representation, so long as we have this minimum representation, we shall have this &ldquo;butchering&rdquo;, if you like to use that word, and this disregard for county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the regard people have for county boundaries in some ways.  I know full well the pride County Leitrim has in its county boundaries <Col N="1275" /> and how hard they resist any attempt that Leitrim should be merged with any other county.  I think that spirit is evident in nearly every county in the country.  Certainly the ideal of preserving county boundaries had not any impact so far as the results of the recent referendum are concerned.  It was inevitable that the constitutional position should bring about the present position, in the light of the results of the referendum.</P>
    <P>This Bill was inevitable.  It could not be delayed.  It must go through this House as quickly as possible and become law as quickly as possible so that, at the longest, in 18 months time the country will be in a position to hold a general election in accordance with the terms and conditions of Article 6 of the Constitution which is to the effect that the constituencies must be drawn as nearly as practicable to 20,000 persons per Deputy and not fewer than three seats per constituency. Whilst I hate to see changes in constituencies, I am afraid it is inevitable that we shall have them and continue to have them.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister for Local Government the job which confronts him.  He will please nobody and I do not think he will please himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever one may think or say of the Minister for Local Government one must agree that he is a very thorough and hard-working Minister.  I think he has told us on occasion here that he has burned the midnight oil in the course of his duties as Minister.  For that reason, there is to me a sort of sinister ring to a reference the Minister made to my constituency in the course of introducing this Bill. He said, in a most casual sort of way, that he should mention that the population figures quoted in the memorandum for the two Cork city constituencies are still tentative.  He went on to say that, because of what he termed certain practical difficulties, it may not be possible to arrive immediately at definitive figures.  I should be very glad to know and my constituents, the inhabitants of the present constituency of Cork city and of the two proposed <Col N="1276" /> constituencies of Cork city north and Cork city south, would be very glad to know, first, what practical difficulties beset the Minister in respect of this area at this time.  I should like to know, too, why the population figures quoted in the memorandum for the constituency must at this stage be tentative.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Minister does his homework.  He is a hard-working Minister. One would think that when the Minister is introducing a Bill&mdash;and dealing with the constituency from which comes the Head of the Government&mdash;he would be able to put before the House the exact figures for the constituencies into which he intends to carve the present Cork city constituency. As Cork city has an atmosphere of enigma about it at this stage, can the Minister tell us at what stage the riddle will be solved in regard to solid proposals for Cork city?  I say this particularly because the inhabitants of the constituency of Cork city have very sad memories of the way in which they were treated by Fianna Fáil Governments in regard to constituency butchering.  On the last occasion the constituencies were carved up&mdash;and plainly in a spirit of gerrymandering which had no regard whatsoever for a portion of the constituency which, whilst it was then in the county, always looked upon itself as part of Cork city constituency&mdash;the Minister and his Party proceeded to carve up the areas of Blackrock and Douglas in such a way that an area of the city, within a quarter of a mile of the City Hall, was shifted into a constituency which sprawled itself away down through County Cork and on to the borders of County Kerry so that people actually living in an area which is portion of the Cork city borough were completely disfranchised so far as Cork city itself was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they wanted to find a TD they had to hie themselves off to the country, the nearest TD being at Bandon or in Macroom.  The result of all this was that no matter how hard Deputy Creed, my colleague, might work it was terribly difficult for those residents of Blackrock and Douglas to have ready access to him and I, who had been working for them since I first came into this House <Col N="1277" /> in 1954, and, indeed, since 1948 when I first stood for election to this House, found I had to deal and very gladly dealt with many of their problems.  The people of Cork have not forgotten all this, particularly the people in Blackrock and Douglas.  They are fully aware that the Minister and his Party will have the most cynical disregard for their rights if their rights clash with the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party, because the reason Blackrock and Douglas were pushed out of mid-Cork was that they were very notably Fine Gael in their sympathies and that disturbed the balance of Fianna Fáil's power in Cork city constituency with the result that the people returned two Fine Gael Deputies, two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Labour Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party stopped this by the way in which they gerrymandered the Cork city constituency.  That is why I say it would certainly be in ease of the peace of mind of the people in Cork if the Minister would confide his intentions in respect of the two new constituencies of Cork city south and Cork city north.  I must say that I was not impressed by what I heard of the Minister's speech and of what I heard from Deputy Gallagher subsequently. The Minister referred to the judgement of the Supreme Court which, of course, has gone down in legal and constitutional history.  He quoted part of the judgement of the Supreme Court in relation to this matter of subsection 3º of section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution where it said:</P>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and, of course, that is so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>And that is so.</P>
    <P>It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>We were tired during the recent <Col N="1278" /> referendum campaign listening to the Minister, his fellow Ministers and backbenchers doing reverence to county boundaries all over the country, kneeling in front of them in admiration and saying: &ldquo;We must get rid of PR because it outrages this very important thing to which we should all do reverence, the county boundary.&rdquo;  They wept over it and expressed the most sincere concern up and down the country, weekend after weekend.  They said that it was dreadful that the Opposition Party should even think of opposing a system of voting which would enable the Government to maintain the county boundaries.</P>
    <P>What has happened since then?  In his speech today the Minister said that the Oireachtas is in the position that it may have regard to a variety of factors and he names a number of these factors.  He indicates that these are some of the factors which he has taken into consideration in preparing this Bill&mdash;that there should not be a divergence of over 1,000 from the national average and that there will not be &ldquo;too great a disparity in the value of the votes to be cast in different areas,&rdquo;<i>et cetera</i>.  However, there was not a word about the county boundaries.  The same reverence was no longer due, evidently, to this natural boundary known as the county boundary.  The Minister alleged that it was necessary to increase the number of three-seat constituencies from 17 to 26, to increase the number of four-seaters from 12 to 14 and to reduce the number of five-seaters from five to two.  Because the Minister has decided to do this and because he has decided to reduce drastically the number of five-seat constituencies and because he has decided to change the geographical position of four-seaters, what has happened? The famous county boundaries are being broken left, right and centre by the Minister and by the Government who so lately were doing reverence to them.</P>
    <P>To do what the Minister has in mind he has to transfer 17 pieces of nine counties and almost 100,000 inhabitants. Could the Minister explain why he has changed his attitude of reverence to the county boundaries? <Col N="1279" /> Does the Minister ask the House and the country to accept that this was the only manner in which he could have adhered to the other factors which he enumerated in the course of his speech?  If he does then he has to reckon with a very interesting article and map which Senator Garret FitzGerald had published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of November the 19th. In the course of this he showed, having regard to all the factors to which the Minister referred, that he could under a different scheme of redrafting of the constituencies alter them so as to involve changes only of six pieces of six counties and fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would explain how his mind did not move along the same lines as the mind of Senator Garret FitzGerald.  I am not tying the Minister to the map or to the suggestions contained in the article; there are various other ways in which the Minister could have approached this if he was sincerely approaching the matter and influenced by the factors to which he referred today and influenced only by the well-being and the convenience of the electorate generally. I do not believe he has done this.  I do not believe he has approached this legislation in that spirit.  I do not believe the Party he represents has approached this legislation in that spirit.  The Minister has approached this in a coldly analytical, political frame of mind.  It does not matter to him who is inconvenienced or who will be disfranchised.  It does not matter to him that all the county boundaries will be breached, that all the townland boundaries will be breached, that all the rivers will have to be crossed, so long as he can contrive to the best of his ability to ensure that, despite their waning popularity and their waning support, the Fianna Fáil Party will come back into this House in force after the next general election.  It is for that reason he breaches these boundaries and does all the things I have enumerated.</P>
    <P>He does these things because he wants to get away from the four- and five-seat constituencies where they do <Col N="1280" /> not suit him, namely, outside the Dublin areas.  Up to now 60 per cent of the constituencies outside Dublin were four- or five-seaters.  Now this proportion is reduced to 32 per cent. If the Minister does not like four- and five-seater constituencies one can imagine him daubing the map all over the place with three-seater constituencies and saying: &ldquo;This is the ideal type of constituency.&rdquo;  But that is not so.  Suddenly, when the Minister approaches the confines of Dublin, a change comes over the spirit of his dreams and he is all for four-seater constituencies.  He suddenly finds a crying Government need for four-seater constituencies and now, in Dublin, you have eight four-seater constituencies where, in 1961, there were only two.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning attempted to justify this.  I do not accept his alleged justifications and I do not believe, for one moment, that the people of the Dublin area will accept his justifications either.  Anybody with half an eye in his head will readily recognise that what the Minister and his Party are trying to do is to neutralise the swing against his Party shown in these constituencies on every possible occasion that presented itself since 1965 when the Irish people were given an opportunity to express their views on the Government&mdash;the Presidential election, the referendum, the local elections&mdash;all these showed the writing on the wall for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Party now are hoping by this Electoral Bill to neutralise this swing away from Fianna Fáil.  I do not believe the Minister will succeed in his designs.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House much longer, except to express the belief already expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick, speaking on behalf of my Party, and by Deputy Treacy, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, that, do what they may, the Fianna Fáil Party cannot escape the anger of the Irish people.  The Irish people are in full cry after them and, no matter how the Minister may hope to re-define territories, no matter how he may allot three seats here, four seats there and five seats somewhere else, the Irish <Col N="1281" /> people will negative everything he tries to do to stop them getting the Government they desire.</P>
    <P>Whilst I deplore the spirit in which the Minister and his Party have approached this matter, whilst I deplore the ruthlessness of what they are trying to do, whilst I still await the Minister's explanation as to the practical difficulties which he alleges exist in my own city, difficulties he has not yet ironed out, I am quite certain that this Bill, if it becomes an Act, will fail in its primary object of defeating the desire of the Irish people to rid themselves of the shackles of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now perfectly obvious that the Minister has spent not weeks or months but, I would venture to suggest, even years on the preparation of this Bill.  This Bill, to my mind, is simply one of a number of alternatives which were designed in the Custom House over a lengthy period with the object of meeting any situation which might result from the referendum, the referendum which this Government decided to hold a considerable time ago.  It seems to me the first incubation of the notion of a referendum must now be seen to have taken shape with the superficially innocuous proposal and, on the surface, beneficial proposal, made two years ago or more by Deputy Lemass when he was Taoiseach.  I refer to the setting up of a committee to review the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become perfectly apparent in the meantime that the primary purpose of that committee was a feint designed to probe, as it were, the feelings and the convictions of the Opposition Parties in regard to alterations in the Constitution, alterations such as were proposed in the referendum.  Over that period of two years it is reasonable to deduce that there has been in progress in the Minister's Department a close study by the Minister's officials of the lie of the land and the disposition of voting strengths throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It is fairly obvious now that plans were prepared to meet any eventuality.  The celerity with which the Minister was able to produce this Bill following on <Col N="1282" /> the, for him, disastrous defeat in the referendum is further proof of that.</P>
    <P>To me the outstanding feature of the Bill is the fact that it is a revenge on the Dublin area.  Anyone who looks at the Explanatory Memorandum will see quite clearly that the Dublin city and county districts, which contain so great a proportion of the total population of the country, running in the direction of one-third of that population, are so badly interfered with as to make it perfectly obvious that they are being discriminated against by the Minister.  Dublin constituencies are required in all cases to produce hundreds of votes in respect of every seat in excess of the national average, which is set out at 20,028 votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a slip of the tongue.  I will come to that.  I am glad the Minister reminded me of that. It is very important.  He has been making specious arguments on that line. There is no reference whatsoever in the Constitution to the number of voters on the register.  The Minister knows that and drags that matter up in all his speeches to try to justify what he terms tolerance but what is discrimination of the most obvious kind.  He has tried to drag the number of voters on the register into every speech he has made as if it were relevant.  Of course, it is not relevant.  As the Minister has challenged me I will go through each <Col N="1283" /> of the Dublin constituencies, with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. There are ten of them.  I will indicate the number of population which must exist in Dublin and does exist and which is required by the Minister to justify each individual seat.</P>
      <P>In North County Dublin the deviation from the national average population per Deputy is 379.  In South County Dublin it is 992, almost 1,000. In Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown it is 893, near enough to 1,000.  In Dublin Central it is 970, practically 1,000.  In Dublin North-Central it is 952.  In Dublin North-East it is 937.  In Dublin North-West it is 974.  In Dublin South-Central it is 963.  In Dublin South-East it is 950.  In Dublin South-West it is 973.  Those are the Dublin constituencies. You can see the plus sign marked in front of them all in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>That means that that many voters in excess of the national average are required in Dublin to secure a Dáil seat.  It is a matter of interest which I want to draw to the attention of the House and of the people outside.  In East Mayo for instance a Deputy can be elected for 19,183 members of the population.  In Dublin South-East the figure is 20,978, a difference per Deputy of 1,795, and a difference in a three-seat constituency of 5,385.  This makes it perfectly obvious that the exercise the Minister is engaged in is a revenge operation on Dublin to reduce its representation so far as he possibly can within the terms of the Budd judgment and of the law as it stands&mdash; and to bend it so far as he can possibly bend it&mdash;and to rob the people of Dublin city and county to the maximum degree of their full right to democratic representation in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Ireland spoke in the most affirmative way possible.  It is possibly true to say that never at any time in the history of the country, let alone in the history of the State, was there such a majority of voters in favour of the single proposition of rejecting the Government's proposal. The people of the country said very definitely that they wanted to retain proportional representation.  They also <Col N="1284" /> said they would have none of this nonsense the Minister and his colleagues were talking, in which they misnamed tolerance by an abuse of the word and an abuse of the English language.  The people spoke in a loud and clear voice on that issue.  The Minister is not content to accept that. He proceeds to try to deflect and circumvent the will of the people so far as he possibly can.  This is one of the methods by which he seeks to do that&mdash;by imposing in the Dublin areas the requirement that the basis of population must be considerably greater in each constituency to return Dáil Deputies than it is elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>I must say in all honesty that, for the life of me, I cannot see any way in which politicians in Ireland today can determine, except perhaps in isolated instances, how areas will vote and how counties will vote, particularly as we are now living in a historic moment of political change, which has been brought about by the arrival on the register of such a large number of young people who are taking a lively interest in the political scene and who are exercising their votes for perhaps the first or the second time, and also in view of the fact that we have the powerful influence of the new medium of communication, television, to which a lot of this political stirring and activity and consciousness is attributable.</P>
    <P>I do not see how it is possible today for any Party to say with certainty where their support will lie, so I am forced back to the conclusion that, in doing what he has done in relation to the Dublin constituencies, the Minister is motivated by the narrowest and most damaging and malignant of political ideas, that is, to get his own back on the people of Dublin city and county for not having fallen in with the foolish, nonsensical, irresponsible and irrelevant proposition which he forced upon the country against the will of the country, against the advice of Dáil Éireann and, I am quite certain, against the advice of many of the older hands in the Fianna Fáil Party who have been dealing with public affairs for a long time.  I am not referring to Members of this Dáil, but <Col N="1285" /> to those down through the organisation who must have accumulated a good deal of wisdom in the matter of the manipulation of votes since that Party were first established.  However, he went on and, as we know, and as he knows now, he wasted the time of the whole country and, indeed, God knows how much money was wasted in that effort. It is impossible to calculate.  Some people mentioned £100,000.  That is a gross under-estimate of what was wasted.  It was nearer £1,000,000 if the whole story were told and the whole picture looked at.</P>
    <P>All that is &ldquo;water under the bridge&rdquo; now.  You would think that he would have taken a lesson from that, but he did not.  He appears to be absolutely impervious to any kind of lesson and to have his mind set on proceeding along his own road.  If the Irish people will not go with him, he is going that way in any event.  It seems to be perfectly manifest that the Irish people are not going with him.  The Budd judgment, which he sought to criticise in his attacks on the Constitution&mdash;a Constitution brought in by the Fianna Fáil Party and supported by the will of the people&mdash;is a splendid production. Indeed, I think it is not too late to pay tribute to Mr. Budd's judgment. I do not know of any piece of work by any court which is so painstaking, so analytical and so objective.  I do not know very much about the work in any courts, thank God, but so far as my limited experience goes few works of that kind will compare with the remarkable end product of the labours of Mr. Justice Budd in this matter.</P>
    <P>It would have been as well for the Minister if he had taken his lead from Mr. Budd and had not gone messing about as he did with the Constitution to his own detriment and to that of his Party&mdash;not that I have any great goodwill to spare for his Party.  The Minister in the course of his introductory remarks&mdash;I suppose in his case we have to describe a script of only ten pages as mere introductory remarks, because we have seen his performance on earlier occasions when he set up a record in boring the Oireachtas for seven hours at a stretch, all of which contributed to his eventual downfall and the collapse of his efforts&mdash;made <Col N="1286" /> great play of the question of the number of registered voters in each area. He talked about the number of registered voters before the referendum.  He talked about the number of registered voters in Donegal, for instance.  In the course of this document today he talks about the number of registered voters in Dublin city.  He made the point that there were a greater number of registered voters in certain areas of the west than in the Dublin area.  What does that really mean?  It means that there were more adults or people over 21 on the register of voters in certain western constituencies he was referring to and that, despite the fact that there was a very much greater population list in Dublin, there were fewer voters registered.  It simply means the west is denuded of children and young people under 21 years of age.  Is not that what that adds up to?  It is not something he should be boasting about. He knows very well, or he must know as well as I do, that there is a colossal population of young children and adolescents in this city and particularly in the suburbs of this city.  Does he think time will stop still for these and that they will never be relevant for consideration as voters?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party hope to bring about a situation where people will have votes at 18 years of age, but, pending that, does the Minister consider that because a register shows a certain number of votes this year it is never going to change or increase? Surely this is completely irrelevant.  The Constitution of the country makes no comment whatever about the register of voters and the number of people on the register.  What is the point of dragging it in here?  Does he want to sidestep or evade the provisions of the Constitution in this regard?  Obviously, he does.  What sticks in his gullet is that the Constitution plays down the argument that the number of Dáil seats must be related to the population.  The Minister's argument, therefore, is totally false.  It is based on the proposition that Dáil seats should be related to the number of people on the register. If that were accepted, it would simply mean that we might very well have to change the constituencies, not after every Census, but every year because <Col N="1287" /> there is a new register compiled every year.  There could easily be a convulsive change in the numbers on the register as between one year and another.  The whole balance whereby Dáil seats are apportioned throughout the country could be completely upset if the matter were based on the register of voters as distinct from the population.</P>
    <P>This matter is one which was gone into in depth in the first instance by those who concern themselves with formulating proposals for the representation of the people in the Dáil.  It was finally decided very properly and logically that Dáil seats must be related to the population and not to the number on the register.  The situation today is that, thanks to the good sense of the people of Ireland, and even in the more limited sense to the good sense of those on the voters' register, the Constitution remains and these provisions remained in spite of the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party to sabotage a democratic ingredient of that instrument. In spite of their conspiracy, which was hatched over a long period, and in spite of their squandering of a great amount of State money and of other money subscribed by their wealthy supporters in the most expensive form of advertisement and propaganda by every method of communication, they just could not cod the people.</P>
    <P>Lincoln it was, if I am not mistaken, who said that you can cod some of the people some of the time, all of the people some of the time but not all of the people all of the time. It cannot be done.  Fianna Fáil have discovered that.  They did believe that they could do it.  I see signs of a revival of the delusion in their ranks already.  It seems to me that they are not yet completely disabused of the notion that only they have the answers to the problems of this country.  No longer have they the answers to the problems; they are the problem creators. Their very presence in the positions which they hold is a problem that vexes the mind of the nation at the present time and the most common remark one can hear outside this House amongst the people is, &ldquo;When <Col N="1288" /> are you going to get this crowd out?&rdquo; This remark has replaced the ordinary civilities such as &ldquo;Good day&rdquo;, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; or even &ldquo;A happy Christmas&rdquo;. It springs more readily to the lips.  Their going would bring a happy Christmas.</P>
    <P>There was a sad occasion recently when a vacancy occurred in the Seanad.  The vacancy was filled with a rapidity which was utterly amazing. I think it took 48 hours to fill the vacancy.</P>

      <P>If you go down at all, that short cut up from Arklow will be well worn.  This Bill is an example of <Col N="1289" /> how the will of the people can be thwarted.  If anything emanated from the referendum, surely it was that the people wanted to retain proportional representation?  Surely, that was evident? Equally, it must be evident to everybody that, if PR is to be operated satisfactorily and fully, it can best be seen to be so in a five-seat constituency or even a seven-seat constituency. Accepting that a seven-seat constituency is unrealistic, in as much as it might very well mean that too great an area would have to be set out for servicing by Deputies, on the basis that a five-seat constituency need not be unreasonably large, would it not have been the logical thing for any Minister of State to provide for five-seat constituencies if he had any regard at all for the people, if he had any concern for what the people wanted?  Of course, I know I am asking too much when I mention these things in relation to the Fianna Fáil Front Bench.  They do not even look into their heart and if they tried to find that organ I am afraid they would have great difficulty in locating it.  They would need the attention of a Doctor Barnard&mdash;particularly some of the gentlemen I see here now.</P>

    <P>I was trying to address myself, when interrupted so rudely by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Carty, to this question of the need which exists, indeed, the obligation, the onus, which rests upon any Government to endeavour to translate into action the will of the people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the lesson of that must have penetrated even the dismal walls which surround the brain of the eminent Deputy from the west? In order for PR to work effectively in present circumstances and in order that the will of the people might be seen to be made possible, in fact, there was an obligation on the Minister to come in here with a Bill which would provide for five-seat constituencies, and the maximum number of five-seat constituencies, because of five-seat constituencies do afford the proportional representation system in present day circumstances its best opportunity for working out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the Minister done?  So far as possible, he has established three-seaters. What has been the history of three-seat constituencies?  Is it not a fact well known to us as practitioners in the art of politics, or call it what you will, that two out of three seats almost invariably have been won by a <Col N="1291" /> Party who secured far less than half the votes&mdash;something more than 40 per cent of the first preference votes nearly inevitably guarantee to a Party the acquisition of two out of three seats.</P>
    <P>Is not this the reason why three-seaters have become so popular in certain areas?  In the Dublin area the same thing is liable to apply.  The hope is that the Fianna Fáil vote will hold on sufficiently strongly to win two out of four seats in most of the constituencies there.  That is the reason for the number of four-seat constituencies in the Dublin area&mdash;to enable Fianna Fáil to cling on as long as they can to representation there.</P>
    <P>I know, and any person associated with politics in Dublin knows, that the first chance the electorate there get they will sweep the Fianna Fáil Deputies in Dublin out of their way as the winds of winter sweep away the leaves of autumn.</P>

It was a lot of codology, the term by which I characterised it at its birth.  It has now gone, never to be mentioned by the Government because they are ashamed of it.  Anyway, it never had any relevance and I hope we shall not hear of its like appearing again in the Dáil.  It served often enough, God knows, to baffle the people, to give decent people coming from Mass the impression that a Fianna Fáil apologist standing on a ditch outside the chapel was an economic expert because he was able to use these long words and the people thought he knew what he was talking about.  That was the function and the purpose of that document. Even the Government did not know what it was all about.  When it was produced to them and when they asked what it was, they were told: &ldquo;It is the Second Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo;.  Then the Government said: &ldquo;Go, get it printed and flog it up and down the country&rdquo;.  The thing was a disaster, without basis.  I am probably being irrelevant in speaking about that document.</P>

One of the odd things about this Bill &mdash;I am glad to see the Minister is coming into the House to hear this little bit&mdash;is a creation called South County Dublin.  This constituency has been described by members of Fianna Fáil as a dormitory area.  I know the Minister proposes to contest this area &mdash;at least it is said he does&mdash;but I think he will find that the people are far from being asleep.  If he is thinking of a pocket constituency in South County Dublin he is blundering.  He is running away at a fast pace from Ballyfermot and North County Dublin and is apparently seeking to establish himself in an area where he thinks the people may not know him so well, where he thinks they may not be familiar with the true nature of the man.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When PAYE was being introduced, the form of the legislation provided that it should not apply to State employees and certain other groups who already had tax deduction machinery available to them.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements in regard to State employees are working satisfactorily&mdash;that is to say, where the employees make full use of the deduction system at their disposal.  This system includes the making of provisional deductions where authorised by the taxpayer; and these are adjusted later in the year when formal assessments are made.</P>
      <P>In the case of members of the Defence Forces their attention is drawn to the provisional deduction scheme at the commencement of each tax year. The majority participate in the scheme.  It is true that those who neglect to participate do not have provisional tax deductions made during the months before the formal assessments are made and have proportionately heavier deductions made afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To apply PAYE now to the Defence Forces would require special legislation, which would have to be of general <Col N="1299" /> application and would raise issues which the employee would have to consider.  I am not satisfied that this course is necessary at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that the Defence Forces in common with other low-paid employees have, in spite of what he said, considerable complaint about the fact that the deductions usually start in large sums immediately before Christmas in each year and that for one reason or another they are not made in very many cases until that time?  Particularly, if they happen to have any increased amount in salary or wages during the year, all the deductions are made between December and the following 5th April.

      <P>We provided grants for the improvement of Limerick harbour some years ago.  We also provided grants for Foynes harbour as a deep sea harbour, to increase traffic there.  I am aware that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have undertaken a market examination as to the prospects for Limerick.  That has not been completed.  I think Limerick Harbour Commissioners are well aware of the position whereby continental traffic, for example, has increased in a recent period and cross-channel general cargo has dropped. The Intelligence Unit's report to the Harbour Commissioners included in its recommendations on the improvement of port operations at Limerick the employment by the Commissioners of a marketing officer and the installation of a suitable crane.  At the same time there has been a problem in regard to restrictive practices at the port of Limerick and, as the Deputy may be aware, a working party comprising representatives of FUE, Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Department of Labour has been set up to consider the feasibility of having a special redundancy scheme introduced for dock workers quite apart from any recent changes and trends in traffic in order to enable more traffic to pass through the port of Limerick.  No doubt the Deputy is aware of the efforts made in that respect.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the differential which exists in regard to western ports as against eastern ports?  Is he aware that there is a differential of 15 per cent in favour of the western ports?  Is he not also aware that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have already made the appointment to which he has now referred and, in view of these facts <Col N="1309" /> and in the light of what is happening at Limerick port, will the Minister guarantee to the House that the future of Limerick port will not be affected by the instant measures taken by CIE in regard to the trans-shipment of container traffic through the port of Dublin?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that there is also an employment position in CIE and unless CIE make use of modern methods such as unitisation people will be disemployed in CIE. The Deputy may also be aware that recently requests were made to me to defer giving licences to shipping companies for transport because of the desire of the people of Limerick to preserve the extent of employment in CIE there and that CIE have to compete with other carriers, with carriers on their own account and with licensed carriers.  There is a certain amount of employment there and CIE have also to take advantage of the fact that traders are making their own decisions regarding the method of transport they use and this is a trend which is now found all over Europe.  It is quite impossible for a Minister in charge of transport and power in any country, under any form of Government, whether extremely left, left of centre, or centre, to prevent certain inevitable changes that are taking place arising from the use of containers.  I have tried to explain this to the House in the greatest possible detail.  It is also necessary with a view to maintaining competitive costs and enabling manufacturers or others to be competitive that the latest forms of transport and the newest techniques be used.  If they do not use them it will merely result in their losing business to other manufacturers abroad who do use these techniques.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a hydraulic model investigation which was financed by a full-cost State grant of £200,000, the Arklow Harbour Commissioners applied in March, 1968, for a State grant of £766,000 to finance the full cost of a major harbour improvement scheme.  They were informed that a State grant of this amount could not be justified having regard to the prospective level of trade of Arklow harbour.  Later they represented that portion of the North Pier was in a bad state of repair and also that dredging was urgently required. I have now approved a grant, subject to a maximum of £20,000, to meet the full cost of the repair works at the North Pier and have also conveyed my consent to the borrowing by the Commissioners of up to £20,000 to finance the dredging work needed.</P>

      <Col N="1316" /> Delay in meeting applications is due to the very heavy demand for telephones which is now running at a rate 50 per cent higher than in 1966.</P>

      <P>The figures the Minister has given mean that there are 7,000 or 8,000 people waiting to have their telephones installed.  There are over 4,000 who have paid their deposit and are still waiting for installation. Does the Minister not think it a disgrace to take the money from these people and hold it for three months, six months, nine months or in some cases for over 12 months?  Can the Department not do better than this?</P>

      <P>The earlier collection of mails <Col N="1317" /> in the area in question was introduced to permit of an improvement in the working conditions of the staff at Ceanannus Mór Post Office.

      <P>There is a reason.  As I said in my reply, the reason for bringing forward the time was in order to improve the working conditions of the staff.  There has been a very long spread-out of mail work in that office extending from 4.30 up to 10.45 p.m. at night.  The rearrangement was in order to allow for the five-day week and for improved conditions for the staff.  With the closure of the sub-offices in this area at 5.30, I do not think bringing forward the posting time by a little less than an hour has created too great an inconvenience for people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right for me to contradict what the Deputy has said in this regard by referring to last year, 1967.  Of the 3,000 people who were nominated in 1967, only 845 were in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  Of those 800 odd 105 failed to attend for interview and 483 of those people were provisionally selected on interview as suitable for work.  There are further checkings which have to be taken into account in relation to the sorting and delivery of postal mail and this narrows down the number further still.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the new Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme is to promote increased production of beef in herds not used for commercial milk production. As well as serving as an incentive to the owners of these herds to expand their production of beef, for which there are good export market outlets and prospects, the scheme is also intended to serve as a counter-attraction to any of these herd owners who may otherwise be contemplating switching some or all of their production to dairying where the position as regards market outlets is becoming increasingly difficult and likely to remain so for some time to come.  The scheme will, of course, also benefit a large number of herd owners&mdash;many of whom reside in the poorer farming areas&mdash;who do not receive from the State financial incentives comparable to those provided for milk.  It is expected that over 300,000 animals will qualify for grant annually under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, which will come into operation on 1st April next, an annual payment of £8 will be made in respect of each calved cow in excess of two in herds not used for commercial milk production.  There will be two inspections annually of each applicant's herd and payment in respect of eligible animals will be made following the second inspection.  Detailed particulars of the conditions and procedure to be followed will be published as soon as possible.</P>

I became aware of Deputy Collins's question, which was put down a week or a fortnight ago&mdash;I do not remember exactly when&mdash;which apparently appeared on the Order Paper and was postponed, so far as I understand. However, it did appear on the Order Paper and the reason it was postponed <Col N="1322" /> I think&mdash;although I have not further inquired&mdash;was that a similar question had already been disallowed. Deputy Collin's question, apparently, had been let through and this did not come from my Department.  It was done somewhere in the Dáil Office. That being the case, it would have been wrong, I think, had I answered Deputy Collin's question at that time, which did appear on the Order Paper and which it was suggested should be postponed.  I readily agreed and so today the two questions are coming along together, and indeed they would have been together earlier.  I had nothing to do with them except to abide by what I was requested to do.</P>

      <P>The planning consultant for this study was appointed in February, 1967, and the brief and commission were formally signed on 20th October, 1967, following preliminary survey of the problems.  The study covers the entire Connemara Gaeltacht and not only the Carraroe district.  The duration of the study is 15 months from October, 1967, and the maximum fee is £8,547.  The planning consultant has engaged the services of the Social Science Research Centre at University College, Galway, for the economic and social analysis.  An interim report was presented in June, 1968.  This has been reviewed with the consultant and the staff of the Social Science Research Centre and the further development of the study agreed.  It is expected that the final report will be completed within the contract period.  The cost to date is estimated at £5,700.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>It was a condition attached to the permission referred to by the Deputy that a contribution of £5,500 should be lodged by the developer with the county council towards the cost of acquiring alternative open space in the neighbourhood.  While I agreed with the planning authority's decision that the case was an appropriate one for requiring some contribution from the developers I considered that the amount of the contribution they stipulated would increase the cost of the six proposed houses excessively and accordingly I reduced it to £2,400.</P>

He considered that these values were fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, I approved of the purchase scheme in July.  I do not propose to have the prices further examined now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> The Deputy pointed out in his question of 8th March, 1967, that the institution of a purchase scheme could seriously affect the existing pool of corporation rented accommodation.  It is not, therefore, necessarily in the corporation's interest to sell their houses at all.  The fact that over 1,000 tenants have already made firm applications to purchase and that more are continually applying shows that many persons appreciate the offer to buy on the terms which they have got and wish to go ahead with the transaction now rather than later when prices rise.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's statement he refers to the court judgment, a very excellent summary of the law and determination of the provisions of the Constitution as they affect the election of Deputies to this House.  The Minister says that the judgment would suggest that a deviation of up to 1,000 would be acceptable. I should like to know where he gets that from.  I should like the Minister to tell us where did Mr. Justice Budd say that a deviation of 1,000 would be acceptable?  I do not see it in the court judgment.  It is a deduction he makes for his own use and benefit and it is a specious deduction.  There is no definite statement by Mr. Justice Budd that it would be legally right to deviate by 1,000 from the national average, either above or below.  The Minister for his own purposes has tried to create the impression that this, in fact, was said by Mr. Justice Budd and the upshot of that process of specious argument is that the people of the city and county of Dublin have to pay a far higher price in terms of votes for Dáil representation than the people in the rest of the country.  I am probably one of a very small minority giving voice to this view because the majority of Members represent constituencies outside Dublin.  I can only appeal to their sense of equity and fair play in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Justice Budd also said that he presumed the words &ldquo;democratic State&rdquo; tended to convey a State in which all the people were deemed to have equal rights and privileges.  I hope we have not gone to such an extreme of cynicism and self-interest that the only thing that concerns Members is the effect of changes of this kind upon our own immediate position as Dáil Deputies, and nothing else.  I recognise full well that it is natural that the <Col N="1340" /> primary interest to any Member of the House must be how changes of this nature will affect his own personal position.  That, however, cannot be the major consideration which surely must be that if we are ever to regard ourselves seriously as a national legislature the major consideration must be the overall national good.  If we permit a Government such as this to produce legislation obviously designed to discriminate against one section of the public to go without protest we are not doing the job with which we are charged here.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that every Dublin constituency is required to have hundreds and up to 1,000 in excess of population over the national average and, indeed, in many other cases, if not in most constituencies, particularly on the western seaboard where as we know the population has been progressively reduced, without going into the reasons for it, Dáil representation is obtainable on lower terms, speaking in terms of votes, than in Dublin.  Why should this be?  The people said it was undesirable and that it should not be.  The people even in the west of Ireland in the constituencies which were supposed to benefit by the referendum proposals said they did not want any part of it.  They said they were satisfied that this socalled tolerance&mdash;a word invented to twist the truth by this Government, to make things appear as they were not &mdash;is something with which they were not concerned.  They were, in fact, quite content and what they said, in effect, in their vote in the referendum was that they were content to be judged on the same basis as every other citizen and have the same rights and privileges as every other citizen and did not wish for any more.  Regardless of that, the Minister is now saying: &ldquo;I do not care what you say.  I will insist on this going through.  This is my solution.  I will create a disparity between the number of votes it takes to elect a Deputy in the Dublin area and the number of votes it takes to elect a Deputy in Mayo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will create that disparity for his own obscure reasons. These reasons are really illusory.  He probably believes that in doing this <Col N="1341" /> he is maintaining to some extent the position of his own Party but, no matter how he tries to paint the picture, nobody in this House will be convinced of anything else but that everything to which he puts his hand is founded on the one idea&mdash;the good, not of the country, but of Fianna Fáil. We must assume, therefore, that this Bill is shaped, so far as he can shape it, for the benefit of Fianna Fáil, the Fianna Fáil Party and this Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>It is illusory to think that anybody can do any manipulation of any consequence in these modern days except, perhaps, in certain areas, very few areas, in which Government Deputies may have certain pockets of strength. Over the country at large it would be impossible to estimate how Party lines join and where they separate.  It is difficult enough, talking to people, to tell in what direction their political allegiance lies.  The generation today does not freely disclose its political affiliations.  It is not as ingenuous as generations past.  People today do not wear their political hearts on their sleeves because they may sense a certain danger in certain circumstances, particularly if they are in jobs of a certain kind.</P>
    <P>I will vote against this measure on the general principle that it is antagonistic to the idea of democratic treatment of the people of this city and county, in the first instance, and to the whole concept of democracy, as I know it and as it is enshrined in the Constitution. The Labour Party will use the Bill to try to get some improvements made in general electoral procedure. I referred on a previous occasion here to experiences I have had in elections: people arrive at polling stations to find they may not vote because their names are not on the register.  These people have lived in the particular locality for a number of years and they find it inexplicable when they are prevented from voting in an election even though they voted in earlier elections without any difficulty whatsoever.  Invariably they approach a politician, if he happens to be present, for an explanation and it is incomprehensible to them that he cannot <Col N="1342" /> secure this right for them.  Omissions from the register may be due to carelessness or a hundred and one other reasons which may not be apparent to all and sundry.</P>
    <P>It is our hope that by amending this Bill on the Committee Stage we will lay the foundations of machinery designed to enable these people to exercise the franchise, even though their names are omitted from the register. It might be possible for them to swear an affidavit at the polling station which would entitle them to exercise the franchise.  If something on those lines is not done there will be serious doubts as to the effectiveness of the democratic system.  This sort of omission happens on a wide scale.  It happened on a wide scale in the recent referendum.  I met scores of people who had voted in earlier elections but who were unable to vote in the referendum because their names did not appear on the register.  Nothing could be done about it.  It is a very undesirable situation and it must be corrected.  Some machinery must be designed to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>In the referendum, too, there was a breakdown in the power supply and people were left without lights.  This could happen in any polling station. Provision should be made in this Bill designed to cope with emergencies of that kind where voting time is lost.  We will be putting down amendments to that effect and one or two others.  I hope they will be acceptable.  This is one of the few opportunities we have and it should be availed of.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who announced after the referendum that they would now set about the savage&mdash;the word &ldquo;savage&rdquo; was used &mdash; breaching of county boundaries.  I do not know quite how savage this handiwork has been.  I am not altogether enamoured of all this talk about the sacrosanct nature of county boundaries.  I think they are a relatively modern concept, modern in the historic sense.  I do not suppose they are any more than 250 or 300 years old and they are vague at that.</P>

      <P>That is very sad. Unfortunately one has to battle on without the support of professors or even of the Minister.  Possibly the country is bedevilled between Ministers and professors.  If we had less of them and more ordinary people like myself, we might be better.  I should like to qualify that by saying he is a very capable and able young man, a young man who owes his scholastic position to his own merit.  I recall him as an ordinary member of Dublin County Council.  I think he was a clerk with the ESB.  He deserves great credit for what he has achieved in the academic world.  It does not follow that he is a politician of greater acumen than I am.  He is probably a politician of greater acumen than the Minister.  It would be hard to find anyone who is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>However, age does not matter.  It seems to me that there was a sort of athletic approach to the business of the county boundaries and an idea that if a bit of one county were taken off another there would be open rebellion, that they would get out the pikes again, or the camáns, but the people do not mind at all.  They are not at all concerned with boundaries except perhaps in the matter of hurling and football, or where it is a case of the rates being lower.  They would prefer to live in a county with lower rates.  People are concerned about the problems of life, and about their rights. They are more conscious today of the impact of the Government upon their day-to-day rights.  That is why they are worried when any attempt or threat is made to reduce their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher, who represents a western constituency, described the four additional Dublin seats as a tragedy.  The tragedy is not that there are four additional Dublin seats, but that the country is being progressively depopulated, and that the bulk of the <Col N="1344" /> population are making for Dublin as fast as they can.  Once those people are living here we do not help by closing our eyes to it and pretending that they are in the west.  The people of the west obviously were not the slightest bit thankful to the Fianna Fáil Party for suggesting the non-reduction of the number of TDs in the west.  Many of them realise that Fianna Fáil dominance there has not improved their conditions to any extent, with the result that we have continuing depopulation of the west.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher, as I say, described the four additional Dublin seats as a tragedy.  In fact, I think there should be more seats added to Dublin.  Because of the nature of the divide, the skilful way in which it was done, and the long preparation in the doing of it, the number of extra seats in Dublin has been kept down to four.  We may have one-third of the population in Dublin city and county, but we have not got one-third of the seats in the Dáil or anything like it.  There is great discrimination against the built-up areas.  I do not see why this should be, nor could Mr. Budd see that there was anything in the Constitution to suggest that because someone lived in a rural area his vote should have greater weight than that of a person living in a city or a town.  Nothing further occurs to me to offer at this juncture on this Bill.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is a disappointment to me, as it is perhaps to many Deputies, that this matter has to be fought out in this House, and that we did not have some objective body to resolve the difficulty for us.  Obviously this is a difficult subject so far as individual Deputies and Parties are concerned.  It is perhaps one that could be approached in a more objective fashion by some outside body, but we have to face it as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister pointed out repeatedly that if he did not succeed in winning the referendum he would be forced to carve up most of the constituencies.  I <Col N="1345" /> describe what has been done as mutilation and butchery.  If he had to do it in that way, he has done it very effectively. With an anatomical knowledge and in a scientific fashion, he has butchered up the country to the advantage of his own Party.  I accept at once that breaching of the county boundaries is inevitable.  If he was not so concerned with political advantage it should be possible to do the job he set out to do with much less mutilation than is shown in the proposals before us.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from movements of people within county boundaries, the number of people who will be moved outside their own county boundaries amounts to over 100,000. I have examined the figures and there are several ways in which one may do this.  The ways are not as limitless as one may think, but by adjustments one could provide constituencies here in keeping with the Budd judgment and with a population displacement of somewhere about 40,000.  In other words, 60,000 people have been wantonly, brutally and unnecessarily displaced outside their natural county boundaries in order to facilitate the Minister in his objective of securing political advantage for his own Party. These, I believe, are correct figures and I will give them to the Minister shortly so that he may have an opportunity to persue them at his leisure.  If there are any errors in the figures I can correct them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These breaches of county boundaries have created areas of discontent. There is an unnecessarily extensive amount of discontent.  I think it was Deputy Dunne who mentioned that there was nothing sacrosanct in county boundaries.  I agree with him that there is nothing sacrosanct in county boundaries as such.  I am not concerned with the emotional appeal of county boundaries.  It happens that county boundaries are usually our local authority functional areas.  Those of us who are rural Deputies who often work on county councils will appreciate that it is very advantageous, both to the public and to the public representative, to work in a constituency where the local authority area and the Dáil <Col N="1346" /> area correspond.  However, I have some knowledge of that because I work in a four-seater constituency where we have a large part of County Waterford. Apart from the geographical difficulties that exist there are also administrative difficulties.  I am not on the county council in Waterford and when I go in there I am at a disadvantage. Similarly, if there happens to be a Deputy from County Waterford also in my constituency he is at a disadvantage when he comes into South Tipperary.  Apart altogether from sentiment or emotion about county boundaries, there is the practical administrative side which is important. The Minister, having been Minister for Local Government for a considerable period, is quite aware of that and appreciates and understands it.  He has adverted to it.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Ceann Comhairle that we may discuss what is in the Bill and what may relevantly be put into the Bill.  On that basis I will attempt to show to the Minister how this figure of 60,000 displaced persons, if I may use that term, arises and how it could be obviated if the Minister would turn his mind to that purpurpose of securing as much political advantage as he can secure under the present constitutional system and within the straitjacket of the Budd judgment.</P>
    <P>If we take Connacht and its problems first, there we have had 33 seats up to the present time.  It is now proposed to reduce that number to 30.  In the Minister's proposal he has done it very simply.  They are all three-seaters now.  There are ten three-seater constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am including Donegal&mdash;Donegal, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Galway and Clare.  Under the existing system North-East Donegal has three seats.  South-West Donegal is a three-seater.  North Mayo has three seats.  South Mayo has four seats.  Roscommon with South Leitrim has four seats.  Sligo with the other part of Leitrim has four seats. <Col N="1347" /> East Galway has five seats.  West Galway has three seats and Clare has four seats, making 33 seats.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to have 30 seats here, all composed of three-seaters. South Donegal takes in some of Leitrim and remains a three-seater. Mayo remains two three-seaters.  It is divided from north to south now rather than from east to west.  Roscommon becomes a three-seater, and Sligo a three-seater.  Galway becomes North-East Galway, which will be a three-seater, and a new constituency called Clare-Galway will be formed and is to be a three-seater.  West Galway is to be a three-seater and Clare a three-seater.  I am proposing to the Minister that he can arrange that area, which is a pretty difficult area, with much less displacement of population than will obtain under the proposals outlined in this House.  I think the key difficulty in that area is Leitrim, and perhaps Donegal.  As the Minister has travelled all over this county he must be very well acquainted with the geography of these counties.  If we take Donegal first, with a population of 108,549, the Government proposal is to add 8,997 from North Leitrim to make up a population of 117,546. Another proposal is to give North-East Donegal 59,200 and South-West Donegal 58,346.  That leaves him with two three-seaters.  If Donegal must be regarded as a five-seater, the population requirement, following the Minister's own arithmetic, would be from 95,140 to 105,140.  This leaves a residue of from a minimum of 3,409 to a maximum of 13,409 for transfer.  I am tentatively suggesting to the Minister that, if he considers Donegal as a five-seater, there will be that minimum or maximum for transfer and I would ask him mentally to put aside that matter for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of Mayo, the population is 115,547.  The Government propose here to let it continue as a three-seater, east and west.  It was a four-seater in the south and a three-seater in the north.  The population is now to be regarded as able to provide for only six seats in the entire county of Mayo.  The population requirement for a six-seater would be between <Col N="1348" /> 114,000 and 116,000 and, with a population of 115,000, Mayo at the moment is barely able to provide for either a six-seater or two three-seaters.  The division would then have to be very well on the 50/50 basis.  There is no reason why that could not have continued the way it was.  No reason has been adduced here.  If the Minister has a specific reason as to why the division of Mayo had to be altered so completely as from east to west to, roughly speaking, from north to south, perhaps he will give us the reason later on. The ostensible reason is that the Minister wanted to separate two fellow Ministers, that he did not want to have them competing with each other and wanted the prestige and value of having a Minister in two constituencies rather than two Ministers in one constituency. That suspicion is abroad.  If the Minister has a more worthy reason, he will have an opportunity of giving that more worthy reason later on in the course of the debate.  I would suggest that he might well do so.</P>
    <P>If we pass to the county of Sligo, here we have a population of 51,263. This has survived as a four-seater constituency by the transfer of 16,629 from North Leitrim.  Now the Government propose that it be made a three-seater by the transfer of 10,503 from mid-Leitrim to make a constituency of 61,766.  Next we come to Leitrim. Leitrim, as I said in the beginning, is a problem because of small population&mdash;30,572. Up to the present 16,629 went to Sligo, taking it now on the 1966 census, and 13,943 to Roscommon, to form two four-seaters.  It is now proposed to wipe Leitrim entirely off the map.  It is proposed to give 8,997 of North Leitrim to South-West Donegal, 10,503 from mid-Leitrim to Sligo; 11,072 from South Leitrim to Roscommon, so as to form three-seaters in each area.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the case of Roscommon. Here we have a population of 56,228.  This has been a four-seater by the addition of nearly 14,000 from Leitrim.  It is now proposed to reduce it to a three-seater and the three-seater is made up as follows: from Roscommon alone, 46,315, that is, after Roscommon has given 9,913 to <Col N="1349" /> Clare-Galway and North-East Galway; to that has been added about one-third of Leitrim, mainly from the Carrick-on-Shannon and Mohill areas&mdash;a figure, to be precise, of 11,072&mdash;that makes a population of 57,387; but, here we have an extra piece thrown in from Westmeath, the west urban part of Athlone with a population of 4,028.  That makes the proposed new Roscommon constituency with a population of 61,411.</P>
    <P>Now, it requires only from 57,084 to 63,084 to form a three-seater, so that the addition of this area of Athlone, its sequestration from Westmeath and its transfer into Roscommon, was unnecessary.  Here again, there have been remarks made that it was done for a special political purpose. Suffice it to say that the constituency was viable as a three-seater without that transfer.  The Minister in his reply might like to say why that particular area was transferred from Westmeath.  Its retention by Westmeath would not bring Westmeath, as far as I can know, above the limit of Longford/Westmeath viability.</P>
    <P>As regards County Galway, here we have a population of 148,340.  If you examine the situation and if you allow for a small removal of population from that of, say, 3,000 to make Clare a four-seater, you would then have a population of 145,340.  A sevenseater needs from 133,196 to 147,196 people, the national average being 140,196.  Here you have the ancient traditional county of Galway, which is quite capable, as it stands, of providing seven seats.  By a simple arrangement you could give, say, 80,000 to East Galway, making it a four-seater and 60,000 to West Galway making that a four-seater also.  That would allow a transfer of, say, 3,000 people from the Gort area into Clare and keep Clare as a four-seater.  Clare has a population of 73,597; it now needs between 2,515 and 10,515 to remain a four-seater.  I suggest to the Minister that a simple arrangement would be to transfer 3,000 from the border between Galway and Clare, say the Gort area or any other area, into Clare and thereby keep it as a four-seater.</P>
    <P>I believe it is an injustice to take a <Col N="1350" /> county and wipe it completely off the electoral map, and that is precisely what has happened in the case of Leitrim.  I suggest to the Minister that this can be obviated.  As I said at the beginning, this is the most difficult part of the arrangement to work out, but I think it can be done.  The two counties of Sligo and Leitrim have a combined population of 81,835.  I mentioned earlier there was a surplus of population available for distribution in Donegal.  This surplus is placed in a rather concentrated fashion in Bundoran and Ballyshannon.  There is also a small neck of country in Roscommon jutting into Sligo and Leitrim, and I suggest to the Minister that Sligo and Leitrim could be constructed as five-seaters by the addition of 2,000 from Roscommon and 13,000 from the lower part of South-West Donegal.  This would be the largest transfer of population I would suggest.</P>
    <P>This type of distribution would preserve the entire county of Leitrim as an electoral entity.  Admittedly, that type of constituency would be big. Sligo-Leitrim itself has got 67,000 acres, but my own constituency of South Tipperary-West Waterford has 77,000 acres.  From the point of view of size it should not present any greater difficulty than I have to contend with, and it seems to be reasonable from the point of view of outline.  I have not an intimate local geographical knowledge of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In any event, as a five-seater it would, in the nature of things, have to be large but we have had areas as large. It is one of the methods by which an attempt could be made to preserve the electoral integrity of Leitrim and other counties in that area.  The Minister's proposal is to divide Leitrim three times, to obliterate it as an electoral entity.  I will give the Minister the <Col N="1351" /> figures again in respect of the population transfers in the plan proposed by him and in the one mentioned by me.</P>
      <P>First of all, my suggestion would make Donegal a five-seat constituency, Sligo-Leitrim a five-seat, Mayo two three-seaters, Roscommon a three-seat, Galway a three-seat and a four-seat and Clare a four-seat constituency. For those areas, the Minister has his own transfer proposals and a summary of these population transfers represent the kernel of the matter in dispute between his side of the House and ours. He suggests the transfer from North Leitrim to Donegal of 8,997 people. Here I am dealing with the transfer of population from a county into another county, not with transfers within counties. The whole of Mayo will be turned around by 90 degrees, the east and west and north and south borders being transferred.  North Leitrim will be transferred to Donegal involving, as I have said, a population of 8,997. Mid-Leitrim will be transferred to Sligo, involving a population of 10,503.  South Leitrim will go to Roscommon, involving a population of 11,072.  Athlone West Urban will go to Roscommon, involving a population of 4,024.  A population of 1,975 from Roscommon will go to Clare-Galway. A population of 7,938 will go from Roscommon to North-East Galway. From Clare to Clare-Galway will go 14,765.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This involves a total transfer of 59,274 persons.  The proposal I have mentioned involves a transfer from South-West Donegal to Sligo-Leitrim of 13,000 people.  From Roscommon to Sligo-Leitrim would be transferred 2,000 and from Athlone to Roscommon, as the Minister suggests, 4,024. Then from East Galway to Clare there is a transfer of 3,000.  That would mean a total transfer in the western counties of 22,024 as against the Minister's figure of 59,274, in other words, if we depart from this notion of the Minister of three-seaters, with which he is obsessed.  Constituencies can be arranged in the counties of Clare, Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal by a transfer of population from outside their traditional <Col N="1352" /> county boundaries of 22,000 persons.  The Minister's plan is 59,000. What I am suggesting means a transfer of only one-third of the population as against that suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am aware that these suggestions will not be accepted by the Minister, but I see no harm in making such suggestions and highlighting in precise figures what exactly the Minister is doing and what exactly he is after.  I have deliberately made a comparison in hard figures which I think nobody can go behind.</P>
    <P>Let us take now the north-eastern counties.  I propose to deal first with Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Louth and Kildare.  The Minister has performed a wonderful bit of butchering here.  I do not suppose that anybody will be able to recognise Meath by the time the Minister is finished with it.  The population has been bundled from one county into another.  It is a sort of merry-go-round.  I do not think that is necessary, but there is the same objective behind it as obtains in the western counties with which I have dealt.  The Minister is aiming in all these cases, in Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, and Kildare, to establish three-seater constituencies.  This is the overall plan and everything is subjected to this plan.  Consideration for the public, considerations of efficiency and humanitarian considerations are set aside in order to preserve the grand plan.  We can visualise the Minister with his carving knife setting about his work saying to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Boland, my boy, be bloody bold and resolute&rdquo;&mdash;and bloody bold and resolute he is.</P>
    <P>In Cavan the population was 54,022. The Government's proposal is to make it a three-seater by taking 5,656 from Meath, mostly from Kells and Old-castle, to make a constituency of 59,678.  This is a smallish county.  It needed from between 3,062 minimum to 9,062 maximum to become a three-seater and this is how the Minister has proposed to do it.  These transfers are from two different areas of Meath. With regard to Monaghan, the Minister proposes that this, too, will be a three-seater.  Again, it is a small county with a population of 45,732.  It is to be made a three-seater by getting 7,532 from Louth&mdash;again poor Meath contributes <Col N="1353" /> another 6,426&mdash;making a constituency population here of 59,751 which, of course, is quite correct for a three-seater.</P>
    <P>In Louth the population is 69,519.  It is proposed to be a three-seater.  This constituency again has to give away population and it gives a population of 7,593 to Monaghan.  That will make the constituency 61,926.  Now we come to Meath.  This is the centre of the Minister's activities.  I do not know why Meath is so particularly picked out but the Minister proposes to make Meath a three-seater.  Meath has a population of 67,323 and after giving its population to Cavan it is proposed then to transfer 5,041 from Kildare to make Westmeath a three-seater and Kildare a three-seater also.  Meath as a county needs about one-half a seat, as it were, to be a four-seater.  It needs 9,789.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that this area of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath and Kildare could be accommodated in a far more simple fashion and with far less population displacements than he has suggested.  For example, if he can swallow the notion of five-seaters at all, and they appear to be anathema to him, if he combines Cavan and Monaghan the combined population will be 99,754.  It requires 95,140 to 105,140 for a five-seater, the national average being 100,000 odd, so Cavan and Monaghan combined is exactly appropriate to a five-seater.  I am suggesting to the Minister that the only transfers necessary then for this region if he will accept the notion of Meath being a four-seater, will be 5,000 from Kildare into Meath, and that 5,000 is already mentioned in the Minister's own proposals, plus 5,000 from Louth.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister the comparable population transfers in that area, me ones I propose and the Minister's proposals.  The Minister's proposals are as follows: Meath to Cavan, 5,656; Meath to Monaghan, 6,426; Louth to Monaghan, 7,532; Kildare to Meath, 5,041.  In these areas the total population transfer envisaged by the Minister is 24,655.  Now, all I have suggested is two transfers, simply transfer the 5,000 you were originally going to transfer from Kildare into <Col N="1354" /> Meath and transfer another 5,000 from Louth, from the part just below Drogheda where it runs out to the sea.  You can get 5,000 very easily there and that gives you a population adequate to preserve Meath as a four-seater. Then you will have the final position: Cavan-Monaghan a five-seater, Louth a three-seater, Meath a four-seater and Kildare a three-seater, with a population transfer of, say, 10,000 against the Minister's proposal of 24,655.</P>
    <P>As regards Longford-Westmeath there is no change.  The long-standing difficulty of the population from Mullingar at one time attached to Kildare has disappeared.  Carlow-Kilkenny is traditionally a five-seater.  It seems to work all right.  It still needs and will have to obtain an addition of 4,398 from Wexford.  That still leaves Wexford as a viable four-seater.  Laois-Offaly, a five-seater, has remained untouched and far be it from me to suggest that we should touch a five-seater. As the Minister has been kind enough to allow even one or two to survive in the country, I do not want to put any further evil notions into his mind.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to come to my own county.  The constituency which I have the honour to represent at the moment is South Tipperary-West Waterford.  Tipperary is a county of two ridings, the north riding and the south riding.  In 1961 we had to give a transfer of population from the south riding to the north riding to preserve the north riding as a viable unit.  In the meantime the population of the north riding has fallen and a further transfusion has to be made this time.  In the event the Minister proposes to transfer Nodstown and Gaile, two or three miles north of Cashel, into the north riding.  In 1961, as indeed now, we were left with the position that we did not have enough in the south riding to form a four-seater. There were four seats there but they had become unconstitutional or illegal, whichever term you like to use, and the notion at the time was that a substantial part of West Waterford would be transferred into South Tipperary. That part of West Waterford <Col N="1355" /> at that time had a population of about 11,000.  That, too, has fallen to a figure of 10,749; but even after giving the extra population of, I think, 875 from Gaile and Nodstown to North Tipperary, South Tipperary-West Waterford is still a viable unit for four seats. However, it has a great geographical defect.  West Waterford is separated from Tipperary, as the Minister well knows, by the Comeragh Mountains. <i>Ab initio</i> Waterford probably had greater claim to be considered a four-seater than South Tipperary in that Waterford had, I think, about 3,000 or 4,000 more people originally than South Tipperary.  But again in 1961, as now, political considerations were paramount and West Waterford was transferred to South Tipperary with a view to perpetuating the hold which Fianna Fáil have on that constituency or had on the south riding of Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Before the election of 1961 there was one Fine Gael and there were three Fianna Fáil Deputies.  The third Fianna Fáil Deputy, who lived in Clonmel, usually was the weakest of the Fianna Fáil candidates; but in order to make that situation safe and preserve the Fianna Fáil position, West Waterford, which we know to be predominantly Fianna Fáil, was brought into South Tipperary.  This had the double purpose of preserving the Fianna Fáil position and it was also hoped that it might damage Deputy Kyne of Dungarvan and the present Deputy Treacy who at that time was a challenger for a Dáil seat.  From the political point of view it seemed a perfectly good answer. No consideration was given to the convenience of the public or their interests&mdash;it was purely a hard political decision taken out of hard necessity&mdash; and some 11,000 people were severed from their native county of Waterford and thrown across the Comeragh Mountains into South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>In the event, it did not come off. Deputy Kyne was elected and so was Deputy Treacy and Fianna Fáil lost the third seat and one of their representatives comes from West Waterford. I believe this annexation of West Waterford by South Tipperary is not in the interests of the people of that <Col N="1356" /> area and does not comply with their wishes.  I am satisfied that everybody in West Waterford, whatever his political persuasions, ardently desires to go back to Waterford.</P>
    <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald, speaking in the Seanad, suggested that the problem could be solved by making South Tipperary a three-seater and Waterford a four-seater.  That would mean that South Tipperary would lose a seat, a Fianna Fáil seat.  I would weep crocodile tears over that but it is not a solution I would accept.  Being a Tipperary man I cannot very well see the second largest town in my county taken off and given to Waterford.  At one stage Youghal was attached to Waterford. Here, again, I do not want to come into conflict with Corkmen who may object to Youghal being taken from them and attached to Waterford. I think there is a compromise solution which would certainly be better all round than the perpetuation of the proposed travesty.  If some population were taken from the marginal areas in both counties of Waterford and Cork it might meet the situation.  On the far side of the River Suir you have Carrickbeg with a population of, I think, 1,500 and you also have part of Tipperary running into West Waterford, Newcastle, and you could take some of the borderline area adjoining the North East Cork constituency, down as far as Youghal and even into Youghal Rural, and get a spread-out population there which would give the necessary amount to make Waterford a four-seater.</P>
    <P>From the last census Tipperary North Riding needed between 3,000 and 9,000 of a population transfer. South Tipperary, with a population of 68,969 must have a transfer outwards of from 5,885 to 11,885.  Already six areas have been transfered from South Tipperary to the North Riding, Cloneen East and Slieveardagh, a population of 2,597.  Now, another 875, it has been suggested by the Minister, should be transferred.  That makes an outward transfer of 3,472 and it means that South Tipperary, if it is to be regarded as a three-seater, would be still too big and at least 1,413 would have to be transferred out.</P>
    <P>Waterford County has a bigger population <Col N="1357" /> than South Tipperary, a population of 73,080 and by removing West Waterford and joining it to South Tipperary it was made a three-seater. Under present conditions Waterford needs a minimum of 3,132 and a maximum of 11,032 to become a four-seater. I suggest that some figure in between these could be taken from some source and added to West Waterford and I have suggested a border transfer on these lines which I think would not cause too much disturbance.</P>
    <P>To give comfortable figures for South-Tipperary as a four-seater or a three-seater or for Waterford as a four-seater or a three-seater the population transfer proposed by the Minister is 10,749. That gives us a constituency which is completely unsatisfactory from a geographical viewpoint and from the point of view that there is a large range of mountains, the Comeraghs, stretching between Waterford and South Tipperary. It is an unnatural alignment of which the Minister is perfectly aware&mdash; he has mentioned it here before&mdash;but it appears now that for personal political reasons he is determined, irrespective of the wishes of the people of Waterford, that they be tied on to South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>It is difficult from the point of view of contact and access but, of course, the real problem lies with the people of Waterford who feel that they have been left out and they are anxious to be put back with their own county.  As against that, the transfer of population that I am suggesting is much less.  The minimum to Waterford from whatever source, either Cork or South Tipperary or Cork and South Tipperary would be 3,132 people.</P>
    <P>I have no observation to make as regards Limerick.  The area in the region of Killachany has been transferred from East Limerick to West Limerick.  East Limerick has a sufficient population to do that and it has preserved Limerick East as a four-seater. West Limerick is a three-seater.  As regards Kerry there is a transfer of 2,024 people from West Cork into South Kerry.  That was necessary to preserve Kerry as a two three-seater constituency.  Some adjustments have also been made regarding the Dingle <Col N="1358" /> Peninsula and mid-Kerry but there has only been a transfer of 2,024.</P>
    <P>I am unable to deal with the Cork constituency.  I have noted the alterations that have been made there but I am not in a position to comment on them.  That would be a matter for the Cork Deputies.  However, under the new proposals there will be a three-seater, two four-seaters and, in Cork city, two three-seater constituencies. Adverse comments have been made regarding these areas but that is a matter for the representatives of these areas to deal with.  I am not sufficiently familiar with that particular area.  It would be entirely a local matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I dealt with that.  Youghal town was previously with Waterford.  That was a traditional attachment for a long time. It has been suggested that Carrick-on-Suir might be put into Waterford. Waterford needs very little to become a four-seater.  It needs only a minimum of 3,132 but if a transfer is to be made it will be necessary to put in a little more than that.</P>
      <P>It has been shown in the census reports that the mechanics of a transfer are reasonably easy but it will be appreciated that when I say a minimum of transfer, I mean a minimum. If, say, 4,000 more are being transferred, I have mentioned ways of doing it without encroaching too much on Youghal or on Carrick-on-Suir.  There is a border hindrance and then there is Carraighdubh and Carrickbeg on one side of the river which is geographically separate from the greater part of Carrick-on-Suir.  If both counties were asked to make population contributions, I should not be inclined to propose that Carrick-on-Suir should be taken and put into Waterford because I could not be expected to agree to the mutilation of my own county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what I mentioned would be a compromise solution to the problem. It is the only one I can think of but if anybody else comes up with a better one, more luck to him.  However, this would make Waterford a four-seater constituency and it would <Col N="1359" /> be the only way to resolve this abnormal constituency of South Tipperary-West Waterford and I doubt if anybody on any side of the House will agree that it is, geographically speaking, a proper constituency.  I presume the reason this is being done now is purely political but, from the very beginning, this was not wanted by the Waterford people and, particularly from the point of view of a Tipperary Deputy, it is badly placed geographically, and, in a fairly big area of 10,500 people, one is faced with the difficulty of not being on the local authority of Waterford when one goes in there and, similarly, the representative from there, Deputy Fahey, is faced with a problem. These are very practical difficulties which a Dublin Deputy may not appreciate because he does not encounter them in the same fashion as we do.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Ceann Comhairle told us at the beginning that our business was to discuss what is in the Bill and what can be put into it.  I see deficiencies in it.  I have attempted in my own way to suggest solutions to the Minister and it is up to every other Deputy to do the same.  The views I have expressed are entirely my own.  Senator Garret FitzGerald expressed his views in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  My views are somewhat different, but the principle is the same.  If the Minister will depart from this over-all plan of three-seaters in the areas where three-seaters work for the Party and four-seaters in the area where four-seaters work for the Party, then we can begin to talk in a businesslike fashion, do better for our people, and there will be less breaching of constituency boundaries than will occur under the Minister's proposals. I have given every figure.  The Minister can check them in the Dáil Report.  I may be wrong in a figure here and there&mdash;one can make mistakes in figures&mdash;but on the proposals I have made the sum total transfer of population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I did.  I have completed my bicycle ride, and I am not going to Dublin at all.  That is a matter for the Dublin Deputies to deal with.  Apparently the Minister is going to have four-seaters there; surely there are no boundaries to be considered?  If the Minister is to heed the wishes the people expressed in the referendum in which they overwhelmingly supported the principle of proportionality he should depart from his three-seat conception all over the country and his four-seat conception in Dublin where he can have plenty of elbow room to give five-seat constituencies if necessary.  I have not touched Dublin but merely expressed the general idea that here is an area where you can divide almost with a <Col N="1361" /> pencil, not being limited as you are in counties.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed scheme of the Minister there will be a transfer of people from the traditional county into other counties.  Again, let it be clear that I am not speaking about intercounty transfer at all but extra-county transfer.  I do not know how to express it exactly, but there will be that transfer in breach of county boundaries under the Minister's scheme.  I estimate 14 breaches giving a grand total of 101,000 disaffected people in most cases.  Under the suggestions outlined by me here there will be only nine breaches of county boundaries and the total transfer of population will be 41,578.  That means that the Minister in his gerrymandering escapade will upset 60,000 people more than is necessary, and that is the size of a nice county.  In order to secure the last ounce of political advantage for his Party out of the straitjacket of the Budd judgment he is prepared to do that.  What in God's name would he have done if he had won the referendum?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> A commission without authority, a recommendation committee; we know what that means.  The general pattern of size of constituencies has altered here down through the years.  We have been steadily departing from the large constituencies towards the three-seat and the four-seat constituencies, as anyone can see from the figures in the memorandum circulated here or as one can find out elsewhere.  It is well known that a movement in that direction militates particularly against the smaller Parties and is contrary to the spirit of proportionality.  Here it is again.  In the 1961 Act there were 17 three-seaters; now it is proposed to have 26.  Under the 1961 Act there were 12 four-seaters; now it is proposed to have 14. Under the same Act there were nine five-seaters; now it is proposed to have two.  They allowed two to exist: Carlow-Kilkenny, and, of course, they dare not go into Laois-Offaly; Deputy Oliver Flanagan was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposals I have outlined <Col N="1362" /> to the Minister&mdash;I do not claim that they could not be very much improved upon&mdash;there would be 18 three-seat constituencies, 16 four-seat constituencies and 5 five-seat constituencies &mdash;considerably better from a democratic viewpoint than the suggestion put up by the Minister, though, perhaps, not as pleasant for Deputies; I do not know.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to comment on these observations.  As I say, they are purely my own.  He can check on the figures if he feels so disposed.  He has plenty of help.  This work was done by myself.  I did not have any computers or a battery of civil servants or up-to-date maps, and you do not need them.  It is quite easy to debunk what this Minister is trying to do, because, as in the referendum he is palpably wrong.  In so far as the Constitution will allow he has tried to oppose the spirit of the people's opinion expressed in the last referendum.  I think the people can be interpreted as saying: &ldquo;We do not want a one-Party system. We want PR.&rdquo;</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Is it out of order if I say that I believe the Minister in this Bill is not behaving in conformity with the proportionality concept of proportional representation which is the accepted method of election in this country and recently endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the people?  Anybody who looks at the map in the Oireachtas Library, anybody who examines the figures, in fact, anybody who gives any thought to this matter, must be satisfied that the Minister has gerrymandered to the utmost of his ability within the limits of the Constitution and I regret he should have done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of action ultimately avails nothing.  It would be resented by the <Col N="1363" /> people at large.  They would take it as an attempt to the utmost of the Minister's ability to repudiate their viewpoint which they expressed so forcibly in the recent referendum.  It would have been quite easy for the Minister at least to make the attempt to come to some agreement with this side of the House as regards the division of those constituencies but it is obvious he has followed willy-nilly a pattern, a planned strategy, by which he formed three-seat constituencies all over the west and the south-west of this State and also in the north-east and in the midlands. With the exception of Laois-Offaly and Carlow-Kilkenny, where he allowed the five-seat constituencies to continue, he has everywhere he could made three-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>When he came to Dublin the pattern changed.  In Dublin city we find all four-seat constituencies with only one three seat.  The idea, of course, is quite obvious.  Fianna Fáil accept that Dublin has turned completely against them and they will make any bargain they can in Dublin and would be more than happy if they could pull even there, if they got 50 per cent and that is the basis on which they are forming four-seat constituencies.  They are doing so in the hope they will get two out of four seats.  Elsewhere they feel a little bit more hopeful.  I do not know why but they are always optimistic gentlemen.  After the referendum they should not even be hopeful about this. They have said: &ldquo;We will gamble on the old three-seat constituencies and with the luck of God we will pull two out of three.&rdquo;  I do not know where the luck of God will get them.  One cannot read too much into the recent referendum but one cannot but be quite impressed by the fact that there is a feeling they are on the way out.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> You are on the way out.  This gamble of the three-seat constituencies will not come off and you should know it.  I do not think I have anything further to say about this matter except, again, to express my regret that the Minister did not try to find some kind of compromise <Col N="1364" /> solution which would be acceptable to all sides of the House. Those matters always have repercussions. If there is a change of Government after the next election what will happen?  What the Minister has done will be undone and the temptation will be for this side of the House to have gerrymandering with the same kind of vehemence as the Minister has displayed. If the Minister had adopted a more reasonable attitude, then he might have pleased the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister was too bemused with this question and set his heart too much on the single-seat constituencies and he can see nothing else.  He blindly keeps on at this but he can expect the consequences.  The House will have heard a Deputy from the Labour Benches saying that if they got an opportunity they would undoubtedly undo all this again.  It should not be necessary to have this kind of vindictiveness and this kind of gerrymandering when one Government go out and another Government come in. A more statesmanlike attitude would be to come to the House and say: &ldquo;Let us sit round a table; we know it is not possible to please everybody but let us try to hammer out an agreed solution.&rdquo;  If this had been tried it might have been possible.</P>

I can see this would be very pleasing to the people of Waterford.  They would like very much to return to a four-seat constituency, which is their right, and which we gave them an opportunity of doing if the Third Amendment of the Constitution was carried.  There was quite a lot of confusion caused in Waterford particularly by the Fine Gael Party in that campaign because the Waterford papers in the week before the referendum indicated in an advertisement inserted by the Fine Gael Party that whatever the result of the referendum Waterford would return to a four-seat constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, for a quarter of an hour&mdash;that was all the time that was left to me&mdash;I moved and spoke to the motion put down by the members of the Labour Party that Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the income tax code is in need of urgent revision in view of the fact that it now creates considerable economic hardship for the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate I was explaining that I considered that certain sections of the community who are in receipt of small wages were being harshly treated by the Minister for Finance. When I mentioned that men who used motor cars to go to work did not receive <Col N="1366" /> any allowance for those cars, the Minister for Labour, Dr. Hillery, suggested that using motor cars to go to work was a sign of the affluent society. I do not know what sign of the affluent society there is in a man who gets up at 6.30 a.m., drives 40 miles into Dublin, where he works hard all day on a building site, with nothing to eat but a few slices of sandwich and perhaps a flask of tea until he arrives home in the evening, when he cannot do anything else but go to bed, because otherwise he will be unable to get out again next morning for his work.</P>
    <P>The Minister no doubt was thinking of the type of transport he is used to where there is no question of pulling up at a petrol station and filling the tank, no question of paying road tax, no question of paying for repairs.  Indeed, most certainly in the case of the type of man I have in mind there is no question of having a spare driver with nothing to do, but to drive one around. The people for whom I speak drive the full distance themselves, work their day and then have to drive home again. They must meet the cost of all the repairs, tax, insurance and other outgoings. If the car is on hire-purchase they must make the repayments and if it is an old car it must be paid for by the unfortunate workman.  Despite all this, the Department of Finance say that, since he is not using the car in the course of his employment, he is not entitled to an income tax rebate. Again and again I have given instances in this House of the man who drives from Meath to building work in Dublin and home again as well as the cases of men who drive from various areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, as Deputy Cunningham might know, CIE do not get out early enough in the morning to get a building worker on the job at 8 a.m.  Even if they did, they would leave him somewhere in town from whence he might have to get another one or two buses to take him to the site.  If the worker does not turn up until dinner time he will lose a substantial portion of his day's <Col N="1367" /> pay.  Those people are treated as if they are living beside the job and have not any expenses.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary thing about it&mdash; and this is the point I was developing when the debate adjourned yesterday evening&mdash;is that if the man who owns the whole building firm&mdash;the man for whom the person I have been speaking of is working&mdash;lives beside the builder's labourer or the carpenter or whatever he might be and does not get up until 10 a.m. drives to his office, drives to the same building site and drives home again, he can claim a tax free allowance for his car.  Indeed, while the man on the site will have to do with the flask of tea and the few sandwiches, the owner of the building firm can bring not alone himself but his pals out on a business lunch or a business dinner and can claim that for tax purposes also.  This may amount to more, every day of the week, than the unfortunate workman is getting for his whole week's work.  I think there is something very unfair there.</P>
      <P>I am giving the extreme case of the man who travels 30 or 40 miles to his work.  We can come back to the man who has to travel four or five miles to his work.  If he is not strong or if he is getting on in years or if, for any of a number of reasons, he uses motor transport, he is refused a tax free allowance or any allowance at all in respect of the vehicle he is using.  When introducing the first Budget of this year&mdash;we have had another Budget since then and it seems an awfully long time ago&mdash;the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, explained that because I was referring to this point so often he thought mention should be made of it.  His argument for not giving an allowance was that it would upset the whole set-up, that it would mean that something would have to be done which would cost a lot and, according to him, would give very little relief to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of the Minister for Labour last night, the Minister for Finance may consider seven shillings in the £ on every £ over £6 10s per week for a single man and over <Col N="1368" /> £10 10s per week for a married man with no family, not very much.  Maybe he considers that £3 a week is not very much but it is an awful lot to a man who is working on a job&mdash;and getting overtime maybe now and then&mdash;which is not a permanent job.  It means that if he is laid-off at any time during the year, as he well may be, he will have to live on social assistance until he gets another job.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of the State towards income tax allowances is wrong.  This is typified by the cases I have instanced.  It is also typified by the approach of the Government to old age pensioners.  If a man works until he is 65 and maybe, as happens in many cases, pays into a pension scheme and, at the end of his working life retires at 65 years of age with a small pension, he is entitled to draw unemployment benefit for himself and his wife and his children until he is 70 years of age and there is no question of income tax being deducted. However, as soon as he reaches 70 years of age and he transfers from unemployment benefit to his contributory old age pension, he must immediately fill up a form and he is liable for income tax on every shilling earned over £6 10s if he is single and £10 10s a week if he is married.</P>
    <P>Maybe the State considers that a man of 70 years of age requires less to keep him.  Maybe they think he is no longer of very much use and it does not matter a whole lot if he goes hungry.  If we apply this to the State itself, there would be very big changes in the Government benches, in the Dáil, and indeed outside it.  Apparently, the approach is that, if persons are so poor that they are unable to avail of the services of talented and trained people to fill out their tax forms and if they are unable to pay for advice as to how they should avail of every loophole in the legislation, then they are fair game for the State and for the income tax authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the things which really annoys me is the fact that most of those people seem to feel that it is the particular official dealing with their case who is responsible for everything, that it is the official who replies to their form and sends out the tax free <Col N="1369" /> allowance who is responsible for the money deducted from their pay packets.  It should be explained to everybody who does not understand it that the people responsible for the deductions are the Government and particularly the Minister for Finance who is the man who frames the Budget and who allows or disallows the tax free allowance in general.</P>
    <P>This whole question of income tax has changed greatly since PAYE was introduced.  Before that there were numerous loopholes and when it was introduced, with the exception of State employees, everybody who was earning a wage or salary was put on PAYE and arrangements were made for a weekly deduction of income tax.  I do not know whether it is true but it is alleged when the time comes for the issue of tax free allowances each year there appears to be absolute chaos in some of these tax offices where people are trying to handle a volume of mail which they have no hope of dealing with before the tax year starts.  The result is that many people do not get their tax free allowances in time and the employer feels obliged to make a deduction from the entire wage or salary until the allowance arrives.  This is something which should be dealt with before the start of another tax year.  It is something which the Minister should try to have remedied.</P>
    <P>I made representations to him in this House about conditions in this city.  A man goes in to fill up a tax form and finds that he is lined up in a double queue with his next door neighbour standing beside him.  A shutter is opened and a little girl asks for numerous details about his income and he has to give them in front of his neighbour and other people.  This system is all wrong; it is wrong for the people who are providing the information and it is wrong for the people who are getting the information.  Strictly speaking, this may not be a matter which is covered by this motion but it is something which should get more attention than it has got.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured me that he would make arrangements to ensure more privacy and to have better arrangements generally, particularly in the city offices, but the effort to improve <Col N="1370" /> them can only be described as pathetic.  We still have the cubicles which put one in mind of former days when a fellow who was looking for drink knocked on a shutter which was opened and if he had the money he was given the drink.</P>
    <P>In addition to the case I have made this evening, there are numerous cases of people, mainly in the country districts, where the custom has been that the family stay together in one house and one person is responsible for the upkeep of the house and that person must bring in a week's wages. The income may sustain the man himself, his sister, perhaps, and maybe an aged mother and father.  Very often when the parents die the sister remains on as the housekeeper and it seems ridiculous that what happens is exactly the same as what happens in regard to social welfare, that the sister is not reckoned as a dependent relative, the man is treated as a single man and must fill up a tax form and pay on all money received in excess of £6 10s 0d a week.  It was increased from £6 5s to £6 10s by simply including the cost of the stamp.  Before that they could claim social welfare insurance but now it is included and they do not claim.</P>
    <P>This is one of the things which are causing a lot of annoyance and distress. When I am replying to this debate some evening next week I propose to give figures which will show how unfairly this works.  In addition, I propose to give figures to show that while over the years the tax free allowance given to a person with the big salary has increased in percentage the allowance given to the person at the bottom of the table is very much less than it was.  Deputy Corish moved a motion which was almost similar to this on 22nd February, 1966 and it was debated and, surprisingly enough, it was voted on.  The Fianna Fáil Party <i>en bloc</i> voted against it and the motion was defeated.  I suggest that when this motion has been debated here, since it is something that is desirable, since it is something with which most of the speakers on the last occasion agreed, including the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, it should be adopted by the House and the Government should make some effort before <Col N="1371" /> the next Budget to have some of the proposals put into operation.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense that in 1960-61 the tax free allowance was £6 5s 0d and the average rural wage was about £5 to £5 10s 0d a week and the income, therefore, which could be earned over the ordinary wage, tax free, in overtime was £1 to £1 10s 0d a week, and that in 1968 when the average rural wage is around £10 per week the tax free allowance is still £6 5s. 0d.  No amount of juggling with figures by the Acting Minister for Finance or anybody else can alter the fact that a man who is getting a bare subsistence on a wage of £10 per week now has to pay tax on £3 10s 0d to £4.  It is not only unfair but it is morally wrong for any Government to carry on as this Government have been and deducting tax from workers who have barely enough to live on.</P>
    <P>The last time this matter was discussed a number of points were made, one of which I thought was something which would have been adopted immediately by the Government.  It was in a reference to page 17 of the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation where at paragraph 39 they stated:</P>
    <P>We recommend that a widowed person should be entitled to the equivalent of the married allowance for the four years following that in which widowhood commences and that, after this time, he or she should be entitled to the unmarried allowance only.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister, when he comes to speak, tell us why this perfectly reasonable suggestion has not been adopted? On page 17 there are very convincing arguments in favour of it.  I believe this recommendation should have been adopted years ago.  There does not seem to be any point in setting up a commission like this while having no intention, apparently, of considering the recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>This question of income tax will continue to be raised here by us irrespective of whether or not this motion <Col N="1372" /> is adopted.  Unless we keep prodding the Minister and his Government nothing will be done to improve conditions. The Minister for Finance seems to think that the implementation of these recommendations would cost a great deal of money and necessitate a great deal of change.  One of the things that causes a great deal of trouble and one of the reasons why the lower paid worker finds it difficult to claim his full allowance is that the forms, even the most recent type of form is so difficult that the ordinary person simply does not understand what is required.  It would almost seem as if these forms are framed in order to trip up the unwary so that they may make mistakes and can then be told: &ldquo;That is what you said yourself on your form.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another improvement could be brought about where the tax free allowances is concerned.  Duplicate forms are sent with the request that they be filled in quickly so that the following year's allowance can be sent out early.  I suggest these should be held until the end of the year when they would have some meaning for those who get them.  Usually recipients throw them away or return them saying they have already filled up a form.</P>
    <P>With regard to allowances under PAYE, there is no reason why those who have to pay income tax should not pay it on wages or salaries in excess of, and well in excess of, an amount which would keep them in frugal comfort. It is nothing short of disgraceful that sections of the community should be required to pay income tax on money which the State itself admits, because some of the statutory bodies fix the sum, is barely sufficient to keep body and soul together.  The Agricultural Wages Board fixed a minimum rate of wages and that wage is taxed.  When we see those who do not have to pay income tax, some of whom get away with it on fine fat salaries, it is ridiculous that the unfortunate man on the bottom rung of the ladder should always be asked to pay more than he can afford.</P>

As a race we do not take the law relating to income tax very seriously and, when we are asked why we did not make our proper contribution to the running of the State through income tax, we look back at once to the bad old days when we were governed from abroad and we say that it is a penal tax and everybody who can get out of it gets out of it. Up to a point that was all right when we did not have PAYE but, since the introduction of PAYE, those on the bottom rung of the ladder are now caught in the net even more stringently than other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there was provision in a recent Finance Act making it obligatory on all sorts of people to keep accurate records and it is an offence not to keep such records.  However, I still think there will be considerable scope for evasion and, because of that, the system is neither fair nor just.  It is immoral.  The whole system needs to be revised.  Leaving that aside, the personal allowance has not been increased to any appreciable extent for many years.  The value of money has declined while the cost of living has increased.  The personal allowance is in or about the same. That is not fair because it really means a substantial increase in the effective rate of income tax each year.  It may be that this is not an easy problem to deal with.  It may be that the money <Col N="1374" /> which would not be collected in this way would have to be collected in some other way.  I certainly think that as a step in the right direction the personal allowance, the child allowance and, indeed, the dependent relative allowance should be increased.</P>
    <P>I have not, I must confess, prepared myself very well for this debate.  I was taken at rather short notice, but this is something I feel strongly about.  I think I am correct in saying that the dependent relative allowance has stood at £60 for many years&mdash;certainly for as long as I can remember.  If I am correct in that, it needs revision.  As I have said, the personal allowance up to a certain grade of income needs drastic revision.  So do the child allowance and the dependent relative allowance.  Only in that way can justice be done to the lower income group and the fixed income group.  It should be the object and the mission of the Government of the day to ensure that any tax imposed is a fair tax, and that it falls evenly on all sections of the community and on all those who contribute to it.</P>
    <P>As I said, we do not believe that the income tax code as it stands at the moment is fair or reasonable.  Part of the reason for that is that many people still regard it as an unjust and penal tax, and treat is as such.  It is the people on fixed incomes and comparatively low incomes, and lower incomes, who fall fully into the net.  A glaring example of a failure of the Government to face up to this problem fairly and squarely was their attitude in the last Budget and the previous Budget.  I think I am correct in saying that in both of those Budgets some relief was given to the surtax class. Up to the year before last, anyone who earned over £2,500 became liable for surtax but in the 1967 Budget, I think it was, certain earned income relief was allowed to the surtax class which meant that a person earning up to £3,750 was exempt from surtax, providing it was earned income and not unearned income.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me correctly, this year the surtax class got a further relief and another £750 of earned income was declared exempt.  That was quite unjustifiable in a Budget which <Col N="1375" /> gave no relief of any description in the personal allowance for the lower income group.  The personal allowance for the lower income group was not increased either in the 1967 or the 1968 Budget whereas, as I have said, the earned income relief for the surtax group was increased in both Budgets.</P>
    <P>These are my personal views on the subject.  I hope that whoever is framing the Budget in 1969, if we have not yet another before then, will pay considerable attention to the praiseworthy views and praiseworthy calls contained in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Income tax as it is operated in this State is a grossly unfair and penal imposition upon one section of our people, that is, the section who are in the PAYE class, the Pay As You Earn category.  One might say it is applied almost exclusively to this category when one thinks of the facilities available to professional people and others to evade by one escape route or another their responsibilities in regard to income tax.</P>
      <P>The PAYE class, as it is called, is made up predominantly of industrial workers, and also includes agricultural workers working for wages, as well as those employed by the State or local authorities.  That is to say, any worker whose wages are returnable in any form enters into the PAYE class.  This is the section of the population which pays far and away the greater amount of income tax.  For the reason that it is applied in this fashion income tax is grossly unfair.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the widow who is in receipt of a widow's pension in this city and has to work, as so many of them do, as office cleaners, as they do in this House in the early hours of the morning.  They are subject to income tax, and must pay income tax.  Take the married man whose family has gone from him, he must pay income tax. Perhaps a man has no family and there are just himself and his wife, and his wife is in employment also, they are subject to income tax.  If his wife is not employed he will be taxed on any earnings he has in excess of £11 or something in that neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Think of the many thousands of ill-paid <Col N="1376" /> State employees Deputy Tully has mentioned, workers who come under the various Government Departments, whose wages are known and returned automatically to the Department of Finance, because that Department control the amount paid in each such case.  They are all made to pay income tax, as are pensioners.  One case comes to mind.  Last week I had a man in with me who was in receipt of £8 a week by reason of having very long service with Dublin Corporation as a labourer.  At the end of a long discussion that man said to me: &ldquo;There is something I do not like to mention to you, but I did my share, or what I think was my share, at the time when this country was in trouble.&rdquo;  I asked him was he a member of the Old IRA or what, and he said: &ldquo;I was in the City Hall.  I was with Joe Connolly on the roof of the City Hall in Easter Week.&rdquo;  That man was unassuming and unwilling to talk about it.  He has every right to talk.  He is a man who had taken great risks and had been in what was possibly the bitterest fighting of all in the City Hall where the casualties exceeded those of Mount Street Bridge. He did not want to talk about it.  He gets £8 a week for his long service of 40 years with the corporation and he has to pay 10/- a week income tax out of that.  That strikes me as most unjust. It would strike one as unjust apart from his background, but in the context of his background it must surely be apparent to everybody that income tax as we know it, or the code as applied, is very unfair to the people.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people caught by this tax are industrial workers.  They are workers employed in industry by various firms who are required by law to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners. There is no escape for them.  They are taxed on their wages and on their overtime.  They are taxed on their gross earnings.  Every half-penny they get is returnable and they are taxed on it.  They are required to pay income tax.  If they were wealthy people and were in jobs which were well paid, which, of course, they are not, they could afford the services of income tax assessors or accountants who are well versed in the methods whereby evasion may be managed.  The <Col N="1377" /> fact of the matter is that in this country, and it seems to be the case in every country, the more wealthy classes regard it as quite in order and as part of the ordinary game of life to evade so far as possible, by fair means or foul, the payment of income tax.  Whatever may be said about that, and I am not one to moralise on these things, I simply want to point out that here we have the perfect setting wherein the well-to-do can get away with it.  They can have the skilled services to enable them to get away with it while the ordinary worker who is hard pressed to live with the increases in his living costs with each succeeding month is trapped by the income tax code.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government have a duty to do something about this.  That is the reason why we put down this motion to enable us to air in the Dáil the grievance of such a large section of the working population and the unfairness of imposing this tax on one section almost exclusively.  I am told by those who profess to know that the Revenue Commissioners suffer from shortage of staff and that the upshot of this is that they are not enabled because of their shorthandedness to make investigations that they would be required to make in regard to most of the individuals earning high salaries or getting big profits in the course of their business activities, for instance.  There are not enough people to undertake the prolonged and tortuous research that might be called for to establish the debts which these people owe to the State.  This is a handicap.  It means, apparently, that there is a random system of examination pursued whereby individuals are selected for investigation more or less, as it were, by chance and that there cannot be, because of inadequacy of staff, a proper and thorough investigation of all the people who might be deemed to fall due to pay tax and who are escaping without paying tax.  The case may be made that if sufficient staff were employed the expenditure would not be justified by the amount of the return they would bring in.  I am not in a position to know if that is correct.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of people getting away without paying tax who <Col N="1378" /> are far better able to pay it than those caught in the trap of having to pay it by reason of the fact that their wages are known to everybody.  In the last couple of Budgets concessions were made to surtax payers, that is, tax-payers who pay a high rate of tax because they receive a very high salary. A case was made, following submissions by the Federation of Irish Industries, that the policy being pursued was resulting in the discouragement of managerial talent and expertise coming to this country, and that such people were being taxed more heavily here than they were across the water with their resultant loss to this country.</P>
    <P>The Government as a gesture, apparently, towards retaining or attracting these elements to industry made surtax concessions.  If they can do that in such an instance, surely there is an unanswerable case for doing it for the people who are really unable to meet the ordinary cost of living and who are still compelled to pay tax and from whom tax is still demanded? Another point which has been made many times is that the levels of tax relief have been fixed for many years and that this has had the effect of bringing more and more people within what is called, for want of a better description, the income tax net by reason of the consistent inflationary tendencies which are apparent so far as money is concerned.  The idea that wages have advanced is illusory and totally false.</P>
    <P>The fact is that real wages have not advanced to any appreciable degree. The value of money has been dropping. At the same time, the superficial or apparent improvement in wage rates over a long period of years has brought into the income tax net many thousands of people who were not affected before although the real economic position of such people had not been improved to any appreciable degree in the meantime.  In fact, the case could well be made that their economic position, speaking in terms of real wages, in terms of real standard of living, had depreciated.</P>
    <P>This policy of non-interference with income tax reliefs which has prevailed here for so long has been a very subtle and insidious way of exacting <Col N="1379" /> more taxes from those who are least able to bear the brunt.  The sum of £6. 5. 0. per week is the amount a worker is now permitted to earn before taxation begins.  Surely no person of commonsense will argue or suggest for one moment that that figure has any relation to reality?  What can be got for £6. 5. 0.?  Take an individual living on his own.  There are people paying more than £6. 5. 0. as rent for a single room flat in this city, apart from the matter of food and the other necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>It is high time that there was a review of the whole income tax code. The Labour Party has long been seeking such a review.  We put down this motion in an effort to bestir this lethargic Government to do something about it.  It may be that in doing something about it some tender toes will have to be trodden on but in order to secure justice for those who are entitled to it and who are not in receipt of justice it is sometimes necessary to make life slightly less luxurious and comfortable for other sections.  We know that this is a course of action that does not commend itself to political Parties or Governments at any time but it is a course of action which tests the real strength of Governments and the <i>bona fides</i> of Parties, the question being whether they are prepared to do something which might cause certain irritation, and could cause no more than irritation, amongst the wealthier sections. One can use one's imagination as to who are the wealthier sections in this country at the present time.  Unlike the Minister for Education, I do not propose to spell it out.  We all know where the wealth lies and we all know the areas where no tax is imposed and we know where the tax falls most heavily, which is upon the working people and, in the last analysis, heaviest of all upon the industrial workers in the cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion that the whole income tax code be revised.  I realise that the income tax code is probably the most unpopular method of extracting money from any section of the community, that it has been unpopular since it was established by, as has been said earlier, an alien government and for that reason, of course, had to be unpopular at the time.  Any government in formulating or fabricating a tax structure must at least have in mind the necessity to be completely fair to every section of the community that has to bear the tax.  A government is not doing its duty in a moral or Christian manner that does not examine in every detail the methods of tax extraction to ensure that they do not bear too heavily upon any section and above all, do not bear too heavily on the poorer section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience of having to fill in tax forms for unfortunate workers who are getting very little over £6 a week&mdash;£7, £7 10s and £8&mdash;and who are faced with the fact that they have to pay income tax.  Having regard to the present high cost of living, it is unrealistic that a single man earning less than £10 a week should have to pay income tax on that.  It is high time that persons earning less than £10 a week were exempt from income tax <Col N="1381" /> and, in addition, that the methods of assessment for the purpose of tax relief were reviewed.  There are workers on the Moy drainage scheme, for instance, who have to travel 20 miles to work and have to provide their own transport.  A worker may have a car or a few workers may have a car jointly. Surely, these workers should be entitled to a rebate of income tax in respect of such transport costs?  If a worker has to travel by motorcycle he must wear expensive protective clothing. In many cases, workers are not provided with protective clothing needed for the work they do and must provide it for themselves.  Mayo County Council workers have to provide their own protective clothing. Although the county council would wish to meet the workers on this point, we cannot provide them with such clothing on account of the rate being so high in the county.  There should be a rebate of income tax in respect of the provision of protective clothing and transport costs.</P>
    <P>In reference to the forms, from time to time everybody, whether in the Dáil or in the local authorities, is called on to help his neighbour to fill a form and, I suppose, with postage charges so high at the moment, more people come to us to have their forms filled and sent away for them than ever before.  Anybody who sees and examines an income tax form will say that it was devised by somebody with nothing better to do than to make it as difficult as it could be made.  It seems to have been designed by a fellow doodling on a pad who came out with a form that he or anybody else could not understand.</P>
    <P>If people have to suffer under penal taxes, like the lower paid workers have to do, they should at least get a form that somebody without the mind of a computer could understand.  I do not know who designs the forms but I ask the Minister or somebody in his Department to examine the individual who designed them to try to get him to issue a form that will be readily understandable.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said the time has come for a complete revision of the tax code. I do not wish to repeat the arguments <Col N="1382" /> already well made by other Deputies but I appeal on behalf of the lower income groups to the Government to give full consideration, between now and the next Budget, if they are here by then, to having the tax code made more realistic and fairer to every section.  I suggest that instead of suddenly introducing a tax at Budget time in order to bring in a certain amount of money, the Government should devise a code that will be fair to everybody from top to bottom, and to ensure that this code will take in the people mentioned by Deputy Dunne who are able to evade it at the moment&mdash;the chancers, the speculators making a £½ million without paying their dues to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Writing about socialism once, George Bernard Shaw said: &ldquo;You would know a good Budget by the fact that income tax went up&rdquo;.  At that time, the ordinary worker was not liable for income tax.  Since Shaw's time things have changed completely and now in Ireland people with an income of £6. 5. 0. or £6. 10. 0. per week are liable.  Deputy Dunne said the figure is £6. 5. 0. but I think it is £6. 10. 0.  Anyway, the five shillings does not make a terrible difference. That is the case of a single man, but if you take a married man without children and add the £140 allowance he gets for his wife it brings the figure to £8, £8. 10. 0. or £9 a week.  If we take the average wage in the Republic as being roughly £13 and take the income tax at 7/- in the £, the amount paid by that man in tax is considerable.</P>
      <P>That is not the only financial burden on that man.  He pays his insurance, possibly he pays into a sickness fund and, as well, the corporation, the urban council or the county council, exercising their rights under the differential rent system, assess him on his gross wages.  Should he endeavour to sacrifice his leisure in order to earn a little more from overtime, he must pay increased rent and he will lose his medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all this, the income tax people are so inhuman that they think this is an encouragement to productivity: those of us who have influence <Col N="1383" /> with the workers are being asked to encourage them to build up the State.  We have heard President de Gaulle in France asking the workers to work for France.  Those who work in Ireland have to give it to the Revenue Commissioners, to the housing authorities and at the same time they lose their medical cards.  Is there any reason why our workers should not say: &ldquo;So long as we can keep our wives and families in ordinary comfort we will not endeavour to bring about the extra production we are asked for&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Our income tax system has degenerated to a very low level when it takes money from a single man with £6 10s a week or a married man without children who earns £8 or £9 a week. There is little more encouragement for a man with a number of children who is capable of earning up to £14 a week. We can think of Dáil Deputies earning a considerable amount more and at times feel ashamed to see ordinary working people scraping the barrel in order to live, to see them having sums of money deducted from them because, due to ignorance or annoyance, they did not fill in their forms. Nearly their entire wages are swept away at once.</P>
    <P>The tax code should be examined seriously on the question of overtime. That, to my mind, is one of the vital things.  It can affect production and it can affect our gross national product. The ordinary workers cannot understand why they should be asked to do this when they know that doctors, dentists and others can have monetary rewards handed over to them without entering them in their books, without any apparent transaction having occurred, people who earn £40, £50 and £60 a day, while a single man earning £6 10s a week is fleeced.  In such circumstances it is not possible for workers to co-operate.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church say that it is no sin to do the income tax people. This has been the teaching of the Church for years.  I have never agreed with it because I have always thought that we have a duty to the State to pay our taxes.  However, I take pleasure whenever can in adding to and <Col N="1384" /> maintaining the wages earned by ordinary workers.</P>
    <P>Let us take a county council or forestry worker.  He buys a motor cycle, a Honda, or whatever it is.  This costs good money and he buys the machine not for pleasure but because he wants to go to work and earn money to keep his wife and family.  Does he get any allowance for it?  Not a halfpenny; he does not get one sixpence for providing the means to earn money.  Deputy Lyons mentioned a clothing allowance. I do not know whether he is aware of it, but I asked for an allocation of £10 for clothing for forestry and county council workers and I got away with it. All Deputies should try to get £10 for this purpose, if not more.  The sum of £10 for protective clothing is very trivial.</P>
    <P>It makes me tired when I think of the people who evade taxes and get away with it when the ordinary working man, the county council and factory worker, has to pay.  A widow came to me during the past week.  She is getting a contributory widow's pension and she got a casual job with the county council for a few weeks. Immediately she earned £10 something in the region of £4 was stopped from her wages.  I know that probably she will get it back at the end of the year. Having approached Deputy Kyne, or whoever she will approach, she will get this back some time.  She has been living on a mere pittance and immediately she earns something down comes the hammer.</P>
    <P>I am not worried about my income tax.  They can stop it and they are welcome to it.  I do not care because I can afford to pay but I know that if I were back where I started earning about £10 a week and trying to keep a wife and family I would regret the fact that the Revenue Commissioners could take from me anything from 35/-to £2 a week.  I should like to support our motion mainly on the grounds that we have switched from the people from whom income tax was meant to take surplus money.  Now we have it as a penal tax on workers.  I warn the Government that workers will not work themselves to the stage where they will simply do overtime for the pleasure of <Col N="1385" /> giving the money back to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming increasingly difficult, and, perhaps, this is a good thing, to avoid tax within the law.  There is no doubt whatever that the references to the extreme weight of the tax burden on wage and salary earners are well founded.  I have spoken many times in this House on this code of taxation, the rules of taxation as applied to wage and salary earners.  There is no section of the tax rules which has been more strongly condemned by courts of law as inequitable. It is a maxim of the law that equity is a stranger to income tax.  In respect of no section of the tax code is this more true than in respect of the archaic and outmoded rules of taxation as applied to wage and salary earners.</P>
      <P>Seven or eight years ago when we had the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill here bringing in PAYE for the first time I was one of the few in this House who expressed grave misgivings about it.  I remember being criticised by some of the Labour speakers on this score.  It is true the trade unions had made a case to the Commission on Income Taxation urging the introduction of PAYE.  I was opposed to it because I felt that it was making the worker fair game for the ravages of the tax collector where other significant sections of the community were to some extent or other exempt from these ravages.  The event has proved me right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> It is interesting to hear a Deputy like Deputy Kyne speaking of his work in filling in income tax returns for workers on modest incomes of £10 a week.  I compliment Deputy Kyne on succeeding in getting a modest allowance of £10 for protective clothing for road workers.  One of the recommendations of the commission was that such lump sum allowances or concessions made available to certain sections of workers ought to be publicly announced so that all road workers could claim this £10.  This recommendation has not been implemented.</P>
    <P>When I requested the former Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, to make known these lump sum allowances, as they are termed, he refused to do so. This ultra conservative approach to tax procedure is something which should be booted out of the law for good and all.  The scale of personal allowances for individuals, for married persons and their children, is, of course, by reason of the impact of inflation completely out of tune with the times in which we live.  There have been no real significant increases in these personal allowances for many years and the effect of this is that persons who 15 to 20 years ago would not have been included in the tax net are now so included when one has regard to the real value of their pay packets adjusted in relation to inflation.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the Tax Rule No. 7 or 8 of Schedule E as applied to wage and salary earners is quite archaic and unjust.  It goes back to a British Act of 1856, if not earlier.  It speaks of the expenses involved in keeping a horse for travelling.  I should like to speak about this matter of travelling expenses as they affect the workers in my constituency.  They are very relevant, indeed, on this 27th day of November.  There are workers throughout Dublin and I am sure throughout the country, a substantial part of whose pay packets is eaten into by bus fares, travelling to work.  They ought, in equity, be allowed the necessary expense of travelling to their place of employment because they cannot earn their wages on which they are taxed unless they reach their place of employment. That is the simple logic of it. It is one of the hard and fast inequitable <Col N="1387" /> provisions of the tax code that travelling expenses for travelling to one's place of employment in no circumstance can be claimed as an allowable expense.  If one is in business or if one is a professional person using a car for the purpose of one's profession it is, of course, usual that one's travelling expenses are allowable.  The worker is very hard hit by this provision.  It is an unjust one and it should be repealed having regard to the grossly exorbitant fares charged on public transport in this city.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the least well off sections of the community being hardest hit by the income tax code. One of the least well off sections of the community is students.  There are, thank goodness, many ambitious young men and women in modestly remunerated employment who are attending universities and other institutes of education to advance themselves, to improve our national well-being, to increase productivity by acquiring new skills and new learning.  These people ought to be granted an allowance in respect of the fees which they have to pay to improve their mental equipment. An industrialist is allowed wear and tear on machinery which is worn out in the course of its use.  Drawing an analogy from that, is there not a case for allowing what one might term wear and tear on the human frame or allowing a young man or woman for improving his mental equipment for earning his living?</P>
    <P>It is commonplace to draw comparisons and contrasts between the effect of income tax on workers in this country and those in Britain and Northern Ireland.  We are told that income tax here is no heavier on persons earning up to £1,500 or so than it is in Britain.  This is not at all a valid comparison because we have not here anything like the welfare state services which are provided to these people, people on modest incomes, in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The personal allowances by virtue of inflation are now so out of tune with the times that it must be resolved to learn a lesson from the errors of the past, the errors of Ministers for Finance in the past 20 years who have failed to <Col N="1388" /> adjust the allowances, and peg them from here on to the cost of living index number so that they will automatically keep pace with inflation and no more than that year by year.  I believe, and I am expressing purely a personal opinion, that if the standard rate of tax has to be increased in order to provide the finance to increase the personal allowance let us face up to this and increase the standard rate so as to provide decent personal allowances. This will have the effect of impinging more heavily on the well-off but it will take the £10 a week road worker or farm labourer out of the tax net and it is only common justice that that should be done.  It is as simple as that. There is no answer to that claim in equity.</P>
    <P>The moral atmosphere which exists in respect of tax is very undesirable and is not in the national interest. Many workers labour under a sense of grievance by reason of the pay as you earn burden on them and the claim, sometimes exaggerated, exaggerated here this evening no doubt, about certain persons who fiddle their tax&mdash;a course of action for which I hope it is not necessary for me to say I hold no brief whatsoever and neither does any responsible Deputy in this House.</P>
    <P>I believe that the mind of this House, which the Government, if they are in office, which seems unlikely, should consider between now and Budget time is that top priority must be given to increases in the personal allowances.  We have exercised some pretty wrong priorities in the past. Previous speakers have spoken of the crazy priority exercised by the Minister for Finance in the Budgets of this year and last year when he allowed relief for surtax payers.  It did not cost very much admittedly and there were certain adjustments made in regard to those in the really high brackets but taking the position by and large as applied to surtax payers up to an income of £8,000 a year they did well out of this year's Budget and last year's Budget on the pretext, the dishonest pretext, of extending a concession to industrial technologists.  There may be a need to encourage industrial <Col N="1389" /> technologists to take up employment in this country but it was dishonest of the Minister for Finance on that pretext to extend the same concession to every shopkeeper, every businessman, every professional person in the country.  A method could have been devised to extend the concession to industrial technologists only.  It is perfectly clear what the priorities of the Fianna Fáil Government are in terms of income tax; it is perfectly clear to me that they have scant consideration for the industrial workers.  One can see here the Taca influence at work.  It suited the gentlemen of Taca to obtain the surtax relief which was extended to them in this and in last year's Budget.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I had given my colleague Deputy Hogan credit for the fact that he made many suggestions as to how the requirements of the Constitution could be met.  He has suggested many more infringements of county boundaries than the Minister has proposed in the Bill. He suggested putting Carrickbeg, which is part of the town of Carrick-on-Suir, in with Waterford and he suggested putting the town of Youghal into Waterford in order to make Waterford a four-seat constituency.  But, speaking here on 5th June in the referendum debate he suggested putting West Waterford in with Cork.  Since he has said this is not so I should like to refer to the Dáil Debates of 5th June, Volume 235, column 507 and I quote :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is easy to fix North and South Kerry.  They do not need very much. North Kerry makes little more than 1,000, and South Kerry 500.  Limerick West is a difficult problem; it needs 2,700 and South-West Cork, 3,700. However, considering that all these <Col N="1390" /> areas are contiguous and the three centre ones are under one local authority, by adjustment from the Waterford side, we would have 11,000 to play with; and with what has been taken from South Tipperary, you have 11,000 to match up the 8,000 needed for this adjustment.</P>
    <P>I know the people of West Waterford would resent this very much if it had to happen.  While it is true that they resented having to go into South Tipperary in 1961 they have become accustomed to being attached to that constituency and they would resent being kicked like a football from one county to another and finding themselves in with Cork on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan's suggestions today differ from those in that we would be reducing South Tipperary to a three-seat constituency by having Carrickbeg put in with Waterford.  The people of Carrickbeg would resent this because Carrickbeg is part and parcel of South Tipperary and of the town of Carrick-on-Suir, being within the urban district of that town.  Their loyalties are to South Tipperary and they would resent being taken from their own county.  I also know that the people of Youghal would resent having to come out of East Cork and go in with Waterford.  They would be the best part of 50 miles from Waterford city and it would be altogether impracticable to have them in the Waterford constituency.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has done in this Bill is the only practical thing he could do, seeing that we were defeated on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which, if passed, would allow for a variation of one-sixth below the minimum of 20,000 people per Deputy. This one-sixth would allow Waterford to return to a constituency in its own right and the same would apply to South Tipperary.  Seeing that that, with the help of the Opposition Parties, was defeated, I think the Minister has done the right thing in allowing West Waterford to continue with South Tipperary. If you were to take any part of South Tipperary or any part of Cork and add it to Waterford you would create new difficulties for the people of the area.</P>
    <P>It was altogether wrong of the Fine <Col N="1391" /> Gael Party, in particular, to put an advertisement in the Waterford papers a week before polling on the referendum saying that, whatever the result of the referendum, Waterford would return to its constituency in its own right.  Perhaps that is why Deputy Hogan today suggested adding part of South Tipperary and part of East Cork to Waterford in order to prove that this advertisement was correct.  I can say that the people of Waterford who were misled by this advertisement think very badly of it at this stage.</P>
    <P>We know that there are difficulties of representation when one is not a member of the county council for the constituency he represents in the Dáil. Deputy Hogan referred to the difficulty he finds in West Waterford due to the fact that he is not a member of Waterford County Council.  While I live adjacent to the town of Clonmel, I am a member of Waterford County Council and in that way the people of West Waterford will never find themselves short of direct representation as far as their affairs in West Waterford are concerned.  Also, in regard to South Tipperary, I can say that I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy on the many occasions when I have to write to the county council, phone them or visit them on behalf of the people I have the honour to represent. They have always treated my representations as they should be treated and I appreciate this very much.  I find no difficulty in making representations and I think the people have come to accept the situation there.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very good job of the very difficult task of carrying out the revision of the constituencies. I did not hear the contribution of any Member of the Opposition with the exception of Deputy Hogan who made many suggestions which were not in keeping with those he made on previous occasions.  It is quite easy for the Opposition to make many suggestions but it is an entirely different task for the Minister for Local Government who will have to see that the revision is carried out in the best interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Opposition Parties say that this <Col N="1392" /> is an attempt to gerrymander.  I do not know why they should say this; it is not.  Many Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House are as much affected as those in the Opposition, particularly rural Deputies, due to the loss of rural representation, because of the requirement of 20,000 people per Deputy laid down in the Constitution.  It must be remembered that this is something that the Opposition Parties advocated and when the people decided in the referendum that they were not worried about the breaking of county boundaries or about seeing that rural interests were properly represented here and when they were willing to let rural representation go to the cities, the Minister had no choice but to have the number of Deputies reduced in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As I said, this will affect Deputies on this side of the House as well as Opposition Deputies.  Many Deputies on this side of the House will lose their seats on account of this revision but there is no justification whatsoever in the accusations of gerrymandering which have been levelled at the Minister for Local Government.  It is a sad thing to see that the voice of rural Ireland is being lost in this House due to the defeat of the Third Amendment of the Constitution but the responsibility for that lies fairly and squarely on the Members of the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>The people of West Waterford, which is a rural area, would prefer to have Waterford returned to a four-seat constituency in its own right just as we have been advocating to them but, due to being misled by the Opposition Parties, they now find that Waterford must continue to be a three-seat constituency. In this three-seat constituency of Waterford, with the bulk of the population in the city, the constituency of Waterford will again be represented by people residing in the city of Waterford, due to the fact that the county has not got the population.  The only way in which to ensure that this will not happen would be to allow West Waterford to return to a four-seat constituency in its own right.  This was what we advocated to the people; it was something that we asked them to <Col N="1393" /> agree to.  I must say, however, that the people of West Waterford gave an overwhelming vote in favour of returning to Waterford, to their own county, to the county to which they owe their loyalties, but this was defeated by an overall national vote.</P>
    <P>I must say that what the Minister has done in this regard is that he has proposed to allow West Waterford to continue with South Tipperary because the people there have become accustomed to being in with that county and it would be altogether wrong to put West Waterford in with East Cork. It would be wrong, also, to reduce South Tipperary to a three-seat constituency and to have Carrick-on-Suir, Carrigbeg or Youghal put in there, making a four-seat constituency of Waterford.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Surgeon Hogan suggested putting Carrigbeg in with Waterford, it must be remembered that Senator FitzGerald suggested putting the entire town of Carrick-on-Suir into the Waterford constituency.  This was also suggested by Deputy Tom Kyne speaking at a meeting of Waterford County Council.  It is easy for a person within a county to suggest that the other county be broken up in order to maintain the seats of one's own particular county but it is not so with the Minister.  He has to look at the situation from an overall point of view and he must do what he thinks is the right thing in a very difficult situation&mdash;a very difficult situation that has been brought about by having the Third Amendment to the Constitution defeated.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on what he has done in this Bill in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, Deputy Surgeon Hogan and Deputy Treacy from the Labour Benches, went into this Bill in very great detail but, like Deputy Fahey, I shall confine myself to the area that I know best&mdash;the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some loose talk, if one may use the word, about the shifting of people from one county to another but it is quite evident that the <Col N="1394" /> people who have been shifted in the west of Ireland have been shifted in the direction of Counties Galway and Donegal.  It is not difficult to know the reason why they have been shifted to these two counties.  One need only look at the result of the recent referendum; one need only look at the result of the local elections; one need only look at the result of the Presidential election and one need only look at the last general election.  It is evident that the Government Party's vote is higher in these two counties than in any other county in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This could have been done much easier by shifting seven pieces of nine counties but rather was it done under the Bill by shifting 17 pieces of nine counties, almost 100,000 people.  This was completely unnecessary and I am sure nobody realises that more than the Minister for Local Government.  It was unnecessary to butcher county boundaries in the way that they have been butchered.  It can be seen from maps prepared by Senator Garret FitzGerald which were published in the daily papers that this could have been done and that it need only have affected six pieces of territory involving six counties and involving less than 40,000 people or, barely one per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>As I have asked before, why has Donegal not been made a five-seater? Why has Sligo not been made a three-seater? It would have been quite easy to do this.  Why could counties Roscommon and Leitrim not have been left together with five seats?  This Bill removes County Leitrim completely from the map of Ireland and I should like to remind the Minister for Local Government, before he does this&mdash;I should also like to tell him why he is doing it&mdash;that it was in County Leitrim that the first Sinn Féin candidate ever contested an election.  This was the late Charlie Dolan, who was an uncle of Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick&mdash; the man who opposes this Bill violently. Charlie Dolan resigned his seat as a Nationalist member of the British Parliament in order to contest that election for Sinn Féin.  He may have polled only 1,600 votes but, nevertheless, he was a Leitrim man and he answered the call of his native county. <Col N="1395" /> It was from Leitrim, too, that the late Seán MacDermott came.</P>
    <P>It is a desperate situation if it takes a native Government to wipe a county like this off the map.  One can be amused by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries making different statements about Partition and one can often hear uncalled for statements from Fianna Fáil about the 26 Counties, but I wonder if they realise that they are now reducing the 26 to 25 in order to try to hold on to office.  That is why it is being done.</P>
    <P>I admit that the population of Leitrim is only about 30,000 people but Fianna Fáil kept Leitrim on the map of this country while it suited them to do so.  In the 1927 general election, when Sligo and Leitrim were one constituency, the result was that Cumann na nGaedheal got four seats and Fianna Fáil got three.  If we take the election in which Fianna Fáil came into power in this country&mdash;maybe under false pretences but they came in anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have indicated their views very clearly in the referendum, in the last local elections and in the Presidential election.  In the 1932 general election Cumann na nGaedheal got three seats and the Fianna Fáil Party got four.  That was when they were riding on the crest of the wave.  In the quick election which followed in 1933 the position was somewhat similar: Cumann na nGaedheal, three; and Fianna Fáil, four.  In the 1937 general election Leitrim became a constituency on its own and the result was: Fine Gael, one; Fianna Fáil, two.  In the 1938 general election, the result was similar: Fine Gael, one; Fianna Fáil, two. <Col N="1396" /> In the 1943 election, with Leitrim still on its own, the result was Fine Gael, one, Fianna Fáil, two.</P>
      <P>In the 1948 general election Leitrim went back into Sligo and became a five-seat constituency, and the result was: Fine Gael, two; Fianna Fáil, one, and the late Ben Maguire won a seat as an Independent.  In the 1951 general election, with Sligo-Leitrim still a five-seater, Fine Gael got three seats and Fianna Fáil got two.  In the 1954 general election, Fine Gael got two seats; Fianna Fáil got two seats, and the late Ben Maguire regained the seat he lost in the 1951 election.  In the 1957 general election, Fine Gael got two seats; Fianna Fáil got two; and Sinn Féin gained a seat.</P>
      <P>We come now to the 1961 by-election in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. Fine Gael won that by-election by 2,500 votes from the Fianna Fáil Party, and that is the time the people of Leitrim rejected Fianna Fáil for the first time.  After the result of that by-election, when constituencies were being revised, Fianna Fáil did not know what to do with Sligo-Leitrim and they started gerrymandering. They switched 10,000 of the electorate to County Roscommon to make it a four-seat constituency and they left the balance of Leitrim with Sligo to make it a four-seat constituency.</P>
      <P>The result of the 1961 general election, was that the Fianna Fáil Party got only one seat, Fine Gael got two, and the National Progressive Democrats got the other seat.  That result came about because the people in that constituency knew the Government Party had been gerrymandering, and that constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim was created in order to secure the election to this House of Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Education. In the 1961 general election the result in Sligo-Leitrim, the four-seater, was Fianna Fáil, two; Fine Gael, two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1965 general election the result in Roscommon, a four-seater, was Fianna Fáil, two; Fine Gael, two. Fianna Fáil succeeded by a very narrow margin in securing the seat which was held by the National Progressive Democrats.  In the same election the result in Sligo-Leitrim was Fianna Fáil, <Col N="1397" /> two; Fine Gael, two.  Anybody who looks at the results of these general elections will see that the trend in these three counties, Leitrim&mdash;which has now been moved off the map of Ireland&mdash; Sligo and Roscommon was completely against the Government.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's constituency has been made a three-seater and he thinks he is protected, but we shall let the electorate decide that, and we have only to examine the results of the referendum to realise what will happen.  Before the local elections of 1967 &mdash; I think this helped to make up the minds of the Government Party&mdash;Fianna Fáil held 12 seats out of 22 in County Leitrim; Fine Gael held six; Independents held two, and Sinn Féin held two.  After the 1961 local elections Fine Gael held 11 seats, Fianna Fáil held eight, and Independents held three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only discussing the trend of voting.  That is the reason why County Leitrim has been butchered.  We find now that Donegal has got 5,831 voters from County Leitrim; Sligo has got 6,540 electors from it; and Roscommon has got 7,642 electors from it.  We were told in County Leitrim during the referendum campaign by no less a person than the Taoiseach that County Leitrim was going to be butchered, and let me say that the Government and the Minister for Local Government have done a very good butchering job on it.  Let me say as Leitrim man&mdash;although at the moment there is not much point in saying that when it seems to be removed from the map&mdash;I know the people of Leitrim.  I was reared in the county and have lived in it all my life. The Minister for Local Government and the Government Party can take it from me that, so far as Leitrim is concerned, they will rue the day when they took this action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four or five weeks ago I was in <Col N="1398" /> Leinster House when there arrived here every one of the Fianna Fáil councillors from Leitrim.  They were having their lunch in the restaurant and, funnily enough, I said to them: &ldquo;I suppose you are here today to give me the kiss of death,&rdquo; and they admitted they were up to discuss the constituencies. The reason the county councillors from Leitrim were brought up was that Fianna Fáil had no Member of the Dáil to talk to and no Member of the Seanad to talk to.  They brought up these county councillors to discuss with them what was going to be best for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>These people were in the House that evening, and I did not bring them into it.  It must have been the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Education. Let me come to the situation in County Roscommon.  I would like to make a few brief remarks about it before I sit down.  It is proposed in this Bill to take 1,500 voters from the portion of Leitrim that made up the constituency of Roscommon and put them back into Sligo/Leitrim.  It is not hard to know why that is being done.  It is not being done to help Deputy McLaughlin or myself, it is being done to help the Fianna Fáil Party.  Mark you, they are taking 1,227 voters from South Roscommon and putting them into Clare-Galway.</P>
      <P>In the Castlereagh area, which makes up West Roscommon, they are taking 3,474 voters and putting them into East Galway.  Again, it is not very hard to know why those people are being switched from a strong Fianna Fáil area into East Galway.  They are being switched on the recommendation of Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Education, because he wants to ensure that Councillor Moylan or Councillor Doc Callaghan cannot be candidates in the election.  It is quite obvious he is afraid to contest an election with either of those two councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> The axe did not stop there.  They have taken 2,809 voters from South Roscommon and put them in East Galway.  They have taken a total of, I think, 9,010 voters out of the old constituency of Roscommon and divided them between East Galway, Clare-Galway and Sligo-Leitrim in order to reduce it to a three-seater. This is the most interesting switch of the whole lot.  We find that they break the boundary of another county, County Westmeath, and take 3,140 voters into Roscommon from County Westmeath.  I suppose one could describe it as accidental but it is rather funny that again, in my opinion, the weakest candidate in this area lives in Athlone.  He is Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Education, and he is prepared and has agreed, to the division of his own native county into three, four or five parts in order to secure his election at the next general election.</P>
    <P>I believe I know the Roscommon people well enough to know they will resent this move and I have a notion where Deputy Brian Lenihan will find himself after the next election and that is where he found himself before the 1961 general election.  I want to say that all this switching is due entirely to the decrease of population in both those two counties and I do not think the Government Party can deny this.</P>
    <P>In 1926 the population of Leitrim was 55,907 people.  That was just before Fianna Fáil came into office.  In 1966 the population of the county dropped to 30,572 people, a total drop of 25,333 under the present Government. The population of County Roscommon when Fianna Fáil came into office was 83,556 and that population is now 56,228 people, a drop of 37,328 people during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that this is rather amusing.  We have a number of vacancies here in this House&mdash;at least one vacancy to be filled for some time&mdash;and poor Miss Pearse, may the Lord have mercy on her soul, was not cold in her grave before the Taoiseach found time to appoint a Senator from <Col N="1400" /> County Leitrim where Fianna Fáil have no representation.  It would suit them better if they filled the vacancies which exist in this House.  We all know why this man was appointed so quickly.  He was appointed in order to have him groomed as a candidate in the next general election.  I want to tell this House and the Fianna Fáil Party that it is a pure waste of time because they will get their answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, first of all, that I had brought home to me just how much time was devoted by the Fianna Fáil Party to this Bill, to the referendum and to all that goes with trying to install themselves in office for 30 years when I went down to the Library to refresh my mind on what had been said on the Budget last spring.  I found there, as I went through the debate, that there were probably eight, nine or ten occasions when this Dáil debated either the Referendum Bill or something else to do with changing the electoral system.  There were more entries regarding this than there were on any other business.  It is sad that we are here at this time of the year, with so many financial and economic difficulties facing us, still discussing how Fianna Fáil are endeavouring to keep themselves in power for the longest possible time and against the wishes of the majority of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now dealing with a Bill, which presumably will become an Act, because of the majority which Fianna Fáil now enjoy in Dáil Éireann.  It will probably become an Act unchanged. This Bill is brought in here in another effort to get more value for the votes cast for the Fianna Fáil Party than those which shall be cast for anybody else.  We have heard Deputy Reynolds, a responsible Member of this House, stand up here and tell how the Fianna Fáil councillors from Leitrim came up here to discuss with the man sitting opposite, the Minister for Local Government, how he should break up the various areas of Leitrim in relation to the forthcoming election, what counties they should be scattered to and where they would get the most votes.  Mark you, this drawing up of the constituencies <Col N="1401" /> was not done as laid down by the High Court judgment, to which I shall refer later, and as was laid down in the Constitution where the phrase &ldquo;so far as is practicable&rdquo; was mentioned.  This was done at the grassroots to find out where the majority could be got in one area for Fianna Fáil which would give the least votes to the Opposition. I think the Minister will not deny this when he is replying&mdash;he can do so now if he wishes&mdash;that he conferred with every Deputy in his Party and with every possible county registrar and every sworn Fianna Fáil supporter to see that he got the best for his Party. In fact, the people of Ireland have given him his office as a Minister of this State for the purpose of doing what is just and proper and, in relation to constitutional law, what is laid down by the Constitution.  Such is the prostitution of the Fianna Fáil Party that I am quite certain that he does not think there is anything wrong with that.  Such are the depths to which they have descended.  That is for them.  For my part, I shall certainly try to preserve standards and, perhaps, to look with some sort of charitable eyes on the standards of those who have debased themselves in such a manner.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that, in fixing these constituencies, the Minister proposes that 101,000 people all over Ireland shall be moved from their natural voting place, that that number of people throughout the country shall be displaced.  A responsible Senator, who is also a well-known economist and statistician, and a responsible Deputy of this House, Deputy P.J. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i>, have each produced an alternative means of doing this and, in each case, the number of persons displaced was well under 50,000 and, indeed, nearer to 40,000.  In so doing, these two gentlemen have left themselves open to very heavy criticism because they could be told, in various areas throughout the country: &ldquo;You are moving us this way while Fianna Fáil were going to move us there.&rdquo;  These two gentlemen have done a great service to the Irish people by pointing out how this could be done while displacing less than half the number of persons who will be displaced by the Government proposal <Col N="1402" /> which is for the sole purpose of giving more value to a vote for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of the quotation given by the Minister in his opening remarks.  I propose to quote from page three of the Minister's opening statement which gives an extract from the Supreme Court judgment setting out their attitude to the provisions of subsection 3º of section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.</P>
    <P>That does not mean we want an exact parallel.</P>
    <P>The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions. The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.  The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have.  Its decision should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article.</P>
    <P>I want to point out how far the court went to try to make it easy for this House not to butcher Leitrim or Louth or anywhere else for the base purpose of politicians.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted.  This, of course, is not to say that a Court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I come now to the important part of the quotation:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> To justify the Court, in holding that the sub-section has been infringed it must, however, be shown that the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the sub-clause.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Court the divergencies shown in the Bill are within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>That means that the Bill, as produced by Fianna Fáil in 1961, was regarded by the court as lawful.  They had at that stage, decided they would bind themselves.  The important point is that this was their decision, not the decision of the court, to bind themselves to a divergence of five per cent either way or a maximum divergence of ten per cent.  They decided that it was not the job of the court to say that a divergence of 3,000 in, say, 15 per cent, or anything else, should be allowed: it was the court's duty only to point out whether or not what was done was lawful.  That does not mean that, forever and a day, that particular divergence could not be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil chose, from that, to bind themselves to this divergence for the sole purpose of butchering and of seeing to it that they could get at the constituencies.  In fact, this Bill relates directly to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill which was defeated by a colossal majority not so very long ago.  First of all, they bound themselves and then they sought to move legally from a divergence of five per cent either way or a maximum of ten per cent to one of 16? per cent or 33? per cent overall.  If they had got that with the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill then it would have been a case of God help the people of this country.  There would not have been a chance for any vocational group to make its protest.  We would have been visited by the Fianna Fáil steamroller in order to make two votes equal three.  Happily, such did not occur.  Fianna Fáil have been moving, by way of progression <Col N="1404" /> from one stepping-stone to the other, in the first instance to gerrymander the constituencies on a small scale and then legally to try to gerrymander them on a fantastic scale.  They have been frustrated, in the first place, and now they are restricted by what they bound themselves to.</P>
    <P>Take no account of townlands, county boundaries, rivers, lakes, people, urban populations and rural populations; forget whether it is Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael; forget Fianna Fáil's base desires and their efforts to install themselves indefinitely in power: they could have produced reasonable constituencies and, without breaking the court ruling of a divergence of five per cent either way, they could&mdash;so long as they stayed along the boundaries created by urban and rural populations and along the mountains, lakes, rivers, and so on, that put our people into compact and proper units&mdash;devised an eminently more suitable proposal than that with which they have now come to this House. However, they were not interested in doing so.</P>
    <P>The units in which Fianna Fáil were interested were the units that would bring more Fianna Fáil representatives into this House&mdash;not necessarily the best people to be in this House, not necessarily the people who would have got the most votes if there were natural boundaries but people sworn to vote &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; according as Fianna Fáil dictated they should do.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that a responsible Deputy of this House, Deputy P.J. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i>&mdash;an eminent medical man himself&mdash;went to the trouble of doing a study in this matter. Likewise, an eminent economist and statistician who is a member of Seanad Éireann carried out such a study.  In their respective results, these two gentlemen were able to produce schemes of constituencies under which only slightly over 40,000 people throughout the country would be moved from where they vote at present.  An eminent Senator and an eminent Deputy did the same study and, with different movements, got somewhat the same results.  However, in order to butcher and to see that they got the most value <Col N="1405" /> everywhere, Fianna Fáil, even within the limits they imposed upon themselves, had to move 101,000 people throughout this State.  Why did Fianna Fáil behave in this manner in this Bill?  How can the Minister justify it?  Why could the Minister not accept, on Committee Stage, the suggestions of the eminent Senator and the eminent Deputy of this House?</P>
    <P>I now want to point to something that has made me very unpopular with the Taoiseach over the past few months. I say that for the actions of Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, the Taoiseach is responsible. This lark that we have all heard and the title I was guilty of giving him myself &ldquo;Honest John&rdquo; is the greatest cod that ever was.  Under the system of Government and Parliament in Britain, here and on the Continent the guideline is that a Prime Minister, Taoiseach, or whatever he is called in whatever the country, is responsible for every action of his every Minister. A Minister of State exists entirely and absolutely on the &ldquo;hire-em and fire-em&rdquo; basis and if the Minister here is guilty of producing a Bill which is improper, guilty of endeavouring to get more value for his own Party than the spirit of the Constitution under which we all serve intended, if he is guilty of acting improperly in relation to that Constitution and trying to get the best for his own crowd, then the man who is primarily responsible and who must answer for that is the Taoiseach and one knows his record in that regard when one recalls the actions of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Local Government which to say the least of it have been very improper indeed.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest in relation to some localised changes which are projected in this Bill and of which I have a certain knowledge that Fianna Fáil have acted entirely and absolutely for their own purposes.  I want to refer first to County Meath.  Over a period County Meath had developed into the position where you had one Fine Gael, one Fianna Fáil and one Labour Deputy elected.  The two Deputies elected on the Opposition side are excellent Deputies, men who are known in every <Col N="1406" /> parish in their constituencies, men who do their work well and who in my view will be elected again.  The other man, the Minister for Defence, is a man so long in political life in County Meath that he will be elected again.  Therefore, there was a <i>status quo</i> there. However, in Monaghan the position is very different.  The Minister for External Affairs who is sitting opposite me knows that when the stage was reached where there were going to be two Fine Gael Deputies in Louth and one Fianna Fáil Deputy, portion of the Fine Gael area in Louth was put into Monaghan, the exercise being on the basis that there were enough Fianna Fáil votes in Monaghan to take the extra Fine Gael votes going in.</P>
    <P>Then in the last election the horror broke.  The Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;I forget which Ministry he had at the time&mdash;was elected with a majority of 120 votes over the second Fine Gael candidate, Mr. William Fox. That meant, of course, that in Monaghan there was the danger but in Meath there was not.  In Meath there was the impact of Mr. Fox who is now on the Monaghan County Council, a young, energetic and able man who is coming up, and this was something that had to be feared.  They decided the best thing to do was to get a lump of another constituency and put it into Meath and to take a lump from Meath and put it into Monaghan, on the basis that this would not bear the stamp of Monaghan, would not have the impact of Mr. Fox and Deputy Dillon, and Fianna Fáil would still get home.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that was not necessary.  Meath did not need any move but if it did need any move it did not need two moves.  It was not necessary to add votes to it and at the same time take votes from it.  Why were votes added to it?  For a very simple reason. The constituency of Kildare was a four-seat constituency and added to it were parts of Westmeath.  Fianna Fáil just could not get any more in Kildare than they had and, therefore, the best thing to do was to make Kildare a three-seat constituency and leave a small portion of Meath therein.  That would mean that the gamble would be there and that Fianna Fáil who had a quota and three-quarters in the old constituency <Col N="1407" /> might, perhaps, make two out of three in the new constituency instead of two out of four in the old one.  This is the sort of thing that we want to talk about.  These are the things which prove that Fianna Fáil are not prepared to do anything except for their own base purposes.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the situation in relation to Cavan.  It was suggested that Cavan and Monaghan could have become a five-seat constituency.  In that situation there would be no doubt that the Government would have a minority and, therefore, the situation was preserved. Louth was left butchered as it was but it should be remembered that the people of Louth greatly resented the fact that Ardee was removed from them on a previous occasion and is still being left there.  The situation in Louth is that if it has not seen the surgeon's knife recently, the surgeon's knife was there some eight years ago.  We are still butchered.  It should be remembered, too, that on the day of the referendum the Fianna Fáil posters were all over the Duleek Gate Ward, that is everything south of the River Boyne, saying: &ldquo;Vote Yes or your town will be split in two.&rdquo;  You had the situation whereby the Minister for External Affairs and his colleague, the Minister for Lands, circulated handbills in my constituency and in their own in which we were told that the village of Collon, three miles from where I live, and I am only five miles from the sea, would go into Monaghan and we were told that more of Ardee and Barronstown would go into Monaghan.  Is that the sort of behaviour in which two Ministers of State should indulge?  They should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what the people of Louth were told on that occasion if they were foolish enough to go against Fianna Fáil.  It was &ldquo;If you do not want our proposals Louth will be decimated as Leitrim was.&rdquo;  Imagine a town of 17,000 people with, say, 6,000 on one side of the river and 11,000 on the other, being told that if they did not vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on that particular day the 6,000 would go into Meath.  In fact, the rumour immediately afterwards from Fianna Fáil was that the opposite <Col N="1408" /> was happening.  Everything in the end was done for Fianna Fáil's own purposes. I do not want to delay the House but I am convinced that there was no need for Fianna Fáil to confine themselves according to the ruling given in the Supreme Court in 1961 which was again quoted by the Minister today.  In fact, I quoted it myself in every speech I made in Louth during the referendum campaign.  There was no need at all for the Government to restrict themselves to this small amount in relation to the number of electors per Deputy.  In so doing they have enabled themselves to use and abuse the Constitution and ensure for themselves a larger number of Deputies here.  Have they succeeded?  I suggest that they have not.  The referendum campaign in which the Government were defeated by 267,000 votes, if you take a broad average of the two proposals, meant that the Government will stay defeated.  Nothing they can do will have any effect on their votes in the next election.  They are out but I also think that, perhaps, they have succeeded in keeping two, three or, perhaps, four good Fine Gael and Labour men out of the House and as such this is important and it should be nailed to their door.</P>
    <P>The fact that they bolstered their constituencies after 1961 has tied them. They did their best in Dublin city where they knew they would be decimated. They produce these four-seat constituencies instead of the normal three and five-seat constituencies.  What is the result?  The result is that with a lesser number of votes they will get two against two for the Opposition Parties.  If they get a lesser number of votes in a three-seat constituency they will get one against two for the Opposition Parties.  In a five-seat constituency, with a lesser number of votes, they will get two against three for the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>The Government are using every artifice to save their seats.  Perhaps, in Dublin city, they may save two or three.  We know they had in broad perspective a normal study of the situation and the Bill produced here shows the effort to gerrymander and shows, too, the noose they have tied around their own necks.  I maintain there is <Col N="1409" /> no question at all but that they are on the way out, and on their way out very, very quickly.  I suggest also that the figure I quoted of 276,000 votes against the Government is something that can be discussed in passing.  I want to get this across very, very clearly now: there is no need whatever for a majority against the Government of 276,000 votes to put them over here.  All that is needed is a swing of approximately 60,000 to 70,000 votes.  If the Government Party retrieve these votes out of a defeat of 276,000 votes, then they are not Fianna Fáil men; they are miracle men on their way out.</P>

      <P>The Opposition did not want single-seat constituencies.  They wanted to continue the present mess. I have gone through it all since June, 1927.  When I first came in here I represented a five-seat constituency.  I worked hard in it for ten years when, under the rules of the Constitution, a change had to be made and I found myself losing three-quarters of that constituency in one fell swoop.  The Youghal end of it was thrown into County Waterford and the northern end of it was thrown into North Cork and I was given what I had never seen before, South-East Cork, as it was called for the next ten years.  I had to fight my corner there and work hard again.  Lo and behold, ten years later they took a bit of South Cork off my then constituency and gave it to North Cork and made us a three-seat constituency for the third ten year period. I might say in passing that on each occasion, in a three-seat constituency, I brought in two Fianna Fáil men out of the three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last change came in 1961.  Lo and behold, I found myself then with a constituency stretching from Youghal right out to Rockchapel on the Kerry boundary.  Take a look at it on the map.  As I said, when I saw it first, nobody but someone in <i>delirium tremens</i> would draw the like of it.  We lost one of our members in the change <Col N="1410" /> and I had to take over his side of the county as well as my own until the next election.</P>
    <P>It is all right for people here in Dublin city or Cork city to talk, but, when you have a constituency stretching over 135 miles, you have cause for talking.  What I had to do was go out for a week and stay out and work it. I worked it and I increased our vote by 4,500 in four years.  Now we will have another change.  When a man knows he will lose half his constituency he does not bother too much about his constituents; he does not bother too much to work for them; he does not bother too much to do what we set out to do from 1916 to 1921, namely, to build up an independent nation here and close the gap caused by emigration by building up industries in which our boys and girls could find employment.</P>
    <P>I saw those changes.  I was in favour of the single-seat constituency; in such a constituency, if a Deputy did not do his job, he would get the high road very quickly, no matter to what Party he belonged.  I was in favour of the single-seat and I campaigned for it and fought hard for it.  But I was beaten by the Cork conglomeration and the hue and cry and all the foolish ideas the people fell for.  The Opposition, having succeeded in beating the referendum, are like the fellow that got a pint one day with a mouse in it; the publican removed the mouse but the fellow still refused to drink the pint.  He would not have it with the mouse in it and he would not have it with the mouse out of it.  The Opposition are not satisfied with defeating the single-seat constituency.  I still believe that you get a better representative in the single-seat constituency. You get a man who knows that if he has not done his job he is for the high road.  I know that no matter what constituency in Cork I stood for tomorrow morning I would be back here.  Deputies can be sure of that.</P>

      <P>I notice that for the first time Fianna Fáil have arranged 26 three-seat constituencies.  It seems that after the Presidential election, after the local elections, and after the referendum, Fianna Fáil are beginning to take notice.  They are getting the wind up.  I come from a county that has got one of the worst deals of any of the 26.  As a matter of fact, it has gone completely off the map when it comes to a question of naming the constituencies. It says here:</P>
      <P>It is proposed to add portion of county Leitrim to South-West Donegal and to make adjustments between the two existing Donegal constituencies. Another portion of Leitrim (and the small portion of Westmeath which is west of the Shannon) is joined to Roscommon to form a three-seat constituency (the present Roscommon constituency has four seats).</P>
      <P>Under the revision it will have three seats only.  It continues:</P>
      <P>The remainder of Leitrim is joined with Sligo to form a three-seat constituency (the present Sligo-Leitrim constituency returns four Deputies).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new provisions Sligo-Leitrim will have only three.  Now, in the list of constituencies on this Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968, we have South-West Donegal.  Leitrim has given 11,700 to that constituency.  You have Roscommon to which Leitrim has contributed about 11,000 more in order to make up that constituency.  Another constituency mentioned in this list is Sligo.  It all boils down to this: there is to be no Leitrim any more.  The Fianna Fáil Government talked a lot about doing away with the Border and about the freedom of this country. I am a Leitrim man, proud of Leitrim, and proud of the fact that in 1916, when this country was making its <Col N="1414" /> attempt to win freedom against the might of the British Empire, Leitrim produced one of the signatories to the Proclamation&mdash;Seán Mac Diarmaid, who went to his death with a walking stick because he was unable to walk without the stick&mdash;but it is a sad state of affairs, and one which Fianna Fáil have nothing to be proud of, to have to read in Leinster House a document like that.  Remember, there are people who followed in the footsteps of Seán Mac Diarmaid.  Until 1921, when the Truce was signed, they gave of their best throughout that county.  They will regret what has been done.  People may say this is due to the dwindling population.  Let us not forget that the dwindling population is due to the Fianna Fáil administration since 1932. In 1936 we had a population of 50,908, almost 51,000.  Let us not forget that the people would still be there but for the fact that they could not find employment. That is why it is now necessary to revise the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  We are left now at the low level of 30,572 people.  That, a Cheann Comhairle, is the history of Leitrim and that is the way it has been treated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I will say here and now that if Fianna Fáil are much longer in power the people will continue to go in thousands because they will not live under this taxation imposed on them by the Government.  The members of the Government will not come down and make any attempt to improve the position of these people.  The only time they come down to this county is when there is a referendum or an election. You meet them in the most rural areas at that time, but never again.  It was shouted off the house-tops during the last referendum how essential it was that Deputies should live near the people who elected them.  We were told of the nice compact constituencies we would have.  Fianna Fáil Deputies told us this.  Of course, they were only joking us, having no intention of letting us into these constituencies.  Now, when they have failed in the referendum, they come along with this bit of gerrymandering and divide this historic county into three parts.  One part goes to Donegal, one to Sligo and one to Roscommon&mdash;and that is the end of Leitrim. <Col N="1415" /> There is not a word about it in the constituencies mentioned here.  We have been talking a long time about what should be done about the Six Counties. We have heard since 1932 about what Mr. de Valera would do in order to get rid of the Border.  Instead of getting rid of the Border and adding to the 26 Counties Leitrim has been wiped out and we have been left with 25 counties instead of 26.  The Minister got rid of Leitrim.  As far as they possibly could they made sure that the Deputy to be elected would certainly be kept on the road.  In most cases they have removed the city Deputies from the people they would be representing.  The people do not know where they are.  Deputies have to study this very carefully to find out whether they are representing this or that townland or what polling booth is theirs.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency the whole of North Leitrim is gone, complete with Dromahair, Kinlough and Kiltyclogher. Manorhamilton, the birthplace of the great Seán Mac Diarmaid, and Dromahair and many other small centres, where the people had the courage, the strength and the determination to remain on their small holdings&mdash;all are gone.  During the last few years you all heard on television and on radio the song sung by Larry Cunningham and enjoyed by many people &ldquo;Lovely Leitrim&rdquo;.  That is the treatment &ldquo;Lovely Leitrim&rdquo; has got.  When the change of Government comes&mdash;and I hope it will be the next time&mdash;I trust that all those townlands will be sensibly revised again so that Deputies will find themselves back amongst those who elected them.  That is what should happen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This has all come about by the fact that Leitrim had been drained of population through bad administration. If Fianna Fáil had wakened up in time, this could have been avoided.  Deputy Cunningham knows that as well as I do as he comes through that county occasionally on his way to Dublin.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out here by Deputy Hogan, who went into full details, all this could have been arranged by the transfer of 22,024 electors instead of, as the Minister for Local Government proposes, a transfer of 59,274.  Deputy Hogan went to a great deal of trouble in order to give the people those details.  As I said earlier, I was told after the last local elections that this would happen in County Leitrim and I was not a bit surprised when it did happen.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the trend may I say that in 1936, when Fianna Fáil had been in power for about four years, the population of Leitrim was 50,908? In 1956, it had dropped to 37,056 and in 1966 it had gone down to the low level of 30,502.  The population of County Sligo also declined and I should like to point out that but for the fact that there was a growth centre in Sligo town, Sligo would have the same experience as Leitrim.  In 1936, the population was 67,447 and in 1966 it was down to 51,263.  As I have said, but for the fact that Sligo town was a growth centre, providing employment, there would have been the same decline in Sligo county as there was in Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly not to the credit of any Government that has been in office since 1932 almost continuously, with the exception of two short periods, that there has been this decline in the population.  As I said when speaking on the Budget, we must always remember that while taxation has reached an enormous figure, the population is only 2,800,000, a mere fraction, about one-quarter, of the population of London.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="1417" /> have made every effort to secure a majority for themselves in the next election by having 26 three-seat constituencies but the people have indicated quite clearly in the referendum what they intend to do at the next election.</P>

      <P>There is very little use in Deputy McLaughlin complaining now about the loss of seats in the west.  We warned the Dáil and the people as well as we could what was going to happen if we could not get the tolerance which was suggested in the Third Amendment, that if we had to keep within the restrictions laid down by Mr. Justice Budd, the representation of the west was going to fall from 33 seats to 30 and that the representation of Dublin would go up from 34 to 38 seats.  Fine Gael knew it very well but they were playing politics and made all sorts of scaremongering speeches and they had scaremongering posters put up suggesting that Fianna Fáil wanted to use the jackboot, that they were abandoning one man, one vote and wanted to make two rural votes equal to three city votes.</P>
      <P>That was their propaganda and Deputy McLaughlin was one of the representatives of Fine Gael who helped to promote that propaganda, to tell that untruth to the electorate, because he knew as well as Deputy Cosgrave, his Leader, and the others that what was going to happen if we had to keep within Mr. Justice Budd's restrictions was that in future four Dublin votes would be equal to five rural votes.  The reason that Leitrim has disappeared off the electoral map as a single entity is that that is the situation under this Bill and that is what had to happen if we were to keep within the limits laid down by Mr. Justice Budd.  If we had attempted to go beyond it, as is suggested by some of the Fine Gael speakers, and expand and give a tolerance of more than 1,000 plus or minus to various constituencies, again, a Fine Gael Senator or some other stooge of Fine Gael would take us to the High Court and take us to the Supreme Court and get the Bill annulled, as they did before.</P>

      <P>I do not regard Senator FitzGerald as a stooge of Fine Gael.  Certain other people are stooges of his because he is one of the persons who knew what was going to happen if the Third Amendment was defeated, and he said it to the Seanad.  He pointed out in the Seanad that the west was going to lose three seats, Dublin was going to gain four and he had a suggestion to make at that time which was quite new from the Fine Gael benches.  He suggested that if we accepted an amendment to base seats on the numbers of electorate with a tolerance of one-twelfth, this might not happen.  He claimed that he was speaking for Fine Gael. I should like to hear from Deputy Dockrell or Deputy Cosgrave was he speaking for Fine Gael.  It was the first time that this suggestion had been made from the Fine Gael benches that the seats should be allotted on the basis of electorate rather than on the basis of population and it was regarded by us as a mere gimmick.  But he claimed that he was speaking for Fine Gael and I should like to know was he speaking for Fine Gael.  Did he put that forward with the authority of his Party or was it just another gimmick to confuse and to delay?  Fine Gael are quite adept at that type of exercise. They have been practising it all their lives and that is what is keeping them where they are.</P>
      <P>They believed, and rightly believed as it happens, that if they played propaganda unfairly on the referendum they would get a victory&mdash;that they would get the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution Bills defeated.  Their campaign was based on false propaganda.  These things come home to roost and they are coming home to roost now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin will have to admit to the people that he deceived them.  He will have to admit that, <Col N="1419" /> instead of it being true that two rural votes would be equal to three Dublin votes, by helping to defeat the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill he left the country open to a situation in which five rural votes are only equal to four Dublin votes.  I emphasise what the Minister for Local Government has said on this Bill.  The Government have been compelled to allocate constituencies on the basis of the population.  Because of the difference in the population pattern between one constituency and another, between rural areas and Dublin city, we have this situation where 10,520 votes in Dublin are equal to 13,240 votes in rural areas; and instead of having one man one vote, you have 10,000 Dublin votes equal to more than 13,000 in South-West Donegal in the matter of the allocation of Dáil seats.</P>
    <P>We hope the electorate will put the blame on the proper quarters for this loss of four seats in rural constituencies and adding them to Dublin city and county&mdash;for doing it unfairly by keeping us within the restrictions laid down by the High Court.  Though we could keep Donegal and other western areas as low as possible in the matter of population per seat it was not possible to get a tolerance so wide as to prevent a situation in which four Dublin votes would be equal to five rural votes in the allocation of constituencies. Last night Deputy Cosgrave gave us, and his own backbenchers as well, a much-needed lecture on how to behave in the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>He told them not to behave in a manner that would bring democracy into disrepute.  He had very good reason for rebuking his Party in that way for their slanderous attacks but he would have done much better if he had given them a little good example which, it has been said, is far better than precept.  It is up to him to apologise and to withdraw the untrue statements that were made, the allegations, the slanderous attacks he made on the Fianna Fáil Government to the effect that all we wanted to do in <Col N="1420" /> the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was to make two rural votes equal to three Dublin votes.  That was posted on every telegraph pole all around the country on Fine Gael posters.  If he wants his Party to behave as they should he should apologise to Fianna Fáil, and to the Irish people for deceiving them into believing that if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill went through it would mean that two rural votes would be equal to three Dublin votes.</P>
      <P>As a result of the defeat of that Bill, the Government were left with no option but to bring forward a Bill leaving four Dublin votes equal to five rural votes in the allocation of constituencies.  The Minister for Local Government, in answer to Dáil questions recently, set out the number of electors per seat.  He had already circulated in answer to a question the population per seat.  According to that information, as I have pointed out, whereas you get South West Donegal with 19,449 population per seat and North West Dublin with 21,000 population per seat, you get a situation in which Donegal has more than 13,000 electors per seat but in North West Dublin the number of electors per seat is little more than 10,000.</P>
      <P>You got that situation because of the restrictive judgment handed down by the High Court.  Whereas it takes 13,000 voters in Donegal to get a seat allocated to them it takes only 10,000 in Dublin.  If the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill had got through we would have been able to give real equality in voting so that the vote of one man in a rural area would be equal to that of one in Dublin and there would not be a situation in which Leitrim had to give a large part of its population in the north so that Donegal could retain its six seats. If Donegal had the tolerance and we could have made one man's vote equal to another, in the allocation of constituencies it would have had enough voters to have six seats of its own without taking in Leitrim.</P>

      <P>During the referendum campaign in my constituency the plea by Deputy Fahey and Deputy Kenneally, unfortunately, my colleague, Deputy Browne, was ill and unable to take part in the campaign, was: &ldquo;Should you answer yes you will return to Waterford that portion of Waterford that was gerrymandered in 1961.&rdquo;  A very good appeal, too, I might say, because all Waterford people would like to have all Waterford in the one constituency.  Unfortunately for Fianna Fáil the Waterford people, notwithstanding this bribe, this carrot put in front of them, decided to reverse the result of the previous referendum campaign where they had a majority of 2,000, to turn that over and to have a 4,000 majority against this time, which is equivalent to approximately 6,000 votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there was no reason when the Minister for Local Government and the Dáil Deputies for Waterford got together to again gerrymander the constituency of Waterford.  One way or another they should give Waterford back the four seats we were entitled to because we had plus 989 <Col N="1425" /> votes over the average.  They could very well have handed us back the 7,000 votes they had taken away from us and give us a four-seat constituency. Of course it is one of the Fianna Fáil secrets why they could not give to Waterford the 7,000 votes they have taken away and make it a four-seat constituency instead of the three-seat it is.  Why does Deputy Treacy have to come down and represent the Waterford people within six miles of my town although he is away up in Clonmel?  Why did the late Deputy Don Davern, God be good to him, have to come from Cashel to represent the Fianna Fáil people in Affane which is only six miles from me?  At the time of the Bill in 1961 I fought here very bitterly but because Fianna Fáil had a majority I could not get anywhere. They had three seats in Tipperary and they were trying to hold on to Deputy Loughman.  He was defeated, of course, and Deputy Treacy headed the poll.  Unfortunately for them I headed the poll in Waterford, too, even though they thought they would throw me out.  I do not think there is any answer to the Waterford-South Tipperary constituency gerrymander.  It was the most blatant thing they ever did.  It has been repeated now.  Waterford are entitled to four seats.  There are two Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House.  Will one of them have the courage to stand up and say this?  Not one of them because they are under the Whip; they are under the Fianna Fáil gerrymander. There is no hope of those boys opening their mouths in this House.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Fahey spoke here this evening and referred to me. Deputy Fahey would not have the courage to stand up in the Waterford County Council and repeat the things he said here this evening.  He is supposed to be a Waterford man when he is in Waterford.  He is supposed to be a Tipperary man when he is in that part of Waterford that has been ceded, in the same way as is done in the North, to Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand this talk of democracy that members of Fianna Fáil go on with.  This is nonsense.  We know that before ever a referendum <Col N="1426" /> was rejected or accepted somebody in headquarters must have been working on it and they did not work it in Dublin.  The local cumainn, the local Fianna Fáil TDs, knew the little distances, knew where to turn and twist so that they would get the maximum Fianna Fáil vote.  It does not matter to me.  I am quite confident that no matter what they did to my constituency, I would be all right.  They tried it in 1961 and I not only got a quota, I got 1,200 votes more than the quota and I will get a quota this time.  I am quite confident.  We have, as I said, 980 votes plus.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Fahey said that I wanted a bit of Carrick.  Of course, I did want Carrick.  Carrick is a workers' town.  It is an industrialised town.  This is the kind of place the Labour Party want in.  Youghal would do.  They made very, very sure I would not get 1,500 people in from Carrick or from Youghal to make it a four-seat constituency for Waterford.  They kept it in South Tipperary.  More luck to Deputy Treacy and his colleagues over there.  I have no worries about them because Deputy Treacy will win his seat whether there are three or four seats in South Tipperary as I will win my seat in Waterford.  There is no question about that but let us not have all the hypocrisy that the Tánaiste went on with about Donegal.  Let us have a look at Dublin versus South Tipperary.  Let us have a look at the differential between these.  The gerrymander done in Dublin is shocking.</P>
    <P>The people were asked to vote on PR.  They were asked to vote on whether they accepted it or not.  The people said by a majority of 230,000 odd: &ldquo;We want PR&rdquo;.  What did Fianna Fáil do?  Under the revision they reduced nine five-seaters to two five-seaters.  They defeated PR in so far as it was compatible with the law. They reduced four-seaters to threeseaters. Has there ever been, since the State was founded, as many three-seaters as there are now?  Counties have been dislocated in every shape to make sure of lessening the chances of Fine Gael and Labour of getting votes.  Surely the Tánaiste knows this as well as I do?  Surely he knows that in Dublin they have thrown two <Col N="1427" /> Labour men into one constituency or maybe two Fine Gael men and separated two Ministers?  This is Fianna Fáil revenge for the referendum.  This is telling the people: &ldquo;You did not do what we told you and we will make you pay&rdquo;.  I am quite convinced that Fianna Fáil are coming to the end of their days.  I hope it will come quickly. Everyone knows that the more seats in a constituency the more effective is PR but when you drop from five to four and from four to three you are doing the best you can to nullify the effects of PR.</P>
    <P>There are 230,000 people over and above what Fianna Fáil can bribe and corrupt into voting for them who say: &ldquo;We want PR&rdquo;.  I suggest that this Bill is as much gerrymandering as they are doing or have done in Northern Ireland, if they could get away with it, but, thank God, the people of the Twenty-Six Counties are too intelligent to swallow the Fianna Fáil propaganda issued during the referendum.  We held them but, of course, they are the Government and with the help of local TDs and their petty outlook they can stay in office.  The challenge is a general election but we have heard nothing about that.  Fianna Fáil have literally gerrymandered the constituencies and will continue to do that as long as they are in office.  This constituency revision must take place but when Fianna Fáil contest the next election and when they are not in office there will be a revision also.  Two people can play at this game; they cannot get away with what they have been doing.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Briscoe coming in.  It shows I am getting under their skin.  The Tánaiste spoke about Dublin versus South Tipperary and if one looks at the constituencies it is a case of the maximum in Dublin versus the minimum in South Tipperary which gives you a fair average.  Because of the fact that we in the Labour Party in Dublin have become the largest but one Party in the corporation they are afraid of us in the next election and they have done their utmost to gerrymander Dublin. They are afraid that this is where we can and will win a number of seats. Deputy Briscoe understands that better than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste was bewailing the west and the efforts they made to keep representation there.  Whose fault is it that hundreds of thousands of people have left the west?  I think I heard the Tánaiste say that for 32 out of 38 years they were in Government and surely the people who were in Government in those circumstances must take responsibility for the flight from the west?  Is there something wrong with the west of Ireland?  Perhaps it is the weather but I suggest it is misgovernment. I know all the suggestions that were made about keeping the Irish language and keeping the people in the west.  My people were western people, even though I am from the south of Ireland, and I regret that the west is being denuded of the finest people in the country.  I have been in England and in various places I met people from Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and from all the western seaboard. <Col N="1430" /> The blame for this emigration must be laid at the door of Fianna Fáil because it is the fault of the Government in power if these people have to go abroad to get a living.  I hope the Government will consider giving a postal vote to the 1.5 million Irish workers in Britain who are only too anxious to come home and take up employment here and to get a Government that will govern in the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose the Bill for any personal reasons.  So far as I am concerned I am satisfied I can win my seat and that the Labour Party can get one, if not two, representatives in Waterford.  We oppose the measure on the basis that this is the Fianna Fáil revenge on the Irish people because they did not accept the Government's referendum proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather an unusual Bill and it has been introduced in a rather unusual fashion.  The Minister, in introducing it, omitted to recommend it to the House.  I need not remind a body of Deputies of the fact that modern psychology says that we really forget nothing.  In other words, when the Minister forgot to recommend the Bill to the House he either did it deliberately because he does not like the Bill or he did it because his subconscious mind did not wish to recommend it to the House.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Bill was rather sourly introduced and, extraordinarily enough, the second Minister who has spoken on the Bill&mdash;certainly the second Minister that I have heard, the Tánaiste&mdash; did not seem to be any more pleased with this Bill than he was with the Irish people for the way in which they voted.  Having listened to Deputy Kyne, I was wondering if the Deputy could have seen my notes because he has said a very large amount of what I intended to say myself.  However, the facts are of such importance that I shall say them again and I am sure Deputy Kyne will not be annoyed with me for doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, speaking earlier, talked about the scaremongering and the referendum posters.  I shall not take him up on that and start to fight the referendum over again but the referendum, <Col N="1431" /> as was pointed out by Deputy Kyne, resulted in approximately 600,000 Irish people voting against it. Nobody can scaremonger that number of people nor can anyone persuade them by poster.  The Irish people believe in PR and this Bill, of course, has been brought in to nullify, in as far as it is possible, the effects of the decision of those people.  The amazing thing is that the attitude of two Ministers, speaking at different times today, had a degree of petulance which, fortunately, is unusual in this House, even from the Government's Party.</P>
    <P>That petulance was because, as a result of the turning down of the tolerance proposals and the turning down of the single-seat constituency, this Bill had to be brought in.  That is the attitude of two of the Ministers of State of this country.  The Tánaiste has said that the loss of four seats in the west would be equal to five in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, to get back to the relevant matter&mdash;I can see that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is becoming impatient from listening to the irrelevancies, as indeed he might because earlier this evening when his distinguished predecessor in the Chair, the Ceann Comhairle, ruled a Minister out of order, the Minister appeared to agree with the Chair but he continued <Col N="1432" /> making his point.  As a matter of fact, he lost me half way through and I would say he would have lost the rest of the population even earlier in his argument because it did not seem to make much sense: it bore no relevance to the matter under discussion.  I expect the Minister hoped it was of political relevance but in fact it was not politically relevant and it certainly was not relevant to this Bill.</P>
      <P>At any rate, the idea is that four Dublin votes equal five in the west when the Government have complete control of the arranging of the constituencies, but they are held in on one side by the High Court decision and on the other by the referendum.  I might say that they are held in like maddened tigers because I have never heard the Government spokesmen speak more vehemently against a High Court decision.  I would remind those who are not as <i>au fait</i> with these matters as we are that the High Court decision stated that the number of population could not be varied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Cunningham failed to notice that I paused slightly before saying &ldquo;population&rdquo;; that was a pause for thinking because, it was not 20,000 votes, but 20,000 voters which would very nearly elect three Deputies allowing a variation of 1,000 either way.  That is what the High Court decision said and that is what has driven two Ministers half mad with rage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has driven them half mad with rage is that the Irish people turned down the Government proposals for single-seat constituencies and that they voted solidly for PR.  Another matter on which, indeed, as members of the Opposition, we do not mind being frowned on&mdash;in fact, at times we would rather be frowned on than smiled on by the Government Party&mdash;is in regard to what is our duty and our right, to point out to the people the facts in this.  Here we have a Government bringing in this Bill which divides the population into various constituencies.  They have been told by a High Court judge that it would be <Col N="1433" /> unconstitutional to vary more than 1,000 each way.  They have been told by the people that they must do it through PR; and they are in the process of being told by the Opposition that they have not done it in the way that it ought to have been done.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Kyne said I believe to be perfectly true: we are being punished for having the temerity to turn down the proposition put forward by the Government Party, and yet you have the Tánaiste coming in here and trying to blame Dublin for the reduction in the number of Deputies in the west.  That is arrant nonsense.  This Bill has been drawn up to conform with what the people said about PR and what the High Court said in regard to a variation.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts, so that if it takes four people in Dublin to equal five in the west, it is the Government who have brought that about and, in fact, the reason for a smaller number of Deputies in the west is that the population has dropped in the west. Why has the population dropped in the west?  We maintain it has dropped due to misgovernment, and it has dropped under Fianna Fáil administration. You cannot claim to be the Government of a country for 32 out of 38 years and then say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, the population may have fallen in the west, but it is not our fault.&rdquo;  Of course it is their fault.</P>

      <P>Thirty out of the last 36 years.  I think the Minister said 30 out of 38, but I would not say his arithmetic was any better on that than it was on the Dublin vote.  In other words, the drop in population in the west has occurred during 32 years of Fianna Fáil administration, and it has dropped in spite of all sorts of things like finding shipping to bring the emigrants back.  It is no good going into that type of thing here, but that was the cry.  The west is as the Government have made it for the last 30 years.  It is no good trying to blame the people in Dublin as if the poor Dublin voters had something to do with the drop in population in the west.  They are very sorry if there is a drop in population but it is not the Dubliners' fault; it is the Government's fault.  Let them be honest about it.</P>

This is supposed to be a Bill under PR.  In fact, the real purpose of PR is being defeated as far as possible in this Bill, because in the last Dáil we had 17 three-member constituencies. We now have 26.  That means that 78, over half the Deputies in this Dáil, are elected in constituencies which defeat the purpose of PR. Yet PR is what the Government have been asked to carry out by the referendum. In all seriousness I charge the Government with ignoring the will of the people as expressed in the referendum. That is what this Bill does.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I had not really got down to particularising about Dublin.  I represent <Col N="1436" /> no constituency at all.  My constituency has disappeared like Poland.

      <P>I will not follow it very closely.  I am just offering the comparison with what has happened in my constituency.  That unhappy country was divided between Austria, Prussia and Russia and found it had disappeared from the map.  I represent the constituency of South City Central but under this Bill it will disappear.  Part of it has gone into the South West, the central part has now become part of Dublin Central and my friends say they hope I am a good swimmer because now I will have to go backwards and forwards across the Liffey.</P>

      <P>It is not the first time I had to swim in the Liffey but it will only be by accident if I have to swim those turgid waters again.  I say the Liffey is the natural boundary between North and South Dublin.  Sometimes the northerners find themselves in the happy position with regard to the problems which afflict the south, that they do not suffer from those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and <i>vice versa.</i> the things which afflict them do not afflict us&mdash; although there is a common denominator between the two.  So, we now have this extraordinary constituency, central, and it is neither north nor south because it is both.  It straddles the Liffey.  Of course, the reason for this is there have been what I would call troubled times in Ministerial seats in the northern parts of Dublin and things have become a bit crowded in Dublin North East and in Dublin North Central.</P>

      <P>At any rate they have not sufficient elbow room <Col N="1437" /> and they pushed out.  I do not know who is going to come into this constituency now, which is part of my dear old constituency.  To come back to what happened in this unfortunate tripartite division of my old constituency, which took in the south dock and the Saint Kevin's ward areas, that has now been joined on to Dublin South East.</P>
      <P>Dublin South East has had a fairly chequered career at times.  It has had some very distinguished representatives, in any event, in this House, including the former Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, the former Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, the former Lord Mayor, Deputy Moore.  So it has been represented by distinguished people, but it is now going to take into its fold part of what was Dublin South Central. Then there is what used to be called the townland of Rathmines. Rathmines is now part of Crumlin, part of Terenure and Kimmage.  It has an extraordinary name.  I do not know where it was dug up from but it is now called South Central.  In fact it is not particularly south nor, as far as I can judge, at all geographical.  At any rate that is what it is called.  That is the old area of Rathmines with many important additions to it.</P>
      <P>One could ask oneself why this was done?  This was not done, of course, to have a slap at the people in the west.  You would really think, when listening to the Tánaiste, that the whole of Dublin had been arranged in some extraordinary way out of spite to hit the west.  In fact, if it has been arranged in any way to hit the west, which I doubt, it has been done by the Government Party.  They have done the arranging.  We, unfortunately, had nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am leading up to is that you have this constituency which used to stretch from Chapelizod at one end down the Liffey almost to the Pigeon House Fort at the other end and over to the canal.  That great area of Dublin, the biggest constituency on the south side of the city&mdash;which as I said earlier I had the honour and privilege to represent&mdash;has now disappeared. Why has it disappeared?  It has disappeared for two reasons.  I do not <Col N="1438" /> really know which is of major importance. One reason is the convulsion of movements of great bodies in the north with Ministers who do not want to be fenced in in the way they have been.  That is one thing.  The other is that there must not be five-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>South City Central was a five-member constituency.  There was no earthly reason why it should not have remained a five-member constituency. It is now being made into a four-member constituency.  The reason, of course, why it has not been made a three-member constituency is that the position in Dublin is rather &ldquo;dicey&rdquo; from the Government's point of view and three-member constituencies are dangerous from their point of view in Dublin.  Dublin has voted decisively against any change in proportional representation and the Dublin public have a way of hitting back when they believe their rights are interfered with.  Dublin has on several occasions in the last two referenda decisively shown it is capable of voting against the Government in no uncertain fashion on matters which affect proportional representation.  That is why it is considered dangerous to make Dublin three-member constituencies; otherwise, mark my words, the whole of Dublin would have been divided into three-member constituencies.  I know I need not remind this House it is much easier to get a majority in a three-member constituency.  I have seen this in print&mdash;I am not sure whether it is mathematically correct&mdash;that 51 per cent will give the two seats.  I am not sure of the mathematical accuracy of that statement.  Certainly, commonsense tells that a tilly-over, a comparatively small amount, will give two out of three seats.</P>
    <P>In four-seat constituencies, somewhat the same mathematical law operates.  You can get two seats with a considerably smaller amount.  Apparently, what is envisaged is that Dublin will somehow hold, or nearly hold, the Fianna Fáil representation whilst, in other parts of the country where their hold is stronger than in Dublin, Fianna Fáil hope to gain on the three-seat constituencies.  Hence the fact that we <Col N="1439" /> now have 26 three-seat constituencies whereas, until now, we have had 17. The last Dáil had 17 and we have gone to 26.  I am not sure of the figures for earlier Dála but I believe that 17 is a good deal higher than in the past.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the number of five-seat constituencies has now dropped to two.  I do not know precisely why the two places have been singled out for what is almost an accolade of affection from the Government Party&mdash;I cannot follow all the deviousness of these matters&mdash;but, at any rate, there is some political reason for it.  I do not know what will happen in them.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have this extraordinary Bill in front of us, quite an unusual Bill&mdash;introduced, as I said earlier in a very unusual fashion&mdash;introduced by a Minister who did not recommend it to the House.  Then, earlier tonight, we had the Tánaiste who really was lecturing the people for placing the Government in the unfortunate position that they had to do what the people wanted, not what the Government themselves wanted.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as well as altering the constituencies, is laying down that the number of Deputies to be elected to Dáil Éireann shall be 144.  I should like to say a few words on the number of Deputies.  This is a non-political matter but it is entirely relevant at this moment.  I believe we need in this House 144 Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>My audience is now leaving.  Night must fall.  Anyway, 144 Deputies is a small number to represent a country.  Sometimes critics of the number of Deputies lose sight of the fact that, although we are a small country, although we are a country with under three million persons, yet, if a Bill goes through dealing with, say, the Department of Justice, it has to be just as carefully produced, just as carefully introduced, just as carefully spoken on here and scrutinised and criticised by the Opposition as would be the case with a Bill in a much <Col N="1440" /> larger country with a much larger population.  That also is true in the case of measures dealing with any of the other Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are dealing with less than three million people and not with, say, 50 million people and populations of more than that, as have many other European countries, does not mean that we can cut down our proportion of more than that, as many other European countries have, does not mean that we can cut down our number any easier.  Consider the work involved in bringing in a Bill for, say, the Department of Industry and Commerce. Whether it applies to millions of people or to only one-quarter million people, we still have to have the same time given to the discussion. Also, there are only the same number of hours in the day during which they can be discussed.</P>
      <P>If membership of this House were cut below 144 Deputies, it would be very difficult to man the Front Benches on the Government side and on the main Opposition side&mdash;ourselves&mdash;as well as the Labour Party and Independents, so as to give Bills the specialised attention which they should get.  Therefore, it is important that we should maintain our figure at 144.  Other Members of the House might like to advert to what I have said and to give us the benefit of their opinion.</P>
      <P>I am sorry, with a Bill of this sort, which is such an important Bill for the people of Ireland, that the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government, have brought it in in such a way a way that they have tried to overrule the decision of the referendum&mdash;because that is the intention of this Bill.  We have the extraordinary spectacle of the Government blaming the High Court decision, on the one hand, and blaming the people, on the other hand, for placing them in the position that they were not free to bring in single-seat constituencies&mdash;and not, at the same time, daring to put that forward in their speeches.  However, the underlying motive behind this Bill is the unfortunate refusal of the Government Party to accept cheerfully the overwhelming decision of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): I raised this question last week and unhappily at the time I was seated over there and the Minister could not hear many of my supplementary questions. Therefore, I have been constrained to bring him back to put the matter before him.  This is a perennial problem and since I came into the House the question has been asked on many occasions what we were doing to protect our fishermen along the coast. The other day I asked the Minister several questions.  I asked him:</P>
      <P>If he is aware of the continual poaching off the Waterford coast by Dutch fishing vessels; and, if so, what steps he intends to take to protect Irish fishing interests there.</P>
      <P>I further asked him:</P>
      <P>If he is aware that at 3 p.m. on 22nd October there were 36 Dutch trawlers within four or five miles of Ballyvila Head, County Waterford; that several of them were within one mile of the shore, and that they were fishing; and what action he intends to take to prevent further occurrences of the kind.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
      <P>One complaint of illegal fishing by foreign vessels off the Waterford coast was received by my Department. This was on 23rd October, 1968, and was to the effect that 39 foreign trawlers were fishing off the coast near Dungarvan, some illegally.</P>
      <P>The corvette L.E. &ldquo;Macha&rdquo; reached the area on the morning of the 24th October, 1968, and found the foreign trawlers outside the fishery limit.</P>
      <P>The area in question along with other fishing areas around our coast will continue to be patrolled by the Naval Service within the limit of its resources.  In arranging patrols cognisance is taken of the increased activities of foreign trawlers off the Waterford coast during the herring fishing season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> My information is that since last July Dutch trawlers have been operating off the west coast, some 40 to 70 at a time and fishing, especially at night, well within the six mile limit.  I understand that there have been similar instances off Dunmore East.  It was suggested to me that these foreign vessels seem to be that able to get information about the movements of our corvettes and it was suggested that they were getting the information from spotters on the shore.  The Minister denied that such information was obtained by any method other than by warning messages passed from one trawler to another.  I should like to know if any special investigations have been conducted to justify him in expressing this opinion and specifically whether any garda inquiries or investigations have been made.  I also asked the Minister if he would consider the provision of a number of small fast motor torpedo boats or coastguard cutters to deal with this problem rather than the single frigate which is contemplated.  The Minister replied that:</P>
    <P>Patrolling of our coastal waters will continue to be carried out by the Naval Service within the limits of their resources.</P>
    <P>The question of the replacement of the corvettes at present used for fishery patrols is under consideration and the suitability of different types of vessels for this duty and also for naval purposes is being examined. The purchase of a frigate is not and never has been contemplated.</P>
    <P>I do not know what advice, if any, the Minister has taken on this matter but the opinion of the people concerned, the fishermen and so on, is that the only way to combat this problem is by having a number of small fast boats. I am not an expert on these matters nor, I suppose, is the Minister but he is in a position to get advice and I should like to know what advice he has taken to date and what decision, if any, he has come to.</P>
    <P>This is a very vexed problem because it is a matter which is dealt with by so many Departments and where you have too many cooks the broth may not be so good.  I know that the Minister is <Col N="1443" /> not responsible for other Departments but the same day I put down a question to the Minister for External Affairs asking him whether the coastal limit for Dutch trawlers is six or 12 miles and the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Netherlands fishing vessels are prohibited from fishing within our 12-mile exclusive fishery limits except in the six- to 12-mile belt in the area between the Old Head of Kinsale and Carnsore Point.  In this area they are entitled to fish between the six-and 12-mile limits for mackerel and herring only.</P>
    <P>You will appreciate, Sir, that this is a very important herring centre and this kind of poaching is supposed to have obliterated herring centres in other places.  I should like the Minister to tell me, if he is in a position to do so, how it is determined that they only fish for herring and mackerel and what steps are taken by his Department to verify this or have his Department been asked to do this.  I should also like to know is this special concession limited to the Netherlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I have intimated that I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in this matter.  As I said, this matter has been raised on several occasions here and as far as I can remember it has never been satisfactorily dealt with.  It would seem that these Dutch trawlers can come and go almost uninhibited.  They are very big vessels which are equipped with every modern scientific device and they can find out the movements of our not too speedy corvettes.  They also use scientific methods to determine where there are shoals and they use nets with a very small mesh which can practically clean out the entire ocean life in a very short time.  They come in in large numbers.  This matter of fisheries is under the care of the Department of Agriculture as far as policy and so on is concerned.  The Minister for Defence has the task of protecting our fisheries and the Minister for Finance is involved through the Office of Public Works which looks after <Col N="1444" /> harbours, docks and wharves.  The Minister for Justice and the Garda are also concerned in regard to detection and prosecution.  In that set-up it looks as if it is a question of no-man's-land. We spent a lot of money on this.  In 1967-68 £53,000 was spent on sea fishery development.  We spend £575,000 on An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. We paid a very large sum for two helicopters.  Apart from rescue operations, they do a little bit of work taking patients to hospitals.  I understand the Minister says they are not particularly useful in patrol work.  I do not know what we spend on harbours, piers, slips and so on, but there is a considerable amount of money involved. And then we fall down on the most important aspect of all.</P>
      <P>There was a question addressed to the Minister recently, which drew some sarcastic letters in the Press afterwards. I quote from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am dealing with the only defence we have available to us and the Minister, apparently, is not in a position either to equip or man the corvettes properly. We have a very long coastline to protect, I know, but as a special concession the Netherlands was given a six-mile limit.  Surely our territorial limit could be similarly extended?  The trawlers fished on 22nd October and the corvette did not arrive until 24th October.  I do not say this information is absolutely accurate, but I understand that on the 22nd the Garda station at Ring was rung up and naval headquarters at Haulbowline.  It could be that that was done on 23rd October, but in that interval all the fish in the sea could be caught, processed, sold or eaten.  Since 22nd October our own fishermen have caught nothing.  Apart from damage to the economy there is the humanitarian aspect; the livelihood of the unfortunate fishermen is at the mercy of these foreign fishermen who operate in huge trawlers and clean <Col N="1445" /> out everything.  I appeal to the Minister to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to see if together they can find some solution.</P>
      <P>This matter has been raised here again and again.  It is a very important matter.  I doubt if the whole position has been adequately examined.  Surely the Minister can find out what other countries are doing to protect their fisheries?  We cannot be alone in this problem, though it may be more acute here than it is elsewhere.  It is extraordinary that such an important herring fishing area as that south of Waterford should be left so defenceless.  My information is that the corvettes are old and really incapable of affording proper protection.  They are regarded as old tubs.  Small, fast boats might be the answer to the problem.  Foreign trawlers can fish with impunity now because they know the &ldquo;old tub&rdquo; will not reach the area inside 24 hours.  Has the Minister made inquiry to find what type of craft is used to protect fisheries in other countries?  Fishery protection would appear to be dealt with more efficiently elsewhere.</P>

      <P>It will, I think, be clear to the Minister that Deputy Hogan asked him back here tonight on the Adjournment very reluctantly. Most of us appreciate the Minister's position in all this.  This problem has existed for years and I am sure the Minister himself is not at all satisfied with the replies he gave here as to the unsatisfactory protection provided.  As Deputy Hogan says, the problem arises because of divided control.  The cost of new vessels to do proper protection work might be so great&mdash;I should like the Minister to be frank about this&mdash; that the game would not really be worth the candle, so to speak.  Since I came in here in 1961 the same replies as the Minister gave today have been given to similar questions.  I remember Deputy Thady Lynch was forever raising the matter here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Hogan, in raising this matter on the Adjournment, treated it with the seriousness it deserves and that the genuinely <Col N="1446" /> looked for information in connection with our fishery protection service.  An occasion such as this could have been availed of to poke fun at the service but I am very pleased that both Deputies approached it in an entirely different way, and were quite serious in their approach to the problem confronting the State in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to say at the outset that the provision of new vessels, or the provision of a more elaborate service, is conditioned by the availability of money and personnel.  The establishment of an adequate fishery protection service that would also satisfy the requirements of a naval service would cost a good deal of money.  We cannot be certain that by voluntary enlistment we would be able to attract sufficient personnel to man even new vessels.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question raised by Deputy Hogan, I wish to put him right about the time and the date on which the marine duty officer at Haulbowline was first notified of the presence of trawlers off the Waterford coast.  He was notified by telephone at 1 p.m. on 23rd October, 1968 and, on receipt of that message, LE. &ldquo;Macha&rdquo; was immediately signalled to proceed to the area.  That vessel was on protection duty at Blacksod Bay at the time and arrived the next morning off the coast of Waterford.  The trawlers were still there but they were outside the fishery limit.</P>
      <P>I wish to say that when I became Minister for Defence I inspected the vessels.  I was advised by competent persons that these corvettes were certainly seaworthy, and that they could be refitted for fishery protection purposes. They have a certified life.  They were examined afloat in 1966 by the survey staff of the Department of Transport and Power.  We have to rely on their findings.  Like Deputy Hogan, I am not professionally competent to give an opinion on these matters.  I decided that as soon as I possibly could I would bring the matter to the notice of the Government, and that I would bring proposals to the Government in relation to the replacement of the corvettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the matter of the purchase of <Col N="1447" /> second-hand ships abroad examined and I found that we could not get secondhand ships abroad which were acceptable for our purpose.  I also had the matter examined from the point of view of the replacement of the corvettes by new ships.  The whole question was examined by an inter-Departmental committee representative of the Departments concerned, including the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The matter is under active consideration.  In the early days the service was a marine and coast watching service with fishery protection duties.  A decision was taken in 1946 to set up a naval service and three corvettes were purchased.  The question of the speed at which these vessels travel has been raised but I should mention that their speed is not a problem in dealing with foreign fishing trawlers and failure to arrest has never been for want of speed.</P>
    <P>The question of the use of helicopters for fishery protection has been raised.  In reply to supplementary questions I may have come down too hard on this matter.  Helicopters can be used on protection duty in conjunction with a corvette, but on their own they are not a completely effective machine for dealing with foreign trawlers.  A helicopter cannot arrest a vessels.  It cannot establish with the required degree of accuracy the exact location of the foreign vessel and moreover a boarding party must go on board the foreign vessels when it is being escorted into port.  There is a limited use for helicopters in fishery protection.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that we have got only three helicopters and they have to be used for the purpose for which they were primarily acquired&mdash;air and sea rescue and the provision of an ambulance service.  A helicopter must be available when there is an urgent demand for its services.</P>
    <P>Another drawback in the use of the helicopter is its range.  If helicopters were to be used extensively for fishing protection it would be necessary to have local stations from which they could be operated and refuelled.  Nevertheless, the helicopter has a limited use <Col N="1448" /> in fishery protection and, in fact, on at least one occasion a helicopter was used off the Waterford coast.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan suggested that we could use smaller vessels and that coastguard cutters could be used.  I am advised by the military authorities&mdash; and that expression includes the naval service&mdash;and others I have consulted, that anything smaller than a coastal minesweeper would not be effective. Smaller ships cannot put to sea in rough weather.  They are not capable of staying at sea long enough in rough weather to be effective.  A coastal minesweeper is.  There may be some confusion as to what a coastguard cutter is but I would point out that coastguard cutters can be very varying sizes and some of them can cost over £3 million.</P>
    <P>The advice tendered to me by the military authorities is that anything smaller than a coastal minesweeper is not of much use.  Smaller vessels can be used when they are backed by larger vessels of the corvette class.  I am advised that very small vessels would not be effective in our circumstances as they could not stay at sea in any kind of rough weather.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that spotters on land pass on information to foreign trawlers, I am not aware that this is so.  I am advised by the Naval Service that information is probably passed from trawler to trawler.  I do not know what information Deputy Hogan has.  I do not like to put the onus on him of producing information that this practice obtains but I should be very glad to get any such information which may be available.  I am certain that if the Garda Síochána knew that such a practice obtained they would have notified us and taken action against persons they suspected. It is difficult to be certain in matters or this kind, but if we had any reason to believe that such a practice did obtain we would have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>The three corvettes we have were built in the period 1940 to 1942. Deputy Hogan asked a question about their age.  From the information I have given to him already he knows that two of them had a partial survey and refit in 1967 and the third is at present being refitted.  They were also refitted <Col N="1449" /> in 1957 and 1958.  At the moment we cannot put more than two of them to sea at the one time because we have not sufficient personnel.</P>

      <P>There would be around 70 required.  I do not know if I am leaving out anything that was referred to in the questions put to me by Deputy Hogan and Deputy Clinton. If I were in a position to give more information I would gladly do so, but I am not in a position to say what decisions will be taken.  The matter is under active consideration and I would <Col N="1450" /> hope that we will be in a position to start on a programme of the replacement of the three corvettes.  I do not know to what extent we can go.  There was no question of purchasing frigates. Deputy Hogan, Deputy Clinton and the House can gather what I have in mind from what I have already said.  I want to be as frank as possible in the circumstances in which I find myself at the moment.  I want to say again that I am glad Deputy Hogan raised this matter in the manner in which he has raised it.  I am also glad to come here on the adjournment and give him the information I have given him now.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.6 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28th November, 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are rigid controls over certain drugs under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, and the retail sale of certain other drugs is controlled under the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, which provide that the drugs covered by the regulations may not be sold to the public by persons other than retail chemists and otherwise than on prescription.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous questions, I propose to make the unauthorised possession of certain drugs liable to abuse, a punishable offence and I hope to incorporate the necessary statutory provision in the legislation for the improvement of the Health Services which, as I have previously indicated, will be introduced in the present session.</P>
      <P>My Department maintains liaison with the Garda and other sources of information regarding the practice of drug-taking, particularly amongst young people in this country and I am in process of setting up a small working party comprising persons with knowledge and experience in this field which I hope may be able to suggest further steps which I might take to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question does not relate to drug addiction within the meaning of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 but rather to the incidence of drug dependence in the wider sense.</P>
      <P>My Department obtain details of the number of persons admitted to mental hospitals for treatment of drug addiction each year.  In addition certain information regarding drug dependence has been obtained from psychiatrists throughout the country and I propose to make further inquiries on these lines shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also hope that the working party to advise me on the problem of <Col N="1335" /> drug abuse to which I referred in my reply to the Deputy's earlier question will be in a position to offer further information regarding drug dependence.</P>
