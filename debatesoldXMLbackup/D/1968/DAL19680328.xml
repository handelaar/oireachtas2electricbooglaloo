      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £42,200 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1968, le haghaidh Tuarastail agus Costais Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha, agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá faoi riaradh na hOifige sin, lena n-áirítear Deontas-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>With your permission, I propose to take the Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs and the Supplementary Estimate for International Co-operation together.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs is required to meet the additional expenditure on subhead B&mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash; on subhead D&mdash;Repatriation and Maintenance of Destitute Irish Persons Abroad &mdash; and subhead G&mdash;Official Entertainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On subhead B, the additional requirement is due mainly to the unexpectedly <Col N="1362" /> high level of payments by way of travel expenses and related expenditure arising from transfers and home leave of diplomatic staff abroad. During the year the number of transfers effected proved greater than was originally envisaged and some of these involved very long distances.  In addition, expenditure on other services provided by the subhead, such as telephones, postage and miscellaneous items, proved greater than expected. The provision for this subhead was also, of course, affected by devaluation which occurred in November last.</P>
    <P>With regard to subhead D, the additional £11,000 is required to meet expenditure incurred on the repatriation of Irish citizens from Nigeria as a result of the conflict in that country. Under the present system of accounting, expenditure incurred on the repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens abroad is charged to the appropriate subheads of the Vote and moneys subsequently recovered from persons who are repatriated is brought to account by way of Appropriations in Aid of the Vote.  In the case of Irish citizens repatriated from Nigeria, it is expected that most, if not all, of the expenditure will be recovered and will be accounted for in this way.</P>
    <P>The gross Supplementary Estimate is reduced by £5,800 as a result of additional receipts in the current financial year arising from the repayment of expenses incurred in repatriating Irish citizens.  About 140 persons were repatriated from Nigeria by the Embassy there or otherwise assisted in their return home.</P>
    <P>With regard to subhead G&mdash;Official Entertainment&mdash;it is expected that an additional sum of £7,000 will be required. While every effort is made to keep down expenditure, there is a tendency towards an increase in the volume of necessary official entertainment each year, largely attributable to a welcome growth in the number of international conferences, both governmental and non-governmental, attracted to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for International Co-Operation is required to meet additional expenditure on subhead <Col N="1363" /> C.2&mdash;United Nations Travelling  and Incidental Expenses; on subhead C.3&mdash;Contribution to the United Nations Children's Fund; and subhead C.7&mdash;Contribution to the United Nations Reliefs and Works Agency.</P>
    <P>On subhead C.2 the additional sum is required to meet the cost of the delegation at present attending the UNCTAD meeting in New Delhi, provision for which was not made in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the additional sums required for UNRWA and UNICEF, it will be recalled that the hostilities which broke out in the Middle East in June, 1967 resulted in great suffering for innumerable innocent people. Some of the victims of the war were already refugees, displaced as a result of previous hostilities; others were newly displaced persons who fled from the areas captured during the most recent conflict.  The existence of some 1¼ million Arab refugees is one of the great humanitarian problems of our time.  It is also recognised that it is a problem which must be settled before there can be any hope of lasting peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>For over 18 years the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees&mdash;UNRWA&mdash;has been assisting the Arab refugees who originally fled from their homes as a result of the hostilities in 1948.  The majority of these refugees were poor farmers who, once displaced from their holdings, had little hope of earning a livelihood.  In May 1967 there were some 1,300,000 refugees living in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip who were registered with the United Nations Agency.  As a result of the war in June last, it is estimated that some 130,000 of these previously registered refugees were uprooted from their homes&mdash;many for the second time in their lives.  In addition at least another 220,000 persons were newly displaced and this number has been augmented by a steady stream of refugees who have continued to cross from the west to the east bank of the Jordan river.  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, in conjunction with the Arab governments <Col N="1364" /> concerned and with other UN agencies and voluntary organisations, took special measures to provide urgently needed supplies and services for the refugees during and after the emergency period. All this placed a great strain on the Agency's limited resources.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency is financed solely by voluntary contributions from governmental and private sources.  In recent years the Agency's annual budget has been about 40 million dollars&mdash;a figure which has allowed the expenditure of approximately 10d. per day on each refugee.  Already before the outbreak of hostilities the Agency lacked sufficient funds to meet the cost of running existing services and it was operating on a deficit.</P>
    <P>Ireland voted in favour of a resolution calling for help for this fund.  As Deputies are aware from my previous statement in this matter on 25th July last in the Dáil, the Government, in response to this UN resolution, decided to make a contribution totalling 50,000 dollars for the aid of the Arab refugees.  Of this total, 40,000 dollars would be sent to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and 10,000 dollars to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).  This special contribution was in addition to Ireland's regular annual contributions to both of these Funds.  The Irish Red Cross Society also made a substantial contribution towards the relief of refugees in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>As at 31st December, 1967 a total of 5,700,000 dollars had been pledged by governments in special contributions to the UN Relief and Works Agency. These contributions have enabled the Agency to provide the urgently needed assistance for the victims of the June, 1967 conflict and they have helped towards relieving the immediate financial problems of the Agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimates before the House emphasise the urgent question of providing relief for a number of distressed areas in the world.  The provision of assistance to suffering humanity is naturally one that finds a ready acceptance among the people of this country.  The contribution <Col N="1365" /> which we can make to this vast problem is not large.  Nevertheless, the fact that it is necessary to make a contribution in providing assistance, either through the Red Cross or through one of the United Nations agencies, brings before our minds the whole question of the extent to which our foreign aid is adequate in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>One of the extraordinary contradictions of the present aid is that in many parts of the world&mdash;not indeed confined to one continent&mdash;hunger and distress exist.  It is sometimes difficult for those not in contact with these problems, who have not in one form or another to deal with them, to appreciate that this is so in this affluent age. Consideration of these Supplementary Estimates affords us an opportunity of examining in present circumstances the gravity of the problem affecting so many areas, the hardship and misery caused by food shortages, as well as the refugee problem referred to by the Minister, and raises the question whether this country is doing enough and whether the aid we are providing is being used to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>Aid, as we know, can take a number of forms.  It can take the simple, direct form of a financial contribution directly by the State either to one of the United Nations relief organisations and agencies or a contribution, financial or otherwise, to the Red Cross or to some other philanthropic body dealing with these problems.  It can take the direct form of food, which has a number of advantages, and in the past on some occasions we provided assistance in that way, or it can take the form of technical assistance.  To a very large extent, Irish aid can be most usefully directed towards ex-colonial countries with which we have a traditional sympathy as well as established contacts, in most cases through the work of the Irish missionaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the extent to which our contribution should be based on a fixed percentage of national income arises.  I understand this was the general recommendation laid down by the relief committee of the OECD countries. We were not actually represented on <Col N="1366" /> this committee, which nevertheless suggested that by a certain year the relief granted would be stepped up to one per cent of the national income.</P>
    <P>The question of aid, of course, raises the problem of the extent to which the aid given is used to the best advantage. It is not easy for a small country like this to ascertain accurately whether the assistance and relief given are used to the best advantage and experience has shown on some occasions in the past that some of the efforts made were misdirected. It does, however, highlight the importance of our present position, the fact that despite our relatively low standard of living compared with some other more advanced and affluent countries, the larger and better organised nations, the standard of living here is appreciably higher than in some countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to the contribution which small nations can make to the solution of world problems, we have endeavoured, in so far as providing peace-keeping personnel in the Middle East, in Cyprus or the Congo is concerned, to play our part.  At the same time, we appreciate and recognise that there is a limit to the extent to which small countries can contribute in that way.  On the other hand, we have an obligation, if we are sincere in our expressed views, supported by all shades of political and public opinion in the country, to make a contribution to alleviate and ease the hardships in so many countries and areas which are affected by problems of hunger and problems which organisations like Gorta or World Food Efforts are designed to assist, and the acute hardships which refugees generally are experiencing.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter so that it may be considered in the future from the point of view of deciding whether our foreign aid programme is designed to utilise to the best advantage the contribution which this country can make and, at the same time, whether our contribution on the basis of our present comparatively higher standard of living compared with those distressed countries can be regarded as being adequate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The question of repatriating refugees <Col N="1367" /> and destitute Irish persons abroad brings up again the problem to which I adverted before of Irish emigrants. Up to the present we have never consciously accepted as a responsibility the duty to provide assistance in a tangible way for Irish emigrants abroad.  In the main, that problem is confined to Britain.  While nowadays a number of people still emigrate to other parts of the world, the largest number of Irish emigrants go to Britain.  In the past I think one of the reasons for refusing to accept responsibility for this matter was possibly based on two grounds: first, a reluctance in some way or other to recognise or accept the fact that we had an emigration problem and secondly, that because of the large number of Irish people going to Britain, to accept responsibility that in any way involved the possibility of limitless liability in the sense that it would be impossible to fix a particular limit or an overriding maximum in respect of assistance.</P>
    <P>I think both those reasons are not well founded.  On the one hand, irrespective of how the emigration figures vary, there is constant and continuous large-scale emigration from this country.  In Britain, there are many well established organisations, either operated or directed by Irish people or in close contact with Irish people, providing relief, assistance and guidance for emigrants.  The fact that they exist and operate and do a great deal of valuable and useful work has to a considerable extent replaced the inescapable duty which the State here would have if they did not exist.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, these organisations are voluntary and financed by different means, and staffed by people who have devoted themselves to this type of welfare work.  At the same time, in present circumstances, that is not sufficient and the Government must accept responsibility for assisting in providing welfare centres for Irish emigrants in Britain.  In certain cases, these welfare centres will have to be provided with financial assistance.  Initially experience would probably show that this assistance could be confined to the larger <Col N="1368" /> centres of population such as London. Birmingham and other cities to which there is a traditional flow of Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>So far as emigration to Britain is concerned, the fact that it is near this country and that it is possible for people to keep in touch minimises the problem to a great extent for most emigrants.  A great many people who emigrate to Britain either already have contacts there or have relatives there, and because of that, they are in a position to avail of guidance and assistance. They know where they are going and they can get some help in their new surroundings.  On the other hand, I think there is no doubt about this aspect of the matter and it is one that must cause us some concern.</P>
    <P>A great many people of tender years or in their teens travel to Britain every week.  A number of them have social and other problems, and welfare workers and sociological workers and others who have been dealing with these problems from time to time expressed their great concern at the fact that there is no regulation or restriction on this form of travel.  A great many parents and guardians, of course, exercise control&mdash;I suppose the majority do&mdash;but there is still a substantial minority of young people who go to Britain without any proper supervision and without proper contacts over there and who are exposed to all forms of dangers and risks against which I feel we have some obligation to try to safeguard them. It seems to me, therefore, that we should again look at this problem to see whether some measure of control could be operated in respect of these types of people and, on the other hand, to see whether it is not possible to provide assistance to welfare centres for people from this country who need it.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wish to raise on this Supplementary Estimate might more normally be raised on the annual Estimate but it is never quite certain, in recent experience&mdash;with the organisation of the Estimates&mdash;when the matter may be considered.  What decision, <Col N="1369" /> if any, have the Government taken on the deadlock which has arisen in respect of EEC membership?  This problem has been discussed here on a number of occasions in recent years. We have had many debates on it.  It is not necessary to recapitulate on the matter or on aspects of it on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I doubt if this matter would be relevant on the Supplementary Estimate.  We are confined to the various subheads.  I do not see any heading under which the matter could be discussed.</P>

      <P>On Supplementary Estimates, the policy of the Department is not generally discussed. That is a matter for the main Estimate which will come before us shortly.  The Deputy will then have an opportunity of pursuing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to press it.  The other matter which is included in the Supplementary Estimate is the provision in respect of Subhead G&mdash;Official Entertainment.  The Minister has argued that the number of conferences and visitors of one form or another is increasing here.  As I understood it, these conferences are generally covered by the organisation concerned. However, it does seem to me that the rise in this subhead&mdash;which, so far as I can estimate, has increased approximately five times over what it was ten years ago&mdash;is substantial.  I do not know whether it now covers aspects of the Vote which were not included previously but it does seem a substantial increase.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase due to the unexpectedly high number of representatives who either were moved or who returned on leave, the Minister adverted in his opening statement to the effect of devaluation.  When he is replying, perhaps he will indicate the percentage increase due to devaluation in respect of this rise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we should aim at doing more to relieve the distress of peoples who are much worse off than ourselves.  I do not want to go into any great detail about what we have been doing.  Over the years, we have steadily been increasing the amount of money made available to the various agencies of the United Nations and the Red Cross for the relief of distress and the improvement of the technical ability of less developed countries.  We can, perhaps, go into that in more detail when the main Estimate is being taken which I hope will not be too long away.  I think we can be sure that our people are prepared to support the funds opened to afford such relief to suffering countries.  The Red Cross collected £150,000 in a very short time for the relief of hunger which was quite a substantial amount for a small country.  I should like to see, and the Government would like to see, our contribution reaching at least one per cent of the national income.  We are far away from that yet.  Counting everything, I do not think we are even half of one per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned help for Irish people&mdash;minors and others&mdash;who reach Britain and who should be taken care of.  A few years ago, I persuaded the Department of Finance to give us a sum of money for the repatriation of minors and others&mdash;Irish citizens&mdash; who, in the opinion of the Ambassador over there, should be sent home.  Until a few years ago, it was absolutely excluded that we could repatriate an Irish citizen from Britain at State expense. The Ambassadors in London were forbidden to advance money for this purpose.  As the Deputy knows, our Ambassadors in other countries can advance money for repatriation in cases of distress but it did not obtain in Britain.  It is now open to the Ambassador there to repatriate any citizen of whom he becomes aware who should be at home instead of abroad. Notwithstanding the fact that this has been in operation for some time now, it has not cost much.  It was discovered that once a means of repatriating people was available, the problem was not so great.  A few years ago, to hear <Col N="1371" /> people describing this problem one would think there were many thousands that should be sent home at State expense but there were very few when the money was made available for their repatriation.  As Deputies are aware, we have no restriction on Irish citizens going to Britain and if we were to introduce restrictions, we would have to introduce the passport system; I see no other way of doing it effectively. That would be a very big step and I think it is much better that we should deal with any problem that may arise of youngsters or people who should not leave Ireland going to British urban centres by having them sent back.  I think that is a better way of dealing with it than by introducing the passport system.  It must also be remembered that the Irish people in Britain, and in the urban centres particularly, are very well organised for charitable purposes and one of the objects of their charity is newly-arrived Irish citizens who might find themselves in temporary want.</P>
    <P>I have not got complete statistics about international organisations that have held conventions or conferences here but the number has gone up steadily over the years, and for my own information I shall get a detailed table so that if the matter is raised again, we shall have the statistics.  But, as everyone knows who is in touch with these matters, there has been a phenomenal growth in the number of these conferences and we have literally dozens held here each year, whereas ten years ago we had hardly one.  Some of them are very big affairs.  We have had one or two conferences this year at which the number of foreign delegates alone went over the 1,000 figure. It costs a little to entertain them, but surely when an international organisation selects Ireland as the place for its conference, we must bid them welcome and give them some little entertainment. We try to keep this within limits, and of course we do not do it on anything like as elaborate a scale as it is done in other countries.  We try to give them a decent welcome in keeping with our size and our purse.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,295,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for payment of certain Remuneration.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required mainly to meet the cost of extending the tenth round increase of £1 or 15/- a week to certain State-paid employees who have not already received it.  A sum of £340,000 is also included for certain increases given to workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs through the conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
      <P>In July 1966 agreement was reached at conciliation level for the granting of the tenth round increase with effect from 1 June, 1966 to civil servants earning under £1,200 a year.  The agreement on the increase left it open to the Staff Side to claim the tenth round increase for staff earning over £1,200 a year if a pattern justifying an increase for this group emerged outside the civil service.  A similar clause was included in the agreements on the increase for teachers.  A £1,200 limit applied also to the tenth round increase for gardaí and members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months it has become clear that the £1,200 a year limit could not be justified on the basis of comparisons <Col N="1373" /> with other employments.  In November, 1967, for instance, an arbitration award on a claim by local authority officers recommended the removal of the £1,200 limit which had applied to their tenth round increase.</P>
    <P>In February last, the Civil Service General Council recommended the extension of the increase with effect from 1 June, 1966 to staff coming within the scope of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I accepted this recommendation and later agreed to the extension of the increase to all civil servants with maxima less than that of Assistant Secretaries of Department&mdash; £3,850 a year.  On 7th March the Conciliation Councils for the three groups of teachers recommended the abolition of the £1,200 a year limit that had applied.  The limit that applied to gardaí and members of the Defence Forces has also been removed.</P>
    <P>The increases did not apply to secretaries, assistant secretaries and equivalent ranks in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for Retired Pay, Pensions, Compensation, Allowances and Gratuities payable under Sundry Statutes to or in respect of Members of the Defence Forces and certain other Military Organisations, etc., and for Sundry Contributions and Expenses in connection therewith, and for certain Extra-Statutory Children's Allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions is for a net sum of £10,000.  As Deputies will see it is expected that the expenditure under Subheads H and L of this Vote for 1967-68 will exceed the amounts provided. <Col N="1374" /> Savings to the extent of £12,340 are expected elsewhere in the Vote.</P>
    <P>The anticipated excess on Subhead H is due to the granting of a greater number of special allowances than was foreseen.  The grant of these allowances has been accelerated due to the large number of qualified applicants who are over the age of 70 years and are regarded as incapable of self-support by reason of age.  As regards Subhead L the position is that only a token amount was provided for special lump sum compensation payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces who served with the United Nations Force and who were killed or wounded or who died or were disabled as a result of disease contracted during such service.  Lump sum payments to the extent of £8,350 have been made.  There will, in due course, be a refund by the United Nations of the amount involved.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House agree to the Supplementary Estimate.  We also agree to the first heading of £14,000 for those who served this country in the dark and evil days, who went out in 1916 and helped to get for us the freedom we enjoy here today.  We know that when these people went out to fight for our freedom, they did not expect at that time any financial reward. It is only right that we in this House of Parliament should remember those people and their actions.  The fact that we have an Irish Parliament today and that we sit here in this Parliament is due to their taking arms at that time to help to free us.  We on this side of the House are in favour of this extra expenditure of £14,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right also that we should treat as well as we possibly can those members of our Defence Forces who served with the United Nations and who were killed or wounded, or who died or were disabled as a result of disease contracted during such service. I should like to state in that regard that we are being very unfair to at least one particular case.  I have taken up the case of one man with the Minister for Defence, and I am sorry to say so far I have not been able to get anywhere, <Col N="1375" /> due to a technical point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I made representations on behalf of James Scally, No. 809771, 2 Harbour Cottages, Mullingar, who was in the Army and who was in the Congo in 1961.  This young chap was 22 or 23 years of age, as fine a specimen of a man as you could see in Ireland.  He was engaged to be married.  He was to go off sentry duty at 6 o'clock in the evening&mdash;I am not too sure of the exact time&mdash;but the other battalion had not turned up and he was asked to remain for another hour.  He remained on and was shot during that time.  From 1961 to 1967 he has been in and out of hospital and had four operations.  He was discharged from the Army in March, 1967.  He is receiving only about £5 per week, and he got no compensation despite the fact that as an active young man he is ruined for life.  He has lost the use of his left arm and is 90 per cent disabled.  Our Army has refused to give him any gratuity although he is so disabled and is the sole support of his mother and a young sister.</P>
      <P>The Department wrote to me on 4th October, 1967 and said:</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>With further reference to your representations on behalf of ex-Private J. Scally, 2 Harbour Cottages, Mullingar, who was wounded in the Congo in December, 1961, and was discharged from the Defence Forces in March, 1967, I am desired by an tAire Cosanta to say that Mr. Scally is in receipt of a temporary award of wound pension under the Army Pensions Acts at the rate of £4.11.6d. per week based on a degree of disablement assessed by the Army Pensions Board at 70%, at his medical examination in May, 1967.  This is the maximum award payable in Mr. Scally's case having regard to the terms of the Acts and the degree of his disablement as assessed by the Board...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am to add that it is regretted <Col N="1376" /> that Mr. Scally is not eligible for the payment of an ex gratia lump sum as his discharge from the Forces took place more than four years after the date he received his wound. </P>
    <P>In this matter the Minister is relying on the fact that the claim was not made within four years, but the reason he could not make the claim was that he was in hospital during this time.  However, he disputes that and has given me a copy of a letter which he sent and which was headed as follows: &ldquo;809771 Pte.  Scally, James, No. 2 Hospital Coy., St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin, 7.&rdquo; It is dated 25th October, 1965, and was sent to the &ldquo;Injuries and Claims Dept., UNO, through O/C., St. Bricin's Hospital&rdquo;. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Sir,</P>
    <P>I respectfully submit my claim for compensation for injury received on the 18th Dec., 1961, while serving with the UNO Troops in the Congo.</P>
    <P>He goes on to relate the history of his case.  I again communicated with the Department in November, 1967, and pointed out that on the 25th October, 1965, Private Scally wrote to the Injuries and Claims Department through his O/C in St. Bricin's Hospital claiming compensation for injuries received on 18th December, 1961, while serving with the UNO troops in the Congo.  I gave the injury as GSW in the chest, which are Army terms.  I also pointed out that he got a reply to that letter stating that he could not get compensation while still serving but to renew his claim when he had been discharged. I further stated in the letter that he did this when he was discharged on 23rd March, 1967.  I pointed out I thought he had been most unfairly and unjustly treated</P>
    <P>Here is a man who writes to the Minister's Department before the four years are up and gets a reply stating he cannot claim until the four years have expired.  Then when the four years have expired, the Department write and inform him that he is not entitled to a gratuity or a lump sum because his claim has not arrived until four years after he has left the Forces.</P>
    <P>I received a further letter from you <Col N="1377" /> on 27th of November, 1967, in which you stated:</P>
    <P>With reference to your further representations on behalf of ex-Private James Scally, 2 Harbour Cottages, Mullingar, who is in receipt of a wound pension under the Army Pensions Acts, I am desired by an tAire Cosanta to say that Mr. Scally's case has been reviewed and he has been awarded a final pension at the increased rate of £5 16s 6d per week with effect from 13th October, 1967.  This is the maximum award payable to him having regard to the terms of the Acts and the degree of his disablement, viz. 90 per cent, as assessed by the Army Pensions Board at his recent medical examination. </P>
    <P>Here you have, on your own assessment, agreed that a man in his prime of life is 90 per cent disabled.  He is a member of our Army who volunteered for and went to the Congo and was wounded in the Congo and because of some technical point he is refused any lump sum.  The man as I pointed out, is engaged to be married but he cannot get married, nor can he enjoy life like any other young man because he is 90 per cent disabled. It is a disgrace and I should like the Minister to look into this case.  I am prepared to let him have the correspondence which I have.  The only thing I can do now, and which I do not want to do, is to take the matter up with the United Nations, but, as I say, I do not want to do that if I can get any redress here.</P>

      <P>This particular case is the only matter that calls for a reply in relation to this Supplementary Estimate.  I am glad that the Opposition Parties have received the Supplementary Estimate in the way they have and that they are in favour of it being passed because of the services that have been rendered by the members of the Specified Organisations and the Army in their contribution of services to the United Nations cause.  In relation to the case raised by Deputy L'Estrange, it is not easy of course to reply in detail to a case raised in such a manner in the House without having <Col N="1378" /> the files here, but I should like to point out in a general way that the Minister and the Department of Defence are not free agents in the payment of pensions.  Deputy L'Estrange has pointed out that the Army Pensions Board found this man, who received a gunshot wound in his chest during service in the Congo, 70 per cent disabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of pension is based on the degree of disablement and we are bound by that percentage. In relation to Deputy L'Estrange's statement that the claim could not be entertained because it was not received until after the four year period, he is slightly in error in that.  The fact is that in cases such as this a soldier must be discharged from the Army within the four year period before the claim is a valid claim.  It is a matter, of course, into which I can inquire to see if we can do anything to alter the situation.  I cannot say any more than that at this stage in relation to the matter.  If the Deputy has any information on his file which he thinks the Department should have, we will be glad to get it.</P>

      <P>We agree with the provision of this money.  We believe that any attempt made by an Irish Government to provide work for Irish boys and girls in their own area is money well spent.  It has been stated on numerous occasions that the yard-stick by which any Government should be judged is the number of Irish boys and girls earning their livings and settling down in their own countryside. <Col N="1381" /> If we use that yardstick to measure the achievements of the present Government, we have to admit that things are not going as well as we would like. Unfortunately the Gaeltacht areas of the West are dying.  That is a disgrace to all concerned.  Over 1,000,000 people have been driven from the land of rural Ireland over the past 40 years.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out, our policy is to provide money for those types of industry mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate, industries based on the raw materials available in the areas in which they are established.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Supplementary Estimate, but we think more should be done to keep our people at home in their own country.  For many years we blamed the foreigner for the fact that our people were being driven from their homes in the West and from rural Ireland generally.  We have now had native government for over 40 years and the responsibility of providing work for our people at home in their own country rests on our shoulders.  We wish the Minister and the Government well in any action they take in that direction and we sincerely hope they will be successful</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not <Col N="1382" /> exceeding £2,681,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain Services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for Sundry Grants.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to meet the cost of the increases in rates of payment and the other improvements in social welfare services announced in the 1967 Budget Statement.  When introducing the estimate for my Department in October last, I explained that the 1967-68 estimate did not make provision for this expenditure, and that a supplementary estimate for this purpose would be required later.  The additional amount required is £2,681,000 which will bring the Exchequer expenditure on social welfare for the current financial year to £45,237,000.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead E, which provides for payment by the Exchequer of the deficit on the Social Insurance Fund, only £20,000 extra is being sought.  The additional expenditure from the Fund arising almost entirely from improvements in the social insurance schemes is expected to amount to £1,084,000. This is met to the extent of £817,000 by increased income of the Fund due mainly to the increase in contribution rates from 1st January last.  Accordingly the difference, namely £267,000, falls to be recouped.  There is, however, a sum of £247,000 in the Fund which was overdrawn from the Exchequer in previous years, and when this is offset against the net additional expenditure of £267,000 only £20,000 extra remains to be provided.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Social Assistance&rdquo; substantial additional amounts are required in respect of old age pensions, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and miscellaneous grants.  In the case of non-contributory old age pensions the improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1967, are expected to cost £978,000 in the current financial year. <Col N="1383" /> A saving of £132,000 is, however, anticipated on the original estimate so that the net additional requirement is £846,000.  The extra £1,485,000 required for unemployment assistance is attributable to increased rates of payment, abolition of the Employment Period Orders and an increase in the number of claims over the level on which the original estimate was based. The excess of £171,000 on widows' and orphans' pensions is due to the increased rates of payment in operation since last August.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead K&mdash;Miscellaneous Grants&mdash;the additional sum of £246,000 is required to meet the cost up to 31st March of the free travel concession and the free electricity allowances for pensioners announced in the Budget Statement.  The free travel scheme was introduced on 14th July, 1967, and the free electricity scheme on 1st October.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Deputies will readily agree to provide the additional moneys I am seeking in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in assuming the Fine Gael Party will give its blessing to the provision by the Dáil of the additional money required to maintain the social welfare payments at present made.  Our only regret, on the Fine Gael benches, is that the Minister is not seeking a great deal more in order to provide for our people a standard of living in keeping with what our Christian obligations should make it incumbent upon us to provide for the less privileged in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first occasion on which Dáil Éireann met in 1919, there was a democratic programme proposed.  It was passed unanimously.  In that programme there was a specific declaration of intent on the part of our predecessors to provide for the underprivileged in our community a standard of living which would relieve them of the burdens compelling them to live less useful and less valuable lives as compared with the more fortunate in the community.  I do not <Col N="1384" /> think that, now that we have just reached the 50th Anniversary of the first meeting of Dáil Eireann, we can be at all satisfied that we have fulfilled the declaration of intent made on the occasion of the first meeting of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The time has certainly come when we should not expect old age pensioners to survive on 57/6d a week which today is quite insufficient to provide for them a diet sufficient to free them from the imminent danger of malnutrition.  It is because we provide such a miserable sum that we have a situation in which so many of our old people are decaying of malnutrition, through sheer neglect, through inability to maintain their bodily health because they are unable to feed themselves properly.  This has led us to the unfortunate situation in which we have such a high number of our old people in hospitals.  Of course, we can discuss this more appropriately on the next Supplementary Estimate, but in passing, it is pertinent to say that the colossal health bill, particularly for old people, arising out of the grossly inadequate social welfare payments which we make to the underprivileged, particularly old folk, is an indication of the Government's incapacity to understand the realities of life.</P>
    <P>This was indicated peculiarly during the recent by-election in Wicklow when the Minister for External Affairs, during one of his brief sojourns in this country, went to the dormitory town of Greystones and boasted that old age pensioners could get 57/6d a week and that this figure could be increased to 77/6d a week if an old age pensioner had two schoolgoing children.  I do not know whether this was an exhortation to people in their sixties who had stopped having children to breed again so that they might qualify to get an extra 20/- a week.  That, in effect, is the crystallisation of the social outlook of the Fianna Fáil Party when their deputy leader exhorts people in their seventies to take such steps as may be necessary to increase their families so that they may get an extra 20/- a week, as though 20/- a week would maintain <Col N="1385" /> the children.  This is a sad but unfortunately true reflection on the social outlook of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party are committed to giving old age pensions to people at the age of 65 years.  At present we oblige a large number of people between the ages of 65 and 70 to be classified as unemployed for the purpose of receiving unemployment benefit.  Why we maintain this Gilbertian situation when we ought to realise that they are in fact retired is something we in Fine Gael find difficult to understand.  Again, we interpret it as a reflection on the incapacity of the Fianna Fáil Party to move into the progressive social age in which we live and of their failure to realise that social rights are just as important to people as the more theoretical political rights which have been long established in our midst.</P>
    <P>We need to establish social rights just as primarily as political rights.  I realise it is not appropriate to suggest here legislation or an amendment of the Constitution, but, as we are preoccupied at the moment with an amendment of the Constitution, I suggest it is only fair that I be allowed to say in passing that we will not be a truly just society until Article 45 of the Constitution is as mandatory as every other Article of the Constitution which specifies fundamental rights.  Article 45 is not cognisable in any court of law. It is only the Legislature, this House, which may have regard to Article 45, which imposes an obligation on us as legislators to bear in mind the obligation of maintaining the standards of our people, irrespective of their wealth or their poverty.  It behoves us, as nobody else refers to that Article, to be always conscious of it.  If we are, we must admit we are not fulfilling it.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate and the Minister's opening statement reflect two very important things.  One is that the State is contributing, as one year follows another, a smaller share of the cost of our social insurance. The Minister will note that the social insurance fund has an increased contribution of £817,000 from workers and employers, which works out at <Col N="1386" /> £408,500 apiece from the employer and the worker with, perhaps, a somewhat larger sum from the employer.  The State is paying only £267,000.  There was a time when it used to be on a one-third, one-third, one-third basis, but the State's contribution is becoming progressively smaller.  In an economy like ours where so much depends on the State and on State policies, we do not think the State should be welshing on its obligations in respect of the contributions it should make to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Again, the increased amount which has to be paid by way of unemployment assistance is a reflection of the increased and growing unemployment rate, which now stands at almost 4,000 more than at this time last year and about 7,000 more than the year before.  If we were to estimate unemployment on the basis of the calculation which was used in this country during the past 45 years, we would find that the true figure is 78,000, though the official statistics put it at 65,000.  If we were to calculate it on the traditional basis, the figure would be 78,000 and that is on the basis of the figures we had last week without taking cognisance of the amount of unemployment we unfortunately have this week.</P>
    <P>The State is doing nothing practical to relieve this situation and we think that is most unfortunate.  It is proper to complain that at the moment ratepayers are being called on to pay a couple of million pounds in rates in respect of payments which ought to be made out of the National Exchequer. Taking one area with another, we find that the amounts paid out in public assistance have almost doubled in the past four years.  This is due principally to the need to subsidise the grossly inadequate social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>All local authorities discover that pensioners of one kind or another&mdash; widows and orphans, old folk&mdash;are unable to maintain their standards of living, unable, indeed, to purchase the necessaries of life out of the social welfare payments they receive from the State.  The result is that local authorities are obliged to an extent greater <Col N="1387" /> than ever to meet the colossal deficiencies in State payments.  The Minister may be able to point to the increased nominal amounts being paid by the State under all social welfare payments.  If he does that, we can also point to the growing gap between what the State is paying and what the people must pay in order to purchase the necessaries of life.  The tremendous growth at an unprecedented rate of public assistance proves the point which the Fine Gael benches are making for years that past the State's share of social welfare is getting less and less compared with the total income of those people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister can point to the percentage of GNP, but if one leaves aside the statistics which the Minister can produce for the moment, it is fair to point out that if public assistance is growing and multiplying at the rate at which it is, it must reflect the fact that the standard of living of welfare beneficiaries arising from State welfare payments is so low that it has to be made up out of some other fund.  How can the Minister explain the fact that local authorities are obliged to pay public assistance at such an unprecedented rate to social welfare beneficiaries?  I do not think it is because they have suddenly lost all sense of the burden which paying this places on the rates.  I think it is something they realise has to be done because the State social welfare payments are grossly inadequate in relation to the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>I should also like to direct the Minister's attention to the fuel scheme.  The free fuel scheme operates in the urban areas and the State is paying the cost of it, with the exception of the cost of administration, which falls on the local authority.  However, an increasing number of people in Dublin are now being&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about fuel in it.  Is the Minister not very lucky because what I was going to point out was that at the moment in Dublin we have to pay 15/- a week to old age pensioners in the new Ballymun scheme to pay their heating costs, whereas if they lived elsewhere the Minister would have to pay for a bag of free turf for them?  He would have to pay 5/- or 6/- a week, but because they live in the better housing the corporation has provided, the Minister pays nothing.  The corporation has to pay 15/- to provide these people with heating.  As you say, Sir, I cannot mention that.  I will not.</P>
      <P>There are two other matters on which I have spoken here before and I want to speak again very briefly on them.  These are provided for certainly in the Supplementary Estimate.  I have spoken again and again on the stupidity of requiring that in an urban area old age pensioners collect their pensions at the local post office and nowhere else, and that they attend in person or through their duly appointed agent to collect their pensions.  The only justification given for this system is that it reduces the possibility of fraud because it allows the post office staff to identify pensioners before payment is made.  The truth is that in urban post offices, some of which pay as many as 3,000 pensions in a day, the possibility of identification is negligible because the numbers are so great the post office staff could not possibly know the identity of many of the people attending.  In fact, it is not uncommon for people other than pensioners to get paid at these post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pitiable sight to see long queues of old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients outside post offices in Dublin, and it is a very common sight.  It would appear that the only difficulty is the incapacity of the Minister to tell his Department that <Col N="1389" /> this nonsense must stop and that we should allow old age pensioners to cash their pension orders at places other than post offices.  I know this system was built up at a time when we had not the large, sophisticated urban areas that we have at the present time. The system which is in operation may be all right in a rural district where the postmistress knows everybody, and sometimes knows more about them than they know themselves, but it is not applicable in an urban area.  It has no value from the point of view of preventing fraud.  In fact, quite the reverse: the system incites people to practices which the Department does not approve of.</P>
    <P>In relation to children's allowances, I would like to know why it is that the Department changed the system.  At one time children's allowances were negotiable through banks but some years ago this concession was withdrawn. Now an increasing number of our people are using bank accounts. Many workers are receiving their wages through bank accounts and every other day we are being bombarded on the radio with advertising announcements from several banks telling us that we cannot start too young and that no account is too small.  I would say the development here in this country would be similar to that in other countries and we will have an increasing number of people using bank accounts.  If children's allowances are still to be paid to all people irrespective of income, I feel we should certainly allow their children's allowance payment orders to be negotiable through banks.  To do this would relieve the burden on the post offices, would reduce the length of queues at post offices and, I believe, would expedite clearance of all these orders through the several agencies.  I would hope that the Minister and his Department would apply their minds to these badly-needed reforms.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like the Minister to answer a question.  At paragraph 3 of his opening statement, he referred to a saving of £132,000 but he did not tell us how the saving arises.  I would be very glad if he would let us know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will undoubtedly support the Minister in seeking this money.  We are, however, greatly disturbed by the way this alleged increase of 5/- has been given out.  A very large number of people who rightfully expected to receive this increase found that, despite the headlines in the newspapers, on television and radio, the Minister's Department went around ferreting out any and every excuse for not applying the increase.  This can only be described as a cheap political confidence trick on one of the most underprivileged sections of our community.</P>
      <P>Let me briefly illustrate how this has been applied.  This week in Dublin three old ladies living in a home, a charitable institution run by a minority religion&mdash;it was established originally in 1720 as an almshouse&mdash;have been deprived of this increase by virtue of the fact that they are inmates of this charitable institution which under the law and under its charter cannot accept payment because they provide accommodation only for the really destitute. This is the way in which this increase has been administered.  I would even at this late stage again appeal to the Minister to stop allowing himself and his Department to be the Cinderella of the Cabinet and try to use whatever influence he has on his colleagues to bring to an end this practice in relation to very unfortunate, very underprivileged and unfortunately inarticulate, as far as political pressure is concerned, sections of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disturbing to learn from the Minister's statement that more money is required for unemployment assistance. This is an unfortunate indication that even more of our people than was anticipated find themselves in the position that they are relying solely on social welfare to keep both themselves and their families.  While we at all times have, and will in the future have, no hesitation in supporting the Minister in seeking more money for social welfare purposes, we would hope that the increases sought were not merely to provide money for more people becoming entitled to unemployment assistance.  It is not our idea of catering for social welfare recipients to increase <Col N="1391" /> the number who qualify but not to increase the benefits.  We in this country have old age pensions paid at 70 years of age.  Undoubtedly we must be one of the very few countries that keep it at such a high level when it is commonly accepted that 65 years is the maximum age at which people should qualify for pensions.</P>
    <P>One could go on about social welfare benefits, repeat all over again what has been said here so often, but I do not intend to do so.  I would ask the Minister to take the opportunity that now offers, in the form of the Budget, to ensure that even at this late stage, after nearly 50 years of ruling ourselves, our conscience and the conscience of the Government will be awakened and positive action will be taken in the forthcoming Budget to provide some sort of decent living for those people whose only means are those which they have earned by virtue of their service to the country and for whom we have so shamefully neglected to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal reason for joining in this discussion on the Supplementary Estimate is to ask the Minister to examine his Department and overhaul it.  I know the Minister's Department is expanding, with occupational injuries benefits and all the other claims, and I also know there is a lot of work to be done in the various sections of the Department.  However, I would ask him to have it over-hauled and try to get claims through much faster.  There is a delay in getting claims through which is much too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had several cases in the past year of people having to wait up to six and seven weeks to get claims put through, especially unemployment claims.  Those people find their employers have not submitted their cards in time and there are long delays until the local agents go to the various employers to clear those cards.  As a matter of fact, I have a case at present, and I am waiting to ring the Department again after lunch, where the delay is seven weeks.  This man has been signing on for unemployment <Col N="1392" /> benefit for seven weeks and has received nothing.  I would suggest to the Minister that in such cases, where a person is genuinely unemployed and signs for unemployment assistance, if there is a delay in getting his card right and cleared up, he should be paid unemployment assistance during that period.</P>
    <P>These are all decent working men and they should not be compelled to seek home assistance, which at the moment some of them do.  They go to the various shopkeepers where they are customers and raise credit to carry them over the period.  In the case I have, the man has been waiting for unemployment benefit for seven weeks. He is fully entitled to it from the information I received yesterday.  Such a person should not be forced to go to the home assistance officer.  People just do not like to go to these people if there is any other way possible.</P>
    <P>My suggestion would be that while a person is genuinely unemployed and claims benefit, if the claim cannot be cleared up straight away, he should be put on unemployment assistance during that time so that he will not be left without a shilling in his pocket.  I sincerely ask the Minister to do that and to ensure that all unnecessary delays are cleared up.</P>
    <P>Likewise, when a widow is drawing a widow's pension and reaches the age of 70, she is put on the old age pension.  I had a case recently of a person of 72 years of age to whom the assistance officer came to tell her that she was to go on to the non-contributory old age pension.  The result of this is that for the past ten weeks, since the investigation officer came out, she has received nothing.  There is some dispute about whether she is entitled to the full pension. When such a person reaches 70 years of age, she should automatically go on to the old age pension.  I know there is a difference in the means test as between the two pensions but that difference should be removed straight away.</P>
    <P>When moving the Second Reading of the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution Bills, the Taoiseach said that people will get their statutory <Col N="1393" /> rights, that there was no necessity for them to go to their Deputies, that they will get them in the ordinary way.  I disagree with that: the truth of the matter is that they have to come to Deputies to look for their rights.  I was at a meeting of St. Canice's Credit Union in Kilkenny.  We had an address by Mr. Rosengrave and he said the census taken in England of 700,000 old age pensioners showed that not all of these were getting the full benefit to which they were entitled.  They do not know how to inquire or make application. Of those 700,000, only 400,000 were getting the full benefit.  Our people here are slightly more enlightened than in England.  I would not go so far as to say that that much difference exists in relation to the people who are entitled to this benefit here and that there are over 400,000 getting benefit.  I think the figure would be nearer 500,000 or 600,000.</P>
    <P>These people should get more information on the benefits to which they are entitled and there should be a more sympathetic approach to unemployment benefit and to sickness benefit in general.  If a person in the Civil Service does not get his pay until the middle of the next month, if it runs to three weeks and comes to the 23rd or 24th, I am sure he would resent it.  If such people resent this so much, why would the normal person who is forced to draw these social welfare benefits to which they are entitled not resent it also?  I think they should get the benefit as it becomes due and I appeal to the Minister who looks after this Department and its various sections to look into this matter.  I know the Department is expanding but still I think these are people who should not be delayed so long in getting their benefits.</P>
    <P>I come now to old age pensioners living alone.  In Kilkenny there are people who should get assistance so that they will have some measure of comfort in their old age.  A person living with his family may not be so badly off but a person living alone should be given an allowance for rent.  It is not fair that that should be put on the rates and the ratepayers called on to pay a supplementary allowance to old age pensioners.  I <Col N="1394" /> should like the Minister to look into those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to avail of this opportunity to join with my colleagues in appealing to the Minister to take all possible steps to ensure that the long delays which we know exist in relation to the payment of so many social welfare benefits will be obviated.  The Minister will surely appreciate that the delays involved in the payment of disability benefit, or sickness benefit, as it is more commonly known in this country, and indeed also in respect of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, are a source of great hardship, worry and anxiety to the families of the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>My appeal to the Minister is to look into this matter very carefully and see if he can simplify the present procedure for the payment of disability benefit in particular.  I understand that all claims for social welfare benefits are siphoned through Aras Mhic Dhiarmada. Here we have a case for the decentralisation of so many benefits. Unemployment assistance, old age pensions, widows' pensions, non-contributory pensions, children's allowances, and the contributory schemes for old age pensions for widows and orphans and the like, are all channelled through the one Department, so you are bound to have delays and confusion and sometimes duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us in public life are well aware of the tremendous hardship and privations which so many families have to endure in order to secure the benefits to which they are entitled.  They are obliged to resort to home assistance and humiliate themselves to this extent.  We know, too, that there is reluctance on the part of home assistance officers to pay home assistance until they are completely satisfied that the applicant is making a factual statement and there is the embarrassment and humiliation of the applicant being told to go for particulars to his local employment exchange and take them back to the assistance officer and then he may decide to grant assistance or he may not.  If he does grant the benefit, he <Col N="1395" /> can insist on the applicant signing a notice of intention to repay the assistance granted in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the standard of living of this applicant, and possibly his wife and family, is dragged down to a subsistence level of existence and the Minister and his Department and officers seemingly do not give a damn how this family exists.  No one seems to care about the human suffering involved in the delays in the payment of social welfare benefits.  These people are thrown on the support of the local TD or county councillor, or the like, and they have to fall back on home assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister must find ways and means of simplifying and shortcutting this procedure, especially where it is clear that a person is entitled to benefit by reason of the number of stamps accredited to him over his working life. Here there may well be a unique opportunity of decentralisation, for conferring more power and authority on the local officers in our employment exchanges, the local health authorities, county councils or assistance officers, as the case may be.  The conferring of power on some local employees would assist in the administration of our Social Welfare Act so as to eliminate the hardship, the suffering and the privation which we know exists because of delays which the red tape involves before the recipient receives the money to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>We are particularly happy to support the Supplementary Estimate on this occasion in so far as it does not include the odious and unfair means test which applies to increases in social welfare assistance allowances in the past few years.  We have had increases granted to all intents and purposes, or purporting to be granted, by way of 5/-increase, only to find there was a means test applied which stipulated that the applicant must have no means before he can get the increase, or not more than 10/- per week as provided in a previous Budget.  This was appalling procedure and negatived in very large measure the whole intention behind the increase in pensions.  It was tantamount to a confidence trick, <Col N="1396" /> a very grave fraud, being perpetuated on the most helpless section.  It is about time that the Minister liberalised the approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would avail of this opportunity to make a statement to the House and to the country as to the up to date position in regard to his obligation to bring the social welfare code into line with that applicable in the EEC countries.</P>

      <P>The provision of free electricity allowances and free travel allowances has been adverted to by the Minister.  A number of persons are excluded.  I refer, in particular to persons over the age of 70 who are in poor circumstances and depending on very small pensions of one kind or another from the British Government, such as British retirement pensions or British widows' pensions, and so on. Because the pension happens to be a British Government pension, which in some cases might not exceed the corresponding Irish pension, the applicant is not entitled to the free electricity allowance.  The number involved is not very great and I would ask the Minister to apply the provisions I have referred to to this category of persons <Col N="1397" /> irrespective of the source of the pension. I do not see why there should be discrimination merely because the pension is a British pension.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the procedure laid down for the qualification certificate and for qualification, generally, in respect of unemployment assistance.</P>

I do not wish to put myself out of order, but I do think we are entitled to some little latitude so as, at least, to reply to the points made by the Minister in his speech. The Minister has referred to the moneys available and the reason for the increase in respect of unemployment assistance and, surely, therefore, we would be entitled to comment on that statement and also on the fact that an additional sum is required for unemployment assistance, which would indicate that there is an increase in unemployment and also to refer to the procedure laid down for qualification?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  With regard to the payment of social welfare contributions, especially in the case of old age and widows' pensions, I would ask the Minister if, after the very great consideration which I know he has given to the oft-repeated pleas in this House, he would now say whether he feels that he can at last make payment <Col N="1398" /> of old age pensions, in particular, at the age of 65?  Would the Minister like to avail of this opportunity to comment on that?  I do not have to elaborate on the vital necessity for this reduction in the age limit.</P>
      <P>The Chair has informed us that we will get an opportunity later on of dealing in greater detail with the social welfare code.  Naturally, I am inhibited and restricted on this occasion.  My main reason for rising was to draw attention to the hardship involved in many thousands of cases by reason of delay in the Department of Social Welfare in dealing with applications for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability allowance. I would ask the Minister to do what he can to simplify the procedure so that time-lags could be reduced or eliminated. It is patently unfair to county councils and health authorities that they should be charged with the responsibility of maintaining applicants and their families over long periods, in some cases over a number of weeks, as a result&mdash;I will not say of dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister and his Department&mdash;but of the cumbersome procedure that must be followed before payment is made.  I would hope that the Minister would have some good news for us in that respect because the human suffering, frustration and deprivation involved is too great to be ignored any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the Deputies who have spoken in this debate have adverted to administrative delay in the payment of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, old age pensions, and so on.  I should like to point out to the Minister that administrative action over the past ten years has meant centralisation, probably with the idea of securing greater efficiency.  I would submit to the House that it has had the opposite effect. Deputies, who get hundreds of applications, have to approach the Department in Dublin and the question has then to be transmitted to the local office.  The local officer has to investigate the matter and make a report which is returned to the central office. That means a time-lag of a minimum <Col N="1399" /> of three weeks to a month, at a conservative estimate.</P>
      <P>There are social welfare officers in all parts of the country.  Actually, a new building was opened in the town of Wexford some time ago by the Minister's predecessor.  But it is of no use whatever to the local Deputy.  He cannot go to this office and make representations there.  He can do it but it remains in effect the same thing&mdash;the local officer has to send it to Dublin, making the whole procedure longer.  It is quicker for us just to go to Dublin. We are not getting the effect we should get.</P>

As a result, there is a delay of two or three days in occupational injury benefit claims being paid out on the week they should be.  Would the Minister instruct all the local agents to send a separate claim for occupational injuries addressed to Floor 1 at Árus Mhic Dhiarmada instead of having them go in the general envelope?

I assume, if we are being asked to vote £846,000, one of our principal pre-occupations should be to ensure that the money expeditiously reaches the beneficiary.  In reciting the following story to Dáil Éireann, I want to lay special emphasis on this: in respect of each officer with whom I came in contact, I received nothing but courtesy and all the help each individual officer could extend to me.  But I have been now 36 years threading my way through the labyrinth of Government and municipal offices and therefore it presented no serious problem to me on the telephone to move from one centre to another.  But compare my situation with that of the constituent on whose behalf I was acting.  I have a constituent who was laid up in hospital in the city of Dublin.

      <P>This poor fellow might have had the same experience if he were a non-contributory pensioner. When he got home, he found £46 15s taken from his pension.  I started on my saga.  I rang up the almoner of the hospital, and a very civil lady she was. She said she remembered him well but that, as far as she was concerned, it was no concern of hers and I had better get in touch with Mr. A., we will say, of Dublin Health Authority.  I rang up Mr. A. and, as far as he was concerned, it did not seem to come within his particular sphere of influence, but maybe Mr. B., who was in charge of the patients' personal property division, might be able to assist me.  So I rang up Mr. B. Nothing could be more civil than Mr. B., but Mr. B. said it did not come within his sphere of office but possibly if I would ring up Mr. C. he might be able to lend a hand.  Right enough, when I got in touch with Mr. C. he said, yes, he had got the £46 10s and was not inclined to part.  I said: &ldquo;But surely an old age pensioner is not to be charged for treatment in a hospital to which he is referred by a public health authority?&rdquo; Mr. C. is still investigating the matter for me and I have no doubt will ultimately resolve the matter for me.  But surely there ought to be some less devious method by which an old age pensioner who finds £46 10s deducted from his old age pension in respect of hospital treatment could discover how to get it back?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience with the Department of Social Welfare has testified to this before.  I find them consistently anxious to get for the beneficiary the last farthing which the law entitles him to recover.  There is no lack of sympathy, no cold, bureaucratic approach to human problems in that Department, from my experience.  But I do suggest we are failing effectively to resolve problems of the kind I have <Col N="1402" /> described here partly because of the decision taken some years ago to withdraw social welfare officers from their country offices and to centralise the service more than it had been hitherto.</P>
      <P>I think that was a mistake.  It reacts on the effectiveness of the money we are now providing for the relief of the poor.  I can very well understand, as the number of beneficiaries of the various social services multiplies, the strong pressure that administration must bring to bear on the Department of Social Welfare to computerise the whole business and to try to do a great deal of this work through computers in the Department in Árus Mhic Dhiarmada. From an administrative point of view, one can imagine that that is a course to be commended.  But when you come in contact with specific cases, you recognise that, if social welfare benefits are to yield their real value, it is not only the distribution of money that counts, because it is some sympathetic officer who will resolve the social beneficiaries' specific problems.</P>
      <P>I offer the Minister an example from my own experience.  I remember that when the Land Project was inaugurated, I insisted that the form the beneficiaries under the scheme would receive should contain nothing but: &ldquo;I want my land rehabilitated&mdash;Signed, Patrick Walsh,&rdquo; or whatever the applicant's name was.  The moment I got that form from the Department, I said that my officials should go to Patrick Walsh with all the details we required and fill up the detailed form. We wanted a lot of detailed information in order effectively to permit him to benefit under the scheme, but if we sent out the detailed form and asked him to fill it up, he would immediately be lost in a maze of bewilderment, whereas experienced officers of the Department could fill up the form without the slightest difficulty.  Because they were experienced officers, they would not be in the least intimidated in a maze of essential information which would enable them to handle the problem expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as we have failed to maintain an adequate network of social service officials throughout rural <Col N="1403" /> Ireland, I think we have failed to provide the people with the full benefits which are available from an annual expenditure of £13,863,000 which we are appropriating in respect of non-contributory old age pensions.  Quite honestly, in discussing this Supplementary Estimate, I cannot make any complaint on the grounds that I feel the approach of the Department of Social Welfare was bureaucratic, unsympathetic or reprehensible.  The very reverse is the case in my experience, but I do think we are in danger of becoming involved in a mass of impersonal administration of red tape, for want of a better word, which is possibly frustrating the genuine desire of the officials of the Department to give the people the kind of human sympathy and service which ought to constitute a very substantial part of the work of the Department over and above the money we are now asked to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us can have any objection to this request for a sum of £2,681,000 extra for this section of the community.  I should like to begin by making the point which has occurred to most other Deputies. This particular field of the social services is one to which Deputies devote a great deal of their time.  When we speak on this Supplementary Estimate, we are reminded of the Taoiseach's remarks a few weeks ago when he said that a lot of the time which we should be devoting to passing legislation in this House was being devoted to obtaining what I think he called favours for the people we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In no other sphere is our presence among our constituents more needed than in the sphere of social welfare, because the whole system of social welfare is so inhuman, and bears so little relation to actual need, and is so difficult for our constituents to understand.  So, a great deal of our time is taken up with this problem. We have been promised that social welfare will receive a new look in the very near future.  It requires rationalisation, simplification, humanising and being brought into line with the needs <Col N="1404" /> of the people.  It is an elaborate mass of regulations which people cannot understand, and because they have no relation to need, they should be eliminated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to Subhead E, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This is met to the extent of £817,000 by increased income of the Fund, due mainly to the increase in contribution rates from 1st January last.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister on behalf of people who are drawing widows' contributory pensions and who are also employed, and who when they become unemployed, by virtue of their jobs being no longer available or through illness, do not draw unemployment or disability benefit on the same scale as other people in the community&mdash;men, single girls or married women.  This is something which people fail to understand, and which brings people to Deputies in large numbers.  I do not blame them for not understanding it.  These widows pay the same contribution rates as other people in our society, and I do not blame them for not understanding why when it comes to the payment of benefit, they cannot receive benefit at the same rate when they have paid their contributions at the same rate as other people.  Some widows who become unemployed get half the rate of benefit which a married woman next door gets.  They cannot understand how such a scheme can be in existence in this country, and they come along to their local Deputies.  That is part and parcel of the kind of work the Taoiseach says we should not be doing, and which we would not have to do if the system were rationalised and organised so that people could understand it.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Social Assistance&rdquo;, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The excess of £171,000 on widows' and orphans' pensions is due to the increased rates of payment in operation since last August.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal for perhaps the hundredth time inside and outside the House for the payment of children's <Col N="1405" /> allowances to the children of social welfare recipients who are over 16 years of age and still being educated.  I cannot understand the persistence of the Department in refusing to pay these allowances to the parents of these children. There is now a more enlightened attitude and with the advent of free education, children in all walks of life who are being educated over the age of 16 years are now being considered for the purpose of differential rents and for various purposes where managerial discretion is exercised under the Department of Health and so on.  Social welfare should also be considered and I think this figure of £171,000 should be larger to make provision for these children whose parents are the only people in the community who must now make a definite sacrifice to maintain their children over 16 years in full time education.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the provision in Subhead K of £246,000 which is required to meet the cost of the free travel concession and the free electricity allowances for pensioners announced in the Budget Statement.  I appeal to the Minister whose Department are subsidising this free electricity to add his voice to the voices of many others on behalf of those people who cannot avail of it.  My colleague, Deputy Treacy, referred to some of them.  I do not want to refer to that category.  I want to refer to people in isolated rural areas who are not served by the electricity supply because they live, in ESB jargon, five, six or seven poles from the source of supply.  They are asked to pay a special service charge which is completely outside the scope of the ability of old age pensioners to pay, and therefore they are precluded from benefiting under this scheme.  I would ask the Minister to add his voice to the plea on behalf of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to remark, we do not oppose this Estimate.  When the proposals were made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget of last year, the Labour Party spontaneously agreed to the provision of the money for these improvements in social welfare.  The Minister had a relatively easy task in the distribution of the moneys made <Col N="1406" /> available to him by the Minister for Finance.  I do not wish to take from the improvements that have been made.  However, we should be conscious of the big change in the distribution of the moneys by reason of the introduction of contributory schemes for old age pensions, widows' pensions and retirement pensions.</P>
      <P>I remember when it took over £1 million to give an increase of 2/6d per week.  I know that some Fianna Fáil Deputies are bursting to tell me what I did or did not do when I was Minister for Social Welfare.  It is relatively simple for the Minister to give benefits with the £2½ million he has this year compared with the system which operated when it took over £1 million to give an increase of 2/6d a week in the old age pension.</P>
      <P>As against what has been said in recent debates and what will be said <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Fianna Fáil Party when they compare the administration of this Government with that of another Government, not alone must we think in terms of the rates now being paid but we must also think in terms of the increase in the cost of living and of the fact that, at a particular time, we had food subsidies which were of tremendous benefit to those depending on social welfare.  I do not want to take from the improvements the Minister has made but merely wish to point out the difference between present conditions and those obtaining ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has given the fullest information to the House: I do not say he has deliberately concealed it.  In respect of the Social Insurance Fund, I should like him to assure us that there is the same division as far as contribution is concerned.  For years, the pattern has been that the Exchequer would contribute one-third, the employer one-third and the employee one-third.  In this Estimate, the actual contribution from the Exchequer is £20,000 because, as the Minister says, there was an overdraw from the Exchequer in previous years. Perhaps he would go into a little more detail and tell us how that happened. <Col N="1407" /> The net position is that to increase sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, contributory widows' pensions and contributory old age pensions, cost a mere £20,000 this year.  Are we still maintaining the one-third contribution from the three different sources I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>The Minister must also give us a breakdown in relation to the extra £1,485,000 required for unemployment assistance which, he says, is attributable to the increased rates of payment, to the abolition of the Employment Period Orders and to an increase in the number of claims over the level on which the original Estimate was based. I think we should get a breakdown of that.  It should be known that some of this money&mdash;I do not know how much &mdash;has to be provided because there is an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>It should be mentioned here also that, in recent months&mdash;and it has been consistent for very many months &mdash;there has been an increase in the number of those not in employment to the extent of 3,000 and sometimes 3,500 per month.  The Minister should give us a breakdown of this to see what the increase in the number of unemployed has cost in unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We all approve of and welcome the scheme which provides free travel for old age pensioners, the blind and certain other people and also the free electricity.  I do not know whether this £210,000 for free travel could be regarded as a further charge on Government. It appears to me that it could be regarded as another subsidy to CIE or maybe it would mean that the ordinary State subsidy to CIE is reduced by £210,000.  The fact that people now have free travel does not mean any extra income or expenditure as far as CIE is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Chair has said we must not talk of anything other than what comes within the Estimate and certainly we must not talk about administration. I do not intend to transgress the ruling of the Chair, but I want to say that, in my dealings with the <Col N="1408" /> Department of Social Welfare, I have received nothing but help and courtesy, without any exception whatsoever, so far as the personnel is concerned. However, we could all criticise the lack of system.  I can corroborate what Deputy Mrs. Desmond has said.  The bulk of the representations I receive concerns the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department do not appear to be wrong in respect of the majority of those representations or approaches I receive, if there is a deficiency as far as the filling-in of a form or the proper making of a claim by an individual is concerned. Over and above that, the Minister should now concern himself with streamlining his Department.  He should endeavour to cut out a lot of unnecessary red tape which binds the excellent personnel in his Department.</P>
    <P>If a complaint is made and it is alleged that some unfortunate person in receipt of unemployment assistance is working&mdash;a complaint by an anonymous writer or by a jealous neighbour, and so on&mdash;the unfortunate man concerned is debarred from receiving unemployment assistance.  That decision is made at the local exchange by some local officer and the matter is then referred to the Department.  It could be up to two or three months before a decision is made on the man's case.  If he is single and is entitled to unemployment assistance and if he goes to the local authority, he does not receive one penny because he is single. He is debarred from receipt of unemployment assistance.  It may take anything up to two or three months to get a final decision.  If he is in the right, he gets his back money.  I suggest that that is not the correct procedure.</P>
    <P>Officials in the various employment exchanges should be told by the Minister not to refer all these trivial cases to the Department because, if they do, it inevitably means they must go before an appeals officer and this takes far too much time.  The same may be said in certain cases of sickness benefit and other benefits paid by the Department. The Minister should streamline his Department so that quick decisions can be given.  The people depending on the payments given by the Department are <Col N="1409" /> the poorer people in our community who cannot afford inordinate delays. The Minister should give a breakdown of these moneys in greater detail than he has given in his opening statement or than has appeared in the Estimate for his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not frown: I shall not delay him.  In regard to my interruption when Deputy Dillon was speaking I said that the people he was talking about were the people the Taoiseach said should not bother Members with the trivial things they should be able to get themselves. I agree with Deputy Dillon that Deputies do spend a lot of time trying to straighten out small matters relating to social welfare, particularly the contributory end of it.  I am not complaining, nor am I sure were other Deputies, about the officers of the Department.  I find most of them courteous and very anxious to ensure that people get what they are entitled to get.  The Minister himself, on a number of occasions when I had to bring matters to his notice, was also very courteous.  We are not complaining about the personnel but about the system.</P>
      <P>I know that I am skating on thin ice in speaking about this matter on a Supplementary Estimate but I shall be very brief.  It concerns people who have been on occupational injuries benefit and are switched, as a result of examination, to ordinary disability benefit.  In the case of the first, whatever the amount is, it is usually paid regularly but the other one is not so paid.  The man concerned gets the 23/-for a period of 14 or 15 weeks but he is also entitled to £5 11s 0d for his wife from the disability benefit and, of course, he usually gets nothing at all until somebody kicks up a row.  This is probably due to teething troubles in the new system but I suggest that it should not happen, and I hope the Minister will take care to ensure that it does not continue to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is the question of investigation and appeal.  It appears that when an investigation, particularly of the assistance sections, is carried out, the delays are <Col N="1410" /> far too great.  Deputy Corish has mentioned this and it is ridiculous that somebody applies for benefit through the assistance end of the Department and for some extraordinary reason, can be literally months waiting for a decision. In many cases the argument is made: &ldquo;We thought they were not entitled to it and there was no urgency.&rdquo;  If it turns out that they are entitled to it, surely there is every urgency.  If they do not get it, it does not seem to matter a damn.  It seems that they prejudge these cases and I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I want to complain bitterly about the fact that on 19th December last, social welfare investigating officers from the DB section&mdash;doctors, I presume&mdash;went out to examine patients in my constituency, a big number of them, and declared them not unfit for work. This was on the 19th of December and what these people had for their Christmas dinner can easily be imagined.  It is a disgraceful situation that any Department of State should stoop to that sort of thing.  It meant that even if these people were to seek work and were fit for work, there was no possibility of them finding employment between the 19th of December and Christmas.  Neither could they get unemployment benefit.  It simply meant they got no money whatever.  Many of them were, on appeal, found unfit for work, afterwards.  I ask the Minister to ensure that does not happen again. Christmas is a long way off yet but this should not happen in any circumstances and particularly at the festive time of the year when everybody tries to have a little extra.  These people were left literally without a shilling in their pockets.</P>
    <P>Again, this may be a matter for the main Estimate, but I should like to mention it now as I cannot raise it on the main Estimate.  I did raise it last year.  I ask the Minister when preparing his Budget requirements to do what I suggested last year and provide some type of disability assistance, just as there is unemployment assistance.  The man with stamps may not be so badly off, but the man who is short of stamps, whose stamps have <Col N="1411" /> run out or who has not sufficient of them, is usually left in a position of having to apply for home assistance and he may be very hungry and ill before anything is done for him.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, if at all possible, to squeeze in a few shillings for that purpose when preparing his Estimate for the Minister for Finance this year.</P>

      <P>Sometimes a widow who finds it difficult to live on the widow's pension tries to find some other means of supplementing her income and immediately that happens, the social welfare officer makes inquiries, with the result that the widow is deprived of her pension.  That is wrong.  She has only sought the employment in order to help her to live more comfortably.  A few such cases have been brought to my notice. The Minister should also consider mentally retarded people of 17, 18 or 19 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I heard another Deputy say that a special charge was being imposed on some of the old age pensioners who were considering getting in electricity. It would be beyond their means to meet such a charge.  If the amount involved is at all reasonable, I think the Minister should try to make it possible for these people who have worked hard all their live to get the benefit of electricity in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I mentioned this problem to the Minister and it is no harm to refer to it again.  Sometimes husbands and wives find it difficult to make a living in the country on one pension and possibly, through lack of employment, the woman will decide to go to England to get work.  She may be a nurse or an ex-civil servant but in any case she goes and gets employment there.  The Social Welfare Department <Col N="1412" /> finds out what her income is over there. Some of what she is earning in England may be contributing largely to the education of a boy or girl and that is a big demand on the income.  She has to live over there and what is asked of her in such cases is to maintain the husband also.  I am sure there are not many such cases and I would ask the Minister to allow the husband to continue to draw the pension.  This will leave him with his own allowance and I am sure the husband could also do with an allowance from the wife.  In addition, some of these people are helping out members of the family and for that reason I am sure the Minister will be sympathetic towards them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not anticipate that the debate would range over such a wide field on a Supplementary Estimate. I am not objecting to the latitude in relevance that has been permitted but because of this, I might not have at my fingertips replies to all the points that were put to me and which might be more appropriate on the annual Estimate.  However, I shall try to deal with all the points as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that I am happy in the knowledge that there is general satisfaction with the upward trend in the social welfare code in recent years and I am grateful to the Deputies who acknowledged that fact and paid tribute to our efforts, and to say with them that I, too, would like to see all rates higher.  I suppose no Minister&mdash;and I have said this here before&mdash; would ever come into this House and be in a position where the Opposition Deputies would stand up and say that the rates are too high.  I never anticipated that that was likely to happen. This is a particular type of payment where one can be very emotional.  One can always induce the greatest possible sympathy in advocating better rates, better conditions and an extended scope for the entire code.  However, I think the £45 million which the Exchequer is contributing to Social Welfare in the current year, a total disbursement of over £63 million, is in relation to our GNP or to the national income, by any <Col N="1413" /> test, very generous.  Certainly if we do make comparisons with the increases made some years ago, the progress made is quite satisfactory, so much so that if the same trend continues in the years ahead we will very quickly reach the stage where we can make favourable comparison with any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not want Deputy Corish to take the wind out of my sails to a certain extent by anticipating the things which should be done or making comparisons with the rates applying now and those that applied years ago.  I do not want to score any points against the unfortunate people who are at fault in an estimate of this kind.  I should like to point out that in an examination of the entire social welfare code one can see a great many areas in which improvements can be and should be effected.  But there again social services cover a very wide range.  Social welfare is only one branch and we must have regard to what other Ministers may do in their respective Departments in the way of social services.  We must have certain priorities and, of course, have regard to the amount of money we can take from the people at any particular time to help the weaker sections.  However, I think it is right to admit that the public conscience has in recent times become more and more awakened to the need to do better for these sections.  The standard which I am inclined to apply is not what the cost-of-living index figure has shown over a particular period.  It is inevitable that we cover these increases, but I would rather be inclined to make a comparison with the improved standard of living of the people generally in considering the rates which I should like to see payable as time goes on.  The pittance payable years ago to the welfare classes might be regarded as generous in the context of what the general standard of living of the people was at the time, but the standard of living has improved very considerably, and this tends to highlight the need for doing more and better for the weaker sections, particularly the aged, the widowed and the disabled.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be wise at <Col N="1414" /> this time to anticipate anything I would say in my Estimate speech or what social welfare improvements are likely to be made in the near future, but I want to repeat that I have had examined and, for my own benefit, been examining the entire social welfare code.  One would have no difficulty whatever in producing a White Paper to outline the trend which we should follow, and I am not anxious to do this lest it would create the impression that here was a complete, new plan which would be implemented overnight.  I prefer to set out the course on which social welfare should develop in the future and establish priorities as far as possible for the implementation of benefits in the necessitous areas as time goes on.  We are conscious of all the anomalies there are and of the course we should follow not merely in relation to improvements which are obvious but also in relation to what is being done in other countries.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this stage that if we examine, as we are frequently reminded we should, the social welfare code in the different countries of the EEC or in Europe generally, the first thing we find is a complete lack of harmonisation. The Treaty of Rome does not impose any direct obligation on the member countries immediately to harmonise their systems.  It advises them to move in that direction, and I do not think much progress has been made.  I am not using this as the reason why we should fail to improve and expand our services, but I merely say that to point out that anybody who may be of the opinion that there is a glorious harmonisation taking place in the EEC as of now would be disillusioned if he examined all the codes of the different countries.  That is not to say that many of them are not much better in individual cases than those which we operate, but there are other cases where in a comparison we would come out very favourably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked for a breakdown of the figures in relation to the increased amount required for unemployment assistance, and I give him these as far as they are available in my brief.  The extra amount sought is <Col N="1415" /> £1,485,000; the original estimate was £2,865,000; and the revised estimate is £4,350,000.  Of this, unemployment assistance under the Employment Period Orders amounted to £620,000. The increase in rates as operated from 2nd August last amounted to £350,000. The increased number of application grants amounted to £515,000.  I think that is the figure he was trying to extract in order to demonstrate that the unemployment figures had gone up.  It is true that many people have applied for unemployment assistance who heretofore were not interested.  Many of them have been encouraged and induced to apply owing to the change in the system of assessing means on the owners of small farms where the means test is now based on the valuation of the land rather than on what their income was or their earnings from the land were over a specific period.  The means test being based on the valuation of the land does enable the smallholder to improve his holding or to improve the earnings from his holding as much as he wishes without having the amount of UA of which he is in receipt being in any way reduced or interfered with.  This has resulted in extra applications and indeed the easing of the means test generally and the improvement of rates have also been responsible for more applicants coming along.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind those people who continually point to the unemployment figure to remember that when from March each year the Employment Period Orders came into existence, they reduced immediately the numbers on the unemployment register. These EPOs, as we know them, are not now being made and as a result these people can continue in receipt of unemployment assistance all the year.</P>
    <P>Most people who spoke referred to the administration of these schemes generally.  I am not going to take a long time replying but while all of them paid tribute to the officers of the Department, many of them referred to the undue delays and harsh decisions taken in some cases.  Deputy Tully pointed to medical referees and one <Col N="1416" /> would almost think from what he said that they were sent out deliberately to make sure that people had their disability benefit discontinued before Christmas.  This can happen at any time in the year and indeed, I would say in all sincerity, from experience in the Department in regard to disability benefit, that if we could reduce the number of malingerers to the minimum, we could afford to pay considerably more to the genuine cases.  Very often the people who have been proved to be malingering and abusing the system are the cause of the genuine case being unduly severely investigated. If sometimes the officers, or the medical personnel appear to be harsh in pursuance of an examination or of spot checks, it is due to the fact that experience has proved that we have had, to use a slang term, our eye wiped many times.  If we could eliminate or reduce to the minimum these abuses, it would leave us with considerably more money to improve the rates we are paying generally to this type of individual.</P>
    <P>The question of extending free electricity to British pensioners was raised by way of question in the House yesterday. I did not agree with Deputies who pointed out that many cases of hardship arise in respect of these pensioners. If a recipient of a British contributory pension residing here is in a particular state of hardship, if his pension is particularly small, then he would qualify at least for a part Irish non-contributory pension, as many of them do, in which case he would already have a pension book which would entitle him to the free electricity, if he is otherwise qualified, and also to the free travel which we have now extended to many of them.  This was a point missed by most speakers who referred to the most necessitous type of British pensioner.

      <P>He might.  There are other considerations.  He might have property.  If the Deputy has specific cases, he can send them along and we will deal with them.  I was dealing with the question of administration and reference was made by some Deputies to this problem of what is described as red tape.  This is something everybody would like to eradicate completely in every Department.  We talk glibly about this and in my time over on those benches, I talked about it too, but when you get down to an empirical examination of this problem, you find that it is not just as easy as that.  While <Col N="1418" /> payments are made and schemes operated, there must be regulations governing the entire administration of such schemes, and particularly if there is a means test, there must be an investigation and the applicants have to show that they are qualified and in order to do that it just is not possible to have the money sent out the next day.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the Taoiseach as saying that Deputies intervened in cases where they should not.  All the people who make the representations are not Deputies; schoolteachers and other people make representations on behalf of these people, very often by showing them the right way to go about it.  While there is a certain amount of what has been commonly called red tape, it is nothing more than the minimum required in order that the applicant may state in the simplest terms possible what his qualifications are, in order to conform with the Department's requirements to qualify for a certain pension.  It is absolutely impossible to dispense with these minimum requirements.</P>
      <P>The format of the application form for old age pensions at present is as simple as it possibly could be.  Indeed, I can safely say that if an applicant merely puts his name and address on the form, the investigating officer will do the rest when he comes to investigate. I should like to see these claims dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  I know that the officials of the Department are always straining to ensure that there is the minimum delay.  If you take any individual case, however, and examine it, you will always find that there was a good reason why it was not possible to avoid delay.  There are very few exceptions where there is undue delay in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like again to refer to something I mentioned in the House the other day in answer to supplementary questions about applications for qualification certificates for unemployment assistance.  We are often accused of undue delay in respect of these and people are not generally aware that the qualification certificate can be applied for and obtained even while <Col N="1419" /> the person is employed.  It need not necessarily be accompanied by an application for assistance.  Persons who may at some time, in order to fill a gap before unemployment benefit is paid and who might, therefore, need unemployment assistance, should take the precaution to ensure that they have a qualification certificate before they make application for unemployment assistance.  If they take that precaution, it will eliminate a good many of the complaints about delays in applications for qualification certificates.</P>
    <P>I shall not attempt to reply to any of the subtle questions posed as to what may be done in the immediate future for the social welfare classes.  Deputy Ryan implied that we are now getting away with less than one-third from the Exchequer in the case of the Insurance Fund.  That is not correct.  In the current financial year, as the figures show, we have actually had a contribution from the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund of 37 per cent.  In fact, the Exchequer contribution tends to go higher than the 33?, which is the figure aimed at, and, if the amount we are seeking here tends to imply that it was less than one-third, it is because this is designed only to make up for the amount the Fund is short.  We take credit here for the extra payment from the Exchequer in 1967 just as we take credit for the over-estimation of £132,000, to which the Deputy also referred.  It should be easy to understand. I think, that it is not possible in my Department to anticipate the numbers of unemployment beneficiaries there may be as a result of displacement, stoppage of work, and so on, and the wisest thing to do, therefore, is to estimate on the right side; the £132,000 was due simply to over-estimation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin referred to specific cases.  I do not think he would expect me to deal with all of these. In particular I do not think he would expect me to deal now with the case about which he wrote to me yesterday. He referred to the special service charges <i>vis-á-vis</i> old age pensioners. <Col N="1420" /> We are looking into this.  There is more involved here than meets the eye. There are many cases in which people did not accept rural electrification because the extra charge was prohibitive. Our payment meets the normal bimensal charge based on the area of the dwelling and, to a lower extent, on the outoffices.  We do not pay the extra charge imposed in the case of isolated dwellings.  However, I am looking into all this.  The difficulty is that people would accept installation if they were sure we would pay this abnormal figure, but even the ESB advised it would not be wise to do this or even to introduce bottled gas as a substitute for electricity.  I appreciate that many people find themselves at a disadvantage. I am looking into the whole question to see if it might be possible to do something in the future.  I make no promises.</P>
    <P>The simplification of application forms and the short-circuiting of decisions on claims are matters upon which the Department are always working in an effort to ease the position, but it is not always possible to achieve these aims.  One cannot computerise a system in which the human element is so deeply involved.  Direct contact will, I am afraid, always be essential.  If we are dealing only with saints it might be much easier; unfortunately, experience here, as elsewhere, does not justify discarding the necessary investigations which must take place to find out whether or not persons are entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I did not think the debate on this Supplementary Estimate, which covers moneys granted really in last years' Budget, would range over such a wide field.  I have tried to cover most of the points raised.  There are many other points requiring reply, but I must have regard to the fact that this is not the time to deal with these, but I hope to have an opportunity of doing that in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> exceeding £1,240,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Árd-Chláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The original Vote provision for the current year was £21,757,000.  Requirements are now estimated at £22,997,000, leaving an additional sum of £1,240,000 to be made available. The need for supplementary provision arises entirely on Subhead G&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities, and is for the purpose of supplementing by £625,000 the provision for balances of grants payable to health authorities in respect of the year 1966-67, and to meet a deficiency, also estimated at £625,000, in the provision for 1967-68 grants. The total supplementary requirements of £1,250,000 are offset by a saving of £10,000 under Subhead P&mdash;in which provision is made for the fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the grants payable to Health Authorities are directly related to their expenditure. Final accounts of health authorities furnished to my Department for 1966-67 show an increase of £625,000 over the figure on which the original provision was based.  In order to comply with the special undertaking to relieve the rates of all increases in expenditure for 1966-67, over that for the previous year, the full amount of £625,000 must be borne on the Vote.</P>
    <P>The original estimate of Vote requirements in respect of the year 1967-68 was based on an estimated total expenditure by Health Authorities of £36,500,000.  The latest estimate is £37,700,000&mdash;an increase of £1,200,000.  I have decided that the same level of Exchequer recoupment should apply to additional expenditure arising in 1967-68 as had been adopted in calculating the grants provided for in the original Estimate.  To do this a sum of £625,000 is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The increased expenditure in 1966-67 arises, to the extent of about £300,000, on drugs and medicines supplied at dispensaries and used in hospitals. This represents an increase of the order of 14 per cent of the cost of drugs and medicines as previously estimated.  The balance of the increase can be accounted for under a number of headings. These are mainly the institutional costs such as salaries, food, heat and light.</P>
    <P>The same factors are to a large degree responsible for the estimated increase of £1,200,000 in the expenditure of health authorities for the year 1967-68.  Drugs and medicines account for over £400,000 of the excess cost, which represents 18 per cent of the original figure.  Here, I might interpolate a comment on the rising cost of drugs.  The increased usage of drugs is a feature of modern medicine and since drug therapy and allied preventive medicine practices undoubtedly help to keep people out of hospital, increase the turn-over of the occupancy of hospital beds, and make possible a more rapid return of people to their employment, it is a development which we must accept and, indeed, welcome.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, temper any observations on increased costs in this area of the health services with a realisation of these considerations. That is not to say that I am unconcerned at rising expenditure which, in the years, with which we are dealing, has outstripped what had been regarded as generous estimates.  I am keeping and will keep a close eye on developments.</P>
    <P>Higher expenditure on remuneration requires an additional provision of £200,000&mdash;arising because of shorter working hours and increased remuneration.  Increased allowances payable to disabled persons require a further £250,000.</P>
    <P>The items which I have mentioned account for £850,000 of the £1,200,000 increase, and are the most significant factors involved.  It will be appreciated that in a service of such a wide scope relatively small increases in a large number of headings can add up to a <Col N="1423" /> considerable total.  This accounts for the further £350,000.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be reporting to the House in greater detail on the health services when the Estimate of my Department for the coming year is being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain unreality about the request of the Minister for Health to be paid another £1¼ million in respect of the health services.  What is unreal about it is that the request has been made without any reference at all to the complete failure on the Government's part to honour the proposal which they made in a White Paper published more than two years ago.  The proposal is contained in paragraph 116, page 59, of the White Paper on Health Services, published in January, 1966.  It contained the following words:</P>
      <P>The Government, having studied this issue, are satisfied that the local rates are not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional money on this scale.  They propose, therefore, that the cost of further extensions of the services should not be met in any proportion by the local rates.</P>
      <P>Many of the services for which we have been asked in this Supplementary Estimate to pay, many of the services for which ratepayers are being called on to pay, are services which are set out on page 59 of the White Paper as being improvements and extensions in the health services.</P>
      <P>The Government have failed completely to honour their proposal and this immediately brings into question the work of all undertakings or statements by the Government.  It is most undesirable that in a matter affecting the health and wellbeing of our people the Government should have in such a disreputable manner welched to the extent that they have on the very specific undertakings so clearly and so frequently repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has brought about a situation in which ratepayers and taxpayers, 70 per cent of whom are denied all benefit <Col N="1424" /> under the health services unless they are so ill as to be in hospital, are being called on to pay the better part of £6 million&mdash;or will be so called on in the coming year&mdash;over and above the services which existed at the time the Government published their now in-famous White Paper.  It has brought about that grossly unfair situation and other undesirable effects, one of which is that we now have some regions in the country up to 25 per cent of the dispensary doctors not being given permanent appointments because the Government are dithering on all health matters and are bringing about a situation in which some of the best medical brains and skills in the country are not looking to the public health services for employment because of the uncertainty that exists.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Health Authority area, which caters for more than 25 per cent of our people, we now have a situation in which, out of a total complement of 83 dispensary doctors, 26 are temporary.  Of that 26, 13 are occupants of posts which previously were permanent and the other 13 are occupants of posts which have been established since May, 1965, to meet the growing population and the increasing demands on our health services.</P>
    <P>On 20th May, 1965, the Minister for Health in the present Government issued to all local authorities a circular letter saying that because it had been decided to introduce a choice of doctor into the general medical services, no further permanent appointments should be made.  In that circular letter the Minister stated that it would be possible to arrive at decisions &ldquo;within the next few months&rdquo;.  There is a declaration of the Government that they would arrive at decisions in relation to the health services, in particular to the dispensary service and its staffing, within a few months of May, 1965, yet here we are three years later and the Government have not yet come to the decisions which three years ago they said they were about to make.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of dithering incompetence and breach of undertakings which compelled the Minister to come once again to the Dáil to look for more <Col N="1425" /> money to bolster up health services which are as unfair as they are unsatisfactory and which are grinding slowly but surely to a halt.  Were it not for the devotion to duty of the people who are administering the health services, were it not for their dedication and their contributions which go beyond the call of duty, our health services would collapse altogether.</P>
    <P>In October, 1966, the present administration were obliged to recognise to some extent the harm which they were doing to the health services by the delays which were occurring. They therefore allowed health authorities to appoint dispensary doctors on a quasi-permanent basis without any rights to pension, without any rights to the other emoluments which go with permanent appointments.  This is another indication of the injustices which are being built into the existing health services.  There are several parts of the country where men are being appointed to posts without having the privilege of having such service as they may now give considered in future for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>This is occurring even in areas where it is patently clear that dispensary doctors on a permanent basis will have to be employed in the future as they have been in the past, because if they are not so employed, there will be no medical attention available in those areas.  The situation in urban areas is of course different from that in rural areas.  We in Fine Gael have always accepted that.  There is no justification for continuing any longer the inefficiency and injustices which are occurring under the present system because the Government have failed over a period of three years to give any attention to the obligation which lay upon them to honour undertakings which they solemnly, and presumably carefully, entered into.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we are meeting a tremendous upsurge in the cost of providing drugs and medicines. This, as the Minister pointed out, is something which must be carefully watched but to some extent it could be <Col N="1426" /> beneficial if it results in keeping people out of institutions.  That is the thing which we must aim at in this country, to reduce the institutional element in health costs, because that is the most costly end of it.  It is an extraordinary thing that we in this country are the most hospitalised people in the world.  We have more people per head of the population in hospitals than any other country in the world.  The reason for that is primarily our failure to develop proper health services outside of hospitals.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to enter into a policy matter but I feel it is important that we should reflect on that because that in itself is one of the most significant factors in the very heavy extra bill which we have for health services before us today.  The increase represents some six per cent over what was estimated last year.  This is due to a large extent to increased costs at all levels, as the Minister's introductory statement points out, but if these increased costs have to be borne by the national Exchequer, they have to be borne to an almost similar extent by local authorities.  The contribution which the State is making to health costs at the moment is about 55 per cent of the total cost and the local authorities are left to find the other 45 per cent.  However, this is not a true picture.  It is important at this moment to realise what the true picture is.</P>
    <P>When we quote these figures, we refer only to distinctly medical services and we are not taking into consideration the tremendous contribution which several local authorities are making to new medical services which to date do not qualify for a grant from the Exchequer.  Dublin Health Authority raised this matter recently with the Minister for Health, who, I think, was not unsympathetic to the argument that if health authorities are now paying, as they are, considerable amounts of money to provide a meals-on-wheels service for old folk, to provide domiciliary nursing services and other schemes to keep people out of institutions, they ought to receive at least half of the cost of those schemes from the national Exchequer.  I do not think it <Col N="1427" /> is sufficient answer to say to health authorities that this is not a matter for the Minister for Health, that it is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  These things should not at all be considered as in the nature of public assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that the only reason these schemes are being financed out of public assistance at the moment is that if they were not financed from that source, there is no other source available within existing legislation to finance these schemes. We thank God that these schemes are in operation and we thank also the wonderful lay and religious people who are making these schemes possible, but having expressed that thanks, we must say that if they were not in operation, the health bill would be many times greater than it is and the Minister's Supplementary Estimate today would be for over £2 million and not the £1¼ million he is seeking.  I would therefore like to hear from the Minister whether he has been able to make any progress with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, or his colleagues in the Government, with a view to having these quite clearly medical services paid for by the State.</P>
    <P>I think it is also safe to mention in relation to the increased cost of drugs and medicines that while it reflects undoubtedly new practices in modern medicines and drug therapy, it also reflects a considerable amount of questionable commercial activity by the drug manufacturers who carry out the most intensive advertising campaigns involving the giving of free samples to members of the medical profession and the pushing of drugs and medicines and preparations, some of which are of highly questionable quality.  I know that at the moment there is a committee considering the establishment of some formulary which would be accepted so as to avoid the unnecessary prescribing of highly-priced modern preparations.  I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that some really worthwhile progress will be made in this field in the very near future so as to remove from this very <Col N="1428" /> important part of medical skills this undesirable commercial pressure.</P>
    <P>We do not begrudge the addition of £200,000 in the Estimate in respect of remuneration because we appreciate that a considerable amount of this is due to shorter working hours, particularly for nurses.  Indeed we must be concerned with the fact that many people in our hospital service who are entitled to shorter hours are obliged, because of inadequate staff, to work overtime, sometimes with danger to their own health and welfare and indeed the welfare of patients.  We hope the Minister will take all steps necessary to ensure that shorter working hours which have been given to various grades will in fact be possible of achievement.  This can only be done if we increase our nursing complement.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would ask the Minister seriously to consider providing for married nurses who want to come back into the service pay scales equivalent to what they would get if they had not married at all.  We are entering into an age in which we must recognise the principle of equal pay for equal work, in which men and women must be paid equally, and in which married and unmarried women must be equally paid.  It is invidious to push a system under which a highly skilled and experienced nurse with several qualifications is obliged to work at the rate paid to a young nurse just qualified merely because she is married.</P>
    <P>This, as the Minister knows, in the Dublin region has led to a situation in which some of the Dublin hospitals, particularly local authority hospitals which are curtailed in what they can pay by ministerial direction, are unable to get a sufficient complement of nurses.  One hospital, Cherry Orchard, has a whole unit consisting of 28 beds closed down for no reason other than lack of nursing staff.  This could lead to a very serious situation.  Nobody would be more embarrassed by that matter, if any crisis did arise, than the Minister.  I would urge on him to relax the rules.  They have been relaxed in the educational sphere where it became necessary to provide teachers. <Col N="1429" /> The important consideration must be the provision of adequately trained staff with proper wages.  I would, therefore, urge the Minister to see to it that married nurses who want to come back into the service will be paid at the appropriate rate.  We appreciate that the Minister is concerned to maintain fair rates and reasonable opportunities for unmarried nurses and that they cannot be lightly overlooked but at the same time the needs of our hospitals and the attention of the sick people must take precedence over any other consideration.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters on which I could dwell but this is a Supplementary Estimate and I think the need for this Estimate has been out-lined by me at the outset.  It is primarily the Government's duty to provide proper health services.  I earnestly hope we will not have much longer to wait.  We are not comforted by the assurance the Minister gave earlier this year to the Dublin Health Authority when he said he was carrying out a reappraisal of the health services.  We would have thought that that should have been done long ago.  Goodness knows we had a select committee sitting on the health services in this House for six years and it is almost three years now since the Government took the decision to amend the present health services.  It is not good enough to receive an assurance at the end of those nine years that there is now to be a reappraisal of the health services.  Surely that should have been done long ago.  Let us hope that this is the last year that Dáil Éireann will be asked to make good the default of the Government which has led to this continuing burden on taxpayers and ratepayers, most of whom are as I say deprived of all benefit under the existing health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are compelled, because of the fact that this is a Supplementary Estimate, to direct our attention mainly to the items for which the extra money is being provided and I do not propose to speak at any length on this.  I cannot help but agree with Deputy Ryan that the country is awaiting the implementation of the White Paper that was issued by the Minister <Col N="1430" /> for Health in 1966.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the time is long overdue when we should decide whether the White Paper will be implemented or whether we are going to struggle along as we are.</P>
      <P>Until our health services are put on a contributory basis a proper service will not emerge and we will have this continuing attempt to provide the necessary medical services with inadequate finance.  It must be true that because of the wage increases negotiated by the trade unions over the past two or three years many people who prior to that were in receipt of medical cards have now lost that benefit.  It is true that different health authorities have different scales but you can take at an average that the ninth round of wage increases practically deprived 25 per cent, if not 30 per cent, of the people in receipt of medical cards of benefits. Not only that but when a wage increase is granted the wage-earner is taxed on it, his differential rent is increased and then his medical card is taken away. Administrators of health authorities take no regard of the fact that the increase while apparently £1 may in reality be less than that because of the increases in various taxes which reduce this sum.</P>
      <P>There is one group for which I have always pleaded in discussing health matters and that is the nursing profession. I believe they are regarded as the Cinderella of the medical profession. Their wages are inadequate, their quarters, if they are sleeping in, are usually inadequate and certainly in many local authorities the question of overtime payment to a nurse is not considered.  If they are sent out on ambulance duty towards the end of their time on duty and have to spend two or three hours extra duty in that day, they are simply told that when slackness is there during the following week they will be able to take that time off.  That is not a proper system.  If a person has to work extra hours of duty that person should be paid for it and not be given time off at the convenience of the matron or someone else in charge of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if overtime was paid we would not have the system which <Col N="1431" /> appears to be prevalent in many hospitals of sending a nurse with an ambulance call a half hour before she is due to go off duty when it is known that the call will take a period of two to three hours.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that a system of overtime payment is introduced instead of time off being allowed to nurses for the extra hours they are asked to work over and above the time allocated.  I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that we have no objection to this money being provided.  All we regret, as I said at the start, is that we do not know the future of the health services. When will the White Paper be implemented or will it be implemented at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House, as Deputy Ryan has stated, are in favour of voting this money but, as Deputy Kyne said, the House and the country are entitled to know where we are going at present and when we intend to implement the promises made over the past few years as regards our health services.  Our health services need overhauling.  They need it immediately.  That fact is recognised by the present Minister for Health and was certainly recognised by the late Deputy O'Malley when he was Minister for Health.  He introduced a White Paper some years ago and I should like to quote from page 59 of that White Paper because those of us who are on local authorities today know the impact on our rates due to the health services.</P>
      <P>As members of local authorities, it is our duty as well as our responsibility to provide this money although we have been promised often in the past that the local authorities would be relieved of this responsibility.  Indeed, I remember the time when Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Health, introduced a Health Act.  He informed local authorities&mdash;I happened to be on a deputation at the time&mdash;that the burden falling on local authorities would only be increased between 2/- and a maximum of 2/6d in the £.  We know, of course, that today it is anything from 10/- to 15/- and, indeed, up to 30/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> It might be no harm to quote from the Government's White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development.  On page 59 it says:</P>
    <P>The Government, having studied this issue, are satisfied that the local rates are not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional money on this scale.  They propose, therefore, that the cost of the further extensions of the services should not be met in any proportion by the local rates.  Following this decision, other possible sources of revenue to meet the additional costs are being considered but it seems likely that the general body of central taxation must bear the major part of the burden.  Pending further consideration of the methods by which extensions of the health services will be financed in future years, the Government have decided to make arrangements which will ensure that the total cost of the services falling on local rates in respect of the year 1966-67 will not exceed the cost in respect of the year 1965-66. </P>
    <P>That is a solemn promise made to the Irish people in a White Paper by the Minister for Health in that particular year.  As a matter of fact, he held a press conference shortly after and we were told that the proposed legislation was promised in a very short time. Later in that particular year, a further statement was made on behalf of the Government that the White Paper would be implemented in a very short time.

      <P>In any case, what I want to say is that the Minister for <Col N="1433" /> Health in November promised the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis that the Bill would appear after Christmas.  It is now four months after Christmas and we are wasting the time of this House discussing proportional representation.  It would be much better if we were discussing the White Paper on the Health Services or the Bill the Government intend to introduce to implement the recommendations of that White Paper. Those of us in local authorities, if I am rightly informed, know that this Supplementary Estimate is due to the fact that these local authorities have to meet further demands.  When their demands are increased, they will have to put up 56 per cent or 57 per cent or whatever their proportion may be.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to say that we are not satisfied with the progress made to date.  We have had plans; we have had Acts; we have had White Papers; but certainly we have not achieved the progress we were promised by the late Mr. O'Malley a few years ago.  We all hear&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party especially at times are inclined to quote the words of the Proclamation of 1916&mdash;about cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  I think it can be truthfully stated that today the local bodies are not cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  The ratepayers' and taxpayers' money is being spent and many of us agree that the poor in any county or area, whether it be Westmeath or anywhere else, are entitled to the same attention from our medical and professional people as are the wealthiest people in the State, but unfortunately they are not getting it.</P>
      <P>I regretted the fact that I had to make a statement I made at our meeting last week in Westmeath saying that only 90 per cent of our doctors are doing their work well.  Unfortunately, there are 10 per cent putting out their hands and drawing their salaries who are not prepared to give the poor of the county the services to which they are entitled.  We believe that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man is paid, it is his duty to attend to his patients at night and when he goes into their house, he should not say that a medical card is worth nothing to him, but &ldquo;I want <Col N="1434" /> the pound.&rdquo;  If they are being paid by the State, it is their duty to give their fullest and best attention to those poor people.</P>
    <P>I think it is time we came down to realities.  Promises of pie in the sky are of little use to our people.  Despite the fact that we have had native government now for over 50 years, and last year we had appropriate celebrations, we have to admit that throughout the country today facts disclose a continuation of the inadequate and the degraded type of health services that have been in operation in this country for far too long.  They contain a lot of the stamp of the poor law system in the health services.  We have still no choice of doctor.  We still have the means test operating in its worst and most stringent manner and, indeed, people are compelled to present themselves at dispensaries to get medical treatment, thereby branding themselves as a section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is hardly worth my while rising to speak on this Supplementary Estimate as Question Time is almost at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal matter referred to in the Minister's very short brief is the additional supplement to the Estimate required to assist local authorities in respect of health charges.  The health charges on local authorities are, in my opinion, a contributory factor to the crushing burden of high rates.  In so far as we in public life are concerned, we know that certain positive promises were made that the central authority, <Col N="1435" /> the Minister for Health, would come to the rescue of our local authorities and cushion the burden of this serious impact on our rates, that is, the cost of the health services.</P>
    <P>That has not yet been done and it is a source of great worry and anxiety that our local authorities must carry this crushing burden which we feel should be the responsibility of the central authority, the Department of Health proper.  We would hope on this occasion to see the Minister avail of this opportunity and say what precisely he proposes to do to meet the growing cost of the health charges on our local authorities which they simply cannot afford to meet much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he has <Col N="1437" /> given instructions to veterinary surgeons to stop vaccinating heifer calves with Strain 19 vaccine; and, if so, for what reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite its undoubted protective value, Strain 19, being a live vaccine, has the defect of inducing a persistent reaction to the brucellosis blood test when used in animals over six months of age and consequently there is a danger that vaccinated animals which have not got brucellosis may nevertheless be adjudged to be reactors and slaughtered when the eradication measures are extended.</P>
      <P>The Veterinary Directives of the EEC forbid the use of Strain 19 in officially certified brucellosis free herds within the community.  It is understood that an amendment, at present under consideration by the Council of the Community, would exclude meat from animals which had been vaccinated with Strain 19 from trade within the community.</P>
      <P>The calfhood vaccination scheme, which operated in eleven counties, was suspended in November last, due to the foot and mouth disease emergency. I have decided not to revive it and I am at present considering the introduction, to replace it, of a scheme involving the use of the new killed vaccine on breeding heifers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been some breakdown in communications between the Department and the farmers in regard to this matter?  As the Minister is aware, I was responsible for urging farmers to vaccinate cattle against brucellosis.  That was in the early stages when Strain 19 first became available.  It has now, apparently, become undesirable, in view of the brucellosis eradication scheme, to pursue the original scheme but there seems to be some failure on the part of the Department to communicate clearly to the farmers the reasons for the <Col N="1438" /> change, and I suggest to the Minister that there ought to be&mdash;possibly through this monthly information journal the Department issues and which is copied into the provincial press&mdash;some more detailed explanation of the reason why it is desirable not to vaccinate with Strain 19.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister further aware that some farmers, due to the advice given by veterinary surgeons, injected cows in calf with Strain 19?  The cows aborted and the farmers concerned lost both the cows and the calves.  Is there any way of compensating these people?  I know one farmer in Westmeath who has been completely wiped out.  He refused to sell his herd in the open market and had to sell what remained to a beef factory at half price rather than contaminate the whole country by selling cows with brucellosis on the open market.  He lost six or seven of them due to the fact that he was advised when the heifers were in calf to vaccinate with Strain 19. Is there any form of compensation in such case?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the opportunity to serve overseas is most sought after by most of our Army personnel and that there is deep resentment about the rigid application of the regulation debarring men over 40?  Does the Minister not also consider that, in adhering rigidly to this stipulation that men over 40 may not be considered, he is depriving the Army of the services of our most dedicated and experienced men, especially when one considers overseas service which can endanger our troops and involve them in a theatre of war? In all the circumstances will the Minister give the House an indication that he will not apply this age limit rigidly and that men who want to serve overseas will be permitted to do so?  Otherwise, it is having a demoralising effect on Army personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my financial statement to Dáil Éireann on the 1967 Budget, I promised to consider how the State's aid to the Arts could be improved.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon has been responsible for this work in recent years and they have been successful to a degree out of all proportion to the funds at their disposal.  It is clear, however, that the range of their functions, in attempting to cater for all the different arts, is too wide in the light of many different pressures for priority for different sectors. A careful study of the problem has convinced me that the most effective arrangement is to introduce a Bill to replace the existing Comhairle Ealaíon with three new councils as follows: one for the visual Arts; a <Col N="1447" /> second for drama and literature; and a third for music, opera and ballet.</P>
      <P>Each council will have the responsibility of stimulating public interest in, improving standards and promoting the appreciation and practice of, its own particular group of arts.  I hope to persuade persons of known qualifications and interest in the various artistic fields as well as the existing members of An Chomhairle Ealaíon to act as members of the new councils and I intend to make reasonably adequate funds available to ensure that their work will be effective.</P>

    <P>A grant of up to the full cost of building and up to half the cost of machinery is available.  Alternatively, factories, warehouses or office accommodation can be rented at economic or subsidised rents with the option to purchase, or sites can be provided on which a company may construct its own building.  There is total exemption from income tax and corporation <Col N="1451" /> profits tax arising from exports, up to 1983.  Grants are available for the training of workers.</P>
    <P>Co. Kerry and those parts of Co. Limerick which are scheduled as undeveloped:</P>
    <P>Grants are available of up to two-thirds of the total costs of factory sites, site development, factory buildings and machinery, plant and equipment. The local authority is empowered to grant two-thirds remission of rates for ten years on premises provided by means of a grant by An Foras Tionscal.  Profits arising from exports are exempted from income tax and corporation profits tax for ten years, up to 1979-80.</P>
    <P>Co. Limerick (outside the undeveloped areas):</P>
    <P>A grant of up to one-half of the total amount of the costs of factory sites, site development, factory buildings and machinery, plant and equipment is available, but, where An Foras Tionscal are of the opinion that there are sound economic reasons why the undertaking cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas and other exceptional circumstances exist, a grant of up to two-thirds of the total amount of such costs can be made.  Profits arising from exports are exempted from income tax and corporation profits tax for ten years, up to 1979-80.</P>
    <P>Facilities available in all three areas:</P>
    <P>The training grants available for industries located in Shannon are also available in Co. Limerick and Co. Kerry.  Where a grant is made towards the cost of providing buildings, or machinery and equipment, An Foras Tionscal may make a grant towards the capital cost of the provision of electricity by the Electricity Supply Board.  Any such grant made may not exceed one-half of the capital cost payable to the ESB.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="1461" /> to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.  As I stated in reply to a previous Parliamentary Question on the 29th February last, the question of the refusal of the British authorities to register Irish nurses who were trained in hospitals having a bed complement of less than 300 is the subject of correspondence between An Bord Altranais and the General Nursing Council for England and Wales at the moment. I propose to await the consideration by An Bord Altranais of the outcome of this correspondence.</P>
      <P>At present in this country there are 64 training schools for nurses and mid-wives, 33 of which have a total bed complement of more than 300.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his short statement, made some reference to the matter.  The main bulk of his remarks related to the steep increase in the cost of drugs and medicines which has gone up by 14 per cent in recent times and this represents <Col N="1465" /> approximately 18 per cent over last year.  I am very pleased to see the Minister's comment on the reasons for this increase.  He rightly concludes that the increased usage of drugs is a feature of modern medicine &ldquo;and since drug therapy and allied preventive medicine practices undoubtedly helped to keep people out of hospital, increased the turnover of the occupancy of hospital beds and made possible a more rapid return of people to their employment, it is a development which we must accept and indeed welcome.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on to speak of the concern at the rising cost.  We all share his concern in that regard but I think we have had too much harping of late on the increased cost of drugs and medicines.  We would all welcome an intervention by which this expenditure could be reduced but many of us in public life feel that excessive profits are being made on drugs and medicines and that health authorities and county councils are being exploited.  We seem to be helpless in trying to resolve the difficulties and I should like to hear the Minister suggest how we can more effectively cope with this problem. Laymen, at any rate, feel that much of this extra cost is wholly unjustified and constitutes unbridled profiteering and very largely exploitation of the sick poor.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned that health authorities may be inclined to carry out certain economies in respect of drugs and medicines and to restrict the allocation of them or they may feel inclined to substitute cheaper drugs for the more sophisticated and dearer types which we know doctors are obliged to recommend in these times. That would be deplorable; it would be a retrograde step if anybody concerned with the administration of medicine were to economise in this way by the application of an aspro where possibly penicillin or some other more costly drug was required.  The Minister must have due regard to this danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party particularly welcome the Minister's honest and matter-of-fact appraisal of the situation that drug therapy is such an integral part of modern medicine on which our <Col N="1466" /> people are relying more and more. Otherwise, we would have our hospitals cluttered up with patients and would lose countless thousands of man-days of employment.  We must not shirk the cost involved.</P>
    <P>The adverse comment on the increasing cost of drugs and medicines may persuade health authorities to be more restrictive in respect of granting free drugs and medicines, a service which is much availed of, to persons whom, although they may not have a medical card and may not be regarded as in the lower income group, find it too great a burden to provide costly drugs and medicines for a sick friend or relative in the home over a long period.  They would be entitled to free drugs and medicines and many thousands of such families are availing of this service from health authorities.  It is a much availed of service and it does all the good work which the Minister acknowledges in his brief here.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, but I feel it is true to say, that these comments in respect of the overall cost of the health services on the rates, and particularly the cost of free drugs and medicines, will be a dissuading factor from the health authority point of view and will cause the number of people who will get free drugs and medicine in the future to be restricted.  We have a feeling that the means tests in respect of the granting of free drugs and medicines is becoming more rigid of late because people are being actuated by the cost factor and not the need factor.</P>
    <P>As far as we in the Labour benches are concerned, the need is the important thing, the need of the health services, the need of a medical card, the need of drugs or medicines, the need of specialist services, hospitalisation, dentures and other such services.  It is the need of these things that count.  That is the criterion which should be applied and not the cost; if we go on the cost, we will negative all the work which is being done in our health services.</P>
    <P>It has been the subject of comment in certain areas that proper control is not maintained over our stocks of medicines and drugs in our dispensaries and repositories in the bigger health <Col N="1467" /> centres.  I do not want to go into this matter now.  I will probably go into it in greater detail on the Minister's main Estimate, because I happen to be a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and this has been a subject of comment there, not so much the cost of the drugs and medicines as the alleged loose manner in which drugs and medicines are allowed to be stock-piled in certain repositories and dispensaries without adequate checks being made.  This is a matter to which the Minister and his Department might direct their energies and apply their minds.</P>
    <P>I am limited in the remarks I may make on the Supplementary Estimate, but other Members have referred to this, and I should like to say that we must aspire in this House to the speedy implementation of what is contained in the White Paper on the Health Services which was issued about two years ago by the Minister's late lamented predecessor, Donogh O'Malley.</P>

      <P>This debate, in fact, did range over a number of matters which are not strictly relevant to the Supplementary <Col N="1469" /> Estimate; in particular, I have in mind Deputy Ryan, in his reference to certain undertakings given in 1966. In so far as he was relevant, he dealt with the paragraph in the White Paper where an undertaking was given by the Government in regard to rates, and he quoted from the White Paper the paragraph which dealt with the decision of the Government at the time.  This decision was to the effect that the rates would not bear any portion of the 1966-67 increase and that for the future the cost of extensions of the health services and any new services provided would also be met by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Last year I dealt with this matter in replying to the main Estimate.  I think it no harm to reiterate what I said to Deputy Ryan and to those who accompanied him on behalf of Dublin Health Authority when we discussed the situation in regard to 1968-69.  I then made it clear to the representatives of that deputation that even if the Government had given an undertaking in 1966 that the rates would never again bear any increased cost, it would have had to go back on that undertaking because this would lead to the situation where even the Minister for Finance ultimately had absolutely no control over the expenditure of the health authorities.  In point of fact, this undertaking was not given except in regard to 1966-67 but even so I said then that I was, and I repeat now that I am, concerned with the extent of the burden on the rates of the cost of health services and I gave an undertaking that during this year the Government would reconsider the whole question of the structure of financing health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan seemed to think that this undertaking could be discharged forthwith.  I do not think this is reasonable. I would not expect that deliberations on this, in which several other Departments are concerned, the Departments of Local Government and Finance, to name but two, would be completed in less than another two months or so, and the consequential changes that will have to be brought in after the Government have taken <Col N="1470" /> decisions in principle will obviously take some time as well.  One way or another, I would sincerely hope that this will be the last year in which the present system of financing the health services will operate.  Not merely do I appreciate that the health element in the rates is heavy but I feel also that it is not as heavy as the propaganda in relation to the increases would lead the public to believe.  I have my own ideas as to what the new method of financing the services should be but I do not think it would be appropriate for me to mention them because that would be only my own personal view and would not have the endorsement of the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Treacy's concern about the application of the means test, I do not think that there is any foundation for his fears in that regard. Certainly there is no foundation for the fear that health authorities restrict themselves in any way in regard to the ordering of drugs.  These drugs are ordered by the doctors who operate the health services and there is absolutely no evidence whatever that doctors skip in regard to the drugs they order.  If anything, they probably order too liberally, leading to a lack of control and the waste which Deputy Treacy mentioned.  That is the reality and, in any case people, the sick poor in particular, all of whom have medical cards, are not being in any way restricted.  As the House knows, the proportion of people with medical cards has steadily increased, not very substantially but at the same time it has increased so that this, again, would indicate that the means test is not being rigidly applied. My own experience is that the health authorities vary considerably in regard to the application of the means test. Some of them I have regarded as being unduly restrictive and others, the vast majority of them, are very fair.  In any event, there is the hardship clause which can be used for the benefit of those people in the middle income group who, it is considered, are being asked to pay too much.  I have given every encouragement to health authorities to operate this hardship clause liberally and with the greatest possible humanity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>Could I ask the Minister to elaborate on what he calls the hardship clause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, this is the clause which allows a health authority, where a middle-income group of patients are concerned, to pay the whole or any part of the cost of a patient's drugs or medicines and, indeed, also allows the health authority, if they consider it desirable, to pay the 10/- a day charge or reduce it to 7/6, 5/- or 2/6.  As I say, I have encouraged health authorities to operate this clause with humanity so that where a person has had a long illness, is in the middle-income group and is not in the voluntary health insurance scheme, that having paid what the authority considers a reasonable amount, paid what could reasonably be expected on his income, the health authority will pay the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>And in regard to hospitalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Also in respect of hospitalisation.  They can reduce the 10/- a day charge or remit it or they can remove it.  Where the lower income groups are concerned, I think that far from it being the sick poor who are likely to suffer it is the opposite, because the sick poor have medical cards and the doctors order drugs which I am satisfied they think best, but people not in the medical card category from time to time may get drugs which are, perhaps, less effective than they would like.  Deputy Ryan said he got the impression that the 42½-hour week or 85-hour fortnight for nurses had not been implemented everywhere.  I want to make it clear that I have encouraged all health authorities to apply the spirit as well as the letter of this change in regard to the 85-hour fortnight and I have actively encouraged them to get the number of nurses considered necessary and to do so without delay.  In general, this process has gone on virtually to completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Kyne who mentioned the situation in regard to overtime.  He stressed the desirability of giving nurses overtime instead of <Col N="1472" /> time off.  This is something on which I should not like to pontificate.  The system of giving time off instead of overtime is one which in many cases may suit the nurses concerned.  Usually it is a matter of arrangement between the health authority, the hospital and the nurses.  Normally, every hospital is staffed on a level above average demands. In other words, I have no terribly fixed ideas about this matter.  I would see no objection to paying nurses overtime if this were the local arrangement.  I would also see no objection to giving time off, if that suited.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I do not agree with Deputy L'Estrange that the means test is operating at its worst; Deputy L'Estrange, of course, is given to hyperbole.  The means test is not operating at its worst.  The Deputy also said he would like to warn doctors in the dispensary medical service against charging medical card holders.  I dealt with this matter before.  I can only say now that I have little evidence that this is happening and no evidence that it is happening on any substantial scale. Of course, I absolutely agree with Deputy L'Estrange that doctors in the dispensary medical service, who are paid to give, and are obliged to give, service to medical card holders free of charge, should not, under any circumstances, contravene the rules in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan talked about married women being employed.  Any time there have been applications from health authorities, such as Dublin and, more recently, my own County Mayo, for the employment of married nurses because of shortage locally, I have acceded to the request that they be paid other than the minimum salary.  It will, I presume, always be the policy to give preference to unmarried nurses. It is right, I think, that that should be the policy, but I confess I personally look forward to the day when, if married women, or any women, for that matter, are employed in any occupation for which they are qualified. they will be paid in accordance with their experience.  This is something towards which we should, indeed, rapidly and progressively move.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> I should point out that the Exchequer is paying this year £2.2 million more than the 50 per cent which the Act obliges the Central Fund to bear.  Last year the figure was £1.9 million, giving an overall contribution by the Exchequer last year and this year of between 55 and 56 per cent.  The fact that the total contribution this year will be in the order of £21 or £22 million gives the lie to Deputy Ryan's suggestion that the Government are welshing on the undertakings they gave in the White Paper in 1966.</P>
    <P>The White Paper began by pointing out the complexity of the proposals and stated that the expenditure on developments could not be undertaken in existing financial circumstances and stated clearly that, in publishing their plans for the future development of the health services at that point, the Government's object was to promote planning in the expectation that, when this planning and preparatory work had been carried out, financial circumstances would be such that the changes could then be made without strain on the economy.  In point of fact, in the last three years expenditure on health services has increased by about £6 million, perhaps more.  In the last six <Col N="1474" /> years, or so, the overall cost of the health services has almost doubled from £21 million to £40 million.  The fact that it is necessary to bring in this Supplementary Estimate today in order to give more money to local authorities is proof that the Government, far from failing to implement the promises in the White Paper, have steadily and progressively done so.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking the Members of the House for their contributions to the debate and I express the hope that by this time next year we will no longer be discussing the impact of increased health charges on the rates.  That is my earnest hope.</P>
