      <P>While suggestions have been made from time to time to exchange diplomatic missions with Eastern European countries, the position remains as indicated in my reply to a Dáil Question by Deputy Gallagher on 22nd February.</P>
      <P>We have, of course, contact with the Governments of those countries through our Missions in capitals where both are represented.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the recent statement by the secretary of the Irish Exporters Association that the Irish Sea is the dearest stretch of water in the world for many exporters of small cargo, he will state the freight charges per ton on the Irish Sea and for comparable distances between the United Kingdom and continental Europe; if he will meet the industrialists concerned; and if he has any plans to remove this obstacle to increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised as an inevitable feature of transport generally that charges for small lots are relatively higher than those for large consignments.  On the more general question, I have no evidence to support the view that the level of freight charges on the cross-Channel routes is excessive.  On the contrary, the information which I do have goes to show that, with the prevailing intensive competition and the rapid adoption of the most up-to-date methods of carrying and handling, rates for industrial goods have fallen.  For instance, the B &amp; I Company's average freight earned per ton has fallen by about 20 per cent since 1960.  Such a reduction in a period when costs and charges have been increasing is quite remarkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cross-Channel freight charges are now determined solely by competition and by negotiation between the parties concerned and charges vary with the nature of the commodity, the volume and regularity of traffic offered, the <Col N="201" /> mode of transport used and the extent of the fringe services provided.  A similar position obtains between Britain and Continental Europe.  In these circumstances no valid comparisons on the lines sought by the Deputy are practicable, nor do I accept the sweeping generalisation that &ldquo;the Irish Sea is the dearest stretch of water in the world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards complaints by industrialists about freight charges, I must draw the Deputy's attention to the existence of the National Shippers Committee which, following a recommendation by the tribunal of inquiry into cross-Channel freight rates, was formed in May, 1960, at my instigation. The Committee's terms of reference include the examination of problems connected with freight rates. Industrialists are represented on the Committee through their associations and the Committee would seem to provide a suitable channel for examining complaints of the type mentioned by the Deputy and, if necessary, discussing them with the shipping companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The present fleet of Aerlínte comprises four Boeing 707 aircraft and two Boeing 720 aircraft. The company has acquired two further Boeing 707 aircraft for delivery in the early part of 1969 and is at present negotiating for the sale of the two Boeing 720 aircraft.  The company's forward fleet plans do not envisage a replacement of the Boeing 707 aircraft for a substantial period but its fleet will be supplemented by the delivery of two Boeing 747 aircraft in early 1971.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the statement in the recent Industrial Development Authority report on industrial grants that 30 per cent of the industrialists surveyed were dissatisfied <Col N="202" /> with internal transport services in this country, he will meet the industrialists concerned and ensure that this obstacle to providing employment will be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quoting from paragraph four point eight (4.8) of the Report but the statement he quotes must be read together with the remaining parts of paragraph four and also part twenty-one of paragraph six which summarises the view of the survey team as follows:</P>
      <P>Many managements complained about transport costs but produced little evidence that such costs represented a significant element in total unit costs.  There seemed to be considerable scope for action on the part of managements themselves to minimise their transport costs (paragraphs 4.8 to 4.13).  Having regard to the general trend towards free trade conditions, the present restrictions on the use of private transport might merit re-examination in so far as they affect manufacturing industries, particularly export industries.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have since eased in various ways the restrictions on licensed transport and I have constituted a working group to examine in greater depth the case for further liberalisation.  I should however point out that the CSO Survey of 1964 indicated that approximately 83 per cent of all road freight transport is performed in own account vehicles and that only 17 per cent is handled by licensed hauliers and CIE road transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of <Col N="204" /> the potential of the area for tourist development and the fact that the West Wicklow report noted a scarcity of hotel, guesthouse and farmhouse accommodation in the area, he will apply the grants normally reserved for the western counties to West Wicklow and thus increase incomes in the area which are at present well below the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The grants available for tourist development in the western counties take account of the remoteness of these areas from our main tourist market.  These considerations do not apply in the case of West Wicklow; neither are the problems of this area of the same order of magnitude as those of the western counties.  In the circumstances I cannot agree to the suggestion contained in the question.  I understand, however, that the Minister for Finance, in recognition of the problems of West Wicklow, has assisted in the appointment of a development officer for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 15th May, 1968, the Government, in their review of the rural electrification scheme, were concerned to arrange that, within practical limits, electricity is available at a reasonable charge to all those desiring to take it.  To this end, as I then indicated, substantial reductions are being made in the high special service charges hitherto payable by some of the ESB's consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated in reply to a question on 20th February, 1968, that the ESB planned to start the recanvass of their Tuosist rural area, in which the <Col N="205" /> parishes of Tuosist and Lauragh are situated, in October next.  However, the Board have now informed me that, because of the improved terms being offered, there has been an increase in the number of acceptances in areas at present being recanvassed and consequently it will not be possible to start the recanvass of the Tuosist area before early next year.  Applicants who accept the terms quoted and have their houses wired would then be given supply during the following autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the calculations in the Study was to show the farm-retail price spread for fat heifers and store bullocks in the period 1963-1965.  The percentages stated in the Deputy's question do not represent a correct interpretation of the figures in the Study as they appear to be calculated on prices for fat heifers only for two particular months out of those given in the Study and, even for these months, the correct interpretation of the figures shows an increase in the farm-retail price spread not of 62½ per cent but of 20.3 per cent, from 36 per cent at the beginning to 43.3 per cent at the end of a selected two-year period.  The relationship of the figures, like the prices themselves, varies from one month to another and, for example, taking the figures for store bullocks only for two other particular months, the farm-retail price spread actually declined by 4.7 per cent between the beginning and end of a selected two-year period.</P>

Would the Minister mind looking into this to see if there is any reason, other than competition, why this should be so because there are large numbers of people quite perturbed about the fact; they took the Minister's advice, eradicated the warbles and are now getting half the price for hides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Minister that the price of hides has dropped to half and have asked him to say if there is any other reason besides competition as to why that is so.  The people have been disappointed, having gone to the trouble, that this is the result.  I know only too well that this was a worthwhile scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that that is the view.  In so far as the price of hides is concerned, as I have already said in reply to the question, it is entirely ruled by the prices for hides on other markets.  Up to May, 1966, the price of hides continued to rise to a very high level indeed.  Since then, the price has been dropping and is at a low level at the moment but, again, is related to and reflected in the price obtaining on international markets.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that the year before last we imported £23 million of cereals that could and should have been grown in this country if a proper incentive were given to the people to grow them?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A public inquiry was held in December last into this matter and the making of a restrictive bye-law is under consideration in the light of the information furnished at the inquiry about angling lures and methods of fishing on this river.  The enforcement of any such bye-law would be a matter for the Galway Board of Fishery Conservators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in my reply, the making of the restrictive bye-law is still under consideration. One of the reasons for the delay, apparently, in this is in defining the actual territory or area to which the law was to apply.  It was somewhat difficult to determine.  Certain people had to try to define this in a concise and technical way.  This has been the main cause of the hold-up, of late, in any case.  I will push along with the matter.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy's question relates to the recommendations of the survey teams which reported to me on fish landing places on the coasts of Counties Kerry and Mayo.  Improvements at 36 small landing places were recommended by the teams.  The recommended works <Col N="214" /> have been completed at one place and are in progress at nine others.  The county councils are undertaking the works at six places and should commence them shortly, assisted by State grants.  In the remaining 20 recommendations, eight are being examined by Roinn na Gaeltachta and 12 by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the statement in the recent Industrial Development Authority report on industrial grants that almost a quarter of the new industries surveyed were dissatisfied with inadequate sanitary services for their factories, he will now meet the industrialists concerned and ensure that this obstacle to providing employment will not arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that the report referred to by the Deputy stressed that it had not been found possible to investigate, in order to establish their validity, any of the complaints made by factory managements in regard to the inadequacy of the sanitary or other services available at their factories.  Local authorities generally are only too anxious to do everything in their power to facilitate the development of their areas and in particular to encourage industries to be set up and expand in them.  Major water and sewerage works, however, take time to plan and implement and reasonable forward notice must be given to the local authorities of industrial requirements if services are to be provided as needed.</P>
      <P>My Department has now got information from the Industrial Development Authority in relation to a number of the firms who claim to have in adequate services.  I propose to ask the local authorities concerned to examine the position with a view to seeing to what extent they can provide the services required.  I may say, however, that a number of the complaints are from areas where the local authorities have already schemes in progress or in planning to augment and improve sanitary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> At a recent discussion between officers of my Department and of local authorities the desirability of establishing adequate liaison between the local authority and local industrialists was emphasised and it was recommended that local authorities should find out from industrialists in their area details of their future requirements in terms of local authority services, including sanitary services, so that account can be taken of these requirements in forward planning programmes.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of section 16 of the Housing Act, 1966, the increased scale of grant can only be paid in respect of a house provided in a rural area.  Rural area is defined in section 2 of the same Act as an area no place in which is within a county borough, borough, urban district, town or non-municipal town.  Non-municipal town is defined in the same section as a place, not being a county borough, borough, urban district or town, the population of which, as ascertained by the census of population which for the time being is the last published census of population, exceeds one thousand.</P>

According to the Census, 51 per cent of the 676,402 dwellings then existing had piped water inside the dwellings and 33.2 per cent had the use of a fixed bath.  Almost all of the 65,000 dwellings built since then are fully serviced.  In addition, grants have been paid for the installation of piped water in a further 33,000 dwellings.

For this reason every effort has been made in recent years to create a greater public awareness of the problem facing the country in this regard. In the year 1967 there was more intensive promotion of road safety than ever before and I am satisfied that in so far as official action is concerned the maximum is being done, having regard to the resources available.  But I would stress that, no matter how intensive official campaigns may be, the greatest contribution to road safety can still be made through the realisation by individual members of the public of their responsibilities while using the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some tenants on the Proby estate whose leases expired in recent years without statutory rights of renewal entered into new agreements with the landlord.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission, while recommending that rights of renewal should be granted to tenants on the estate in question, including tenants whose leases had recently expired, specifically excluded from its recommendation any tenant who had made an arrangement with the landlord for the granting of a new lease or for the purchase of the landlord's interest.  When recommending this exclusion, the Commission was aware that there were, in fact, cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to recommend to the Government that, as suggested by the Deputy, tenants who have already entered into agreements should also be covered by the legislation and refunded any payments made.  Such a departure from the Commission's recommendations would, in my opinion, be an undue interference with existing contracts <Col N="224" /> and be open to serious objection in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, whatever may apply in respect of cases that have been completed before the matter was considered by the Commission, the landlord here used the threat of eviction in order to secure settlement with a number of these tenants?  There is no doubt that this action was what could only be regarded as in breach of the question being considered by the Commission at the particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have some sympathy with these couple of tenants who missed the bus for the reasons stated, there will always be some people who will find themselves legally in this position.  I would refer the Deputy to recommendation No. 62 in the Report of the Landlord and Tenant Commission, which I am sure will be accepted by all of us as completely independent.  Here is what they said:</P>
      <P>If the suggestion in paragraph 60 above is accepted, regarding an extension to cover the case discussed of the rights to a reversionary lease, the amending legislation should contain a similar provision.  Any such section should give rights only to a lessee holding on under the expired lease without having made any arrangement with his landlord for the granting of a new lease, or for the purchase of the landlord's interest, or otherwise.</P>
      <P>These men went before this Commission. The Commission heard their evidence and were aware of their position. The Deputy will appreciate that, as I understand it, these men did purchase the fee simple&mdash;at least one of these men had contracted to purchase the fee simple.  I have grave doubts whether what the Deputy is seeking is constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some of these cases&mdash;certainly in a few of them&mdash;the landlord took ejectment proceedings while the Commission was sitting which in any other circumstances&mdash;if there were court proceedings&mdash;would be regarded as contempt <Col N="225" /> of court?  This action was designed to stampede tenants who were not in a position to resist the claim legally but who nevertheless had the justice of their case recognised by the recommendation of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says there were definite proceedings in these few cases excluded by the Commission, I will accept what he says.  I do not know in how many cases from this estate there were proceedings but the fact remains that the Commission brought in under the recommendation some 100 of these tenants and specifically excluded those who, for whatever reason, whether partly under threat or not, did purchase the fee simple.  As far as my information goes, they made no bad deal in purchasing the fee simple as the property would be worth at least double what they paid for it.  At all events, they did purchase and this independent Commission specifically excluded them for this purpose.  That is in keeping with all landlord and tenant legislation which has passed through this House so far as I am aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was treated for gastric influenza at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, Galway, because this was the illness diagnosed by the Army medical officer who examined him on 6th and 7th December, 1966. Following the examination on the latter date the medical officer arranged to have the patient conveyed by ambulance to the military hospital.  Athlone. This was done because of the nature of the illness as diagnosed and because it is the policy of the Army medical authorities to avoid as far as possible undertaking treatment in a barracks of any condition which is likely to keep a patient in bed for more than two or three days.  This policy arises from the practical difficulties of feeding, nursing, maintaining a comfortable temperature, etc., in an Army billet.</P>
      <P>While the patient had no symptoms of appendicitis when examined by the medical officer at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa the medical officer who examined him after he had arrived in Athlone found that symptoms had by then developed which suggested that he might be suffering from appendicitis.  The latter officer, accordingly, arranged for the transfer of the patient to St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin, for operation if considered necessary by the authorities of that hospital.</P>
      <P>The patient was examined within minutes of admission to St. Bricin's Hospital by the emergency medical officer on duty who immediately summoned the assistant surgeon.  These two doctors diagnosed acute appendicitis and arranged for urgent operation.</P>
      <P>All aspects of the matter were fully investigated and it was established that the person in question received appropriate treatment at all stages and that there was no neglect on the part of any of the medical officers concerned.</P>

      <P>The Tuam processing plant is adequate to cope with Erin Foods' present requirements of potatoes and the company does not envisage that it will have need for another factory in the foreseeable future.  If an extension in production facilities is required at a future date, the supply position existing in County Louth will be a relevant factor in deciding the location of new plant.</P>
      <P>If the establishment of a potato processing plant in County Louth were to be undertaken by a body other than Erin Foods Ltd., detailed proposals in regard to any such plant would need to be studied before a decision on State assistance could be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in view of the complaints by 40 per cent of the firms mentioned in the Industrial Development Authority survey about customs clearance delays he will meet the industrialists concerned and take immediate action to remove this obstacle to increased employment bearing in mind that an earlier report brought this matter to his attention in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey team emphasised that it was not possible to investigate the various complaints made by managements in order to establish their validity.  They also said that the vast majority of the firms involved indicated that most of the problems encountered by them were characteristic of new industries establishing anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken in recent years to facilitate the free flow of trade and the inter-departmental working group which reported in 1965 on the question of accelerating the movement of cargo <Col N="238" /> through sea and air ports found that only a relatively small proportion of delays could be directly attributed to customs clearance procedures and that most delays occurred before the goods were presented to customs for clearance, and, to a lesser extent, after clearance.</P>
    <P>I am of course prepared to meet any of the interests concerned to discuss how matters can be further improved.</P>

An offer of a further discussion, with the proviso that no further increase would be offered, was made by the Office of Public Works, but since then nothing has been heard of that.

      <P>On the last occasion I had dealt with a number of points raised <Col N="250" /> on this stage of the Bill, and at the insistent request of Fine Gael Deputies, and Deputy Dillon in particular, I was going on to deal with the question as to why it was that PR was included in the 1937 Constitution.  Apparently it is one of the main planks in the Opposition's programme to oppose these proposed constitutional reforms that this was included in the new Constitution in 1937.  I have already pointed out to the Opposition that what was being done in 1937 was of great national importance.  The enactment by the people of the new Constitution was the culminating point of the first phase of the existence of the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>
      <P>Apparently it is necessary to remind the Opposition once again that Fianna Fáil was set up specifically to get rid of the degrading Irish Free State which was established here by force by the Party we replaced as the Government in 1932.</P>

      <P>Whether we have or not, I am dealing with the specific point now that the opportunity was not taken at that time to ask the people to make this electoral reform. I want to remind Deputies of exactly what we were doing in asking the people to enact that new Constitution. All the other limitations on our sovereignty had been removed one by one and, with the replacement of the foreign imposed Constitution, there was only one thing left of this kind to be achieved.  Admittedly that was the most difficult thing; to regain the part of our national territory which was signed away in an act of unparalleled treachery by the present Opposition Party.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the Constitution in itself was of fundamental national importance.  I am sure many Deputies will remember the fierce opposition there was at that time from both sections of the present Opposition to the enactment by the people of that new Constitution.  They will remember the grim determination there was at that time to hang on to the status of a British dominion.  The Fine Gael Party were not satisfied to oppose it by misrepresentation and by their normal political activities.  They actually started a Fascist movement here in an effort to defeat it and to defeat the whole system of democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was another time&mdash;and I know it is another sore point with Deputies opposite.  In those circumstances, when there was such an important national objective to be accomplished and when the Opposition was so fierce and so unscrupulous, it obviously would have been foolish in the extreme to jeopardise the attainment of the national objective of getting rid of British domination in this country&mdash;which was accepted as an ultimate settlement in 1922&mdash;by asking the people to make this electoral reform at the same time.  Despite the fact that, at that time, this was official Fine Gael policy, we know that, so great was their attachment to the British connection, the mere dealing with the electoral system in accordance with their wishes at that time would not have been sufficient to lessen in any way their opposition to the replacement of the Irish Free State Constitution by the Constitution of 1937.  This was, as Deputies opposite will remember, described as the final act of breaking the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Clearly, then, the enactment of the Constitution in 1937 was a case of doing first things first.  Since then, the evils of the present electoral system that we have here have gradually become more and more apparent.  We have seen what has resulted from similar systems in many parts of Europe and our people here have also had two experiences of what results from a Coalition Government.  Luckily, they were two short experiences because the people were lucky to have had a solid and united Fianna Fáil Party to fall back on.</P>

      <P>Another point which is in some way, possibly, related to what has been raised here is the question of the situation in the north-eastern part of this country which, again, of course, is in existence because of the connivance of the Opposition Party with the British in its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been maintained here that the electoral system we propose enabled the Government in the north-eastern part of this country to entrench themselves in their present position.  In actual fact, the system we have here was in existence up there up to 1929.  Prior to 1929, under the present system of multi-member constituencies with the transferable vote, the position was that there were 37 Government members as against 15 non-Government members.  But, in the first election fought there under the present system, that position was changed to 35 Unionist members as against 17&mdash;so in actual fact the change in the electoral system there, so far from having the effect Deputies opposite said it had, had something of the reverse effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the situation in that part of the country is completely different from what it is here.  The boundary of the area was, with the co-operation of the Party opposite, skilfully drawn to ensure that it would be possible for the majority there to arrange, under any electoral system, for their perpetuation in power.  The situation is completely different there, where the majority and the minority consist respectively of those who want to maintain the British connection and those who are anxious for independence and to be united with the rest of their own country&mdash;and, of course, the main Opposition Party here are <Col N="254" /> deeply implicated in the establishment of that position.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange devoted a large part of his speech on this stage of the Bill to the subject matter of Partition generally.  I do not think I should co-operate with him in going any further into it beyond saying that the Opposition Party are very deeply implicated in the establishment of that position here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne had some sarcastic remarks to make about what he describes as &ldquo;strong government&rdquo;&mdash; apparently wanting to imply that somebody from these benches has advocated government of this type.  As reported at column 1797 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann of 26th June, 1968, Deputy Dunne said:</P>
    <P>Who says the first essential is strong government?  The vested interest says it first: the person who is a bit fearful that the social system may so change as to alter his status in society: He is the first to look for strong government.</P>
    <P>Further down in his speech, Deputy Dunne is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The bulk of the Irish people are people of little or no property.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne knows well that nobody &mdash;certainly on this side of the House&mdash; has advocated the type of government he describes.  Nobody here is in any way interested in strong government in that sense.  However, we do very definitely suggest to the people that they need a coherent and responsible Government.  They need a Government with a consistent policy, a Government they can decide upon at election time and whom they can hold responsible for the manner in which they conduct the affairs of the country after the election.  If the system is such as to prevent them from choosing their actual Government at election time&mdash;I think it is admitted the present system is designed to do just that&mdash;and if, instead of being able to choose a Government at election time, they get, instead, a Government of individuals or of small groups in which, in the immortal words of the vice-Chairman of the Labour Party, each member of <Col N="255" /> the Government will be watching for the opportunity to spring a trap on his colleagues, then, if that situation develops, it will, we say to the people, prove as disastrous as it did before. The point is that, once that situation develops of elections producing a large number of small groups, it will be too late for the people to do anything about it: it will be too late to make any change.</P>
    <P>We do not advocate strong government of the type Deputy Dunne describes but we do say that wise guidance is necessary to preserve and to improve the position of the people &mdash;and it is the people whom he describes as people of no property who feel most keenly and most immediately the effects of ineffective and inconsistent government based on day-to-day expediency and on the ebb and flow of Coalition manoeuvring.  For example, in 1956-57 the first to be hit by the collapse of the economy were the workers, the building workers in the first instance, and then it spread right through the economy to every type of employment.  We have no hesitation in saying to the people, in particular to the people of no property, as Deputy Dunne described them, that it is essential for them to have responsible and consistent government which they can hold responsible and which they can replace in the next election if they see fit.  The present system prevents that and the Opposition speeches have been, in fact, a tacit admission that even though the worst splintering effects of the system have not been felt here still the situation is that the only alternative to the present Government is another coalition government such as proved so disastrous on the two previous occasions it came into operation here.</P>
    <P>I suppose in view of the amount of talk which we have had from the Opposition about it I had better make some reference to the incursions into the realms of fantasy by the famous television professors.  The poverty of the Opposition case is shown by the fact that they have to get normally intelligent and rational men like them to indulge in this kind of ridiculous exercise. However, I intend to deal with it <Col N="256" /> a lot more briefly than the Opposition did as I do not think it really merits serious consideration.  Deputy Donegan appeared to be impressed almost as much by this fanciful forecast of a large majority being permanently achieved by the Fianna Fáil Party under the proposed system as he was by the equally silly projection of the Fine Gael Senators of the possible results under the present system.  All I would like to say about that is long may they continue to dissipate their energy in this type of useless activity. The projection of 95 or 100 seats, or whatever it was, by these people only serves to show the nonsense people can produce when they pontificate on something about which they know nothing. I do not believe that any of these people ever did a day's electioneering in their lives.  Certainly nobody knows what the position will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with this forecast on which the Opposition rely so heavily, the fanciful forecast of certain otherwise eminent gentlemen on television with regard to what they pretend to consider the likely results of the system which we propose.  As I was about to say, the constituencies have not yet been delineated nor has the Commission which will do this yet been formed, so nobody knows what the constituencies will be and nobody knows who the candidates in individual constituencies will be.  In any case, so far as we are concerned, and I think the same would apply to other Parties, information about the distribution of support in different constituencies is just not available and therefore one cannot say what the results of an election would be under the system.  Certainly the results of the local elections on which this forecast was supposed to be based are completely irrelevant and in any case Fine Gael have been claiming they won these local elections. If they won the local elections how they can then prove they are going to be wiped out under the new system, on an investigation supposed to be based on the local elections, just beats me. For anybody to base a forecast of the <Col N="257" /> results of the next general election on results in areas which varied widely in population, varied from a population as low as 3,603 up to areas with a population of 51,772, and in view of the fact that the Constitution requires at present strict parity of population per Deputy and even if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was passed it would still require comparatively close parity of population per Deputy&mdash;for anybody to base a forecast on such diverse areas as that in an election decided on local issues and local personalities is foolish in the extreme.</P>
      <P>As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we know if the next election is fought under the present system, we will be the Government; we believe we will win under the system we propose but this can be no more than a guess.  In so far as the future is concerned we have confidence that we will continue to retain the support of the majority of the people but this is in the future and it is unknown.  We would not be so foolhardy as to forecast that we would always remain in Government under this or any other system.  However, there is one thing sure and that is we are not afraid of circumstances in which there will be a clear confrontation between the different Parties for each seat in the Dáil and I might say neither is the Leader of the main Opposition Party or a substantial number of the Members of his Party.  I believe that the majority against the proposal in the main Opposition Party is one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point to which I wish to refer briefly in order to point out that what was said in regard to it was completely incorrect.  I refer to the question of the members of the Committee on the Constitution who contributed to this debate.  Five Fianna Fáil Deputies served at different times <Col N="258" /> on that Committee.  I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who alleged that only one of these had indicated his support for the Government's proposals. In fact each of the five has done that; four have done it here in the debate and one has done it outside. The Fianna Fáil members who served on that Committee were the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Davern, Deputy Andrews, Deputy Molloy and, for a short time, Deputy Seán Lemass.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Andrews and Deputy Molloy all spoke here in support of these proposals and, although Deputy Lemass did not speak in the House, he did express his opinions outside and they were published in the papers.  On the other hand, there were three Fine Gael Deputies members of this Committee and only one of them spoke here although we know there was an all-out effort by the Fine Gael Whips to compel as many as possible to come in here and speak.  They succeeded in getting 21 members of the Party to come in here on the Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Needless to say I do not know what happened in the discussions this Committee had.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was not, I think, a member but he claims to know everything that went on.  So do various other members of the Fine Gael Party.  Whether that is mere pretence or whether it is a fact that the members of the Committee did purport to disclose what occurred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How arguments could be made against something that was not discussed I cannot understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that at that Committee the effort naturally was to try to see if some agreement could be reached.  Agreement was not reached and we were left, therefore, to formulate our own proposals and we formulated those proposals and put forward the best proposals we could for an electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is alleged that the system we propose will give rise to a large number of what are described as &ldquo;safe seats&rdquo;.  I have already pointed out that it is much easier to have &ldquo;safe seats&rdquo; under the present system and it is a fact that some Deputies scrape up a quota of votes in different ways throughout a large constituency and look upon their seats as being &ldquo;safe seats&rdquo; which is largely responsible for the very narrow majority in opposition to our proposals at the Fine Gael Party meeting.  The Fine Gael speakers alleged that Fianna Fáil will have a large number of &ldquo;safe seats&rdquo; and they alleged that what they describe as the &ldquo;Party bosses&rdquo; would send down people from Dublin to acquire these &ldquo;safe seats&rdquo;.  It is obvious that Fine Gael are obsessed with their own Party's procedure.  We have not got Party political bosses.  Our conventions are conducted in a democratic way.  It is the local people who select the candidates and the assumption that the electorate would elect people who were put before them by Party bosses is, of course, based on the normal Fine Gael attitude of looking upon the people as politically immature and incapable of considering the relevant issues at an election.  Deputy Tully gave the same indication.  He also alleged that the <Col N="260" /> Fianna Fáil Party would send down a nominee to a safe constituency.  I can assure Deputies opposite that it is because we have more respect for the intelligence of the people than that that we have continued to retain the people's support and it is largely because of their contempt for the intelligence of the people that they are where they are.  We do not look upon the people as being, as Deputy Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> said, hidebound by tradition, which means, in fact, unfit to operate the democratic system.  If anybody showed his interest in a safe seat it was Deputy James Tully who, when I was describing what must inevitably happen in his particular part of the country if our proposals are not accepted and an adjustment has to be made between County Meath and County Louth by the transfer of part of County Meath to County Louth, interjected at column 853 of the Official Report of 28th May, 1968, and said:</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully alleged this was a threat by me.  In fact, I was merely pointing out that, unless the proposal we are making is adopted, some adjustment such as I have outlined will have to be made, but the only point Deputy Tully was capable of seeing was the possibility of what he described as a &ldquo;cushy seat&rdquo; for himself and he was very quick to see that and stake his claim.  I was not making any threat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know in what way the complexities of that situation will be dealt with, but it is quite obvious that that is one of the possibilities. It was not a threat.  Neither was what I said with regard to the possibilities in Donegal a threat, as Deputy Harte alleged.  Deputy Harte took four columns of the Official Report of 27th June alleging that I made a threat.  I quoted what Deputy Harte <Col N="261" /> said on 3rd April, 1968, at column 1722 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>We have at the present time two constituencies which are sending three Deputies to the House and, if commonsense is to be observed, and if the Constitution is to be honoured, it should be one constituency sending back five Deputies. This will be conceded by anybody with limited intelligence who devotes any time to the political scene in Donegal.</P>
      <P>All I did was to point out to Deputy Harte that he was, in fact, demanding that Donegal should lose one Deputy and, in order for that to be done, a transfer of a substantial portion of the population of Donegal to Sligo-Leitrim would have to be made because the population of Donegal is 108,549 and that is below the minimum population required for six Deputies and above the maximum allowable for five Deputies.  Therefore, if what Deputy Harte demanded is to be done in Donegal, that inevitably involves the transferring of part of the population out of the county to some other constituency. That was not a threat.  That was merely a factual indication of what must be done to comply with his requirement and, indeed, to comply with the requirements of the Constitution at present.  I went on then to point out that this was not necessary from the point of view of the number of voters, that there was, in fact, substantially more than the national average of voters per Deputy in the county of Donegal to justify the present representation there.  However, that can be dealt with at a more appropriate time during the campaign when both Deputy Harte's and Deputy O'Donnell's constituents will be let know just exactly what their representatives are proposing to do in regard to the County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it is really necessary for me to deal again with the question of the outstanding achievement of Fianna Fáil in winning six out of seven by-elections, although Deputies opposite dealt at quite considerable length with this matter, or indeed, I do not think there is any need <Col N="262" /> for me to defend the voluntary personnel who assist Fianna Fáil at these elections.  We are proud of the fact that it has been one of the main sources of strength of our organisation that there are always people of high ideals who are ready to come and assist us in a voluntary capacity at election time.</P>

      <P>There are some very effective voluntary workers who came from Donegal, as Deputy Donegan and Deputy Fitzpatrick know to their cost.</P>
      <P>Another matter that was raised here was the question of the cost of this referendum.  The actual carrying out of the referendum will cost a certain amount of money but, as I pointed out, first of all, it is obvious that it is fully justified to achieve the benefits of the system we propose and to get rid of the dangers of the system that we have but, quite apart from that, it is obvious that if the proposals we make are adopted by the people, all this cost will be very quickly recovered.  In fact, it will be recovered by the reduced cost of by-elections in the period of any one Dáil.</P>
      <P>The British Parliament set up a Royal Commission to consider the question of introducing the system that we have into their elections and, like sensible people, they rejected the suggestion but one of the main objections that they saw to our present system was the disproportionate effort and expense that would be involved in by-elections under the system and, of course, it is obvious that the effort and expense that is called for in by-elections under the present system is disproportionate to the task that has to be performed.</P>
      <P>The elections are held over large scattered constituencies.  Whereas, under our system, the elections will take place over constituencies only a fraction of the present size.  In addition to that, the effort, of course, of all Parties has to be correspondingly greater and the people of these large constituencies are being asked to go to the polls to replace a fraction of their representation whereas, under the system we propose, at a by-election the task of the people in a smaller area, an area a fraction of the present size, would be to elect their total representation. So that, the cost involved would, obviously, be very quickly recovered in the reduced cost of by-elections, apart from anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have probably spent enough <Col N="265" /> time dealing with the points that were made on this Stage of the Bill because I feel they were made largely for the purpose of delaying its passage rather than for any other reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We were asked why we decided to put this proposal before the people.  In the first instance, we considered it necessary, particularly in view of the debate on the revision of constituencies in 1961 and the unanimous demand of the Opposition Parties at that time, to ask the people to amend the constitutional requirements with regard to strict parity of population per Deputy.  That was necessary in order to avoid injustice to the people in different parts of the country.  Having taken the decision that there should be a referendum at any rate, the question of the electoral system naturally came up for consideration.  There was the fact that there had been a substantial change in the electorate since 1959, that there had been more experience of the present system since then and more examples of its disruptive and unstable effect in other countries.  There had been the example of the long recounts here.  There had been a considerable amount of speculation at least as to whether or not there would be a move made to provide ourselves with a more rational system of election.  In addition, we had recommendations from our own Party Ard-Fheis to make this move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things were allied to our own conviction that the present system being designed to provide representation for small minorities therefore was also designed to foster the formation of minority Parties and our conviction that this must eventually have the same splintering effect that similar systems have had in other countries.  We were convinced that it was only a matter of time until that situation developed here.  Obviously, once it develops, it is then too late to give the people an opportunity of getting rid of the system.  The inherent disadvantages of the system of multi-member constituencies; the evils it gives rise to <Col N="266" /> and the dangers inherent in it; the corresponding advantages to public morale and to the better representation of the people involved in single-seat constituencies and since a referendum had been decided on at any rate&mdash;all this decided us to give the people an opportunity of warding off the inevitable result of the present system.</P>
    <P>Our proposal to the people arises from these facts&mdash;from the fact that we believe the main purpose of an election is to enable the people to choose their own Government.  Obviously, any system in which you have a large number of small sectional Parties will make it impossible for the people to do this.  It is our belief that it is fundamental in the system of democracy that the people should in fact be able at election time to choose the policies to be operated by the Government and it should be feasible for them to hold the Government responsible for their actions at the next election. It is obvious that, if Governments are only to be formed on the basis of whatever arrangement it is possible to make after elections, the policy of that Government&mdash;if any&mdash;will never have been before the people and that it will be based on the policy of day-to-day expediency and what results from the considerations of a Government in which, as the vice-chairman of the Labour Party said, the different members are watching for the opportunity of &ldquo;springing the trap&rdquo; on their colleagues.</P>
    <P>Our decision was also based on our belief that instability in Government inevitably gives rise to economic recession. I think that has been demonstrated here.  We believe that if it becomes impossible for the people to actually choose their Government, democracy has been a failure.  Indeed, I think the Opposition see this because a large part of their speeches here consisted of a rather pathetic plea for a continuation of a situation in which the formation of Coalition Governments will be possible.</P>
    <P>A system of single-seat constituencies will obviously, over a period of time at least, result in good and effective representation for the people.  A Deputy will no longer be able to hide <Col N="267" /> the fact he is not giving service because some of his colleagues are dealing with the interests of his constituents. Because the areas Deputies will have to deal with will be of more reasonable size it will be possible for them to give attention to local matters that need their attention and at the same time, because of the smaller amount of time it will be necessary to spend on this type of activity, Deputies will be able to give more attention to their more important business as Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I have also pointed out before that the present system, in which there is competition for the same votes between a number of Deputies, is bad for public morale.  There is a built-in incentive for Deputies to try and curry favour with the electorate by pretending that things which are available to them because of statutory provisions made by this House are in fact obtained by virtue of the effectiveness of representations made by public representatives. This is to a certain extent a belief in corruption.  It is not true that this position obtains, but it does have a bad effect on the public morale generally.</P>
    <P>This system we are proposing is obviously the fairest one because there will be a clear choice in each constituency. The people will be able to see clearly what is being put before them. I cannot see that any Party can have any complaint because every Party will be contesting each constituency on an even footing.  The candidates will be standing on their own feet.  There will be no opportunity for anybody to be elected because of the surplus of a particularly popular candidate of his own Party.  In addition, the proposal in this Bill will establish for the first time in this country the fundamental democratic principle of one-man, one-vote. It will get rid of the present system which discriminates unjustifiably between different members of the electorate.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the allegation that this must inevitably result in a perpetuation of Fianna Fáil government and I do not think it is worth while referring to it again.  This proposal is not being made in the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The history of the <Col N="268" /> State has shown that it is not required for the interests of Fianna Fáil.  But it is obvious that the tendency for the Opposition to fragment into small Parties is developing again.  We do not know how many Parties Fine Gael is going to split into.  It is obvious that when a situation of a large number of small Parties develops, it will be too late to do anything about it.  Those in Fine Gael who are not completely demoralised by their long experience of defeat agree with our proposal.  It just so happens that they are temporarily and indeed narrowly out-numbered. The attitude to this debate was well indicated by Deputy Murphy of the Labour Party who, at column 1701 of the Dáil Debates of the 26th June, had this to say:</P>
    <P>Let us hope that what is in the Bill and what is not in the Bill will not matter.</P>
    <P>I think it is obvious that the decision to oppose the Bill is not based on what is in it or not in it; it is based on the consistent attitude of the Opposition Parties of opposing proposals by Fianna Fáil purely and simply because they are put forward by Fianna Fáil.  I think it is significant that the Leader of the main Opposition Party adheres to the traditional view of his own Party.  He stands where his father stood on the foundation of the Fine Gael Party in 1933.  I quoted the extract from the published programme of the Fine Gael Party in 1933.</P>

      <P>No. That was not it.  I have already put it on record in this debate.  Point 7 of the Declaration of Policy of the Fine Gael Party which was set up in 1933 was &ldquo;the abolition of the proportional representation system so as to secure the more effective democratic control of national policy and to establish closer personal relationship between parliamentary representatives and their constituents.&rdquo;  I also showed that this was still Fine <Col N="269" /> Gael Party policy in 1937 and it was still their policy in 1947 and the first indication of change from that was in 1959.  The only obvious reason was that in 1959 we proposed to give the people the opportunity of making the change that Fine Gael had been advocating all through the period of their existence and that indeed the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party had been advocating prior to their demise.</P>
      <P>In case Deputy Fitzpatrick might think this is an exaggeration and that it was only with the advent of Fine Gael that this plan and programme was adopted, I want to quote from a paper known as &ldquo;An Réalt&rdquo;, the Star, A National Weekly Review&mdash; which was the official organ of the old Cumann na nGaedhael Party which was later transformed into Fine Gael. In the issue of Saturday, May 10th, 1930, was an article headed &ldquo;Faults of Proportional Representation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors which has delayed normal political development in the Saorstat is our bad electoral system.  The particular form of Proportional Representation which is in force here is perhaps not so bad as that in force in Germany but that is the best that can be said about it. It has all the ineradicable faults which attach to the system.  It may be added that such faults have manifested themselves in every country in which Proportional Representation has been tried.  Both before the outbreak of the Great War and after its close a great many nations enshrined the principle of proportional representation in their electoral codes.  For a while theorisers and faddists succeeded in pushing their views in many countries, with the result stated.  Proportional Representation has proved to be like prohibition in two respects.  Those who have had experience of it and who are prepared to judge it impartially are satisfied that on the whole its results are evil but vested interests have quickly grown up around it which renders its abolition difficult.  In our case Proportional Representation was thrust upon the country by the British.  Generously subsidised propagandist societies had, for a long <Col N="270" /> time, been at work in the neighbouring country endeavouring to persuade the people there to abandon an electoral system which in its main outline had been in existence since parliament was first established.  The British people, or at any rate certain sections of them, were interested but not convinced.  When the Home Rule Bill establishing two Parliaments in Ireland was passed these kind people arranged, on the policy of trying it on the dog, that the new Parliaments should be elected on the principle of Proportional Representation.</P>

      <P>It is also interesting to see that Deputy Dillon did not, in fact, invent this phrase of &ldquo;trying it out on the dog&rdquo; and that when he expressed this opinion in 1947 he was quoting an official Cumann na nGaedheal publication of 17 years previously.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party in being in favour of the proposal we make now is being entirely consistent.  He is adhering to the policy of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party in 1930 and of the Fine Gael Party right up to some time between 1947 and 1959.  This, then, is not necessarily in Fianna Fáil's interest <Col N="271" /> alone; it is in the interests of whatever Party the people will choose in conditions in which it will be possible for them to make a clear choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it reasonable for Deputies to insinuate that Deputy Cosgrave wants to perpetuate the Fianna Fáil Party in Government.  I think the fact is that he sees that what we are proposing is the right thing for the country and that despite the long history of defeat in the Fine Gael Party, he is still capable of deciding questions on their merits rather than indulging in blind and unreasoning opposition, and so far from its being an indication that he wants to perpetuate Fianna Fáil in office, it is an <Col N="272" /> indication that he has sufficient sense of responsibility and honesty of purpose and confidence in his own judgement to agree with the Government when he believes they are right and that unlike the majority of his Party, he has the moral courage to say so.  It is also an indication that he still retains some hope that at some time in the future it will be possible to instil some backbone into the Party he leads.  I think it is obvious from the debate here that the Fine Gael Party are gradually coming around to the point of view of the Leader of the Party and that when this referendum goes to the country, Deputy Cosgrave will have his way in spite of the Party he leads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a short one and an explanatory memorandum has been circulated with it.  I do not, therefore, propose to make a lengthy statement at this stage.  If, however, Deputies wish me to clarify any of the Bill's provisions, I will be happy to do so when concluding.</P>
      <P>Section 1 provides that polling cards at the forthcoming referenda must contain a statement, prescribed in the Bill, summarising the proposals in the Third and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bills.  The section will also enable this statement to be displayed at polling stations and will authorise presiding officers to assist illiterate, blind or otherwise physically incapacitated voters by reading out to them the prescribed summary of the proposals, asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposals and then marking their ballot papers in accordance with the voters' answers. These arrangements are similar to those which were introduced by the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1959, in relation to the 1959 referendum.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its short title, the Bill containing the proposal passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have been legally advised that there is no alternative to this.  It would obviously be impracticable to set out the proposal itself on the ballot paper.  Furthermore, it would be extremely undesirable that the ballot paper should contain a summary or paraphrase of the proposal because of the possibility of litigation to restrain the President from signing a Bill, even after a referendum, on the grounds that the proposal as stated on the ballot paper&mdash;and, accordingly, as approved by the people&mdash;was not identical in its legal effect with that contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I think the House will agree that it is desirable that a simple summary of the proposals should be circulated for the information of voters, as was done in 1959. Copies of the Bills containing the proposals for the amendment of the Constitution will, of course, be made available for inspection and purchase at a cost of sixpence at all post offices so that voters can study the actual terms of the proposed amendments.  The Government are not committed to using the actual summary which is set out in the Appendix to section 1 and and alterations which the House might wish to have made in it can be discussed at Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> Section 2 provides for a revised and simplified form of ballot paper at a constitutional referendum.  Unlike section 1, this section will be a permanent provision, applying to all constitutional referenda.  For the reasons I have mentioned when dealing with section 1, no change can be made in the manner in which the proposal which is the subject of the Referendum is stated on the ballot paper.  No change is proposed in the question put to the voter, that is: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&rdquo; The layout of the remainder of the ballot paper has, however, been altered and some inessential instructions omitted in an effort to make the paper itself clearer for the voter.  The main changes are the provision of separate spaces for &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; votes and &ldquo;No&rdquo; votes and the linking of the voting instructions more closely with these spaces.  I feel sure that the House will agree that the revised layout is a considerable improvement on the existing form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In the position in which we find ourselves, following the steamrolling through this House by the Government, with their majority, of the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution Bills, we are now faced with a referendum on these Bills.  That cannot be avoided unless the Bills are withdrawn by the Government.  It is therefore necessary that a Referendum (Amendment) Bill should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear the Minister saying that he is not tied to the explanation about the two Bills contained in the Appendix, and that he is prepared to listen to any suggestions made to alter those explanations, as I call them, at a later stage.  I should like, first of all, to deal with the explanation, or the paper, which will be sent out explaining the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The object of that card, and the object of the explanation which will appear on the ballot paper and in the polling booths, should be to qualify the position and to use language which will convey to the voter exactly what the proposal is. <Col N="276" /> I have to say that the language used in the Appendix in reference to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, is, in my opinion, calculated to confuse and to deceive. The green paper explanation will read as follows: The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, proposes to substitute for the present system of voting at Dáil elections the straight vote system in single member constituencies. Now, this description of the spot vote or the first past the post system as the straight vote system is simply and solely an invention of the Minister to give a respectable description to this system&mdash;to describe it as &ldquo;the straight vote system&rdquo; when, in effect, it is anything but straight and is, in fact, a crooked and unfair system of election.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill describing this as the straight vote.  In Part II of the Schedule to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, it is stated that the members shall be elected on the relative majority system by means of the single non-transferable vote.  This is the description of it there&mdash;a single non-transferable vote.  This single non-transferable vote system is described in a couple of ways in the Report of the Committee on the Constitution, December, 1967, this Report the Minister does not like quoted at him and does not like to discuss.  It is described there as the first-past-the-post system. It is also described, at page 115 of the Report, as &ldquo;the spot vote which is used in British elections&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to me that the introduction into this explanation of the word &ldquo;straight&rdquo; is not a mistake and is not just a coincidence.  It is an effort by the Minister to dress-up this unfair &ldquo;relative majority system&rdquo;, &ldquo;first-past-the-post system&rdquo;, &ldquo;the spot system&rdquo;, in language that will convey to the electors that it is fair and straight and honest because the words &ldquo;straight and honest&rdquo; go hand in hand in the ordinary everyday language of the man in the street here.</P>
    <P>How any system could be described as straight in regard to elections which propose to represent a person who <Col N="277" /> receives 30 per cent or 35 per cent of the votes as representing a majority of the people in his constituency is a mystery.  That is the system the Government are now trying to force on the people of this country.  It is anything but &ldquo;straight&rdquo;.  It is anything but fair.  It could be described, if one sought to describe it in terms which would suggest merit or demerit, right or wrong, as unfair&mdash;&ldquo;the unfair vote&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the `straight' vote&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am very much against the use of those words &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; to describe this system.  I cannot get it in the discussion which took place in the Committee: it is described there as the &ldquo;first past the post system&rdquo;.  It is also described and officially described in Great Britain as &ldquo;the spot vote&rdquo;.  I therefore propose to put down an amendment on Committee Stage to alter that description.</P>
    <P>I think reference to proportional representation should be made in the description, too.  Reference should be made to the abolition of the system of proportional representation and the substitution of &ldquo;the spot vote&rdquo; or the first past the post system.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is a matter which can more properly be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I want to serve notice on the Minister that I am making a charge that these two words, &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and &ldquo;honest&rdquo;, are calculated to deceive and will in fact deceive, that they are calculated to mislead and will in fact mislead, that they are calculated to present a dishonest system of voting as an honest system of voting.</P>
    <P>On the ballot paper dealing with the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, it is stated that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, proposes that in forming Dáil constituencies the population per Deputy in any case may not vary by more than one-sixth of the national average.  In Part II of the Schedule to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill it is clearer.  Actually, what is happening is made clearer in the Schedule because it is stated that none of the quotients shall be greater, or less, than the average by more than one-sixth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> I think it should be made clear in the explanation which is to be given to the voters that the Government may, in one constituency, go one-sixth above the national average and, in another constituency, may go one-sixth under it.  I do not think that is clear in the explanation which it is proposed to give.  I propose to consider that further, between now and Committee Stage, and to put down an amendment.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that it should be necessary to introduce this Bill and to discuss it.  It is necessary only because the Government have refused to accept the clear answer given by the people in 1959 that they are quite satisfied with the system that we have and, indeed, the present President is on record as saying that this is simply a manoeuvre with the system so as to get Party advantage.</P>
    <P>What we are doing now is introducing a Bill to enable the Minister to try to persuade the people to change the system so as to get Party advantage. As reported in Volume 67 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, column 1344, the present President stated here on 1st June, 1937:</P>
    <P>My view is that it is better, when dealing with fundamental law, with the right to vote and how the vote shall be exercised, to define, and take away from Parties the temptation to manoeuvre with systems so as to get Party advantage.</P>
    <P>That is clearly the Minister's object in introducing this Bill.  If the other two Bills had not already been passed by the Government majority in this House, I would certainly vote against this on Second Reading, but when these Bills have been passed and when the Government have decided to steamroll their opinion through the House by their majority obtained since the last election, we should do everything we can to make the issue as clear as possible for the people.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, neither of the explanations of the Third Amendment or the Fourth Amendment as contained in the Bill at present will clarify the position for the electorate.  On the one hand, the synopsis of the Third Amendment <Col N="279" /> is not clear: it does not make it clear that the one-sixth tolerance, as the Minister calls it, goes either way. Certainly the synopsis of the Fourth Amendment describing this unjust, inequitable, unfair and undemocratic system as the straight vote is, in my opinion, a grave abuse of the English language and a grave abuse of words. I propose therefore to try to improve the synopsis of each Bill on the next Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vital that the issue be placed before the people in the referendum in a positive, fair and impartial manner, devoid of any tricks designed to mislead or confuse the people.  We have good reason to be suspicious of the Government's intentions in regard to the manner in which this matter is being put to the people when we remember the earlier intention to put both issues, the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution, on the one ballot paper.  It was called at that time the package deal. Here we had an indication of an intention to compel the people to vote on the question of the abolition of PR on the one hand, the creation of the single-seat constituency and the straight vote, and on the other hand, on the matter of tolerances.  Due to the public indignation over the unfair manner in which the issues were being put in this package deal, the Minister and his Government relented and they have now been forced to put the matters at issue on two different ballot papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is of vital importance that the matters be put fairly and honestly without any gimmicks or trickery attached.  Above all else, the wording of these ballot papers should be simple, straightforward and readily understandable to people who go to vote and who are likely to be confused by the large amount of wording on the specimen ballot paper we are debating, much of which is quite unnecessary. The ballot paper will be bilingual and this is going to make for confusion. There will be a pretty large space for the insertion of a brief reference to the Bills: for the proposals in the Third <Col N="280" /> Amendment of the Constitution Bill given briefly, and for the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill the explanation will contain three provisions, first, to substitute for the present system of voting at Dáil elections the straight vote system in single-member constituencies and secondly, to establish a Commission to determine constituencies subject to the right of the Dáil to amend the constituencies as so determined and, thirdly, to provide that whenever the Dáil is dissolved, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle may be returned without a contest as a second Deputy for a constituency chosen by him which consists of or includes a part of the constituency he represented before the dissolution.</P>
    <P>We consider that there is a lot of wording there which is quite unnecessary and which would tend to confuse. It is something which people cannot be expected to assimilate in the few moments one usually gets to exercise the franchise in a ballot of this kind, in the confusion of a booth and particularly late in the evening when one cannot be expected to read all this rigmarole and to comprehend it and then to mark one's ballot paper intelligently.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Fitzpatrick when he says in regard to the wording on the specimen ballot paper for the Fourth Amendment that there is a positive bias in favour of the Government's proposal.  The emphasis is on the straight vote and the single-seat constituency, whereas the real issue facing the people is the abolition of proportional representation.  This is the issue and there is no reference whatever to it on the specimen ballot paper.  A simpler ballot paper could be designed quite easily and the issue put to the people plainly, for or against the abolition of PR, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The fact that there is no reference to PR on the ballot paper is likely to confuse and it is certainly designed to try to make people forget about the main issue.</P>
    <P>Therefore we believe that a simpler method of presentation could and should be designed.  For instance, I question whether it is really necessary to have on the ballot paper in Irish and English &ldquo;Place mark in one square <Col N="281" /> only&rdquo;.  This is quite unnecessary.  The squares are there with the words &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; and &ldquo;Níl&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and people should be regarded as having sufficient intelligence to know what they are doing when they are marking those squares.  Another aspect to which I want to refer is this whole question of secrecy in ballots in this country.  It is contained in the specimen ballot paper that the back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the back of the counterfoil attached to it is to bear the same number and the number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.  By reason of the fact that ballot papers are numbered, people are losing confidence in the absolute secrecy of the ballot.  I know many people who are of the opinion, foolishly or otherwise, that the manner in which they vote can be made known and is made known to Party bosses.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to state why it is necessary to have ballot papers and counterfoils numbered at all.  Are they not traceable?  Is it not a fact that if one goes to the trouble, one can find out how a person voted?  I know for a fact that certain political bosses in my constituency, and in other constituencies also, have hinted, thereby intimidating people, that they knew how they voted; they purported to tell them how they voted.  As I said, people are losing confidence in regard to the alleged absolute secrecy of the ballot.</P>
    <P>We question the necessity for numbering ballot papers as well as counterfoils. It is vitally important that we should be unanimous on this issue of absolute secrecy in respect of ballot papers.  It is vitally important that there should be no means of finding out how a person voted.  We know that certain unscrupulous people have sought to intimidate voters by alleging they could find out how they voted.  It is time the numbering of ballot papers was challenged and justification sought for its continuance.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what happens to ballot papers.  How long are they held?  In whose hands are they retained?  Who is responsible for safeguarding them?  How are they eventually <Col N="282" /> disposed of?  Can outsiders gain access to them?  Can comparisons not be made with the counterfoils?</P>
    <P>The main emphasis should be on the presentation of a simple and easily understandable ballot paper.  There should be no ambiguity; there should be no attempt to mislead.  The issue here is a simple one and we will see to it on the hustings over the next few months that the issue is not clouded, despite the trickery involved in this specimen ballot paper and the emphasis on the alleged straight vote.  Proportional representation is the issue. There is no reference to this intrinsic principle enshrined in our Constitution and it is right that there should be a suitable amendment to clarify the matter. If the straight vote must enter into the ballot paper, then equally proportional representation should also be mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that cards will be issued containing a summary of the proposals in regard to the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution. It is vitally important that the information on these cards should be clear and that people should be alerted to the fact that the Government are seeking to abolish proportional representation and replace it with the straight vote and the single-seat constituency. I should like the Minister to tell us what this summary will contain? Will it be similar to the information given on this specimen ballot paper?</P>
    <P>It is good to know that the blind and physically handicapped may be assisted in marking their ballot papers by a friend, or a relative, or the presiding officer.  It would be better if these people were assisted by friends or relatives in order to save them embarrassment by having the presiding officer reading out what is involved before the other personages entitled to be in the polling station.  But this is a welcome provision.</P>
    <P>We regard the Minister's proposal generally as anything but straight.  The intention is to confuse and mislead. The proposal is designed to entrench Fianna Fáil in power for ever.  It is very important, therefore, that the ballot paper should be unambiguous. The Minister and his Party are clearly <Col N="283" /> endeavouring to secure their original design by having the issue carried by default.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Treacy in querying the provisions with regard to the green ballot paper in this Bill.  In what circumstances, I should like to know, does the Minister propose that voters be told that the Fourth Amendment represents a choice between the present system of voting at Dáil elections and the straight vote system?  There has been a welter of confusion about this whole proposal to amend the Constitution, confusion that has arisen from a variety of sources.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made in the debates and discussions up to this to different systems of election.  Proportional representation is something the people know.  It is there and it has been there since the State was formed.  There has been reference to the British system of election, to the spot system of election, to the first past the post system of election and in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill that the people are asked to vote on, and copies of which they are entitled to receive in the referendum, if they read it from beginning to end, they will not find any term containing the words &ldquo;the straight vote system&rdquo;.  It is not in it and it could not be in it because there is no such system of election known to persons concerned with politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What they will find in the Fourth Amendment is the system of election by the single non-transferable vote providing for the relative majority. That is what the people are asked to vote on and this green ballot paper proposes to tell them a lie.  That is what it is.  It proposes to tell them that in the Bill they are asked to approve or disapprove of they are given a choice between &ldquo;the present system of voting&rdquo;, which is not named &mdash; why is it not named?  Why does the Minister want to conceal that the present system of voting is the system of proportional representation that has been known in this country in this <Col N="284" /> generation of voters, in the generations that went before them?  They have never known any other system for the best part of the past 50 years.  Why is it not named?  It is clearly not named because this green ballot paper instruction is intended and designed to deceive the voter.  &ldquo;The present system of voting at Dáil elections.&rdquo; Surely it is the minimum in accuracy, the minimum in truth, to tell the people that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution proposes to abolish proportional representation?  Is the Minister afraid of saying that?  Are the Government so concerned with concealing the truth that they will not say that their proposal is aimed at abolishing proportional representation?  If they have courage in their proposal, let them state that in the simple instruction to the voter &mdash;&ldquo;and the straight vote system&rdquo;.  We object to the use of these terms.  They are not in the Bill.  They are not used.  It is an adjectival way of describing the British system of election. It is perfectly as fair to describe it as the crooked system of voting.  One is perfectly entitled, depending on one's point of view, approving or disapproving, to describe it by either adjective. Why should this Referendum Bill contain an emotive description of a system of election upon which the people are asked to vote in the sense of approval or disapproval?</P>
    <P>We object to the use of this term.  It is not in the Bill.  It is not in the referendum proposal.  If one wanted to be technical, surely the choice before the people is the choice between the single transferable vote and multi-member constituencies and the single non-transferable vote in single-member constituencies? That is the choice.  If there are to be technical terms applied, those are the terms that should be applied. If you want to use simple terms, terms that the people understand, the choice is between the present system of proportional representation and the British system of election.  No other terms are more clearly understood by the people and will more clearly convey to them what the choice is.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that, in any event, this Bill is necessary and in that sense the Second Reading must be conceded but it would certainly be <Col N="285" /> our object and our purpose to seek proper and appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.  I do hope that the Minister's statement here was made with sincerity and conviction and that we are not going to be faced on Committee Stage with a stone-walling refusal to entertain amendments.  I do hope the Minister will demonstrate on Committee Stage that he is open to amendments from us designed to bring the choice before the voter, designed to make sure that the issue is clearly understood by each person who goes to vote.</P>
    <P>If this referendum is to be held&mdash; and unless the Government change their mind, as I suppose they may in view of recent happenings, the referendum will be held&mdash;it is well that this time there should be no doubt in anybody's mind as to the decision and conviction of the Irish people.  It is necessary that the issue be put fully and clearly before each voter and that each of us, depending on our point of view, can be satisfied that there was no confusion, no mean little efforts to sweeten the pill, and that each voter goes in to vote knowing what he is asked to do.  Under the ballot paper proposals here, I fear that that may not be the result.</P>
    <P>Above all, I hope that there will be finality in this decision of the people with regard to our electoral system and that we will not have to bother the people ever again.  It is for that reason that I want the proposals clearly put without any deception, without any false description.  As the Bill now stands, there certainly are elements for deception and there is a basis for a false description and we will seek to amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can foresee further appeals to the people on this issue in time to come, possibly every five years, unless this Government are removed from office.  Deputy O'Higgins expressed the hope&mdash;I think it is rather a vain hope&mdash;that this would be the last time the people would be asked to make a decision on it.  The evidence is all to the contrary.  We had this performance nine years ago.  It is quite <Col N="286" /> obvious that people at the head of the Fianna Fáil Party see no objection at all to putting the people to endless trouble to get their own objectives, if there is the slightest hope of doing it. The only hope is that they will get such a tremendous hammering that it will take quite a while for the memory of it to fade, even in so insensitive a mind in matters of this kind as that of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill and it seems that this most distasteful and objectionable description of what he has in mind in the straight vote will not be contained in the Bill itself but will be contained in the polling cards to go out to the public.  It would take a ballot paper a foot long to put down all this material in one sheet as it affects each amendment.  This makes the matter all the more insidious.  Polling cards notify the people of their right to vote and set out where they are to vote.  These things have a significance in the mind of the ordinary voter which makes them appear official, authoritative, carrying weight.  When on that they read &mdash; those of them who take the trouble to read &mdash; the description set out of what is contained in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Act, as it will be, the tendency will be to think that this is something which has a sort of blanket approval by most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking of the vast number of people who may not take the intense interest in political affairs taken by us here or by Party members and supporters. There are many people whose interest in politics is a cursory one. Many of them regard it as light entertainment. Others think of politics, when they think of it at all, in relation to local or national problems which arise. These people will not be as conversant as we are with what is contained in these Bills.  When they get an official-looking document, such as a polling card, through the post referring to the straight vote, it will form a prejudice in the minds of some&mdash;not all&mdash;and can be used by other less scrupulous people to create the impression that this is the thing to do, that it is the straight vote as against something which is reprehensible and disputable. <Col N="287" /> This will all be done through the post. It will not be on the ballot paper but will be on the card the voter will receive. That makes it all the more objectionable and its ramifications all the more insidious.</P>
    <P>We must stop this if we can.  We can only stop it by trying to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  It is vitally important that we do.  What Deputy Treacy has said is all too true.  Practical politics on the day of elections makes for a situation familiar to every Deputy and to those who work close to them.  There is always a great element of confusion present in the mind of many voters when they go to the polls.  Every Deputy has seen a voter go to a polling station with the fixed intention of voting for a certain candidate, and every Deputy has seen that person&mdash;by no means an unintelligent person or lacking in what is known as education &mdash; come out and has learned that he did not in fact do what he had intended to do.  By some means or other, his intention was thwarted through his own hurry to get the job over with quickly or through the atmosphere of excitement which builds up in polling booths, especially when things get busy towards the end of the day.</P>
    <P>How much more true is this going to be when people are faced with a ballot paper of this kind which is going to take time to read?  A simplification of this ballot paper is absolutely necessary if there is to be any element of fairness in this contest.  So far we have not seen any sign of any such intention. Perhaps it is too much to ask a political Party, particularly a Party struggling for its life, coming up for the first time, like a person in the water gasping for breath, or, if I may mix my metaphors a little, making a last desperate throw of the dice.</P>
    <P>The people coming into the polling both are entitled in fairness to have the issue presented fairly to them.  They are entitled to be asked whether they are for or against PR, for or against the system with which they are familiar. The question must be: &ldquo;Do you want to abolish this system which has given us government from the formation of <Col N="288" /> the State?&rdquo; That is the question.  &ldquo;Do you want to abolish PR or not?&rdquo; That is the question as far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would need somebody with training in constitutional law or at least a year or two at the King's Inns to understand some of the phraseology so far as the Third Amendment is concerned. The effect of the Third Amendment is that in a five-seat constituency in some parts of the country, it will take up to almost 30,000 voters more to elect five Deputies than in other constituencies.  It can have that meaning, allowing for this so-called bias. How is that to be explained on the ballot paper?  It cannot be done, nor indeed is any reasonable attempt being made to explain it in the explanation of the ballot paper given in the Appendix to this Bill, which reads:</P>
    <P>The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, proposes that in forming Dáil constituencies the population per Deputy in any case may not vary by more than one/ sixth from the national average...</P>
    <P>How many know what the national average is?  What does the phrase mean?  How many Members of the House, let alone members of the public know what the national average is?  To what does it relate?  How can one expect the average worker, with much more on his mind than the determination of constituencies, to know what this means?</P>

      <P>.................. and that regard must be had to the extent and accessibility of constituencies, the need for having convenient areas of representation and the desirability of avoiding the over-lapping of county boundaries.</P>
      <P>It is idle to send that to at least half the population.  Yet that is what we propose to do.  It will be set out on the balloting card because in section 1 (a) of the Bill it states:</P>
      <P>A polling card sent under section 64 (1) of the Electoral Act, 1963, shall contain the statement set out in the Appendix to this section.</P>
      <P>That is what I am reading, a statement purporting to explain the Bill.  It does not explain the Bill to the majority of people and I say advisedly that damn few Members of the House could explain it or appreciate what it means.  I am not saying that I am one of those who could.</P>

      <P>If it is obvious to the Minister, he will have an opportunity of explaining it.  It should be obvious to him since he composed it&mdash; or did he?  I may be reading it for the first time for his benefit.  Perhaps he is reading it for the first time.  The point I want to make is that anything that will tend towards a profusion of words on the ballot paper will have the inevitable result of confusing the voter, which confusion can only help the Government.  The temper of the people is such that they are just waiting for the chance to reject this proposal and it is Government tactics to confuse them. The more they can be confused, the narrower can be made the incredibility gap between the Government and the public.  Contrary to what the Americans call the credibility gap, we have this incredibility gap between people <Col N="290" /> and Government.  The people do not believe that this is being done to give a more effective electoral system but that it is being done to entrench the Government in power.  It will not work that way: &ldquo;The best laid schemes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Treacy, I believe that if we are to put any face on it, there must be a fair description of the choice the people are asked to make between the existing system which has worked and the other system which it is sought to introduce.  The ballot paper should be in the simplest possible form.  &ldquo;For or against PR&rdquo; is a far more logical and sensible question from the point of the average, fair-minded individual than what they are being asked to decide now.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Treacy in asking the Minister to say something on the question which comes up at every election, of the numbering of ballot papers. I suppose there is a case that can be made for it.  I should like to know it, but whether there is such a case or not, public sentiment is against it.  The idea that anybody should cast a vote which can be traced, even theoretically, is repugnant to the democratic idea.  It is wrong.  We should take steps to eliminate that.  I should like to hear the Minister on that and the other points made here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill is, I think, most misleading.  It begins:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to assist voters at the referenda on the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution Bills, 1968, by making available to them a summary of the proposals in the Bills and by introducing a revised form of ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the summary of the proposals in the Bill set out will in the slightest degree assist the average voter.  I am wholeheartedly with Deputy Dunne when he says that the obvious way to deal with the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is by asking the voter: Are you for or against PR?  I can understand the soul of the parliamentary draftsman revolting at anything so simple and so <Col N="291" /> readily understandable but I suggest to the Minister that if some simple form as this were devised, it would be in aid of the elector.  That is what every Member of the House should want to ensure&mdash;how best can we get the mind of the people on this particular question?</P>
    <P>In my view, and if the Members on the other side of the House consider it, I think they will agree with me that the simplest way of doing it is to ask that simple question.  Possibly we are before our time in hoping that such a consummation could be achieved. Possibly some day parliamentary draftsmanship will be directed, on occasions like this particularly, towards achieving what really should be achieved in a referendum proposal. For that reason we must accept that we will not get that simple formula on the ballot paper.  I believe that the formula we have on the green ballot paper in this Bill is simply a sales talk for the so-called straight vote and does not assist the elector to make up his mind on the issue at stake.</P>
    <P>We have here a Bill which has been passed through this House and which has gone to the Seanad and it speaks of the relative majority system by means of a single non-transferable vote. The Minister coins the phrase &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; to cover this.  It is a slang term used by the Minister in this respect, and I imagine this is the first time that a slang term was ever imported into an enactment of this House.  Those of us who know the Minister do not consider that he is so simple as not to realise the import of this explanatory statement which is being sent out on the polling card.  It bears all the signs of the publicity agent, the advertising agent, the man who knows best how to sell the thing he wants to sell.  You mention it as often as you can and you do not mention the competitor's name at all in any circumstances.  The only occasion on which the Minister is able to mention the commodity he is peddling is once, but he makes very sure that the other commodity which is being put forward to the people, which is in the possession of the people at the moment <Col N="292" /> and which we are asking them to keep, is not mentioned at all.</P>
    <P>The note which will go out on the green polling card simply says that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill proposes to substitute &ldquo;the present system&rdquo;.  The Irish people have become accustomed to the discussion of the abolition or retention of PR.  I doubt if some of them even know that it is the present system.  It would be fair&mdash;and on consideration, the Minister would agree, I think, it would be fair&mdash;to make some reference to it.  The Minister can expect to have a very rough time in the amendments on Committee Stage seeking to have these words inserted: &ldquo;substitute for the present proportional representation system.&rdquo; It is not fair to use the term &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;; some other words should be used.  The words in the Bill are &ldquo;relative majority system&rdquo;, and these are the words that should be used.</P>
    <P>The terms of this Bill underline the immense responsibility which devolves on Opposition Parties in this matter. The man in the street has no indication whatsoever of the contents of the two Bills on which he is being asked to vote in this referendum.  He and his wife and his family can thank God there are Opposition Parties who have in this House gone to the trouble and who outside this House will go to the expense of explaining to them exactly the issues which are at stake in this referendum.</P>
    <P>The ballot paper simply asks if you approve or do not approve of the provisions of such and such an Act of Parliament.  It is a bad system.  Some other system should be evolved whereby pithy explanation of the issues at stake could be inserted in the ballot paper. There is an intimation that copies of the Bill can be inspected and purchased at any post office.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that, as he is telling the electorate that he might as well give them the added information that they can purchase the Bill for sixpence.  The man in the street does not believe he can get any official document for that amount and he may not go to the trouble of looking for it, but <Col N="293" /> if he is told it costs only sixpence, he may purchase it.</P>
    <P>I should like to warn the public against going to the trouble and expense of purchasing both of the Bills, because I contend not one-third of the Members of this House fully comprehend the nature of the Bills which are in front of them.  I defy the average man to read the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and make any sense of it at all.  However, as the Minister is obliged to tell the people they can purchase these Bills, he should give them as much information as possible about them.</P>
    <P>Here there arises a lovely thought. We have been talking about the expense of this referendum, and notionally every elector in this country, stirred by interest in the referendum, could go to purchase a copy of this Bill.  Should that happy or unhappy situation arise, I should like the Minister to tell the House how many copies of each Bill he intends to have published for this purpose.  The ideal situation would be, notionally at all events, that one copy per elector should be available.  What will be the situation when an elector goes into a post office the day before the referendum and says: &ldquo;I want to get the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, please, sir,&rdquo; and sir has to say: &ldquo;We are very sorry; we are sold out&rdquo;?  It would be a serious disappointment, I am quite sure, to the electorate, and I would suggest the Minister should tell us at this stage how many copies of each Bill he intends to publish and the expense involved in the publication of roughly 1,500,000 copies of each of the Bills in question.</P>
    <P>There is another part of this Bill on which we shall be addressing the Minister on Committee Stage.  It looks innocuous enough, and I think it does arise on the general discussion on the Bill.  I refer to section 1 (e) which says:</P>
    <P>copies of the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section may be displayed in or in the precincts of polling stations,</P>
    <P>There is a well-established practice in <Col N="294" /> this country that no document shall be displayed in polling stations by any of the candidates.  This section would enable any political party to go into a polling station and plaster the place with this statement.  They could underline or put in big print any parts of the statement to which I have been objecting already, that is, the statement that is included on the polling card which is sent to the electorate.  I would earnestly ask the Minister to reconsider this proposal in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree completely that the explanatory statement as amended by this House should be prominently displayed in each polling station, and to that end the Minister should take out the permissive words in the section, &ldquo;may be displayed&rdquo;, and should say the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of section 1 &ldquo;shall be prominently displayed&rdquo; by the presiding officer.  The Minister will agree with me that it is a dangerous precedent to enact a measure here which gives any person the right to go into a polling station and display any document, no matter what it may be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy Treacy who spoke before me have referred to something which undoubtedly has disturbed generations of Irishmen, particularly when they have had a few drinks at night.  It is only then it strikes the Irishman that his vote is not really a secret vote, and it is only on occasions like that he will come to you and say: &ldquo;Is it true my vote is not secret?&rdquo;, and you will have to reply to him that notionally it is not a secret.  I do not think the average voter yet realises that and I think he should be informed of it.  While I can appreciate that there may be technical reasons why the counterfoil and the paper itself should be numbered, the Minister should seriously consider taking some steps which would ensure the secrecy of the ballot, because it is notionally possible for a Minister who is sufficiently ruthless and sufficiently assiduous to find out how each elector cast his or her vote.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may address the House afterwards and put his view, but I should like him to allow me to continue putting my view.  I am quite serious, and I think it important that this should be said. I should be very glad if the Government, or the Deputy, or anyone, would explain to the Irish people that this is not so.  It is my conviction.  We have the ballot paper here and on the back we see:</P>
      <P>The back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the back of the counterfoil attached to it is to bear the same number.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the intention behind the next bit, or whether it arises from false confidence.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.</P>
      <P>I do not know why that should make any difference to the ballot paper.  You have on the counterfoil the voter's number on the register, his letter and his number, and the number of the counterfoil.  Then you have on the back of the paper the number of the constituency. I believe that if you got the register for a particular constituency and if you were able to get hold of the voting papers and the counterfoils, you could trace the vote of a voter.</P>

      <P>That is a bad state in which to find our society.  Any considerations which make it necessary are not at all as important as the consideration of maintaining the secrecy of the ballot and getting out of the minds of the Irish voter the secret fear that his secret vote could be made public to the Minister or his friends. I do not mean the present Minister but any Minister of any Government. That is bad.  That is dangerous. It should not be allowed to happen.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to <Col N="296" /> avail of this occasion to change the system which has been with us for a long time and has rightly, I think, given rise to a great deal of apprehension.  Even if the Minister does not intend to change the system he should avail of this opportunity to explain to the Irish people exactly what is involved in a referendum such as this, and exactly what happens to their ballot papers and their counterfoils.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made very plainly to the Minister that it is possible to trace a man's vote.  If the Minister is of the opinion that this is not so, it is absolutely necessary that he should at this stage explain to the Irish people in plain unequivocal terms that it is not so and tell them where the ballot papers and the counterfoils go.  He should be able to assure them that in no possible circumstances could the two be again reconciled, as I believe they could.  Until the Minister can say: &ldquo;Look, once you cast your vote your ballot paper can never be reconciled to the counterfoil; no one can say, here is the counterfoil, here is the vote number, here is the register, and here is the man,&rdquo; the Irish people will continue to regard measures of this nature with apprehension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is very carefully laid down for that precise reason.  The Committee of this House <Col N="299" /> which went into the whole question of the reform of electoral law gave very serious consideration to this question of the number on the ballot papers. It was made perfectly clear to us, and we accepted, that it is a final protection against any substitution of ballot papers, but it is still necessary that this safeguard should be maintained. That was accepted.  There was no question of a Government majority or anything else.  It was accepted as the proper electoral procedure.  There is no way in which the counterfoils and the ballot papers can be brought together otherwise than by the direction of a judge of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No official way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be done only if a <i>prima facie</i> case is established of the substitution of ballot papers. Deputy Barrett said there was much too much verbiage on the ballot paper. He started off by saying we were confusing the people with words.  Deputy Dunne said we were confusing the people with words.  The next moment, Deputy Barrett says we have not half enough words, that we should preach a sermon on the ballot paper and give far more information on it.  According to the present referendum Bill, all you could have on the ballot paper is simply the question: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&rdquo;.  That, probably, was sufficient, if there was only one Bill before the electorate.  In this case, we have two very complicated Bills before the electorate and we have decided therefore &mdash;I think, correctly&mdash;that we should give some summary of the provisions of the two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once you start summarising, you are in trouble.  I think, in this particular case, as set out in the Appendix to the Bill we are now considering, we have done it very fairly and as briefly as possible.  Quite obviously, if you wanted to do it fully, you would reprint the whole Bill&mdash;and that cannot be done.  Basically, the contents of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill are proposals for limiting the <Col N="300" /> deviation from the national average of the number of population per Deputy. It does not make any difference whether the national average be 20,000 or 21,864, and so on: what the electorate are worried about is the amount of deviation which there may be&mdash;and that is clearly set out.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Deputy Barrett said that all we really want to say is: &ldquo;Are you in favour of or opposed to proportional representation?&rdquo; Having said that, he promptly abandoned that suggestion and started suggesting a much wider coverage of the whole business.  He attacked the use of the words &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;. He said he wants to make it easy for the electorate.  If we had said &ldquo;to substitute for the present system of voting in Dáil elections the relative majority vote in single-member constituencies&rdquo; people would say the average man would not know what &ldquo;the relative majority&rdquo; is and I would agree with them.  He would not know what it was unless we went into a further explanation.  But, by reason of all the publicity which has been given, both in this House and in the press, it has become a fact that people know what is meant by the words &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;.  It means a non-transferable vote, a vote exactly the same as we had in the elections of the Beet Growers' Association.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  The Deputy is getting too much into verbiage again.  When we get down to a technical Bill which will be enshrined in the Constitution, we must use technical language because ultimately that may be referred to the High Court or to the Supreme Court for an interpretation.  When we are composing a document for interpretation by lawyers, we must be very careful in our choice of language and we must use the correct technical terminology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>They will make a straight issue of it because they know precisely what it is.  Deputy Barrett suggested we should not refer merely to &ldquo;the present system&rdquo; but that we should say &ldquo;the present system of proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies&rdquo;.  Here, we are again getting into a mass of unnecessary verbiage.  Our suggestion is &ldquo;to substitute for the present system&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Surely to goodness, anyone who will vote in this election knows what &ldquo;the present system&rdquo; is?  The great majority of them will already have voted at a general election and no doubt will have their own minds. Deputy Barrett suggested &ldquo;for or against proportional representation&rdquo;. There is a very important provision to establish a Commission to determine constituencies.  There is provision, too, that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle may be returned without contest. That, again, is an alteration of the Constitution to which some reference must be made.  If we had not made it, we should be told we were trying to cover up something.  We have these proposals as set out at (1), (2) and (3).  We have put it in simple language.  We have not oversimplified it.  We have not loaded the question.  I think we are doing it fairly and properly.  I hope Deputies will not follow the example of Deputy Barrett and air their complete ignorance in such a way as to give unnecessary alarm to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to reaffirm that there is no way in the <Col N="302" /> world in which any Government or any officer of the Government can bring together the counterfoil of a voting paper and the voting paper itself otherwise than by order of the High Court on a petition for a declaration annulling the election.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that in the drafting of this Bill, the Minister and those who advised him must have come to the conclusion that the electorate consisted of Rhodes scholars.  If there is anything that could possibly confuse people, this ballot paper will certainly do that.  It is the height of nonsense to say that by reading the ballot paper and by reading the Bill afterwards, the average person could understand the voting system. What we have been debating here over the months was whether we are to retain proportional representation or get rid of it and get the system that the Government are trying to foist on the country.  There would have been nothing simpler than to have said that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth, as I say, has the motive pure.  However, he is now going to retire from the House.  I do not think that this is a simple ballot paper and I do not think that the ordinary person is going to understand the ballot paper and know exactly what he is voting on. <Col N="305" /> It has been said that its contents will be read out to an illiterate person, who is fully able to vote.  In all fairness, if this conglomeration is read out to an illiterate, is he going to be any wiser at the end of it?  He would probably ask the presiding officer: &ldquo;How do I vote to retain PR?&rdquo;.  The presiding officer will not be allowed to tell him that.  He will only be allowed to re-read this nonsense which is written here and which as I said would be suitable for Rhodes scholars and nobody else.  He cannot say: &ldquo;If you vote `no' or vote `yes' you will be voting such-and-such a way&rdquo;.  He can only say: &ldquo;You can only say `yes' or `no' in relation to the Constitution&rdquo;.  That is for the Fourth Amendment, the attempt to change PR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people as a whole know that this Bill is for the purpose of trying to change the electoral system but because of the considerable confusion that has ranged around this, they will probably be confused and not quite clear about what the Minister's system is.  That is only natural because of the considerable confusion thrown into this debate by the Minister and the Government. Last week it was said that the French system is that of the straight vote.  It is not but a lot of people will now think that it is the transferable vote.  What they want in black and white is whether they are voting to retain PR or voting to get rid of it. That is all they want and it would be perfectly simple for the Minister's advisers to produce such a ballot paper if they were allowed to do so.  Quite obviously they were asked to produce this mix-up of words which really conveys nothing to anybody unless, as somebody said, he is a constitutional lawyer of high standing.  In regard to the Third Amendment, the tolerance vote which enables the minimum to drop to 17,500 or to go to the same degree in the other direction, would it not have been better to put that in simple parlance instead of expressing it as it has been expressed?  It boils down simply to a tolerance of 2,500 voters and if you have not got that, which you have not in the west of Ireland and certain other rural parts due to the emigration which has taken <Col N="306" /> place because of the Fianna Fáil policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Under the Constitution we had 20,000 votes as a minimum and 30,000 as a maximum but now the Government, in their wisdom or otherwise, consider they have to cut it down because of emigration.  The people were there but now they have gone.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in regard to the allegations that the wording of the proposed summary of the Fourth Amendment is in some way unfair, I suppose the Opposition, in pursuance of their role as an Opposition, as they see it, had to oppose this and this was the only matter on which they could seize for the purpose of opposing.  It is beyond all doubt, in my opinion, that the description of the proposed system as the straight vote system is a well-established one.  It is a well-known system and it is a system that is in common use.  In fact, there is no other description by which it would be recognised by the people.  It is quite well understood by the people and any description of the proposed system would result only in confusing the electorate.  That, of course, is exactly what Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Esmonde, Deputy Barrett, Deputy Dunne and Deputy Treacy want.  They appreciate that, as each day passes, more and more people, particularly in the Fine Gael Party proper and among the supporters of that Party, are gradually coming round to the view at present held by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and by a near majority of the Party.  Indeed, it has been a plank in the Party's programme from their very foundation, a plank taken over from their predecessors, Cumann na nGaedheal.  These diehard members of Fine Gael who persist in opposing the Leader of their Party see in the creation of confusion their only hope of succeeding in their efforts to prevent this proposed electoral reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us something about the diehard members of the Fianna Fáil Party now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is 100 per cent acceptance, enthusiastic acceptance, of this proposal in the Fianna Fáil Party. Every single member is in favour of the proposal, recognising it as the best <Col N="308" /> possible system of election and the best possible system of representation for the people.  Apart from the fact that the description &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; is the description by which people know and recognise the electoral process we propose, it is a good description and an accurate one.  It is the description used to describe the system in a number of textbooks on the subject of electoral systems.  A straight vote is exactly what it is because, under the system, the voter votes for his candidate; he is not required to do other things which do not make sense but which result in the post-election manipulation of votes and unjustified discrimination between one voter and another. Apart from the fact that the voting operation is a straight operation, the counting is also straight.  The system is straight in another sense in that it ensures equal consideration to all voters, something which is denied them at present.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made that there is something wrong in not including in the voting card a description of the present system.  If the people do not know what the present system is it is hard to believe that describing the present system on the voting card would make them any better informed. It must be quite obvious that including on a small voting card a description of the proposal and a description of the system at present in operation could only result in further confusing the people.  To describe the present system would take a considerably greater quantity of verbiage than will the description of the proposed electoral reform.  It is quite likely that, in the rush to vote, people seeing this lengthy description of the present system would, in fact, think that they were being asked to vote for or against the present system.  This could only result in confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole approach of Opposition Deputies to this Bill is the same as their approach to the Bills proposing to amend the Constitution.  It is obvious they want to create as much confusion as possible; their only hope is that the people will be so confused that they, the Opposition, will have their way.  They cannot accept the possibility <Col N="309" /> of a clear decision by the people and they hope to confuse electors so that this reform will not, in fact, be made.  In my opening statement I said:</P>
    <P>Under existing law, the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its short title, the Bill containing the proposal passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I have been legally advised that there is no alternative to this.</P>
    <P>The questions, therefore, that the people must be asked are: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal contained in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Act?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal contained in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Act?&rdquo; That must appear on the Order Paper. That is prescribed by the Constitution. The voting card, therefore, must obviously contain, if it is to contain anything to guide the voters, a summary of the proposal; and the proposal is to amend the Constitution by substituting, in the case of the Fourth Amendment, this system of voting which is known as the straight vote for the present system.</P>
    <P>To include a description of the present system which, it must be assumed, the people know, in so far as it is possible for anyone to know it, and I agree with Deputies that there are comparatively few who know how the system works, would only clutter up the voting card with verbiage and result in confusion.  In fact, at the time of the last referendum, when a short description of the existing system was given, one of the complaints made was that it was confusing.  Now, when it is not included, there is a demand that it should be included.  This is just another indication, as I said before, of the impossibility of interpreting the mind of the Opposition on this matter, or on any matter, because their attitude is determined purely and simply in accordance with the principle of opposing anything and everything suggested by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, if we include in the summary of the proposal on the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution a description of the present system&mdash;in other words, what it is proposed to <Col N="310" /> replace&mdash;then obviously the same thing will have to be done in regard to the Third Amendment of the Constitution. Of course, that would be impossible to do.  I believe that I have a fairly accurate idea of what the present interpretation of the Article of the Constitution with regard to the delineation of constituencies is but the Opposition have not.  In order to show that opinions differ as to what the present position is, I want to quote, first of all, Deputy Ryan of Fine Gael, who said in the Dáil on 28th May, 1968&mdash;Volume 235, column 42 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The courts have allowed no divergence from equality in so far as equality is practicable....  The courts have not said that a five per cent divergence is permissible....  That is not what the Constitution says.  That is not what the law at the moment says....</P>
    <P>But, on the other hand, Deputy Fitzpatrick, on 15th May, 1968&mdash; Volume 234, column 1364&mdash;assumed that a divergence was allowed and that, in fact, a divergence in excess of five per cent was allowed and that, in fact, the amount of divergence was something that could be decided by the Oireachtas.  He said:</P>
    <P>... we do not know the extent of the divergence at present permissible. We know that in the O'Donovan case a percentage of approximately 17.6 was considered too high and we know that 4.6 was considered correct, but we do not know what the difference is between 4.6 and 17 per cent approximately and, therefore, we do not know what the present permissible tolerance, or divergence, within those limits is.</P>
    <P>So that, if even two Fine Gael lawyers of the status of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Ryan cannot agree as to what the present position is, how could anyone expect the agreement of all Parties in the House to a summary of that position?</P>
    <P>So I think that everybody on every side of the House knows that the proposed summary of the two Bills is, in fact, a reasonable summary and I <Col N="311" /> am quite certain that everybody also knows that to try to insert into those summaries also a description of the present position would only create confusion. It is obvious that it is only for that object of creating confusion that the proposal is made.  If it is considered necessary to describe the present voting system, then I do not know what to say about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very pertinent question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution lays down that the question to be asked must be: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposals in the Bill?&rdquo; That is the question. The question must be related to the proposal that is being put before the people and in connection with the Fourth Amendment the proposal is to substitute this system of election for the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also raised the question that in so far as the Third Amendment is concerned, instead of saying that the Third Amendment proposes that in forming Dáil constituencies, the population per Deputy in any case &ldquo;may not vary by more than <Col N="312" /> one-sixth from the national average&rdquo;, we should say: &ldquo;shall not be greater or less than the national average.&rdquo; That is exactly what &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means.  It is obviously impracticable to reproduce the whole of the two Bills in the summary. Any intelligent person knows that &ldquo;vary&rdquo; means that it can vary in either direction and there is no need to introduce any more words into it. Obviously, the more words that will be in, the more likelihood there is of conclusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins stated that not describing the present position amounted to concealing that the present system is the system known for almost 50 years.  If the system is known and known to have existed here for almost 50 years, how is it possible to conceal that by referring to it as the present system?  If it is known, as Deputy O'Higgins said, surely it is unnecessary to describe it and to describe it in connection with a ballot paper where the question is, &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal?&rdquo; obviously can only have the effect of confusing some people and possibly making some of them think that it is a proposal to retain the present system that they will be asked to approve of.  It is obviously much clearer to describe the proposal, which is, to replace the present system by a new system, and ask them the straight question, do they approve of that proposal.  As I said, there is no way of asking the people to make a choice between two different systems.  The only possible question is to ask them whether or not they approve of the proposed change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy got back to the question of what he described as a package deal.  Of course, it is a fact that when we decided to ask the people to reform the electoral system we intended to put our proposals to them for the reform of the electoral system in the form of one proposal.  That seemed to us to be a reasonable thing to do.  It would be the easiest thing to do.  There would be only one ballot paper and the people would vote for or against the proposal that we were making.  In response to the demands of the Opposition, we agreed to separate them.  I do not know why the Opposition wanted them separated.  That is a mystery to <Col N="313" /> me.  The only possible reason I can see for having the proposal for electoral reform separated into two separate proposals is that it was intended to recommend to the people acceptance of one of the proposals and rejection of the other.  As far as it is possible to interpret the attitude of the Opposition Parties&mdash;and I admit that is not an easy thing&mdash;it appears to me that they are, in fact, opposing both of these and if they really, genuinely and unitedly want to oppose both of these things, then they could do it more effectively if there were just one proposal. I wonder is it a fact that there are a number of Deputies in each of the Opposition Parties who are in favour of one or other of these proposals and intend, in fact, to support one or other of these proposals or are they, in fact, opposing both proposals?  However, they were separated to convenience the Opposition Parties and on the Second Stage they were brought together to convenience them again. When they were separated for the Committee and subsequent Stages the Opposition found it impossible to adjust themselves to that situation and dealt with both together.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of the numbering of the ballot papers, I would like to point out, first, that this provision to put the number on the back of the ballot paper is a new one.  It was always on the face of the ballot paper before.  I do not know whether putting it on the back will do anything to relieve these fears that Deputies say exist as to the secrecy of the ballot. I do not think any such fears do exist except in so far as they are deliberately fostered by people like Deputy Barrett.  I certainly have never heard any such fears expressed.</P>

They went into the matter in considerable detail, as Deputy Booth has said.  This was an official joint committee.  They reported and accepted on behalf of their Parties the necessity for having the ballot papers and the counterfoils numbered.  They also accepted that the arrangements for secrecy in this regard were satisfactory and that there is no danger of individual voters' ballot papers being traced.  To imagine that anybody could really believe what Deputy Barrett suggested could take place&mdash;that all of these practically 1¾ million ballot papers could be gathered together and the counterfoils associated with the actual ballot papers and the numbers checked against the register in order to find out how individual people voted&mdash;is the height of nonsense.  Indeed, it is just typical of some of the other suggestions that have been made.</P>
      <P>This Committee, which sat down seriously to consider the electoral law rather than just put on a show of opposing this Bill, accepted that this numbering was necessary so as to provide a means of checking for the purpose of an election petition the votes cast by people accused of personation.  After the referendum the ballot papers are sent to the returning officer in sealed packets.  He is required to retain them for six months and then to destroy them.  None of the sealed packets may be opened except under an order of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The law on the matter is contained in the Referendum Act, 1942.  Section 34 in Part I of the First Schedule to that Act states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the next preceding rule, no sealed packet of counterfoils shall at any time be opened and no counterfoil and no counted ballot paper shall at any time be inspected save under and in accordance with an order of the High Court under Part III of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who sat down in a reasonable <Col N="315" /> way to consider this on behalf of all Parties in the House accepted that this was a reasonable safeguard.  But of course the situation is different here. Here reason does not enter into it.  The only concern is to create as much confusion and as much doubt as possible and to create, if possible, apprehension.</P>
    <P>Section 31 in Part I of that Schedule describes the arrangements for the sending of reports and documents to the referendum returning officer.  They must be sealed and so on.  If there is any desire to have this re-examined by the Joint Committee or by another Joint Committee, this can be done. Everybody here&mdash;certainly everybody on this side of the House&mdash;would be concerned to have the greatest possible amount of confidence in the conduct of elections.  The provision for secrecy was studied by the people nominated by the different Parties.  They were satisfied that the numbering of the ballot papers was necessary and they were also satisfied with the arrangements to ensure absolute secrecy in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and the other Deputies who spoke on this matter were, I think, talking with their tongues in their cheeks.  They were talking for the sake of the audience rather than expressing any real doubts they had in regard to this matter.  Those who were nominated by the Parties to consider the matter were thoroughly satisfied.  If they now have any doubts, the matter can certainly be re-examined. I do not see that it is feasible not to have them numbered.  I do not think any more definite or more satisfactory arrangements for ensuring secrecy can be made than what is already laid down in the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is firstly, to authorise an increase in the existing statutory limit on the aggregate amount which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation, and secondly, to repeal the provision in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959. which restricted payments to Bord Fáilte for grants for the development of holiday accommodation and major tourist resorts to a period of ten years from the date of the passing of that Act.</P>
      <P>Provision was made in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, for the payment to Bord Fáilte of such sums not exceeding in the aggregate £500,000, as the Board might require for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation.  The limit of £500,000 was raised to £1.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1963, and to £3 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966.  The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte at 31st March, 1968, was £2,630,000 which left a balance of £370,000 in the authorised amount of £3 million.  The amount to be voted in the present financial year is £800,000 and amending legislation is necessary to authorise payments in excess of £370,000 in the present financial year and to provide for payments in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the funds provided for the development of holiday accommodation, Bord Fáilte operate a scheme of grants to encourage the provision of additional holiday accommodation and the improvement of existing accommodation. Although reasonably good progress had been made in the provision of accommodation since the 1959 Act was passed, an investigation of accommodation requirements carried out by Bord Fáilte in 1965 revealed that a much quicker rate of growth was required to cater for the increase in tourist traffic.  The board calculated that it would be necessary to provide 2,000 additional bedrooms each year up to and including 1970 of which <Col N="317" /> 1,500 should be provided in registered hotels and guesthouses and 500 in supplementary accommodation.</P>
    <P>As it was clear that the required rate of growth could not be achieved on the basis of the existing incentives, I authorised Bord Fáilte in April, 1967, to provide substantially increased incentives for the development of holiday accommodation.  Prior to that date the general level of grants was of the order of 20 per cent.  Apart from the fact that the level of the grants has been generally increased the scheme has been modified in the light of experience to provide for greater flexibility in the provision of financial assistance.  Accordingly, Bord Fáilte are now authorised to determine, within certain specified maxima, the level of grant appropriate to each case taking account of all relevant factors including the location of the premises and the adequacy of existing accommodation in the area, the type of accommodation being provided, the price level, the market demand, the prospects of off-season business, the estimated cost of development and the background of the developer.</P>
    <P>The current scheme of grants provides for the payment of up to 35 per cent of the total construction cost of new hotels in the western counties. In other remote areas the maximum grant is 25 per cent of total construction cost.  Where the total construction grants do not apply, grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of new hotel bedrooms are provided in the western counties and 40 per cent elsewhere.  Grants up to 30 per cent are provided for dining areas, kitchens and stores in hotels in the West and 20 per cent elsewhere.  There are also grants for hotel staff accommodation and for the provision of recreational facilities for hotel guests.  Guesthouses in all areas are eligible for grants up to 20 per cent of the cost of new bedrooms, provided at least five guest bedrooms are available on completion of the project.  Caravan and camping sites are eligible for grants up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of site development and amenity works subject to a maximum grant of £20,000 per site.  There are grants also for <Col N="318" /> the provision and improvement of youth hostels and for improvement works in colleges and similar institutions providing accommodation for visitors during vacation periods.</P>
    <P>The increase in the level of grants has resulted in an increase in the amount which has to be provided each year to Bord Fáilte for the purposes of the scheme.  For instance, the amount provided in 1965-66 was £255,000; in 1966-67 it was £500,000; in 1967-68 it was £700,000, and in the present financial year the amount required to finance the scheme is £800,000.</P>
    <P>Since the scheme was introduced in 1959 it has stimulated an investment of £15 million by private enterprise in holiday accommodation.  The number of bedrooms in registered hotels and guesthouses has increased from 17,200 in 1960 to 24,000 in the present year, an increase of almost 40 per cent. There has also been a significant improvement in the standards of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The increased incentives introduced in April, 1967, have had an immediate response from promoters.  Figures available for 1st January, 1968, showed that there was a net increase of almost 1,300 bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses in 1967 although the increased grants were available for less than nine months of the year.  Continued expansion and improvement of accommodation will be necessary to cater for the increasing number of tourists and there will be a particular need to cater for motoring visitors.  The number of passenger-accompanied cars brought directly to ports in the State increased from 10,000 in 1959 to 68,000 in 1967. Bord Fáilte estimate that by 1970 about 150,000 cars will arrive directly and a further 100,000 through Six County ports.</P>
    <P>The present range of grants will fall due for review in 1969 but there is no doubt that a continuation of financial assistance will be necessary to secure the required rate of expansion.  Already a large number of projects are being planned for the coming years and Bord Fáilte anticipate that the target of 1,500 additional bedrooms in registered hotels and guesthouses will be achieved in each of the next three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> I am accordingly proposing that the present statutory limit of £3 million for the giving of grants for the development of holiday accommodation should be increased by £2.5 million to £5.5 million.  On the basis of information at present available this increase should be sufficient to provide for accommodation grants up to 31st March, 1971.  I should explain that the purpose of this provision is to obtain the general approval of the Oireachtas for the financing of the accommodation development scheme.  The amount to be provided each year will fall to be voted by the Dáil in the normal way under the Vote for the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>Although there has been a substantial increase in registered hotel and guesthouse accommodation since 1960 &mdash;from 17,200 bedrooms in 1960 to 24,000 in the present year&mdash;the increase in supplementary accommodation has been more significant.  The number of bedrooms in supplementary accommodation included in Bord Fáilte lists increased from 815 in 1960 to 8,400 in the present year.  The increase in A* and A hotel bedrooms has been 68 per cent in this period; in other accommodation the increase has amounted to 82 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for an increase in the statutory limit on the amount to be provided for the development of holiday accommodation the Bill also contains a provision to repeal a restriction contained in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, which limited the payment of funds for the development of holiday accommodation and major tourist resorts to a period of ten years from the date of passing of that Act. I consider that the annual debate on the Vote for my Department and the fact that legislation is required every two or three years to authorise an increase in the aggregate amount provides sufficient control over the administration of the scheme without imposing a specific time limit.</P>
    <P>The ten-year limitation applies not only to payments for the development of holiday accommodation but also to payments for the development of <Col N="320" /> major tourist resorts.  The aggregate amount to be provided for the development of major tourist resorts was increased to £3.25 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966.  The total amount issued at the 31st March, 1968, was just over £1.5 million.  As the amount being provided in the current financial year is £400,000, it is now clear that there will be a considerable balance remaining in the authorised amount of £3.25 million at the expiration of the ten-year period in August, 1969.  It is intended to undertake a second programme for the development of major tourist resorts when the works at present in hands have been completed and, in the circumstances, I have no doubt that Deputies will agree to the removal of the time limitation so that the major resort development scheme can be continued after August, 1969.</P>
    <P>The further development of the tourist industry depends to a very great extent on the availability of an adequate supply of holiday accommodation. There are good grounds for believing that the incentive scheme now in operation will achieve the rate of growth required to cater for the anticipated increase in demand.  It is equally important that the major resort development scheme should be continued.  Bord Fáilte are at present embarking on a policy of promoting year-round tourism and the development of this policy will give rise to an increasing demand for entertainment and recreation facilities.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to remind Deputies of the importance of the tourist industry to the national economy. Since 1959 the income from tourism and travel has risen from £39.4 million to £84.3 million in 1967. During the period of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion tourist income at constant money values rose at a rate of 5.5 per cent a year.  I am confident that this rate of growth can be maintained and possibly increased provided the necessary resources and facilities are made available.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable these resources to be made available and I accordingly confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we welcome this Bill.  We welcome any Bill that provides more money for the development of tourism, be it by way of the development of tourist accommodation or tourist resorts.  What worries me very much is the delay in providing the moneys which are voted by this House for the various purposes.</P>
      <P>I thought that when Bord Fáilte was set up, when we married the various tourist organisations, when we got new blood with a new outlook, we might have cut the red tape with which the various tourist organisatitons were tied by the Civil Service.  Unfortunately that is not so.  On the last occasion I spoke on the Minister's Estimate I mentioned the delay in providing grants for guesthouses.  The Minister kindly said that if I brought it to the notice of Bord Fáilte, he felt certain that these grants would be paid.  I have brought to the notice of Bord Fáilte three separate applications for grants for guesthouses and so far not one of them has been paid.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why Bord Fáilte cannot make payments on account to developers as the development of their premises progresses.  If one wishes to repair, improve or extend a guesthouse, one must do it to the standards of Bord Fáilte and to the extent required by Bord Fáilte.  One must provide one's own overdraft accommodation from the bank.  Bord Fáilte will not assist you in any way in procuring that, but when you have procured it, Bord Fáilte will then undertake to pay the interest rate for a fixed period.</P>
      <P>The delay in paying the grants, as distinct from the interest rate on the loans, considerably increases the amount of the interest rate, and there is a delay in discharging the overdraft incurred in developing the property. Strange as it may seem, that relates only to guesthouses and smaller hotels. If one wishes to build a luxury hotel costing anything between £100,000 and £200,000, there appears to be no delay whatsoever in procuring the money. Bord Fáilte may be overdoing the building of luxury hotels at the expense of neglecting the furtherance of guesthouse accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The Minister has told us that supplementary accommodation has increased from 815 beds in 1960 to 8,400 beds this year.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that Bord Fáilte have provided money for these additional beds?  Of course they have not.  These beds were always there, but it is only in the last year or so when there was a demand for what is known as B and B, bed and breakfast, that the proprietors of these houses decided to cash in on them.  Bord Fáilte have deserved no thanks and should seek no praise for this increase of supplementary accommodation from 815 to 8,400.</P>
    <P>I am personally aware that throughout rural Ireland houses are being registered for bed and breakfast, as supplementary accommodation, by people who have received not one penny from Bord Fáilte but who brought their premises up to a fairly high standard by means of grants from Local Government and Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Therefore, Bord Fáilte cannot take very much credit for this additional accommodation.  For instance, in my own town the supplementary accommodation has increased from zero to something like 40 beds per night, but not one penny has been spent by Bord Fáilte in the town of Dungloe, in the heart of a tourist area. When one hotelier there did make application for a grant, the plans with which it was suggested he should comply were beyond the reach of the normal hotelier in rural Ireland, and he had to drop the project for the time being at least.</P>
    <P>The Minister should concentrate more on guesthouses.  Many of our guesthouses deserve to be registered as hotels.  The standard for hotel registration is far too high, and the Minister should remember that those of the middle or lower class who require guesthouse accommodation should be entitled to the same facilities as the upper class who require and procure hotel accommodation, in that they should be entitled to partake of intoxicating liquor and consequently these premises should be licensed if they have ten or more bedrooms set aside for guests.  There is class victimisation <Col N="323" /> here&mdash;I do not wish to go into it in detail; some other speakers may &mdash;in that licences will not be granted to guesthouses whereas they will be granted to hotels.  The difference between a top-class guesthouse and a third-rate hotel is very little indeed. There should not be this discrimination and it should not react against what may be described as the poorer type of tourist.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are doing a very good job with the farm guesthouse grants. Sufficient advertisement has not been given to those grants and a sufficient number of them have not been utilised.  Much more could be done by bringing to the notice of farmhouse owners the generous grants which are available from Bord Fáilte for the repair of their houses.  In so far as this Bill provides money for that, we welcome it.</P>
    <P>There may be other aspects of the Bill which require careful consideration in view of some legal matters which have recently arisen in connection with the registration by Bord Fáilte of hotels under the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  Some other speakers may deal with that in more detail.  We in Fine Gael welcome this Bill.  I want to ask the Minister to ensure that when grants are applied for and allocated, they are paid as soon as possible, and that the unfortunate applicant is not left carrying dead weight by way of an overdraft.</P>
    <P>I am glad also to notice that tourist resort grants are being increased.  God knows it is time.  I often wonder what we are doing with the various resort grants that have already been issued under the various Acts passed by this House.  I remember the Minister and his predecessor coming to Bundoran and telling the people about the grandiose schemes which were in hand for the development of that magnificent seaside resort, but year in and year out, those promises have remained unfulfilled. It is only quite recently that a beginning has been made on the West End by expanding the promenade and car park there.  It is frustrating to developers of seaside resorts to be told that plans have been made for a particular <Col N="324" /> resort, and then find that those plans are not implemented for years and years.  Despite the fact that deputations see the Minister, Bord Fáilte, and the local authorities, the buck is passed from one to the other and nothing is done.</P>
    <P>Again we welcome that part of the Bill which provides more money for tourist resort grants as we do the portion of the Bill which provides more money for the development of holiday accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for two reasons.  One is that it shows an advancement in tourist development and the necessity for the provision of extra money in order to encourage that advancement.  The other is that it gives me an opportunity to give voice to a matter which is disturbing me and many people throughout the country&mdash; Deputy O'Donnell has touched upon it&mdash;in relation to the licensing of guesthouses.</P>
      <P>So far as the development of tourism is concerned, I am particularly pleased that the Minister has made special mention of the western areas for the development of tourist resorts and accommodation generally, whether it be hotels, guesthouses, farmhouse accommodation, camping sites or any of the several ways and means whereby this very valuable industry is being cultivated.  I want to say straight away that the majority of our people in the hotel business have met the challenge of tourism extremely well, having regard to their limited financial capacity so to do.  In addition, I want to say that in my experience Bord Fáilte has come to the assistance of these people with extraordinary rapidity and quite a sympathetic approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All over the country there is ample opportunity to develop this industry. If it is going more slowly than we should like, that slowness is due to the fact that the people interested in the promotion of tourism have not got the necessary capital to move as fast as we, or even they, would like to move.  On the other hand, this Bill shows the necessity for this.  The amounts available <Col N="325" /> by way of help from the national Exchequer through Bord Fáilte have not been sufficient.  For that reason I welcome this Bill, as Deputy O'Donnell does, on behalf of my Party.</P>
    <P>On the 18th June last, I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Justice asking him if he had any intention of amending section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  The reason I did so was that it had come to my notice that the provisions of that section are about to be applied with great stringency at the annual licensing courts next September.  I may say in passing that I approached Bord Fáilte officials on this matter, and all they could say to me was that there is a defect in the 1960 Act.  If there is a defect in any Act, it is the job of the Government, at the instigation of the responsible Minister, to remedy that defect. I would go further and seek the support of the Minister for Transport and Power to urge upon the Government that they should remedy this defect at least in so far as it applies to the people immediately and directly concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have the whole thing thrown open to anyone and everyone to get a licence, but, as the law stands at the moment, as I see it, under the old provisions of the 1902 Act persons in rural areas who have got ten bedrooms set aside separately for the sleeping accommodation of travellers are entitled to get a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor.  In the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, that definition was continued, but in respect of the county boroughs, the number of rooms was increased from ten to 20.  That was provided in sections 40 to 42 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  They have now been repealed by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, but the definition of hotels is still there.  Under sections 19 and 21, hotels are defined in exactly the same way in relation to rural Ireland as they are defined under the provisions of the 1902 Act in pursuance of which applications are made for licences.</P>
    <P>The functions of Bord Fáilte are defined.  <i>Inter alia</i> they include the grading of hotels, guesthouses, camping <Col N="326" /> sites, youth hostels and the like.  I do not mind to what extent this grading goes.  So far as I am concerned, Bord Fáilte are free to grade them down to Z, but Bord Fáilte are not entitled to alter the statutory definition of an hotel.  They can grade them as they wish, but may I repeat that they are not entitled to alter the statutory definition of an hotel?  A person who is granted a spirit licence under the 1902 Act is granted it because the premises in respect of which he seeks a licence is an hotel.  Bord Fáilte, in my view&mdash;and I earnestly hope I will not have to urge this anywhere else&mdash; must register these premises as an hotel until such time as this House thinks fit to give another definition to these premises.</P>
    <P>From inquiries made, I understand that there are 125 licensed guesthouses, but the official from whom I made the inquiry was not able to segregate them. He was not able to say how many were simply those without a public bar qualifying under the provisions of the Act of 1902 or the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, or were the kinds of places that had purchased two licences under other provisions.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with premises that have public bars and are entitled to have them.  I am concerned with premises the proprietors of which have been visited by members of the Garda Síochána in the past few months who said that, pursuant to the provisions of section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, they will oppose their licence at the next annual licensing court.  These premises are all within the category of the definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; in all relevant enactments. I do not know how many of the 125 are affected or will be affected, but it is within the Minister's competence to find that out from his officials.  I do know, however, that in a part of my constituency in North Mayo, five such premises are affected.  Why some of these are not registered by virtue of their own standards, as hotels and, indeed, by virtue of Bord Fáilte standard of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; I do not know. They fall within the spurious category of &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo;, the definition of which I cannot find in any tourist <Col N="327" /> traffic enactment.  I have the definitions of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; and I have the definitions of &ldquo;camping site&rdquo; but I cannot find the other.</P>
    <P>Now, when people purchase large premises that might otherwise have to be knocked down, premises that provide ample sleeping accommodation in great luxury&mdash;and, mind you, as it occurs to me, I think the Minister knows at least two of the premises to which I refer&mdash;they deserve respect, consideration and thanks.  One is that of the late Major Paddy Knox-Gore at Coolcronan between Foxford and Ballina on the Moy.  It is now owned by a Ballina veterinary surgeon and some other people who have been running it successfully as an hotel under the application they made for a licence but it is classified by Bord Fáilte as a guesthouse.  Next September, under existing conditions, that licence will be opposed by the Gardaí and it will no longer be licensed.  If that house is not a house into which we could welcome guests not alone from this country but from any country, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Across the road, a little further down towards Ballina and probably known to the Minister, too, is Major Aldridge's house, Mount Falcon, a wonderful house with wonderful accommodation and licensed&mdash;but, next September, certain to lose the licence unless something is done about this.</P>
    <P>Enterprising people purchased the former convent at Ballycastle on the North Coast&mdash;Whelan's, Ballycastle.  It is the only place where it is possible to get a meal and sleeping accommodation between Ballina and Belmullet along the north coast unless one goes to where a young man named Garvin is, at Carrateigue, Ballina.  Mr. Garvin earned his money in the Middle East, I think, in conditions of danger, working with oil people.  He came back, got the necessary accommodation, satisfied the Circuit Court judge, through his architects and engineers, that he had a premises that fell within the provisions of the 1902 Act and got a licence not for a public bar but for a dispensing business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> There is another lovely house in the town of Ballina which was and still is one of the showhouses of the West&mdash; Glencairn, Ballina, the Egan private house.  It also is licensed in the same way.  I am not so certain whether any places in the Island of Achill are affected.  Perhaps Deputy Calleary might know something about this.  I do not know whether or not he does but I am sure he does.  However, there may be some places in the Island of Achill.  From a tourist point of view, it would be extremely serious if anything happened to them.  I am not making an appeal for these people on political grounds.  Some are against me and some are for me: they are mixed&mdash; but they are all enterprising and good people who are helping to run the tourist business in the west of Ireland and who are giving of their very best. This is my view and, as I said, I hope I shall not have to urge it anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Taking the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; as defined in all the enactments I can lay hands on, I consider that these premises fall into the category of and that Bord Fáilte must register them as hotels for the purposes of the Intoxicating Liquor Act and, indeed, for their own purpose because, mind you, their function, as defined, is simply to grade hotels and guesthouses.  You can call them hotels Grade X, if you wish, but they must be graded as hotels because hotels they are within the meaning of the provisions pursuant to which they were licensed.</P>
    <P>Now, after my question to the Minister for Justice, I received a long letter from him today the contents of which I do not propose to read but it contains in my view specious and spurious arguments as to why this defect cannot be remedied.  It would be a very easy matter to confine any amendment to premises affected as of this moment.  Not having received any satisfaction in this regard from the Minister for Justice, I am particularly pleased to avail of this opportunity to try to elicit the help of the Minister for Transport and Power in this serious matter concerning isolated areas.  I also call upon my colleague, Deputy O'Hara, to assist me in the same <Col N="329" /> regard, as well as Deputy Calleary, because they are nearer to him than they are to me.  After my disappointment, on receiving this letter from the Private Secretary to the Minister for Justice, I went in and quickly framed&mdash; perhaps imperfectly&mdash;a Private Members' Bill to try to remedy this defect.  I earnestly urge the Minister to look at it to see if he can assist these people in any way&mdash;as I am sure he will.</P>
    <P>Let us contemplate the appalling prospect for people who, maybe, have booked fishing or shooting parties next winter or even people who go on professional work, such as archaeological pursuits, and their staff.  What will happen to these bookings?  What will happen to the furnishings with which they have fitted out these houses? What will happen to the small but important staff?  What is to happen to these people if these houses are closed down as tourist amenities in the area?  What is to happen to the passing tourist who travels that road and finds that he cannot get anything to eat or drink?  Let us make no mistake about it, one's ability to get drink in this country or some other countries&mdash;and here and in Great Britain we have most archaic laws&mdash; differs from one's ability to get a drink on the continent where they are sensible about this.  Their view is that if you have the money you will get the drink and the licensing hours are not confined to any particular hours.</P>
    <P>However, that is beside the point. I do not want to enter into any discussion about the liquor laws and whether they are archaic or not.  It is important to have these facilities with meals and I am not necessarily referring to wine.  The wine of the country is extremely important and if you are having a steak, the best drink to have with it is the pint of stout or the pint of beer.  Wine is all right for the cultivated palate but those of us who were brought up in the hard and rough school still like the wine of the country with our food.  If that is not made available for the tourist, then forget about it, forget about the west of Ireland and the remote places, forget about it all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> I am sorry that I have had to speak at such length about this and with such feeling, but I feel that if anything were to happen to these premises, it would be a retrograde step for the tourist industry and a blow to members of families who find employment in these places, about which there is not the slightest complaint.  Those of them I know are extremely well run and in any of them you can have an excellent meal, an excellent drink and excellent sleeping accommodation.  Is that not what we are providing for the tourist?  Is that not what we want to provide for the tourist, whether he is from the south of Ireland or the south of France, whether he is merely a holidaymaker lolling around or someone on a hunting or fishing holiday or even whether he is a business man who stays there while he is transacting his business?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into this matter urgently because I understand we are rising next week and something should be done in this House to enable the Seanad to consider it before it rises so that these people can approach the next licensing court without the apprehension they now feel and without the gloom which is almost overpowering them and their business future.</P>

      <P>I want to support what Deputy Lindsay has said.  He being an eminent legal man has made what I would describe as a cast-iron case for something to be done in regard to these guesthouses.  I want also to stress the importance of having something done. In fairness to the Minister, I think he is the type of far-seeing man who will realise the importance and urgency of taking up this matter and finding a solution.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is a necessary measure and is of particular importance to the west of Ireland.  Down through the years in this House and outside it, we have had people emphasising the difficulties, generally speaking, under which people in the west of Ireland live.  It is a part of the country from which at all times we have had emigration and migration. Many of the lines in which small-holders previously engaged have disappeared or have become uneconomic, such as the poultry and egg business which once was a great source of income.  Very few people on small holdings can now make anything from such lines.  Many people in the West are now turning to providing farm holiday accommodation for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No later than yesterday in Connemara, I noticed with pride and satisfaction that many people in this remote area were availing of the grants for improving accommodation in order to encourage more tourists to come to the area.  It would be a tragedy if these people were forced to pack up and get out, as many have had to do.  A similar situation applies in Achill, Erris and other places.  Indeed, yesterday when I <Col N="332" /> was taking my daughter to the Connemara Gaeltacht, I was delighted to find in one family which I visited three children aged four, six and eight years, a boy and two girls, who could not speak a word of English.  It is wonderful in this age that we can find this happy state of affairs, that the language has not died along the western seaboard.  If we allow a situation to develop in which the parents have to emigrate, then we can surely say that the language is lost.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which confront strangers in my county, and which does not exist for those of us who live there, is the problem of signposting.  In many cases roads are badly signposted and on more than one occasion I have seen tourists with an American, a GB or North of Ireland registration, or even a Dublin registration, coming to a crossroads, looking for a signpost and then having to get out and make inquiries as to how they can get to their destination.  I would stress the importance of improving signposting. It is true that progress has been made in that direction, but a great deal remains to be done.</P>
    <P>In Foxford, an area referred to by Deputy Lindsay, there is some wonderful scenery.  There is Pontoon and Lough Conn and Lough Cullen.  There are towns like Crossmolina, Ballina and Belmullet.  There is some really beautiful scenery around Blacksod Bay, Newport, Achill and Malranny. The scenery is varied.  There have been most extraordinary improvements in housing.  Deputy Calleary played an important part as engineer in these improvements and he is, in fact, more conversant with them than I because he supervised the work.  Considerable progress has been made in housing.  In this connection I should like to stress the importance of water supplies and sanitary accommodation.  Some people have gone to considerable expense to supply these amenities.  In many cases they have gone to the limit of their resources and, in some cases, have gone into debt to provide them.  This may be more relevant to another Department, but I would ask the Minister to use his good offices with the appropriate Minister to try to speed up the provision of <Col N="333" /> water and sewerage facilities.  These have a bearing on the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>We have a grumble in the West with regard to publicity.  A relative of mine, whose husband runs an agency in New York, told me recently that very little advertising space is allotted to areas such as Foxford, Pontoon, Achill, Malranny, Crossmolina and Ballina.  That is not fair.  We all know that centres like Dublin and the east coast generally have the advantage of an airport and shipping facilities and it is only natural, I suppose, that the majority of those who come here on holiday would be inclined to stay in Dublin and along the east coast. I appeal to the Minister to use his influence with tourist organisations to divert more and more tourists to the West.  The tourist industry provides a supplement to the meagre incomes the people derive from whatever occupations they have.</P>
    <P>I saw people yesterday in Connemara harvesting a little patch of hay and only the Lord knows how they manage, unless they have some income from tourism to help them to live. Some small income to supplement what they have would be of great benefit. Some find casual work with the county council; some are engaged in forestry. Anything we can do to help them is of tremendous importance.</P>
    <P>My regret is that the grants are not more generous.  The Minister should not be afraid to go to the Minister for Finance and demand more money.  We produce the finest food in the world. We have a grand country for tourists. Ours is one of the most peaceful countries in the world today and a great many people are discovering that.  The evidence is there in the numbers of cars on our roads bearing foreign registrations.  I hope the Minister will try to extract more money from the Minister for Finance to help these people.  In the congested areas, the income from tourism is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Many improvements under various Acts have been made in Mayo, which is now one of the best counties in Ireland.  Our houses have been improved.  The only problem that remains to be solved is the provision <Col N="334" /> of bathrooms and toilets in the houses generally.  Grants should be increased substantially to allow this work to be done.  We are one of the best tourist areas and we should keep Mayo that way.  The best way to do it is to provide facilities.  The county council has done great work on the roads. There are few towns in Mayo I have not visited.  I know the county pretty well and, comparing the county today with what it was 20 and 30 years ago, I maintain that we are now one of the best counties in the country and there is no reason why our tourist traffic should not be expanded considerably. We are one of the nicest counties. Achill is doing fairly well but areas like Belmullet are not getting the traffic that they should get.  There are lovely areas in north Mayo.</P>
      <P>In Lacken, there is one of the best strands in Ireland.  I do not know why the attractions of that area are not advertised.  Lacken has associations with St. Patrick.  The remains are there of Micheál MacRuaidhri of whom Pearse wrote:</P>
      <P>Slán leat Micheál a mhic</P>
      <P>Slán leat Micheál a mhic</P>
      <P>Slán leat Micheál a mhic</P>
      <P>Micheál ó Conndae Mhuigheó.</P>
      <P>Sufficient advertising is not done to attract tourists to these areas.  There is a beautiful countryside between Ballycastle and Belmullet on the north coast road.  There is not sufficient propaganda about these areas.  In north Mayo there are the most beautiful but the least developed areas in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There has been progress in the matter of housing.  There are very few thatched or derelict houses to be seen there now but I should like to see bigger grants being made available for the provision of water and sewerage in houses.  There are very few areas that are as lovely as Mayo, especially north Mayo.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues who have spoken from these benches, I want to welcome this Bill which proposes to increase the amount available for grants for holiday accommodation from £3 million to £5½ million.  It is not quite clear from the Minister's <Col N="335" /> statement but I assume that when the Minister says the total amount issued to Bord Fáilte at 31st March, 1968, was £2,630,000, that was for a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good sign that the Minister should have to come to the House seeking additional money for grants for holiday accommodation. It is only fair to say that in many parts of the country there is evidence of progress in the provision of additional accommodation in recent years.  One must be impressed, driving through parts of the country, seeing so many houses advertising guesthouse accommodation. It may be a mistake to have the two grades described as supplemental accommodation and guesthouse accommodation.  People may get the idea that the supplemental accommodation label means poor accommodation. That could be a very mistaken idea.  There are many houses providing supplemental accommodation which is first-class.  The description is misleading and should be considered in connection with tourist propaganda.</P>
      <P>Tourism is one industry in connection with which we are doing a good job at selling.  There are many other industries in connection with which we are not selling well.  In the case of tourism we are selling faster than we are producing the goods, which indicates that we have not been really trying hard enough to get people to invest in this type of accommodation.  A person who expresses interest in providing holiday accommodation of the guesthouse or supplemental type who gets in touch with Bord Fáilte is informed that it may take 12 months before a representative will get out to see the accommodation.  This implies shortage of staff.  The amount of money involved in this Bill is a small sum having regard to the importance of the industry as a whole, the employment content and the effect of tourism on our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One difficulty is that most people who are interested in providing accommodation of the type I have referred to must find all of the money first.  They <Col N="336" /> have to be in a position to invite people into their houses before any loan accommodation is forthcoming. The grant is paid when the work is completed.  The provision of guesthouse accommodation involves considerable effort.  Only people who hope to make an additional income out of it will venture into this business because it entails extra work.  They will not undertake this business unless they see a potential profit.  The people who would be interested in providing this type of accommodation are very often people who are short of capital to provide the building, furniture and fittings of a kind that we would be proud to have available.  There should be some way whereby these people would get the necessary finance in advance, whether by way of insurance bond or something of that nature.  There should be some means of ensuring that people are not prevented from taking part in a worthwhile industry by shortage of capital.</P>
    <P>In the case of the provision of a dwelling it is possible to get the greater part of the necessary finance by way of loan or grant.  There should be a fund similar to the Local Loans Fund from which money could be made available for such people as I have referred to, so that they would not have to get everything on credit in advance of starting business.</P>
    <P>Various parts of the country, mainly the west of Ireland, have been mentioned in this debate, probably because most of the speakers were from the west of Ireland.  Nobody denies the necessity to supplement the incomes of the people in these areas.  Similar conditions exist in other parts of the country, particularly in places very much nearer to the capital.  From time to time mention is made of places like west Wicklow.  We have all had a gallop around west Wicklow in the recent past.  This is an area that is wide open for development.  The people in west Wicklow are no less poor than people in many areas which are getting grants but in west Wicklow the people who engage in this business have to accept smaller grants.  West Wicklow is obviously a place that could be an intensive development <Col N="337" /> area.  It is within very short distance of the capital and within easy reach of tourists.  The scenery would be difficult to surpass.  There are many amenities there such as fishing, trekking and other tourist attractions.  If we were really in earnest about providing the type of accommodation visualised in the Bill we would be going out and asking people if they were prepared to engage in it and not expecting those who do express an interest to wait for 12 months before anything will be done.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the shortfall exists.  There are good reasons for it. It exists because apparently we have not got the staff to go out and sell this.  We should be selling it as people sell insurance.  It is a worthwhile industry, one of the few in the country where we have done a better job of selling than producing the goods.  We have all the raw materials to produce the goods.  We have the scenery.  We are an agricultural country producing food as good as it is possible to get in any part of the world.  We have people who have a reputation for hospitality and kindness.  I think personally that far too little effort and money have gone into this industry.  I am glad the Minister has come before us and I hope before very much longer he will be back again looking for more money for the development of this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister comes before us seeking permission to expend money in the fashion he described, I think we should have a little more information about what is meant by holiday accommodation and in what part of the country it is proposed to expend this money.  Some areas of the country can be described as overdeveloped so far as tourism is concerned and others as underdeveloped. We must not lose sight of the fact that, when we provide money for improved holiday accommodation by way of providing extra bedrooms and so on, we must have some understanding about the type of employment envisaged as a result of this expenditure. There was no mention of this in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asked us to provide this money for Bord Fáilte in <Col N="338" /> respect of holiday accommodation and we must assume the board have made a case to the Minister.  Therefore, I believe the Minister should make his case clear.  You cannot have extra bedrooms if you do not also have competent extra staff.  I should like to know from the Minister if he has had any indication from Bord Fáilte as to how many people they envisage will be employed fulltime if they spend so many thousands for extra accommodation. This is a reasonable and an important question to ask.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly stressed the value of tourism to our economy, but we must not forget that tourism has become a highly competitive business internationally.  It is not good enough for us to do the job as well as we have been doing it; we must do it better. The only way is to engage staff, train them well and ensure they will be in permanent and lucrative employment. The Minister may answer by saying there is an organisation in existence for the recruitment and training of catering staff.  This is not the answer because this organisation, while it is doing its best in connection with training staff, has only limited funds.  At the moment it is at a loss to know where it will obtain more money to further its great effort in staff training. Along with this request for more money, one would expect the Minister to ask for permission to be given to Bord Fáilte to spend more on staff training.</P>
    <P>I know from my association with a number of people engaged in this industry that they recognise there is a need for improvement throughout the country, but they also have a fear about overdevelopment in certain areas.  For example, it has been stated repeatedly, not only by working people in the catering industry, but by the employers in the industry, that as far as Dublin is concerned, we have almost reached saturation point.  This is evident if one looks at the off season, which unfortunately is longer than the season itself.  If you keep building more hotels and adding bedrooms in areas such as Dublin and Cork, you will find it will have an effect on the situation of full employment in the industry there at the moment.  The more <Col N="339" /> accommodation provided in areas of that kind, the more competition there is for business, but, strangely enough, the less employment is provided.  The employers concerned find they have to share their business in the off season. The first indication one gets in regard to the off season is that staff are laid off.  This is something we should try to eliminate as far as possible.</P>
    <P>We have been in the fortunate position of being able to develop our business. The car ferries have improved business, and the Minister is to be complimented in that regard.  At the same time, the location of car ferry services and their utilisation in some cases has not resulted in giving a great deal of extra employment.  The introduction of the car ferries has brought about the happy situation that we are now able to encourage British tourists to bring their cars here where previously they went to France.  I hold we have not sufficiently concentrated on the British visitor.  If that encouragement is to be continued I agree that we must have improved accommodation. While I am not decrying the provision of money for holiday accommodation, we should have some information from the Minister as to the areas in which Bord Fáilte propose to provide this extra accommodation.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister should also indicate what the effect will be on employment. It is accepted in catering circles in Dublin that for every room added to an hotel an extra member of the staff is engaged.  This is what the employers tell us.  If this can be taken for granted as part of Bord Fáilte's plans, it is great, particularly if the Board's information shows we are going to have full employment in the cities and a tendency to fuller employment in the rural areas.  I do not want to appear to be contending that you cannot have extra accommodation in what are known as holiday resorts if it does not offer full employment.  We all know there are certain resorts that are purely seasonal resorts where operatives work for a season and know they cannot expect continuous work because the hotel closes when the season ends. Is that the seasonal accommodation and seasonal employment the Minister <Col N="340" /> talks about when he speaks of holiday accommodation?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister absolutely satisfied with the staff accommodation position? In view of the fact that there are funds available for hotels wishing to provide staff accommodation, I am not satisfied that these funds have been fully availed of.  Would the Minister take steps to ensure that when applications come from hoteliers for grants for holiday accommodation, these hoteliers should be required to satisfy the Minister that they have ample staff accommodation? Establishments have been improved by grants and it has not resulted in improving staff accommodation but rather in worsening staff accommodation or their accommodation being reduced by more staff being put into a smaller space.  It has happened in County Dublin that instead of staying in part of the hotel as formerly, the staff were required to stay in caravans with no permanent sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>These are important things.  There is no sense in building extra rooms without staff to work them and you must ensure you will have staff by taking all possible steps to provide them with reasonable accommodation.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to delays in the payment of grants.  I understand that in the case of guesthouses, because the volume of work is small, Bord Fáilte wait until work has been actually completed before paying the grants.  If the Deputy has any cases in which he thinks, having regard to all the circumstances, there has been excessive delay in paying grants, perhaps he would let me have particulars, if he has not already done so, and I shall look into them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Ritz class of hotels or the converted palaces that can be found in certain countries along the Mediterranean.  In any case the number of bedrooms in medium and lower class hotels and guesthouses and in supplementary accommodation rose from 13,000 to 24,000 odd between 1960 and 1967.  The increase in the A standard was 68 per cent and increase in the other accommodations has been 82 per cent so that I think we are making progress in providing moderately priced accommodation. The farmhouse grants on which so far £200,000 has been either spent or allocated will further increase this very desirable type of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell suggested that possibly the standards imposed by Bord Fáilte may be excessive.  This is a very difficult matter to estimate.  My belief&mdash;and I agree with Bord Fáilte &mdash;is that when you prescribe standards or grades for hotels, you must think ten or 15 years ahead.  If the incomes <Col N="342" /> of people from Europe who are our customers are constantly increasing and their standards of living improving you must be certain if, extending an hotel or building a new one, that you make available space for still further improvement.  In other words, the hotel providing a very small shower instead of providing a bath may find itself without customers if there is no room to put in a bath adjacent to the bedroom ten years from now and the hotel is still operating and in good order.  That is a very difficult problem to estimate <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen quite validly raised the question of the basis of allocation of these grants.  The answer is that the level of grant available depends on the necessity for the accommodation.  If Bord Fáilte feel that in a particular area there is absolute saturation, they will not give any grant for an hotel.  It depends on their analysis of bed occupancy, demand throughout the season and all the other factors relating to market research that they undertake as to the level of grant they will give in a particular area.  Development, as Deputies have indicated, varies from area to area.  In some areas a great deal of accommodation is required but not provided because of lack of local initiative.  In other cases there is far greater development and Bord Fáilte must judge the situation in regard to each application they get and they try to classify the various areas on the basis of need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen referred to the necessity to provide all the year round employment.  That cannot be found anywhere except in great cities which have all the year round business and enormous functional business.  The season is extending in the Irish hotel and guesthouse world and it is one of the supreme objectives of myself and Bord Fáilte continually to extend the season until finally it is continued all the year round except, perhaps, in some very isolated locations.  At the same time it is true that here, as elsewhere, there are sections of the community who benefit from summer employment. There are people for whom it is convenient and to whom it brings additional income.  Various classes of <Col N="343" /> people benefit, including students and people living in rural areas whose economy in some cases is associated with hotels, which, because of their isolation, in the normal way close in October or November and reopen in the following year in time for Easter, where the additional income to the people living in the district proves helpful and where, on the whole, one can say the people there do not suffer necessarily because the income ceases in October.  It is part of the whole rural life of the district.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen suggested that we ought to be rather careful about the amount of extra accommodation provided in Dublin.  Bord Fáilte have that under review, but I might mention the fact that there was hardly a single room available in hotels in Dublin in May because of the existence at the one time of three different congresses or conferences.  Therefore we may have need for accommodation in Dublin still.  However, I agree with Deputy Mullen that the position in regard to Dublin, taking the whole year round, is fairly satisfactory at the moment.  Of course Deputy Mullen will be aware of the fact that tourist employment extends far beyond the hotel industry. It employs about 160,000 people directly or indirectly in the provision of food and drink, the transport of various materials, and the production of goods that are bought by tourists when they are here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen asked about staff accommodation.  I will do my utmost to encourage Bord Fáilte in this regard. I think they do suggest to hotels the necessity for giving their staff accommodation wherever possible.  The staff must be contented; standards of comfort are increasing, and the hotels will not have a contented staff if they have dreadful accommodation where they live in.  A good many staff accommodation grants have been provided by Bord Fáilte, and I agree that the attitude of hotel owners should be positive in this connection.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to delays in the development of the facilities at Bundoran.  If I remember rightly&mdash;I have not got the facts with me&mdash;there <Col N="344" /> was considerable delay in this particular case in obtaining suitable conditions for the acquisition of the site. Deputy O'Donnell will remember that there were local difficulties there which were not of Bord Fáilte's devising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly think Bord Fáilte were not, in the main, responsible for the delay.  As I said, my memory is not very good in relation to that scheme, but, as the Deputy knows, a tremendous number of resort development schemes have been implemented, including access roads, golf club facilities, where there is a tremendous tourist potential, civic centres and so forth.  A great deal of work has been done very successfully.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara raised the question of signposts.  Bord Fáilte have an overall sign posting campaign which they have been carrying out for many years. The regional tourist companies ought to take over this responsibility, and it certainly should have regard to the places where Deputy O'Hara suggests there is an urgent need for a signpost. Water supplies, Deputy O'Hara says, are required in certain areas.  There again the regional tourist company should be able to bring influence to bear on the local authority concerned, and in turn, on the Minister for Local Government where a water supply scheme is connected with a priority accommodation development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions were made that insufficient publicity was given to the west of Ireland.  I could not agree at all about that.  I look through all the publicity of Bord Fáilte at regular intervals and I read regularly &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo;, and there is a great deal of publicity about the West. The regional tourist companies have now a whole collection of guide books all of which are used in publicising the West in respect of each of these regions. The angling publicity campaign by Bord Fáilte reflects the value of salmon and trout angling in particular in the West.  CIE itself offers a great many western coach tours, all of which are advertised in Great Britain and <Col N="345" /> America.  The whole of the Shannon development not only relates to the Shannon but also encourages tours up and down the West.  Therefore I do not think anybody need fear there is insufficient publicity attaching to that part of the country.  Indeed I sympathise with Deputies from the West, because the fact remains that about one-quarter of the total tourist income has been spent in Dublin city; some £20 million out of a total of £80 million is spent by tourists in Dublin.  This is not unusual in relation to the capital city of a country.  However, we are doing everything we can to encourage accommodation in the West and to develop publicity which will encourage people to visit the West.</P>
    <P>I come last of all to the very important question raised by Deputy Lindsay and Deputy O'Donnell in relation to intoxicating liquor licences.  This will be a very difficult matter to settle.  I think eventually I shall have to take an entirely unconventional attitude towards this.  Although I understand that it is very difficult for Bord Fáilte to start altering the registration rules and principles and it would create a very serious precedent, somehow or other, if the Minister for Justice says he cannot do it through the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, Bord Fáilte will have to take some kind of <i>ad hoc</i> or extraordinary action in relation to the registration of these premises, the number of which is not known to me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Calleary referred to the improvements taking <Col N="346" /> place in his own constituency.  There are many beaches that could be developed, and I recommend to Deputy Calleary that he approach the regional tourist company about Lacken, for example, and some of the other tourist areas that have not yet been exploited. Of course, in every case it is desirable to have a local development association working with the regional tourist company if there is anything very definite to be accomplished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the question of separately listing the supplementary accommodation and the registered accommodation.  Deputy Clinton was looking rather far forward in that.  I do not think we can for ever have two separate lists of accommodation, although they are printed in equally prestigious booklets by Bord Fáilte.  The total grants to Bord Fáilte have increased enormously in the past ten years, but the complete registration of all premises which serve tourists would be a very expensive business. Eventually we may have to change the principle of the two classifications of accommodation, but I do not think we need to do it at the moment.  As far as I know, these supplementary rooms are being well exploited and the very large number of supplementary bedrooms, nearly 9,000, are getting customers. The whole development is going sufficiently well at the moment, so that we do not need to worry about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton suggested that guesthouses were unable to get financing in certain cases.  They get guaranteed loans.  They can get loans guaranteed which they are able to raise from banking institutions and insurance companies.  I have no evidence that there is a lack of finance for guest house accommodation.  If Deputy Clinton knows of a case where he is told that it will take 12 months to inspect the supplementary accommodation before it can be included in the list provided by Bord Fáilte, I should like to have particulars.  Bord Fáilte can publish only one list a year of supplementary accommodation.  It may be in relation to that that there is no point in rushing the inspection of any particular case.  I should like to have the particulars of Deputy Clinton's <Col N="347" /> complaints in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the position in West Wicklow.  The remoter parts of West Wicklow can still get grants that would be larger than in the case of hotels in towns or cities in the midlands.  West Wicklow is closer to Dublin city and can take advantage of that proximity.  We cannot offer any special consideration to West Wicklow as compared with other similar areas adjacent to the city or as compared with those offered in the far West which is far more isolated and where the problems of encouraging employment are more acute.</P>

    <P>Under this scheme, grants could be made by An Foras Tionscal towards the enlargement of an industrial undertaking or the adaptation of its machinery, plant, equipment, buildings or other works so as to enable the undertaking to be carried on more efficiently or to enable it to engage in the manufacture of products not manufactured by it before the making of the enlargement or adaptation.  Under the provisions of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1966, the time limit for making application for an adaptation grant expired on 30th September, 1967.  In the financial year ended 31st March, 1968, grants totalling £7,314,295 were approved and a total of £3,238,853 was paid.</P>
    <P>(3)  As already announced legislation will be introduced in the near future giving effect to (i) a new scheme of re-equipment and modernisation grants and (ii) modifying and extending the existing industrial grants scheme.</P>
    <P>(4)  Small Industries Grants</P>
    <P>Under this scheme grants are made available by An Foras Tionscal to assist the establishment or development of small industries.  The scheme is at present confined to selected pilot areas. It is contemplated that the scheme will eventually be extended to the whole country.  In the financial year ended 31st March, 1968, grants totalling £84,126 were approved and a total of £13,378 was paid.</P>
    <P>(5)  Technical Assistance Grants Scheme:</P>
    <P>Under the Technical Assistance Grants Scheme grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of (a) the engagement <Col N="247" /> of consultants and (b) training courses and study visits abroad may be given, in certain circumstances, to firms engaged in manufacturing industry with the object of promoting efficiency.  In the financial year ended 31st March, 1968, a total of £174,684 was paid to manufacturers under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The making of a comparison on the lines sought by the Deputy is not practicable because there are considerable differences between the types of industrial incentives, which are not limited to grants, in operation here and those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Grants are also given by Córas Tráchtála for various purposes designed to assist exporters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the Code of Practice for the Protection of Persons against Ionising Radiations arising from Medical and Dental use, 1964; and whether he will consider publishing a similar code for practitioners in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Code of Practice to which the Deputy refers.  This code deals with administrative arrangements necessary under the National Health Service in Britain in addition to protection from radiation hazards generally including, in particular, the safety measures necessary to reduce the radiation dose to the patient and to ensure that staff are not exposed to radiation hazards.</P>
      <P>We have a simpler problem in Ireland as compared to Britain.  For instance all large radiation sources for therapy are confined to four specific hospitals here and these are operated solely by consultant radiotherapists.</P>
      <P>Circulars issued by my Department in 1959 and 1963 to all hospitals with X-ray Departments directed attention to radiological hazards and the protective steps which should be taken in the interests of patients and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Radiation Monitoring <Col N="248" /> Service operating here since 1963 applies the safety standards set out in the Code of Practice to which the Deputy refers.  It supplies a badge service and a consultative and advisory service to hospitals, radiologists and dentists using ionising radiations (the badges are pieces of film which are sensitive to radiation and are worn continuously&mdash;being changed every two weeks).</P>
    <P>Three of the four hospitals with therapy departments (the other has its own badge service), all other hospitals with X-ray departments, all radiologists and most dentists using X-ray apparatus avail themselves of the continous badge service of the Monitoring Service.</P>
